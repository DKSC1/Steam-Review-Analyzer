[Date: 2025-03-26 | Playtime: 4h 8m | Rec: Positive] I don't know how to describe the game It's good, really good. And it truly is an ImSim with how many options you are given
[Date: 2025-03-26 | Playtime: 7h 57m | Rec: Negative] Wow! This game is so cool! If only it was good.
[Date: 2025-03-26 | Playtime: 8h 51m | Rec: Positive] Peripeteia, a game I've had on my Steam Wishlist for the better part of three years, has finally released in Early Access. Peripeteia belongs to the genre of Deus Ex style open ended stealth action game, colloquially known as Immersive Sims. It's set in a dystopian alternate universe Eastern Europe. The protagonist is android girl Marie, looking very intentionally like a sort of a bootleg European Alita: Battle Angel, firmly and very deliberately in the uncanny valley. Marie finds herself waking up in a pile of junk in an unnamed Polish megacity, having lost most of her memories. One of the few things she does remember is that she is supposed to be looking for a mysterious bunker. She takes on a variety of missions that are supposed to get her closer to that goal.  Peripeteia is an Early Access game and currently contains the first five of what are eventually supposed to be nine large levels, plus a small hub, Marie's apartment building, you get to visit in-between. The first three of which appear to be set in the same collosal Polish city, the latter two taking Marie to equally dystopian locations in Serbia and Russia. Peripeteia is a very... unique game in a number of ways. Its setting and general vibe definitely being one of them.  So, as I mentioned, it's set in an alternate dystopian Eastern Europe. It's a very alternative take on a Cyberpunk setting. Rather than late capitalist, it's distinctively post communist. Its seedy urban environments aren't the overcrowded, neon lit metropolises of a Blade Runner or Akira. They're industrial. Decaying. Sparse. Barely inhabited megastructures built on top of each other. Towering apartment buildings with hundreds of floors but barely a handful of people living in them. Giant monuments, either abandoned or solely occupied by vagrants and gangs. Ruins of industry. We learn that it's set after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The regions previously in its sphere of influence are now a battleground between the Soviet Union's remnants, nationalist independence movements and encroaching western interests, along with various criminal operations cropping up to fill the power vacuum. Most levels feature some sort of conflict between these groups and usually let you pick a side. And that's when the game doesn't take a turn towards the explicitly paranoid and para political in a way that makes Deus Ex blush.  Peripeteia, you see, takes a lot of influence from experimental, Soviet era Science-Fiction (Your Roadside Picnics and Solaris' and O-Bi O-Ba's and such), real life conspiracy lore and haunting techno-spiritual 90's and 00's experimental Cyberpunk anime, think Lain, Ergo Proxy and Texhnolyze. You know. The sort of thing Chiaki J. Konaka would have written for. It gets very weird. Not to take anything away, but one of the later levels goes into full blown survival horror territory.  And "weird" is really the games mode of operation as a whole. It gleefully ignores a lot of design conventions. Especially when it comes to its level design which often feels like it'd made decidedly not with the player in mind. The levels are... large. No, actually, let me rephrase that. The levels are huge. And easy to get lost in. And there is no map, nor are there questmarkers. There's a lot of practically unused space. I've seen the games level design compared to EYE: Divine Cybermancy but I've never played it. Marie, however, moves quite fast and is quite agile. Every ledge can be grabbed onto and almost every fall can be broken. Which is both a blessing and a curse because the game has a very loose definition of whether you're out of bounds or not. It makes a point of letting you go everywhere but only occasionally rewarding you for doing so.  The music is likewise about as eclectic as its influences. Between patriotic songs, J-Pop and indie electronic music courtesy of alternative artist Sewerslvt it sure creates a unique atmosphere. Its stealth system operates similarly to that of Thief. There are three degrees of visibility and you can tell by your Hud which one you're one. There are still a couple of oversights there in regards to which one you should be on but it mostly works fine. There is a very large number of weapons, although there is currently no way to hold on to them between levels. Likewise, there are Deus Ex style augments which grant special abilities like bullet time, invisibility or enhanced movement and consume energy.  But at the end, what Peripeteia has, in spades, is style. Between the way it juggles its different artistic influences, the oppressive architecture, the incredibly detailed skyboxes, the ample item descriptions, the low polygon models, the moody lighting, the cigarette in Marie's mouth and the surreal architecture it really pulls you into this nightmarish world and its manifold conspiracies.  Straight up, Peripeteia is just one of the most me-coded games I've ever seen. It's weird and surreal and dark and paranoid and political and full of weird design decisions... Basically, it's what barely any games dare to be anymore. There are some very clear influences, for sure, Deus Ex, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Thief... but there's nothing remotely like it. Now, make no mistake, this is not a finished game. It's missing most of its back half, it's buggy, it's missing plenty of gameplay refinements and quality of life features but it's already one of the most interesting games of the year. It's likely going to be a while till it's properly finished, I think the plan is early 2026 but I don't regret supporting this at all. This is shaping up to be a very special game.

[Date: 2025-03-26 | Playtime: 7h 42m | Rec: Positive] Serial Experiments Blame!  You have to be a certain kind of autistic and or transgender to enjoy this game.  In other words, it's peak, as the kids say.

[Date: 2025-03-26 | Playtime: 5h 45m | Rec: Positive] It's amazing. And a little weird. But in a good way! Mostly...  The game heavily draws on Deus Ex, but arbitrarily leans into immersive sim elements while heavily expanding on the idea of a very big map that is almost fully traversable. If you really want to you can scale an entire apartment complex. Or walk all 100 flights of stairs.  There are a lot of guns, with music and art to match. The entire game does extremely well capturing the idea of a post war cyberpunk Poland. The writing and attitudes of NPC's reflect that, even just by implication of lore that can be gleaned   from around the environment.  The biggest gripe most people are going to encounter is their expectations of content, or rather how quickly things happen. There's a lot of walking and exploring, and there can be some emptiness. To me, getting lost was the fun part.  The only real negative right now is that the game is in Early Access. Make of it what you will, if you prefer a full release then I would wait. The game is still rough around the edges, with audio probably being the worst offender.  There's also the stark contrast with Psycho Patrol R having just released as well. IMO they are very different games but still share the immersive sim element. Go buy both I guess, they're both doing great things
[Date: 2025-03-26 | Playtime: 16h 5m | Rec: Positive] Very refreshing. I really felt as though I could do anything I wanted.
[Date: 2025-03-26 | Playtime: 9h 3m | Rec: Negative] The game shows potential with its art style and core gameplay, but it's not there yet. Here's the breakdown: about 70% of my time was literally just walking through empty spaces - corridors, stairways, and elevators that feel completely pointless. Another 15% was actual combat and missions, and the remaining 15% was wrestling with bugs like weapons randomly not shooting and tank turrets floating in air without the main part of the tanks.  I was okay with some initial bugs, but after the Belgrade level that disables the save feature, forcing you to redo the entire thing over and over again, I can't really excuse that anymore. It's become a chore, an extremely boring one.  Bottom line: I can't recommend buying it right now. The game needs serious work. There's a solid foundation here, but in its current state, you're paying for more walking simulator than actual gameplay. Maybe wait for some major updates and patches before considering a purchase.

[Date: 2025-03-25 | Playtime: 7h 10m | Rec: Positive] Почитал отзывы и подкупило нытье по поводу Белграда. Я пока не дошел, но игра с первых минут чувствуется очень атмосферной и стильной, в отличии от киберпанка 2077 (я не про графику). Но ИИ - это жесть затупки. Дойду до несчастного Белграда и дополню обзор))
[Date: 2025-03-25 | Playtime: 4h 50m | Rec: Positive] This game is very fun and I love the atmosphere. I can really get lost in the setting, can't wait till it's finished.
[Date: 2025-03-25 | Playtime: 17h 17m | Rec: Positive] 7\10 for an early acces still A LOT of work to do, but already good
[Date: 2025-03-25 | Playtime: 17h 28m | Rec: Positive] if i go to poland and it isn't like this, i'm going to ask for a refund (for the ticket, not for the game.) buy it already

[Date: 2025-03-25 | Playtime: 0h 17m | Rec: Negative] just buy cruelty squad or devine cybermancy, game is not worth the gamble of early access. aint no way 970 is recommended for stable 60 fps
[Date: 2025-03-25 | Playtime: 41h 16m | Rec: Positive] This game is a masterpiece.  Belgrade is a masterpiece.  This game is like if Cruelty Squad and Pathologic had a Deus Ex baby.  Since the first days of Penumbra I have dreamt of a fever dream this bittersweet and fueled with techno-psychedelic sadism appropriate for our times.  If you even partially understood what I just said, you should probably buy this game.
[Date: 2025-03-25 | Playtime: 0h 43m | Rec: Positive] I'm not going to lie, I feel like I'm playing a glamour game for someones gender-dysphoric online OC. Which is totally fine. The aesthetics stick out like that to anyone who is... more or less aware of these niche spaces on the internet - depressed, queer, love dark and rainy cyberpunk aesthetics, and listen to breakcore made by people who are, ultimately, just like them.  When people go "this feels like a trans game", this is generally what they're referring to. And yet, when you dig into the lives of the developers, as far as you can go, you seem to find very little of that - it's bizarre - and I'm not sure how much I believe the "Shodanon has a wife and three kids and a farm" but then again, not only do we know who thought of Marie or the larger project,  but who knows - maybe some people are just different. Maybe one day someone will (ironically, of course) cry "my culture is not your costume!" or accuse someone of appropriating the culture of they're niche, and moderately schizotypical ingroup on the internet.  That being said, my thoughts going into this is less that there's some absolute reason that I have to consume this game as a game, but moreso that I want to gamble my $25 in hoping that one day 1. Mod support for this will be astoundingly creative and 2. Devs will add some stuff in. Who knows how much. 1 is my general hope. Yes, I hope that one day there are mods for Peripeteia on unity in the same exact way that mods for Tarkov exist.   The game itself, occupies this sort of "E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy" feel to it. The inventory feels like more granular stalker, and it is manipulated in a way that is similar to tarkov; even the movement it almost feels like... one could play this as almost some type of bizarre, hardcore extraction shooter. The gunplay is different, but not really bad or anything. Many aspects of this game are really novel.  $25 has never felt so steep, and I don't know why. $25 for the game is a good price, but at the same time I don't know, I just get this vibe that I'm hoping for a modding community to pop up.  I wonder who created Marie, the main character is cute, the in-game model for her isn't necessarily a high quality model, but she fits with the environment. I imagine she'd be... like Alita, battle angel if it existed in this world. She looks a little different, this is okay.  The artistic elements of the UI design, such as Marie's representation in the augment menu among other things, is really cute. Unfortunately there's very little content like that.   I think it's worth getting. For some reason I can't help but compel myself to explore. This reminds me of the source game, G-String, which had been in development for 12 years. I think they're both worth playing.  I think that this, as a creative product, is something worth exploring. You feel like you're picking the mind of someone who has a particularly fantastic outlook on alternate history. And in a way, it feels as if a westerner has adopted the slavjank mantra. I find this very endearing.   I think it's worth buying. My intent is to gamble on the future though. This game by itself is a nice $25 novelty... But what I'm really, really hoping for is some sort of cosmic power to descend from above and bestow a new modding scene upon us.  This game is included in bundles that include things such as "Beyond Citadel" - one could say that that game, is... fetishized look upon some of the same design choices that make peripeteia what it is.... so, perhaps you can consider it a "less horny" version of that.   The dialogue is well-written. Whoever wrote the responses and the talking and conversation segments has a really nice grasp on how it is one can write multiple characters... The messages are worth reading. Marie almost occupies this bizarre position that compels someone (like me) to examine what it is her femininity means to the bigger picture of her life, and herself existing as a sentient cybernetic human/entity.
[Date: 2025-03-25 | Playtime: 17h 0m | Rec: Positive] I almost got filtered by the first level, but i kept going and it was extremely worth it. KINO

[Date: 2025-03-24 | Playtime: 25h 59m | Rec: Positive] まずとても気に入って、完成が待ち遠しいという事をはっきりさせておこう！ そのうえで、万人受けはしないだろう事も確信する。  クルーエルティスクワッドを楽しめたなら問題無し。 Stalkerシリーズを攻略に頼り過ぎずに楽しめた人もまぁ多分大丈夫。 Kenshiとか好きでもきっと良いだろう。  ともかく、22時間で2025/3時点での最終ステージまでクリアできた。 攻略については、チュートリアルステージについてツイッターで1投稿だけ見ただけだ。  日本語化MODはないけれど、Melonとかなんとかいうソフトで、リアルタイム機械翻訳する方法がある。 Peripeteia　日本語化とかで検索すればヒットするんじゃないだろうか。 ダイアリーなどは翻訳されないが、大体のゲーム内の会話やダイアログは自動で翻訳してくれる。 現代なら、スマホでグーグルレンズを使えば、ダイアリーも日本語で読める。 まぁ、翻訳精度はガバだけど、とはいえクリアする事は出来た。  そんな事はともかく、このゲーム内の世界はかなりソリッドでディストピアだ。 寒々しい。 だけど、ところどころに美やユーモアや、人間愛みたいなものが紛れ込んでいて、 世界の基本的な殺伐加減によってそれらの温かみがブーストされて、とても愛せる。 そう、つまりサイバーパンクで、ハードボイルドだ。  例えば、主人公のアパートが幕間に登場するが、変わり者の隣人や、サボテンの植木鉢、冷蔵庫のビールが、 主人公に人間味や生を注ぎ込んで、まさにイマーシヴだ。

[Date: 2025-03-24 | Playtime: 36h 48m | Rec: Positive] [i]tl;dr ghost in the shell deus ex set in hl2 beta land, play the demo & you'll know if you'll like it[/i]  Crude, clunky, filthy - handmade cyberjank in the most endearing sense I can muster.  Trains don't quite follow their rails, trams and boats will clip through stuff, and the pipes don't quite fit together, to say nothing of the abstract models or textures. In most other games this sort of thing would be sloppy, yet it's actually quite fitting for a lo-fi post-nuclear Poland. The further you go east, the deeper you head into the wastes, and the more interesting it gets.  Sentient helicopters, nuclear meltdowns, commie insurgents, and joycultist terrorism: [b]Peripeteia[/b] has so much to offer, and it's an early access gem if you don't mind it being rough. The [b]Demo[/b] is a fantastic slice of the wider game and it is [b]the[/b] bar by which you'll love or hate it. Every level has multiple paths, different little endings, and it's easy to miss half or more of what it had to offer - hence how just five maps has pulled over thirty hours from me in the last couple of weeks, even if it chugs in that way indie unity releases tend to do.  Initially the game came up on my radar back in maybe 2020 or 2021 by way of their taste in music, but I hadn't been able to really give it a whirl until now - and while it's been a long road and with more of a ways to go, it's refreshing to have a cyberpunk game as far from the corpo-punk vibrancy of 2077 as possible. Something like a post-apocalyptic Ghost in the Shell set in the land of the HL2 beta, where commie insurgents will cremate you just to harvest your augments faster.   Dirty, simple, handmade - I'm waiting for more.
[Date: 2025-03-24 | Playtime: 3h 46m | Rec: Positive] this game is cool as fuck dude
[Date: 2025-03-23 | Playtime: 10h 30m | Rec: Positive] Despite the jank and the game being in EA, it's still the most compelled I felt about any games in recent memory.
[Date: 2025-03-23 | Playtime: 3h 52m | Rec: Negative] Its vibes are immaculate and the girl is cute but its just too rough and too jank for my liking. Feels a bit ambitious so far. Maybe it could get better, but some of it is just eh. Also sound design is pretty rough too. Either enemies and guns that blow out your speakers or rain sfx that is just way too loud.
[Date: 2025-03-23 | Playtime: 5h 44m | Rec: Positive] This game is so cool. There are multiple ways to complete objectives, little to nothing in the form of handholding, interesting dialogue/aesthetics. The cheeky UI art is a fun thing to mix with the depressing and morbid looks the game otherwise takes on. The sound design is fine for the most part, the music is alright (if you like generic breakcore). It can be jank and frustrating at times, but I'm very happy that it exists.
[Date: 2025-03-23 | Playtime: 14h 22m | Rec: Positive] Когда делался Белград, автор точно прибегал к тяжелым наркотикам. В остальном для раннего доступа вполне неплохо. Идея игры заложена. Конечно, есть куча проблем, но надеюсь, что в дальнейшем они будут решаться. И если думаете, стоит ли покупать игру конкретно сейчас - кому как. Пока что игра только на английском (есть конечно, вариант с русификатором сомнительного качества). Также её вид пока-что оставляет желать лучшего.
[Date: 2025-03-23 | Playtime: 5h 11m | Rec: Positive] Если вкратце 500 рублей отработала на ура. Не хватает оптимизона для такого уровня графики, имеются баги, но я сталкивался с ними в  малом количестве, игра учит вчитываться в диалоги, а также исследовать локацию, что прекрасно, что не очень, так это тот факт, что у игры нет русского языка, что многих может отпугнуть Add russian languege please  Ост 10/10 Геймплей 10/10 
[Date: 2025-03-23 | Playtime: 16h 44m | Rec: Positive] Alors le jeux est "Spécial", mais globalement tout ce qu'il entreprend est sacrément bien foutu, le mélange low poly breakcore et les bruitages des pnj te ferons ferons l'impression d'un trip sous acide et sont déstabilisants au départ mais ça donne vraiment l'effet que on est étranger a cet univers. C'est un immersive sim, en gros a chaque level tu est lâché cul nus ou avec 2/3 objets de base et un objectif: prendre le train pour terminer le niveau, tu auras une quête de base a l'entrée du level pour te guider vaguement, le jeu ensuite te lâche complètement la main et a toi, en explorant les niveaux qui sont vraiment immenses parfois, de faire les choix qui te correspondent. Tu peut tuer quelqu'un, ou trouver un moyen d'arriver a tes moyens en l'épargnant, ou trouver quelqu'un pour faire le sale boulot pour toi, ou trouver une autre solution, le jeu donne vraiment la liberté de faire ce que l'on souhaite. Le level design est franchement cool, bon c'est beaucoup de grands espaces vides, de voies sans issues et de trou sans fond mais si on prend le temps de chercher et de se perdre dans le niveau on se verra surpris de découvrir des raccourcis, passages secret ou nouvelles zones des fois énormes qu'on n'imaginerais pas avoir a coté, une grande partie du plaisir du jeu est de découvrir ces niveaux, des décors cachés franchement bien foutus, l'histoire de ce monde et ses personnages. Les persos sont intéressants, bien écrit, et les missions permettent de développer des personnages parfois mémorables alors qu'on ne les rencontres qu'une fois par niveau. Après le jeu n'est pas sans problème, il a le "Slavic seal of quality" (ceux qui ont joués aux trois premiers stalker doivent me comprendre), y a des bugs, la physique du jeux peut faire des petites blagues, les IA sont plus A que I et y a moyen de se softlock dans les niveaux. MAIS c'est un jeux en accès anticipé, et malgré tout cela c'est vraiment un plaisir d'explorer ce jeu, alors si vous vous y sentez, donnez lui une chance il l'a mérite franchement.
[Date: 2025-03-23 | Playtime: 24h 32m | Rec: Positive] 確かに、開発者がインスパイアされたとおっしゃっている、デウスエクスやE.Y.E.のような雰囲気や仕組みがあります。主人公はJCデントンのようなカッコをしています。 ・JCデントンの恰好が好き ・だだっ広い所を、見返りを期待せず散策するのが好き ・ジャーナルや人の話から行くべき場所を決めるのが好き ・ディストピア系サイバーパンクの世界観が好き ・なんだか不気味な場所が好き という方にはおすすめです。一方で、 ・JCデントンが嫌い ・隅っこまで行った散策が徒労に終わるのが嫌い ・マップやマーカーが一切ないのは困る という方にはおすすめできません。 ちなみに、アーリーアクセスな事もあってかかなりバグが多いです。プレイ可能な所はすべてクリアしたのですが、発砲できない銃があったり、やり直しをしたらボスが勝手に吹き飛んだりしていました。 あまり人にすすめようとは思いませんが、これらの要素を容認できる方にはおすすめです。
[Date: 2025-03-23 | Playtime: 2h 43m | Rec: Positive] Love this game, the concept and execution is very fun! both demanding and comfortable with the way saves work. I just feel like it's a shame that your inventory progress reset in between mission, especially since exploring this blame like structures can reward you with secret weapons that you don't even get to use a lot in the end. Other than that I really recommend this game!

[Date: 2025-03-22 | Playtime: 13h 8m | Rec: Positive] (Would love to give it my GOTY, but it's still in Early Access- so I'm gonna wait till the full release of the game)  Peripeteia is great. No, it's wonderful.  Never has a game challenged me to adapt my "gaming habitat" to a degree, where I had to relearn everything just to fit in the world. I know, that's a weird statement, but let me explain: This game looks and feels clunky, and I'd argue that it's by design. A clunky design alienates the player from real life -- and I think there isn't a game where this practice fits more than in Peripeteia. Marie (the character you play as) finds herself blind in this cyberpunk Poland which exactly correlates with the the situation we as the player have. We have to adapt to this alien environment and we have to learn its rules  and OH I JUST LOVE THIS GAME IT'S SO GOOOOD!  There is a level later in the game which I think is probably the best one I have ever played. It starts normally but partway-through you think to yourself "oh wow, that's gotta be the end" but no, it keeps going and going- and it mixes different gameplay-designs and genres during the level. An experience, I've never gotten anywhere else before.   Looking forward to the last chapters, this rocks!
[Date: 2025-03-22 | Playtime: 13h 47m | Rec: Positive] at launch this is like a 10/10 game stuck in the cyborg shell of a 6/10 game. so to me its perfect but you have to be into that kind of thing. the demo is the entire first mission (which took me like 3 hours) and save data transfers over to the full version so just play that and see if youre willing to meet it at its level. personally im hooked
[Date: 2025-03-22 | Playtime: 16h 32m | Rec: Positive] There are still a lot to be fixed and/or changed in Peripeteia, but I guarantee you'll not find another game that is similar to this one - not even it's inspirations.  Belgrade and Karabash will test your limits as gamer, but once you conquer them, there's no coming back.
[Date: 2025-03-22 | Playtime: 14h 17m | Rec: Positive] good
[Date: 2025-03-22 | Playtime: 39h 33m | Rec: Positive] you will get lost in this game but once you find a direction or a hint as to were you should go just follow it to the best of your ability, and if you can't find a way forward just explore, the levels are huge, and there are weapons and items scattered throughout the level. I found it enjoyable to just walk around, and find stuff in this game.
[Date: 2025-03-22 | Playtime: 2h 28m | Rec: Positive] Very strange but also pretty fun.  Pretty janky but in a good way, lots to explore and do, and it has a cool style in my opinion.  There's a few weird problems here and there and then sometimes it feels a bit unpolished but it's definitely a cool little game, u can tell the devs put a lot of care into it.

[Date: 2025-03-21 | Playtime: 10h 32m | Rec: Positive] E.Y.E. оставила во мне ощущение что я недополучил архитектурного брутализма. E.Y.E. начинается с того, что тебя кидают в гиганские сточные каналы, показывают гиганские бетонные сооружения, но в итоге это самое вау быстро растворяется в вполне узеньких локациях. Живу я с этим неудовлетворённым ощущением очень давно.  Peripeteia как бальзам на душу. Я не знаю что со мной, но мне нравится бегать по огромным бетонным городам где нет ни единой травинки кроме кактуса. Более того тут не так много врагов, их ещё нужно умудриться найти. Не знаю как описать этот кайф когда ты видишь лестничные пролёты и здания у которых ни начала, ни конца, когда горизонт застилают бетонные сооружения, когда твое понимание земли теряется на заоблачных этажах застройки которая не даёт тебе даже вспомнить что от земли ты сейчас на огромной высоте...  Это какой-то гигакайф... ИРЛ такое бы не хотел, а вот в игре почему-то кайфую...

[Date: 2025-03-21 | Playtime: 25h 44m | Rec: Positive] Лучшая игра, в которую я когда-либо играл. Не жалею ни единого цента что потратил на неё. Все часы, что я провёл в ней, были насыщены разными активностями, а я при игре постоянно находился в состоянии шока и ахуя от происходящего на экране. Мне давно не хватало такого экспириенса, что смог подарить данный иммерсив сим. Саундтреки просто шикарны, не описать словами чувства что я испытывал когда резал саблей коммунистов под северслата. 10/10 absolute cinema. Большая часть уровней невероятно красивая и сильно отличаются друг от друга, даря постоянно новые эмоции. Красота первого лвла порожает и заставляет на него возвращаться, чтобы просто банально даже посидеть на балкончике и позалипать на этот skybox в купе с играющим на фоне треком Leavingbalcony. Отдельного упоминания заслуживает уровень Белград. Лучший лвл что только можно было придумать. Резкая смена стиля и правил игры ещё больше усилили ощущения ахуя, что итак преобладали большую часть игровых сессий. Да, местами боты были в край ахуевшие и сильные, но всё же именно это и создавало тот челлендж при первом прохождении, когда ты ещё не знаешь спидран стратки на прохождение этого уровня.

I mean come on you cant even close a conversation with a button but instead must do something you dont even want just to end the dialogue?   You can find a quest NPC and are FORCED to accept his task cause you cant end the dialogue otherwise.  Its like I play a RPG from 2004 with a fun premise but without any experience on games so everything, even the most basic QoL is missing. Lots of bugs and rendering problems too.  On a positive note high resolutions work great as well as UI scaling and FOV. Alot of games don't have that so thats really good.  Worst of all: IT TAKES FAR TOO LONG TO MANAGE INVENOTRY/LOOT.  Oh and randomly, while I loot and fix my inventory cause the game cant even give me the ammo when I walk over enemies, I randomly explode. Hooray.  Also those cool implants are too rare or useless.  The foundation and idea is good but needs a much better execution.

[Date: 2025-03-21 | Playtime: 8h 55m | Rec: Negative] Потенциально один из лучших имсимов последних лет, страдающий от кучи болячек. Если кратко - в данный момент это немного кривоватая, но сделанная с душой игра не для всех, где вкупе с приятной стрельбой и большой вариативностью прохождения соседствуют спорный геймдизайн с ГИГАНТСКИМИ уровнями, где можно спокойно заплутать на пару часов с вопросом "а куда мне блять идти", очень странно себя ведущий ИИ и неотполированность игры в целом. Покупать в текущем виде только при желании поддержать разработку или наконец прикоснутся к игре в хоть каком-то виде. С одной стороны мы имеем впечатляющий иммерсив-сим с необычным сеттингом (Польша в пост-постапок на фоне партизанской (ну а где-то и горячей) войны между подпольными комуняками и правительством), редкой для игр боевки (оружейная часть по сути тарков на минималках с менеджментом магазинов и шатанием оружия туда сюда), довольно большой вариативностью как в проникновении куда тебе надо/устранении врагов (импланты на инвиз, слоу-мо, дрон для разведки, модуль кукловода, обширный арсенал оружия) так и в достижении нужной тебе цели (в одном только первом уровне как минимум 4 варианта развития событий есть) и простором для исследования. С другой же ворох проблем не дает игре достичь статуса "мастхэв берите прям сейчас не думая": - ИИ откровенно тупой, враги регулярно могут забыть на тебя и стригерится на стену, или на стыке между горизонтальной и наклонной поверхностью просто застыть и забыв про все пялить вверх. - карты не просто большие - это гигантские лабиринты из канализаций, вентиляций, бетонных катакомб, комплексов, панельных высоток и других радостей брутализма. Поначалу простор радует, но по факту во всех миссиях можно легко или заблудится или не понимать где находится твоя цель, продолжая бродить туда-сюда часами в поисках нужного места. В моем прохождении каждая из миссий заняла у меня примерно по 2 часа (за исключением второй, которая проходится куда быстрее и заблудится на ней куда сложнее); - отсутствующая связь между разговорами с НПЦ и квестами - ты можешь спокойно придти в какие-нибудь ебеня, поговорить с стоящим там уникальным неписем и внезапно оказатся в середине одной из квестовых цепочек, аналогично с диалогами за прохождение определенных этапов задач - не сделал цель и непись говорит с тобой по кругу одну и ту же портянку текста что сделать, сделал цель и непись по кругу говорит с тобой портянкой текста про "малаца сделал". Я не знаю временный это костыль или авторское видение, но из атмосферы выбивает знатно. - Белград - это полный пиздец, миссия которую можно заспидранить за 3 минуты, а можно застрять на пару часов, апогей хренового геймдизайна и полного отсутствия каких-либо указателей куда идти и что делать.  В итоге покупать только если вы или хотите пощупать Перипетию хоть в каком-то виде или очень сильно изголодались по имсимам, иначе ждать релиза через пару лет.

I have a feeling that not many people have played this, and even less appreciate it, but this game massively rewards exploration, if you ask yourself "Can I get over there?" the answer is not only YES, but also you really should, you will be rewarded, if you think to yourself, "I have climbed 90 flights of stairs, should I really keep going?" YES You can complete levels in 5 minutes, OR you can wander around, finding looped paths that lead ahead or back, you can talk to the locals and get a feel for the environment, this game had me saying "Oh my god this is awesome" more times than any game has in the last few years. 12/10 can't recommend enough, awesome work.

However, the gargantuan maps and minimal guidance offered to the player make it a daunting, hostile game space when you're not familiar with it. The traversal mechanics are simple, the combat is basic and so are the objectives you're given throughout the game.   The first time you play a map, i'd say 70% of your time will be spent running around trying to figure out where to go and what to do, 15% of your time will be spent doing things relevant to your objective and 15% will be other things like talking to NPCs and platforming.  Even if the game looks great to you, play the demo first and keep an open mind. There is fun to be had here, but as with everything else in Peripeteia, it won't be easy to find.

[Date: 2025-03-20 | Playtime: 6h 7m | Rec: Positive] I really liked this game, despite its many (current) flaws.  The atmosphere, the graphics,the music, the enviroment are amazing and stunning, I don't know how to describe it but everything fits really well together, just walking around the game feels like an experience of its own. I also really liked the ilustrations used for the character, very cute!  The music choice is excellent for the game, I was very suprised to see sewerslvt, in a good way, of course. I definitely think the audio system needs a lot of tweaking as the "triggers" for different tracks seem to be area based, I would sometimes run into walls and that would trigger the soundtrack from other areas, and I would probably keep the more "combat" music (for example, where you enter the planetarium) not area based but more "detection" based, as in, if all enemies are dead, or they have lost track of you, return to the more calm, ambient music. Even silence in this game feels good because theres a lot of ambience around you, it makes it feel very real. More on the audio department, some sounds *really* need to be tuned down, I've had many moments where I had to take off my headset because the sounds would be insanely loud, coming from a singular enemy [spoiler] that guy in the sewers in the blackmail mission [/spoiler] There's other examples such as in gunfights, where I think it is realistic that it is this loud, but tuning it down to not f*ck my ears would be perfect.   The movement felt quite good and smooth, I do like that you can zoom around since the map is so big and it makes you feel like you can pretty much go anywhere if you experiment with the enviroment and ledges around you.  I assume the gunplay is done like this on purpose to keep it realistic, it is a bit challenging to get used to aiming, specially with something that has a silencer because it covers your iron sights, most enemies die with headshots so if you're a good shot you wont have to worry as much about ammo.  In short, I do think this game has insane potential, it needs a lot of smoothing of course, but I can tell it has a lot of love behind it, I hope I see it bloom someday.

[Date: 2025-03-20 | Playtime: 16h 38m | Rec: Positive] I'm all for cool aesthetics in video games, but this one definitely takes the cake for me. My only gripe is the game-play and level layouts.  The stealth kinda falls off in a lot of levels, it doesn't help when you're not given a silenced option, and the sword will alert every guard in a 10 block radius apparently. It also isn't clear where low-level light areas are. The level layouts are bad, and goes against exploring for loot because you will end up stumbling upon a random npc that'll automatically do a random quest-line for you, and you'll get horribly lost. The quicksave also stopped being a "quicksave" near the end of the game, and started taking around 5-ish seconds at worse. Quickloading would sometimes glitch and enemies would bug out completely or teleport where they're not supposed to be at times because of it. However, I am still super excited for the future of this game!

The most crooked game in my opinion and at the same time awesome in that the soundtrack in this game is sewerslvt and in general all art musician aesthethics is the best work that is at the moment and the most confusing because I didn’t know where this fucking train was. 10/10 wasting all my credit for a vodka and beer

[Date: 2025-03-19 | Playtime: 46h 23m | Rec: Positive] I was immediately hooked on the idea behind this game since its kickstarter announcement, even pitched in a few dollars during the green-lit phase and spent 40+ hours playing the demo till the early access dropped. After spending a good amount of hours playing both the demo and early access, I can say without a doubt.. this game still has a long way to being a very polish experience, the foundation is there and it's obvious that the dev took many borrowed "ideas" from game's like Deus Ex, System Shock, Thief, Vampire The Masquerade, etc.. set in a Polish dystopian cyberpunk hellscape where the digital space and physical world start to become one big blur. Who's to say, when both start to bleed into the consciousness, you gotta start asking yourself, what is real? If you're familiarized with Ghost in the Shell or more importantly, Serial Experiments Lain then you can see where this story takes inspiration from.   I know a lot of people like to say this game shares many characteristics with  E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy but honestly, the moment you play the game, you'll immediately start to notice how different it is from that series. One thing they share that this game does equally, if not more worst is the level design. Giant maps, giant buildings, giant empty hallways/corridors that intertwine and contort into other pathways that either lead to more empty areas or a dead end. You can see the devs wanted to make giant set pieces as to only give a sense of scale compared to the player, but due to the lack of density, no recognizable landmarks or any signpost to help players gauge where exactly they're at. It starts to feel less like an dystopian world on the brink of collapsing on itself from an ongoing war of ideologies and more like a barren post-apocalyptic world. Journals (now a bit more fleshed out in the early access) kinda give a general sense on where you need to head to just in case you get lost but reaching towards that destination will prove its own challenge as there's very little hand holding. Which more or less goes well with the "mystic" nature and player freedom this game has going on (although in most cases you're more than likely going be reloading a save file since you can't fast travel anyways), each level can be approach and complete in various ways, with 1-3 different endings per level to choose from that  branch off into different "routes" leading up to the next level. However, items, weapon and augments don't carry over to the next stage, money however does.   It's clear the devs want this game to take pointers from more well established immersive-sim titles out there by claiming to be just that, an immersive sims and I do agree it does do a well enough job. i just don't see the similarities like Deus Ex or E.Y.E in this game, at best I say it's very loosely similar, I see it as being it's own thing. Which is a plus, however the executions at implementing certain ideas/mechanics leave a lot of room for improvement. Body augmentation are a thing but the game doesn't do a well enough job explaining what they do, half of them are downright redundant and worst, they take up inventory space (the inventory space is a grid-based layout, think of RE4 inventory system) that makes no sense given the fact these are BODY augments we're talking here. A.I pathfinding/behavior patterns need more tweaking, since it's just boils down to the enemy just running at you the moment they see you, getting stuck in walls or shooting at you through invincible walls while not moving from the spot they originally saw you at. No sense of direction, no way to tell who's friend or foe since the aggro system can reset for almost no reason, so if you shoot an important NPC you can soft-lock yourself. Thankfully you can save/reload anytime in any level (expect level 4, if you know, you know) so that's not a huge inconvenience if you have multiple save files). The sneak mechanics can either be the most overpowered or buggiest mechanics in the game, if you know how to take advantage of the lighting system. Due to how shadows work in this game, If you stay secluded within the shadows, you are practically invisible to the A.I. Taking on multiple enemies in a a dark-lit room can be trivialized simply by killing an enemy with a head shot, run to another spot that's dark, not only will the enemy stop shooting in your general direction but they'll stop pursing you, repeat this process and you'll almost never feel the need to strategize any gunfight you come across. Double jumping exist but it's only available when you're falling from a great enough height but if you reach the maximum terminal velocity, you'll outright lose the ability to double jump. Why did they do this I have no idea but I assume the devs did this to stop players from abusing it by softening your landing when jumping from the many tall buildings that some levels are plague with. That's just scratching the surface at the many janky shenanigans you will face playing this game.   It's almost comical at how unapologetic Peripeteia is towards the player, it throws so many odd (and somewhat deliberate) design choices at you, that you kinda get a clear picture on what the creator is trying to achieve but can't pinpoint what exactly they're trying to say.  It kinda reminds me of the Disillusion series in that regard, except the creator watched Serial Experiments Lain a few too many times and decided they wanted to make a game based off that by learning the bare minimum on how to code. I like it. This is another game that I wouldn't be able to recommend to just anyone but if you seek something that could care less whenever or not you understood what it's trying to achieve but you enjoy taking the journey none the less. Then definitely pick up Peripeteia, or just wait when it's out of early access. Either way...   i need to find a way out of Belgrade, i forgot how to spell password again.
[Date: 2025-03-19 | Playtime: 7h 14m | Rec: Positive] So far (as of 3/18/25) this is my release of the year. There's something completely novel and fascinating about this game. I love it, it's weird and in a sense indescribable. The world design is perfection! The sound design and gameplay combine with that to form this lonesome longing that's really difficult to capture in a review. It's obtuse and difficult, and totally worth getting lost in. This is one of those rare gems that I feel very strongly about and can't quite explain why. You should try it, and don't get sifted by the first level; just explore around and try to find your way (for example, I took the most obtuse route to the objective I think, randomly wandering on rooftops and all around and then sorta falling into where you're supposed to go, only later to find about 4 other routes all of which were so obvious and yet I overlooked them). I highly recommend this game.
[Date: 2025-03-19 | Playtime: 32h 42m | Rec: Positive] While this game may have a lot jank, there's so many things going for this beauty of a game. My favorite part of Peripeteia is its exploration and how rewarding it feels. Keep in mind each level is massive; so you can seemingly feel lost but then find new ways to navigate through a level, find hidden items, new enemy hideouts etc.  The freedom this game provides is something that feels refreshing to me. This game does not hold your hand whatsoever, so the way a player navigates each level can be confusing at first. But after beating the game and replaying the first level again; I started seeing how insanely good the replayability of Peripeteia is with all of the possibles way of finishing every mission. Another thing I enjoy about this game is its atmosphere. One of my favorite manga of all time is Blame! so I automatically feel drawn to the design and vibes of the urban sprawl that is presented in each level. Its got a kick ass sound track that complements the overall feel of the game. I've seen people complain about the combat but I do genuinely enjoy it, especially when I use the augments this game has to my advantage. There are so many different weapons to choose from and so many different augments that can create many different viable play styles to defeat enemy groups and complete missions. The AI definitely needs improvement in combat given that sometimes they would be shooting randomly at walls, sometimes entire groups of enemies shooting at the same time seemingly at random with enemies sometimes killing each other by accident. Other times the enemy AI enemy will just be stuck in a wall shooting at you no matter where you are at the area. But these things are to be expected since this game is in early access, and devs are aware of these issues so Im hoping for constant improvement in many aspects in this game. Overall though I've been having a blast playing this game and well worth my money already. Cannot wait for new levels and for 1.0

[Date: 2025-03-18 | Playtime: 24h 14m | Rec: Positive] There's an odd tendency with the gaming community especially within the indie side of gaming, where people will compare one IP to another within the same genre it's tackling (that being immersive sims); and an awful a lot of people, (maybe in the minority), comparing Peripeteia to E.Y.E. As someone who play's both, they are nothing alike but sharing two massive flaws (while one game suffer's the most). ---------------- 1. Big part of the game is you have augmentations, most are useful but other's are useless or an oddity, like how certain augs aren't explain how they properly use. With the oddities is it give's you vague explanations; but once you KNOW how to use it (Like with Peripeteia with the puppet aug,) it's very effective.  As someone who has played both and loved both (for good & worst), Peripeteia is very simple and the only bad part 'sorta' is playing the game stealth. The stealth and the Aug's in favor of it, the flaw are talked about but overlooked. To put it simply this is how you accomplished stealth; is by paying attention towards what enemies hear you, on the same icon place where it shows in the bottom left corner if your in the shadows or not. While it is a flawed system it isn't as useless if you stayed in the shadows with your stealth equipment (and augs in favor to it). Stealth not-that-good, but it ain't as awful or useless as some negative reviews makes it. If anything slightly confusing. The huge issue with the stealth that makes me pull my hair sometime's, is how 'most' times the shadow in the game does not match to your shadow radar icon, most of the game consists of shadow... So- you are left guessing and end up giving up using stealth. All the levels so far I have played has this consistent issue, where you are left where to hide and where to avoid hiding. makes it very difficult for someone like me that plays stealth game; such being the Thief games, splinter cell, hitman etc etc,   In no way is it worst than or equal to being as bad as E.Y.E, just very inconsistent.  2. The map is huge. Now as weird as it is, I never personally minded Peripeteia for this but I did in E.Y.E; the difference is context on why Peripeteia work's while E.Y.E does not. Not to advert criticizing Peripeteia, so here's a quick rundown on E.Y.E levels;            With each level you need to pay attention to your level system all-of-which can be set in random, if you die a few time's (typically more than a few), your current level system you have been building up to one set-of-style can change completely to a NEW play-style. So the illusion of choice is very real to E.Y.E but that's kinda the point and you can get around that. And why having that game be as huge is bad already, is because enemies can be revived just as much as you, all with the same power scaling (minus you). Most of the time you are learning how to use MOST aug's. Most of them is more confusing and sometimes usually more useless that forces you to be in the meta of the game to one or two sometimes three play-styles. THAT IS NOT COUNTING the weapons in E.Y.E.  Peripeteia works because most level's can be done in different way's, you could play this level this way or instead go that way. The biggest issue with Peripeteia isn't that the level's are huge (and some people are exaggerating a bit); some of these level's you need more than just (word-of-advice) guidance but a map. The game very clear where you should go and how to go, so if you go out going in a killing spree you may end up being more lost than soft locked. Very hard to be soft locked unless you try to kill everyone you see. So of course your gonna soft locked yourself, you literally took out the key master to unlock the finished line. The biggest level that I have the worst time is Belgrade. Game need's a map with a marker when you do some quests. Most of the later level's you don't even need to follow the main quest and just look around to get to the finished line. The 3rd level of this game (The Chasm) has you go about the level (so far that I find) two unique ways, one more harder than the other but more rewarding for the results. What you do is look around & talk. Most people complaints besides with Belgrade; soft locking themselves because they lack self restraint when the proper time to kill. Best part of this game is each level can replayed in the menu besides in save files. But that doesn't excuse the game for causing occasional confusing where to go and that's why i believe it needs a map to guide the player more than word-play and a picture hint where to-go. Peripeteia most time's, reward you for aimlessly walking or climbing around the world and sometimes punishes the player. E.Y.E unintentionally punishes you for even looking around the world aimlessly because it's other flaws that became the game point.  Peripeteia is not in equal terms or close to resembled these issues, even common ones such being the world. Peripeteia in fact in more way's better than E.Y.E for the environment you look around. Game is amazing for how huge it is. You can look around and play the game but with that, if you just want to beat it in a small space, In a small or relatively medium size world in it's level design would hinder Peripeteia world building. Making the levels smaller isn't a good idea. ---------- Now you can't really really really soft lock yourself in Belgrade, as I found out there's 3 place's you could go. Like letting the fan go out and falling in a pit. BUT falling in the pit is better for you as it brings you to a computer, to get yourself trap (supposed to); inable to escape prision underground, if not... Well you are in a different area that your not supposed to be in, in fact you are outside of a building your supposed to be in that's the neighbor to the prision that your supposed to be trapped inside. This is a bug- but you can go back looking around back to this computer spot,and try to go to prison (or restart to a save area if you save whenever you are calm). You could go inside the vent before the fan is on to land in the pit safer(ish) passage beside you or you can save time by going down the pit. Or go down in the abyss before reaching the fan and new enemy types that shoot non-stop. The pit is better because you get a weapon later after being in prison underground.  Now once again this game has a problem being vague, or introduce you to a cool mechanic that should of been explain before Belgrade but part of the main bit of the game. When the upper left corner with a cute anime girl says "You are slightly calm" that means you can save. Belgrade. Is. The. Only. Level. That. Does. This. And this little detail has put me more hours playing this level than it should of been (I just straight up speedrunning it). Even without the speedrunning, this is the only level that confuses me where to go that I just gave up and found exploits how to get to the boss faster; Belgrade is both the worst and the best level in this game. But I really really wish I knew where I should be going. And that's where I see the problem where this game levels can be too big however; personally better finding a proper balance when to experiment more on a level like Belgrade especially when you are force to find equipment after losing it once your in this level. This level needed restrictions on it's level design- that is why this level has more bugs and issues. Not a bad level, the most flawed level so far with many potential but when you got someone like me just finding quicker ways to finished it (who already loved this game huge levels), you got a problem when it becomes to confusing where I just miss the point in the level.   in conclusion: This game has a special place in my heart, by the end of the early access of the game ending has caught me off guard, having me avoid giving anyone spoilers because how emotional it is. Many game's has made me bored and less inspired. With this game though. It really is special.

[Date: 2025-03-17 | Playtime: 9h 41m | Rec: Positive] Really surreal experience. Not the kinda game where you rush around from objective to objective, if you're a big fan of taking in the sights when you or cyberpunk media like Ghost in the Shell/Bladerunner then I definitely reccomend. It feels rough at time of writing [3/17/2025] but the game just has a 𝑽𝒊𝒃𝒆 thats hard to replicate. Even this early on in development I feel like my money is going to something with soul and passion in it instead of some triple a companies overflowing bank account and that means something these days. 
[Date: 2025-03-17 | Playtime: 19h 2m | Rec: Positive] This game is amazing. Don't get me wrong there are issues - the game is more jank than game at times and yet  I kept playing it. The main strength that cannot go without being mentioned is the atmosphere this game gives - if you want to experience an overbuilt world that just shy being from being an Ecumenopolis with the added bonus of it all being built in a Brutalist style then you found what you were looking for.   The gunplay is good, nothing revolutionary but nothing bad either. Gun variety is high and with that comes managing ammunition - since that takes up valuable inventory space it is better to not horde every bit of ammo you find unless you know that the enemies have matching guns for you ammo that you can take of their fresh bodies.   You are encouraged to explore the game area, even if you think that there might be nothing there 8/10 times you will find supplies that you will need if you are sloppy with your resources.   It's definitely not for everyone, if you are looking for a polished well rounded experienced I would advise against picking it up but, if you are willing to crawl through mud for this rough gem then I would definitely recommend you give it a try.   
[Date: 2025-03-17 | Playtime: 10h 31m | Rec: Positive] It's a good immesive game, full of atmosphere, very unpredictable. Map are MASSIVE and very empty (brutalism architecture). However, it is also incredibly janky, and feel like the all the devs are schizo or drugged out when making the game (not that it a bad thing). If you played all the more popular im-sim, or like Cruelty Squad, give this a try. Personally I kinda like it. I give it 8.5/10. Also, Marie is very cute.

[Date: 2025-03-17 | Playtime: 52h 0m | Rec: Positive] Квинтэссенция брейкора в оболочке игры.   От общей атмосферы альбома "HOPE LEFT ME" by Astrophysics в начальных уровнях до клипа "expand your space" by usoqu в финале, игра визуально-звучно сделана так, что в саундтрек ей можно подставить практический любую песню этого жанра. Даже общая грязная стилистика текстур, по типу игры "Babbdi" и неуклюжесть, отлично рисует мир заброшенного будущего, которому так-то плевать на тебя. Причём, мир на уровнях огромный, где проходы связанны между с собой и их забавно исследовать (хорошо, что нет карты), даже находить что-то в затаённых уголках и в out of bounds (привет, обучающий уровень). Да и этому способствует весьма гибкая система передвижения и паркура (есть уступ - можно забраться). Запутанный общий лор (я не понимаю польский щитпост, но в нём что-то есть). Стрелять прикольно, возиться с оружием через инвентарь в пылу боя весело, изучать мир приятно + смешная система взлома. Есть ещё уровень (Белград), который выбивается из предыдущих уровней, но мне он понравился.  Так-то, я бы больше сравнил игру с Wrought Flesh, чем с классическими иммерсив-симами.   Ах да, игра сырая, но в таком статусе, что не понятно, а должно ли так быть или нет.   1) Странные и поломанные зоны проигрывания эмбиентов и музыки. Либо не так проигрываются, либо просто глючат, как звуки выстрелов.  2) По факту, аугментации и усиления не имеют смысла, так как нет закрытых зон, открывающихся с их применением.  3) Порой не работающая система фракций и игровые скрипты 4) Иногда визуальные эффекты ну прям сильно бьют по глазам или настолько кислотные, что комп сдохнет. 5) Баги. Выпадение за текстуры. Ломающийся инвентарь. + Лучше не сохраняться на движущийся элементах. 6) Всё же мир пустоват (или так задумано) 7) Чёт ещё там было 8)Побольше бы сюжета и персонажей  Честно говоря, у игры огромный потенциал и я надеюсь, что её доделают и добавят ещё кучу уровней и фишек.   Если не уверены, стоит ли брать игру, то поиграйте в демку. В ней целый уровень и он как раз отлично передаёт суть игры. Меня он и убедил купить игру (да и за 500 рублей в донатных помойках ничего толком не получишь, а тут игра).   Покупайте, играйте, заходите на сервер в дискорде и предлагайте свои идеи и фиксы.

[Date: 2025-03-17 | Playtime: 7h 34m | Rec: Positive] I have no idea what's going on, that is the truth complete and full.   At one moment I understand, the next I have a polish sniper duel against 15 guys with mosins and PKMs, afterwards a commissar says something I couldn't read and blows his brains out in front of me, and then a philosophic AI talks about Frankinstein Gangster "AI master race" teeth knowledge. And I simply walk away from the whole encounter no longer understanding.  The style is perfect, the combat is meaty. I have not had more fun in a gunfight than having a perverbial knife fight with subculturalists while their brainrot TV blares in the background.  I'd heavily recommend the game if you like immersive sims, and enjoy a good dirty cyberpunk aesthetic.  Some day I hope to simply understand, but I might end up dropping my Glock and have it go supernova therefore vaporizing me from this plane of existence.  10/10 would understand again.
[Date: 2025-03-17 | Playtime: 12h 30m | Rec: Positive] Like E.Y.E. if it was actually the Deus Ex-like people claim it is. Quite a lot of walking, though. I'm not sure if this was intentional or the devs forgot that E.Y.E. also had infinitely reusable cyberlegs to make traversing Noctis Labyrinthus and other ginormous maps tolerable. I like megastructure walking sims, but they're not for everyone.
[Date: 2025-03-17 | Playtime: 20h 9m | Rec: Positive] I really like the jank. In this game Encountering a bug or going out of bounds feels like falling through some drywall or accidentally wandering into an employees-only zone in some huge building, which fits very well because this game is all about traversing huge buildings. Obviously I would prefer that it worked as intended but the stuff that doesn't work is still pretty cool. My only real problem is that I can never tell if my pc is overheating or its just the game ambience

[Date: 2025-03-16 | Playtime: 9h 38m | Rec: Positive] The game is very enjoyable, it has some pretty fun shooting mechanics and the world is very cool. I do enjoy the atmosphere and gameplay. But there's a significant number of bugs at the moment especially around reloading a save. Some items will disappear from your inventory or become unmanageable in your inventory. As an example if you use the saber and stab it into a wall to be used as a platform to climb on and save then reload that save the saber will disappear which I've read you can get replaced but it seems like a very big issue if that's a problem. There's a cassette tape player that has cassettes you can play in it however. They frequently experience bugs in your inventory window. As an example if you sell one of the tapes at a merchant but have to reload to a save prior to doing so the cassette will still be gone from your inventory. In addition any cassettes in your player will become unmanageable in your inventory after reloading as in you can remove them from your cassette player but you can't replace them in your inventory but you can drop them and pick them back up. However, after doing so you won't be able to move the item in your inventory after picking it back up it will have no border around it and it will permanently stay in one spot in your inventory while not occupying space it does clutter the UI. One tape in particular that I've found has more bugs with it than the others. It's the "Red Army Classics" tape or whatever it is called. I can't really remember as it never stays in the inventory no matter what you do. If you ever save and reload it will replace itself where you first find it or just disappear altogether. I hope more bugs continue to be removed from the game and it becomes more stable as I genuinely find this game fascinating and extremely fun when you play the parts that work.

[Date: 2025-03-16 | Playtime: 2h 49m | Rec: Negative] Фанат им-симов обoссут меня за этот обзор, но такова судьба. Мне кажется Cruelty Squad загазлайтил просто всю игровую действительность и теперь любой кaл можно терпеть, потому что это не криворукость - это так задумано.   У игры огромный потенциал. Самая сильная часть Перепетии - атмосфера. Просто наиcэксуальнейшие пейзажи, красивый цветокор, дождь, вся вот эта тема. Неоунарный киберпанк во всей красе, просто идеально.  Остальное - кaл. Я понимаю, что мы, фанаты им симов, как нелюбимые пасынки игровой индустрии и получаем либо пряжкой по eбaлу со смертью Аркейн студии, либо подарок на день рождения в виде какого-нибудь проекта от New Blood. Но с Перепетией наш метафорический отчим въeбал самого паленого спaйса (осуждаем очень сильно) и наблeвaл  в нашу кровать, пока мы в ней спали. Да, конечно, все это можно оценивать как интересный перформанс, над этим даже можно посмеяться и получить от этого  какой-то абстрактный кайф. Но это все еще лужа плохо пахнущей блевотины.   Сюжет в игре практически отсутствует, вообще все это лороискание в целом поднадоело. Но если даже отбросить его - диалоги написаны крайне слабо и как-то плоско что ли. Визуал и музыка тебя погружают в эту густую, тягучую антиутопию. А диалоги как будто из дешевого научно-фантастического романа про попадацев из книжного магазина.   Ганплей норм. Ни плохой, ни хороший - он есть и он выполняет свою задачу. Были ганы из которых приятно стрелять, были которые ощущались как вялые пукaлки и не более. Но это все меркнет по сравнению с двумя основными грехами игры. И это даже не баги из которых, на мой взгляд, самый критичный это абсолютно поганый и позорный ИИ врагов. Болванчики застревают в стенах, в упор тебя не видят, ими легко манипулировать и любая стычка становится просто шуткой.   Два основных минуса игры - звук и дизайн уровней. К саундтреку вопросов нет вообще, долбит нормально. Но вот все остальное делала какая-то глухая свoлочь, которой видимо хотелось поиздеваться над игроками. Все просто перегружено, игра будто в перманентном бас-буст режиме, когда перестрелка начинается. Ну а про дизайн уровней тут и другие обзорщики достаточно написали. Проблема не просто в том, что хeр пойми куда идти, а в том что уровни невыносимо огромные и пустые. Да, да, это задумка, сатира на идиoтизм советского и постсоветского брутализма, ну так и было задуманно! Если задумка идет поперек хорошего геймплея и левл дизайна, то это хyeвая задумка. Шароeбится по этим гигантским уровням тупо скучно и тоскливо. Не значит что нужны желтые стрелки на каждом углу или маркер на карте, но в этом магия и суть хорошего левл дизайна. Без лишних слов и GUI-уродтсв донести до игрока куда ему нужно идти.   Не могу, к несчастью, рекомендовать на данном этапе. Очень сомнительное удовольствие за такие деньги. До Белграда, который у части обзорщиков вызвал праведный гнев, а у части вызвал ceмяизвержение не дошел, но судя по тому что тут пишут вкуснятина наверное просто наикрутейшая. Кушай не обляпайся, фанат им симов. А потом еще добавки попроси. В общем да, терпим, карлики, терпим. Такова наша новая реальность. Мы навсегда заперты в аду джэнк-всратыш-игр, потому что Cruelty Squad и его обсасывание задали новый стандарт (причем даже не для разработчиков, а именно для игроков благодаря бесконечным обзорам, разборам и т.д.). Не нужно уметь делать графику, уровни, механики, системы и так далее. Нужно просто взять ото всюду понемногу того, что тебе нравится, кое-как слепить, а потом сказать что ты дoxуя поэт и все это часть огромного метанарратива. К игре вернусь, когда ее допилят. С радостью поменяю обзор на положительный, когда багов станет меньше, ИИ будет лучше, уровни не будут гoвной вонять, а при коммунизме все будет зaeбись. На данный момент - шляпа.

What I did was climb down a massive hole with some chunky wires, it took several attempts but eventually I made it down without dying and with a decent amount of health left. I just think it's awesome when a games mechanics are open enough to allow for these kinds of solutions, something I'm not sure the dev intended but is still viable, isn't that the prize of imsims?  Try the demo and have a look down that hole, I'm sure you won't regret it :)

It is janky, confusing, ugly, massive in size but hollow in content, and not particularly fun. From enemies that kindly remove all their ammo before dying, to your energy meter that doesn't recharge and burns out in 10 seconds so you can't even enjoy your cybernetics, to game/immersion breaking bugs, this dumpster fire has a lot to (not) enjoy. The fourth level in particular, Belgrade, could win several awards for atrocious game design. It's best viewed as an autistic passion project, but come on - $25.00???? This is a $7.50, forgotten at the bottom of the Steam charts game.
[Date: 2025-03-15 | Playtime: 1h 48m | Rec: Positive] Well...  It is good, but very very very very raw.  VERY big locations - that are empty. A LOT of enemies - that are blind or stupid many quests - but where do I go? You can loot enemies - but they have only weapons with couple of bullets There are a lot of cool abilities - but your energy wastes pretty fast and there are no normal consumables (but a lot of "temporary" hp/energy ones)  Well...  I don't know... It is fun...  And tries to become immersive simulator, but everything works junky. I killed nearly everyone and didn't feel any restrictions or achievement...  Hopefully it will become a little better and have some pointers for the player to see what he/she had done...

[Date: 2025-03-15 | Playtime: 2h 28m | Rec: Negative] Love the idea of the game and the fact that it's an immersive sim, without knowing where to go, it's often very confusing to even find any solution. Love that the environments are huge, but the issue is there's like 5 total npcs (rip possesion augment), and any sort of plot line is really hard to follow. I think the emphasis on exploration is very cool, however the map is too big and barren for you to find anything, but I do think it can be done well, [spoiler] such as you being able to find a dead girl in her apartment in the tutorial [/spoiler]. The stealth mechanics are well done but it's very hard to know where the light is coded and sometimes youre in the complete darkness only to be seen by some hobo because you're somehow fully visible. Fortunately the game is in early access, and it's very clear there is passion behind the style and direction, it'd be cool to see what changes come next. But for now, the playable parts are amazing and the unplayable parts are awful.

[Date: 2025-03-14 | Playtime: 48h 28m | Rec: Positive] The overall experience can be described as "slightly incomprehensible". There are multiple design choices that contribute to this: - The art style is very "dirty" - low-resolution textures combined with industrial environments create some really oppressing and uncomfortable atmosphere. - The level layouts can be downright schizophrenic, with passages leading to nowhere, or intertwining in a weird way, or not connected at all when you assume they should, etc. - The areas are huge. Gigantic even. The size of the buildings is increased to a degree where you feel like an ant next to a car. You can spend hours on each level just running around and exploring. The game will occasionally reward you for this, but most of the playable area is pretty barren and only serves to add a sense of scale for the world. Someone described the experience as a "lucid dream". That is also quite a succinct way to describe it.  When it comes to the quests, most of the time you do know what you need to do (you always have the journal to remind you if you forget). The goal is clear, but the path to accomplish it is not. There is zero hand-holding. If you get lost, there is no "fast travel to base" option or anything like that to get you out. The only thing you can do is to reload a save (if you made one, of course). There are multiple ways to complete the level. In general, there are at least 3 ways, one of which will get you to the end in a matter of minutes, whereas completing the level normally would take at least an hour or two (usually longer if you thoroughly explore it). Right now, the choice of how you play does not affect the story, but this is supposed to change in the full game. Currently, the levels alternate between one big open level and one more "compact" one after it. Which is nice, because it allows you to take a break from running around big empty spaces.  The game has a "realistic" approach to inventory management. The inventory itself is grid-based, and you need to manually move the items around, since the game won't do that for you automatically. If you want to reload a magazine, you need to manually take it out of the gun into the inventory, then combine the appropriate ammo with it, and then insert the magazine back in. Or if you have spare mags with ammo, you can just reload with R. So you must constantly be aware of how much ammo you have and if you have the space for it. This system works quite well, but it's not properly explained in the tutorial.  If you read other reviews, and take the current early access state into account, you will realize that the game is quite buggy. The weapons can disappear from your inventory, you can softlock yourself in some places, the game could stop working properly after a load, etc. The devs are actively working on fixing all of that, though.  What I think could be improved: - Quest scripts are somewhat wonky. The transition from one stage of a quest to another is not always straightforward. Some lines will be replayed over and over when you speak with the quest giver, and they won't acknowledge that you completed the objective. - The game is very dark, even on max brightness. It's probably by design, and the game has night vision to compensate for it, but it costs energy, and it's not always easy to replenish it. I would prefer either night vision not costing energy at all, or to be able to slowly regenerate energy with an augment. This would make long exploration more bearable. - The enemy AI is very simplistic. They always run to the same spots and just stand there, letting you pick them out one by one. The stealth is also rudimentary - you are either completely invisible or enemies instantly notice you. Also, it's hard to predict where enemies will see you just by looking at the lighting of the spot, because it rarely corresponds to the actual brightness level. - I would prefer to have the ability to always double jump, instead of only being able to jump when falling.  The game's page states that it's inspired by Ion Storm and Looking Glass games. But I don't really see it. It may be loosely similar to the original Deux Ex in some places, but that's it. The game is its own thing, and that's good.  If you like immersive sims and can tolerate jank and bugs, you should try the game, even right now. It's not that expensive, and the amount of content already present can give at least 20 hours of gameplay. But it is a niche game, be aware of that.

[Date: 2025-03-14 | Playtime: 27h 56m | Rec: Positive] Честно говоря, когда я впервые попробовал поиграть в демо перед покупкой, я долго плевался и не понимал, как вообще можно так делать игры. Огромные карты, где непонятно, куда идти, ты можешь бежать 10 минут, и в итоге это приведёт тебя в тупик, где ничего нет. Оружие, из которого зачастую неудобно стрелять, например, мосинка, у которой глушитель перекрывает весь прицел, инвентарь, что исчезает между уровнями, искусственный интеллект врагов, который просто отсутствует, из-за чего они тебя ваншотят, чтобы как-то это компенсировать. Но я всё равно решил дать игре ещё один шанс и купил ранний доступ... И я не пожалел об этом. Пусть Белград для меня и стал личным филиалом ада, потому что я не люблю все эти хорроры и подобные вещи, но атмосфера, визуал, отдых в своей квартире между миссиями, разговоры с Катей (твоей соседкой, что угорает по яою и любит прибухнуть пиваса, а также без ума от лифтов) и сама Мари полностью всё окупили. У игры есть проблемы, это бесспорно, и она далеко не так вариативна, как многие любят преувеличивать, но всё равно это один из уникальных игровых проектов и, я думаю, максимально нишевый, в которые я играл в последнее время. Плюс понравились абсурдные шизомемы по телеку, ну и северслат на саундтреке делает своё дело. Надеюсь, игру допилят в конце концов и не забросят, как это часто случается с ранним доступом. В общем если вы когда-нибудь хотели побродить по огромному гигахрущу, проникнуться постсоветским киберпанком, разрезать танк саблей, набухатся водки и по паркурить по панелькам, то это игра для вас.

[Date: 2025-03-14 | Playtime: 3h 42m | Rec: Negative] the aesthetics are amazing, visuals are easily the best part of the game the gunplay feels really meaty and powerful played the original demo all the way back and was excited to see how they were gonna improve on a lot of the flaws it had, but it doesn't seem like it did though and feels super unpolished  the stealth feels horrible, even if with the invis augment you have to be sneaking almost all the time, and with the huge energy drain it just isnt worth it, that with the lack of just any available silenced weapons in some levels  with the routes you can do to complete levels just feel jank, i softlocked myself in the second level after killing the main objective guy, came back and accidentily talked to the bartender about getting dirt on him which apparently made all the npcs forget i literally just killed him and locked me out of getting through that way, since the game is so fucking confusing you can just trying to find the right way to go and accidentally progress the other routes  the augments themselves feel so underpowered for their cost, like getting crappy invis to chew through your energy barfor less than a minute when you really need to save it to traverse or like see in the dark  the main problem i felt were with the maps, they were fucking HUGE and so god damn empty, since nothing of real value transfers between levels theres no actual reason to explore and get loot outside of doing the main objective, but its just so fucking huge and confusing to go through its actually so hard to even tell where to go, and the most directions youll ever get it just to go like west or something  to put it bluntly the level design sucks ass, like huge ass hallways leading to literally nothing or huge empty rooms, not knowing where anything is, and being unable to communicate where the fuck anything is  like even if you like the gameplay alot, most of it is just gonna be wandering around wondering where the fuck to go

[Date: 2025-03-13 | Playtime: 11h 4m | Rec: Positive] Vou recomendar só porque o Dev conseguiu me prender com a estética e a lore, mas gameplay-wise, esse jogo é ruim, não é nada polido. O jogo se vende como boa parte da gameplay dele sendo stealth, mas você mal consegue usar a mecânica de forma eficiente, eventualmente você vai meter bala em todo mundo só por frustração. A IA dos inimigos é um lixo, o jogo tem uma hud toda bem feita pro stealth apontando os pontos de visão, audio e skills pra mecânica, mas tudo é executado de forma porca.  Existe um level que mete os inimigos mais fudidos do jogo em uma área onde você mal tem equipamento pra usar, essa área é legal na teoria e seria fácil uma das melhores se o stealth fosse bom, mas ele não é, você infelizmente tem que passar o mais longe possível dos inimigos, quase desconsiderando que eles existem no mapa, se você chegar perto, mesmo escondido, eles vão te ver, e não tem como você matar eles de forma segura usando aquela faca merda que o jogo te dá. E vai por mim, se você chegar em Belgrade e um inimigo te ver, você tá praticamente morto.  Se tratando de um immersive sim, é onde ele brilha, ele de fato trás os charmes do gênero, tem um mapa extenso, cheio de rotas e mais de uma maneira pra completar as missões, ele também não de tá senso de direção alguma conforme você explora, mas você eventualmente vai esbarrar no objetivo principal ou vai fazer uma quest secundária sem saber que fez.  Esse jogo está em EA, ou seja, ele não lançou completo, tem grande potencial para virar um grande jogo e uma jóia do mundo indie, mas o Dev precisa urgente se comprometer a melhorar essa gameplay e essa IA horrorosa, vou ficar na expectativa e espero de coração que o Dev não esteja satisfeito com o estado atual do jogo, ISSO PRECISA DE POLIMENTO. Enfim, sei que ele tem a capacidade de melhorar tudo isso com o que eu vi até agora, estou com altas expectativas para esse jogo.

[Date: 2025-03-12 | Playtime: 17h 10m | Rec: Positive] Really interesting game. Most of the playtime is spent jumping around environments that don't really feel like they were meant for players to explore. What's so captivating is usually you'll find an item laying around despite at time feeling almost out of bounds. Gun play is really good with there being an absurd amount of guns to play with. Augmentation system needs some work. I didn't find anything besides advanced movement and nightvision actually worth using. Story is very strange but good.   Biggest issue right now are the bugs. Some of them are whatever (models clipping out, dialogue duplicating, ui bugs). Some of them are game breaking (inventory bugging out, scripting breaking making quests impossible to complete or completeable despite failing parts of them, story events breaking between saves causing the save to break completely).   Its worth a purchase for sure, but may be better off waiting until the games a bit more stable.
[Date: 2025-03-12 | Playtime: 13h 14m | Rec: Positive] One of the worst pieces of shit i've played. It rivals EYE: Divine Cybermancy, Cruelty Squad and Brigand: Oaxaca in terms of jankiness. 10/10
[Date: 2025-03-12 | Playtime: 9h 11m | Rec: Positive] So some of the levels feel pretty rough around the edges, but overall is a pretty solid game. 7.5/10 do recommend if you like imsims.
[Date: 2025-03-12 | Playtime: 2h 8m | Rec: Positive] The good:  World is pretty dang cool, I like the dialogue and the story. Gunplay is very deliberate and that deliberate feeling emanates throughout the game. Oozes soul and care. The inventory system is cool as hell and once I got the hang of it very easy to deal with such as taking mags out of guns on the ground, taking off attachments and selling them for some extra cash. Good fucking game frankly.  The bad:  While the world is cool, it feels quite empty most of the time. You are parkouring a lot with your abilities and that verticality is cool but it feels like it's not capitalized on enough (early access issues probably). Additionally, while I know some people are ok with this I'm not ok with you losing your inventory when you change levels. One of the best part of these types of games is seeing your arsenal grow not having it taken away each time you return from a mission. And finally the jank ass inventory slot decisions for some items such as the augment I picked going everywhere like a spiderweb and being a pain in the ass to manage in my inventory. I wish this item could have just been equipped as I had initially assumed it would so I wouldn't even have to deal with it.   The point:  It's a fantastic game with clearly a lot of love and if you get past the jagged edges it's wonderful.

[Date: 2025-03-12 | Playtime: 22h 12m | Rec: Positive] Peripeteia is the new KOTOR2 and not because of dialogue choice but because of genuine player choices and demonstration of true autonomy as a roleplayer. Thank you for allowing me to relive childhood memories of KOTOR2/S.T.A.L.K.E.R, I am a 34 year old man.  Mechanically this game is amazing, I grew up playing gunzonline and traversing EVERY SINGLE INCH OF A LEVEL is such a genuine expression of player skill and reminds me of traveling through levels in Gunz with slash climbing. I never thought I would experience this again.  This game is not for you if you do not value the exploration of how your own beliefs, morals and self perception reflect upon you as a player. I am a fundamentalist Christian with absolute certainty to believe that transhumanism is a sin. I once struggled with gender dysphoria and believed that one day I would be best represented in a digital medium, uploading my consciousness to the internet perhaps or not even being perceived at all. Jesus saved me from my once fatal delusion and I preach the Gospel now through His strength, but I have great empathy for those who suffer from gender dysphoria due to this suffering that God has allowed me to experience. I put myself into the game to explore Christian themes and the writer for this game absolutely is amazing. Someone on the team must be a genuine Holy Spirit-filled Christian because this was absolutely moving. I am so deeply moved by the writing of this game. Thank you for respecting my intelligence, my beliefs and my experiences as a player.   I am the target audience for your game.   God bless you, Jesus loves you and I pray one day I see you in Heaven.
[Date: 2025-03-12 | Playtime: 27h 3m | Rec: Positive] [h3] I am, for the FIRST time in ALL of my years of playing video games EVER, going to leave a review. [/h3]  BEFORE my in depth honest review and hot takes, I'll be straightforward for the light readers. If your looking for a finished product, you don't like exploring new confusing mechanics, or hate getting lost at times in honestly confusing level design, you might want to sit this one out.  Now. I feel like its important to disclose WHY i believe this game is worth its cost, to address its justifiable shortcomings, and to inform YOU about the product you are considering buying.   This game is by no means a finished game. That is why it is in early access, and if the 20 odd bucks is to steep in your opinion for an unfinished game, there you go. The game is buggy and the missions can get confusing. I've found my way out of the map on accident more than once, found multiple bugs as well as faulty augmentations (puppeteer for example, haven't found a single npc it works on),  [b] AND THE OPTIONAL DIFFERING PATHS YOU CAN TAKE ARE NOT ISOLATED [/b] so i found myself unintentionally completing both ways on approaching the mission (multiple times.) [spoiler] to the people who know, im specifically referring to Filemon, who will specifically also request the bulb from the planetarium and can also conclude act 1 if you bring him the android. as well as being not the first npc you encounter that requests the bulb? [/spoiler] but that's what you get when you invest in an early access game.   HOWEVER. The atmosphere is astonishing. Blue hazy skies and a banger soundtrack coursing your way through a bleak dystopian city. Can't be beat. Even in spite of the games low resolution graphics i found myself not just happy with the environment and the npc interactions and the world design, I found myself ENAMORED with it all.  The gun handling is a little hard to learn to deal with. But once you catch your groove, you learn to love in even in its jank. The world design is a little dark and sometimes confusing, but that's why you have night vision throughout almost all of the game anyways. I wish there was more to the augmentations, and i never felt i [b] needed [/b] them per say, but they are mostly well rounded and definitely useful. (especially night vision)  And now, for my hot take. Belgrade. I love it. What can i say, I'm a sucker for the horror and the story woven into this level.  The saves are limited, sure but not to the degree I've seen you goobers complaining about. If you're really that concerned with save scumming you can always scramble back to the last area you could save in, [b] lord [/b] knows i did. But the concern of having that safety net stripped away makes encountering Belgrade's enemies so much more memorable. It makes searching for the story behind its walls much more risky, and it makes exploring for the next area you CAN save much more of a daunting task. But i found 4 save areas in the first quarter of Belgrade alone and its more than enough. Though admittedly, The stealth based concept of the mission does limit playstyles types and i can sympathize with my blaze-of-glory compatriots.  In conclusion, Its a lot of exploring and if you aren't a fan of that, that's ok. But if you DO have the cash to blow and an open mind, this is an amazing one of a kind game I find myself thinking about all day at work and you wont regret having tried it at all.  I recommend it a thousand times over, And i hope the it continues to get the love it deserves.
[Date: 2025-03-12 | Playtime: 1h 54m | Rec: Negative] I really want to enjoy this game, but I simply can't. I loved the atmosphere and many of the mechanics like the tarkov-esque inventory tetris and whatnot, but just... There's not much... Like I almost took over the refund time simply trying to figure out HOW to finish the first mission... I had to search up a walk-through literally just because I apparently did look into an odd dark corner.   I spent nearly 25 minutes head-scratching wondering how on earth I was going to carry the *robot* back up to the hovel, on TOP of that, I was stuck for 10 minutes simply thinking that the dialogue menu was glitched and I simply didn't have enough storage to pick the robot up. Past that, I finished that got the ticket and was set to begin the next level. (?)   Another gripe is holy smokes is some crap absurdly loud. Like I got shot at, and I genuinely paused the game and rushed to the settings because the gunfire physically hurt.   To anyone considering the game now, just understand, if you're fine with spending $25 to walk around lost for almost 2 hours as you try to figure out how the hell the mission is supposed to be completed, I leave that to you.   But for what it's worth, I simply don't feel like I can justify spending $25 for this game, indie or not, in its current state. 
[Date: 2025-03-12 | Playtime: 14h 59m | Rec: Positive] Amazing game, nothing quite like finding the ending area of a level early, thinking “I bet I can climb even higher”, using super strength to move a box way too far so you can climb up somewhere it just looks like you could get to, only to then find nothing but a magazine for a gun you haven’t found in the level yet. Absolute class, would do it all again and will when more levels come out  Play the demo! Or don’t, I don’t give a fuck what you do. But the game is dank as hell

[Date: 2025-03-11 | Playtime: 13h 39m | Rec: Positive] DeusEx初代やSystemShock初代のような、いわゆるイマーシヴ・シミュレーションゲーム。個人的には「１ステージが広大な、ステージ完結型Imm Sim」という意味ではE.Y.Eが一番近いと思う。最初に言っておくとこの３つのどれかが好きという人は買っていい。逆に「Imm Sim好きだけどDishonoredとか人間革命とかやってない」、という人はとりあえずdemoを触ってどういうものか確認した方がいいと思う。  超巨大なブルータリスト建築のビルが立ち並ぶサイバーパンクポーランドが舞台に放り出され、「何をするか」から「どのように目的地にたどり着くか」まですべてプレイヤー自身に委ねられる。問題へのアプローチの仕方もさまざまで、裏口からステルスを意識しながら侵入しても良し、銃をもって正面突破するのもよし、ビルの屋上からコヨーテタイムを駆使してバルコニーからバルコニーへと飛び移り外壁をよじ登って全部すっ飛ばすのも良し。崖や鎖をよじ登れたり、急斜面をジャンプで駆け上がれたりなど、結構色々無茶ができるのがこのゲームの醍醐味だと思っている。逆に多くの人がひっかかりそうな点でありつつ、自分のような人間が喜ぶ仕様としては、マップ表示や目的地マーカーがないこと。ちゃんと会話を聞き、文章を読み、自分で建物の位置関係などを脳内である程度マッピングすることが必須となっている。  インベントリシステムは優秀で、グリッド方式。また、武器のマガジンなどはしっかりイベントリ領域を取る上に手動。つまり、戦闘前にマガジンにしっかり弾を込め、戦闘の準備や戦闘後のメンテが必要となっている。たまらん人にはたまらん。当然、武器から装填済みの弾を抜いたり、マガジン式の武器のマガジンだけ抜いたり、アタッチメントを取り外したりもできる。おまけにアイテムが全て矩形にはなっていなく、回転や反転などをしながらインベントリテトリスをすることになる。好みはあると思うが、個人的にはこの手のインベントリマネジメント要素は大好きなのでこれはプラス要素。めんどくさいと思う人は向いてないかもしれない。  一方で探索する建造物があまりにも巨大すぎて、目的地が分かりづらかったり（自分で建物などの位置関係をメモるか頭の中に入れておく必要がある）、明らかに推奨されていない通行経路（100階以上ある螺旋階段を足で登る）などがあったりするのは嫌いな人は嫌いかもしれない。また、あまりにも広大なマップのため、探索しても必ずしもアイテムがあるわけではなく、むしろご褒美が用意されていることの方が珍しい。それでも透明な壁などが一切なく、隔たりなく自由に探索できる今作はとても魅力的。また、現状ステージ間での装備は引き継げないが（お金は引き継げる）、アップデートで今後一部装備は引継ぎできるようにすると明言されている。  あるゆる意味で癖が強いが、この癖の強すぎる要素が好みの人にとっては、最近のゲームでは味わえない栄養分をこのゲームから補給できる。特にE.Y.E好きなら現状のアーリーアクセス状態でも十分満足できる内容となっているので買って間違いない。

[Date: 2025-03-11 | Playtime: 26h 41m | Rec: Positive] The game is in early access and messy right now, but I still recommend this to select people familiar with the genre. This game is definitely not for everyone, from its language and themes to its gameplay, it most definitely falls within its own niche.  The story is fantastic, there is many interesting quest givers you will meet throughout the game. There *will* be a character you fall for despite being a horrible person. Each character has a unique perspective on life, and often the game will have you thinking during the ''down time'' sections where you walk around and explore. Some might complain about the plethora of empty spaces, I think it is great. The down time lets you soak in the atmosphere and lets you think about the game its story.   The choices *matter* and the combat is very expressive and punchy. For a fan of games that make you rethink your own believes and gameplay that does not hold your hand, this game is fantastic.

[Date: 2025-03-11 | Playtime: 6h 51m | Rec: Positive] it needs some more time in the oven. In some ways it's like a skeleton of a game, it's really not even an immersive sim in its current state. It is SUPER immersive though, the environments are very fun to explore and a lot of the emptiness hints to me at future content locations. The soundtrack is genuinely wonderful, like pure bliss at times for a game with such big, ambient environments. There's a little bit of NPC interaction and side questing but there is literally no incentive to do anything any particular way other than pure exploration and curiosity, as the game has no form of faction system, XP/perk system, or loadout carryover between missions except for money. you can use some basic augmentations for stealth and other stuff but there's usually very little reason not to just run in and shoot every enemy in the head. gunplay is clunky but it encourages careful planning and awareness. it's barebones but what's here is really promising, I definitely see the vision and I would like to see this get enough support to escape early access :)

[Date: 2025-03-10 | Playtime: 8h 15m | Rec: Positive] Essa é a minha review depois de 5 horas jogando o Early Access. O jogo instalou e rodou bem no meu Arch Linux usando Proton Experimental, os únicos problemas são alguns bugs que parecem relacionados ao alt-tab (uso Hyprland então não existe exatamente um alt-tab, é só a mudança de foco das janelas que as vezes quebra o jogo).  [h1]Gameplay[/h1] O feeling do jogo é muito bom, apesar da física e dos controles não serem totalmente responsivos (isso me parece um problema relacionado a jogos que usam Unity em geral, onde comandos simultâneos podem falhar em serem registrados e comandos repetitivos, como sair pulando por aí, também não registram muito bem). [h2]Armas[/h2] Armas de fogo são especialmente divertidas de usar, apesar do design de algumas delas atrapalhar a visão quando mirando. Os tiros são precisos, o recoil é realista e é possível encarar tiroteios bem frenéticos sem muito desconforto. Alguns detalhes interessantes são o "leaning" usando as teclas E e Q (tipo Tarkov) e a opção de mudança no modo de disparo de algumas armas (single-fire, burst-fire, full-auto, etc). Armas corpo-a-corpo são estranhas, usei a maioria apenas durante incursões furtivas. Esfaquear um guarda pelas costas e ver ele ficando preso na sua lâmina é um detalhe que eu gostei, facilita a esconder os corpos e é engraçado. [h2]Modificações Corporais[/h2] O jogo conta com várias modificações que podem ser equipadas. As modificações também precisam ser carregadas no inventário, mas isso não atrapalha muito pois o sistema de inventário é bem feito. Algumas modificações são passivas e outras ativas. As modificações passivas, como a armadura que absorve dano e transforma em energia, são legais e bem úteis, mas sinto que as modificações ativas deveriam ser mais úteis do que são. O drone, uma modificação que permite voar com um drone por aí e observar o local, é bem esquisito pois gasta muita energia e não permite marcar inimigos ou algo assim. Usar o drone é legal, mas não vale de muita coisa pois você vai sobrevoar uma área, olhar onde estão os inimigos, mas quando for entrar na área os inimigos já terão andado e saído de suas posições. Usei a modificação de marionete, que te permite controlar um inimigo, mas ela funcionava muito melhor na demo. Nesse early access essa modificação parece quebrada, espero que os devs consertem ela em breve. Não tenho muito o que dizer das outras modificações, a maioria aumenta sua capacidade de exercer outras atividades (ficar invisível para ser furtivo, deixar o tempo lento para acertar headshots, correr mais rápido e pular mais alto pra chegar a algum lugar). Acho que seria interessante se modificações realmente alterassem completamente o modo de se lidar com as fases, como a modificação da marionete deveria fazer. [h2]Movimento[/h2] Se mover em Peripeteia é bem legal, o jogo tem um sistema de parkour interessante e que funciona muito bem quando o mapa é projetado para isso e, na maioria das áreas do jogo, esse é o caso. As vezes, quando em escadas por exemplo, o movimento fica um pouco "escorregadio", mas não é algo impossível de se lidar. Usar a modificação que te faz correr mais e pular mais alto torna o parkou muito atrativo de se fazer em alta velocidade, adicionando adrenalina aos tiroteios. [h2]Inimigos[/h2] Os inimigos não são as criaturas mais brilhantes do mundo, mas são bons de mira. Eles investigam coisas estranhas (um corpo, um barulho, etc) e não enxergam nada no escuro. A maioria dos encontros é dada da seguinte forma: um conjunto de salas, ou um galpão, com vários inimigos dentro, alguns patrulhando e outros parados. É fácil bolar um plano diferente para cada encontro, dependendo dos itens e modificações que você tem, e mesmo quando os planos dão errado é possível improvisar no ato ou usar o método infalível de ficar num canto com uma escopeta esperando os inimigos virarem uma esquina. [h1]Narrativa[/h1] Ainda não entendi para onde vai a história do jogo, mas ela é contada através de diálogos e anotações no diário da Marie. É uma forma ok de contar uma história, dependendo do saco do jogador para falar com os NPCs para saber o que está acontecendo. O diário da Marie não é 100% confiável, já que ela não escreve tudo de importante que é falado, mas é possível ver histórico de conversas também. [h1]Atmosfera[/h1] Boa parte do meu interesse no jogo veio da atmosfera cyberpunk do leste europeu que ele tem. Os cenários, sons e visual de itens do jogo combinam muito bem e estabelecem a atmosfera de forma excelente, mas acredito que a iluminação "dark" é um pouco exagerada, o jogo ficaria menos cansativo de se olhar se fosse melhor iluminado. [h1]Sons[/h1] A música é boa. As tracks são tocadas dependendo do local e podem ficar um pouco repetitivas as vezes, mas não incomoda tanto quanto o som ambiente. Acontece que o jogo tem alguns bugs sonoros. Você pode estar numa sala e ouvir um soldado dizendo algo, mas se procurar não encontrará nada. Não sei se os soldados mortos continuam fazendo barulho e falando, mas é irritante ficar ouvindo passos e vozes sem poder encontrar de onde elas vêm. [h1]Missões[/h1] O formato do jogo em missões separadas, em que você não pode levar itens de uma missão para outra, não fez muito sentido para mim. O ambiente que você fica entre as missões, que é o apartamento da Marie, não serve para muita coisa, já que não dá para guardar itens, comprar itens, etc. Descobri recentemente que você recebe dinheiro entre as missões, talvez o valor do seu inventário na última missão, e com isso é possível se equipar direito no início da próxima missão (isso se algum mercador vender coisas boas, o que só começa a acontecer a partir da terceira missão). De qualquer forma o formato de missões me incomoda um pouco, mas creio que isso é um immersive sim e não um looter shooter. [h1]Gráficos e Performance[/h1] O jogo é bem bonito, apesar dos gráficos de PS2, e os cenários, luzes, sombras e texturas combinam muito bem entre si para formar uma identidade visual distinta. O jogo engasga as vezes dependendo do mapa. Curiosamente tive muitos travamentos no mapa da segunda missão, mas o da terceira, que parece maior, não engasga. Talvez os problemas de performance sejam coisa que pode ser consertada durante o desenvolvimento do game.  [h1]Conclusão[/h1] Recomendo o jogo para quem se interessa pelo gênero immersive sim e pela temática cyberpunk. É um early access então vamos poder ver o jogo se desenvolver ao correr dos anos. Acredito que foi uma boa ideia gastar meu dinheiro com esse jogo, pois ainda não terminei e estou me divertindo bastante quando jogo.
[Date: 2025-03-10 | Playtime: 20h 19m | Rec: Positive] Очень грубый и не огранённый алмаз. Шероховатый и забагованый геймплей не мешает наслаждаться невероятной атмосферой. Имбовость ОСТ перекрывает иногда очень заметную проблему со звукорежисурой. Огромные уровни захватывают своей глубиной и получается им простить что в них существуют какое то количество пустых мест.
[Date: 2025-03-10 | Playtime: 11h 43m | Rec: Positive] Невероятно атмосферная игра пропитанная стилем призрака в доспех, блейма, деус екса и многих других популярных проектов. Потеряться в этих огромных и очень атмосферных локациях одно удовольствие, на эту самую атмосферу сильно влияет визуал игры и музыка. Графика времен 2000, но современное освещение и стилистика отлично работают в синергии. Музыка здесь очень подстать игре, атмосферный брейккор. Помимо визуала и стиля, из тех самых популярных проектов, игра заимствует множество механних, которые не выглядят нагромождение всего подряд, они придают особенности проекту. Отличный имерсив сим, где квесты можно проходить множеством способов, порой не очень очевидными, но дающими малые крупицы лора и истории.   Почти все в игре сделано хорошо, но игнорировать слона в комнате очень трудно....  Техническое оформление игры плохое, множество багов, софтлоков, сломавшихся скриптов и сохранений портящих впечатление от игры. Очень надеюсь, что разаб на релизе отполирует игру и мы сможем получить невероятный имерсив сим, которого до этого не видели.  Буду следить за дальнейшей разработкой и держать кулачки.  Слава Белграду!
[Date: 2025-03-10 | Playtime: 17h 14m | Rec: Positive] This game is Kino at its rawest form! Its rough around the edges and has some issues but all of that is literally avalanche crushed by the atmosphere of the game, the sheer size and care put into these maps, the dedication of the devs, and the fun gameplay! This game is clearly made with love and I cant fucking wait till the full game releases as I want to fully dive into this fucked up world.
[Date: 2025-03-10 | Playtime: 14h 54m | Rec: Positive] yeah its alright. lorns lure meets deus ex meets polish femboy
[Date: 2025-03-10 | Playtime: 33h 7m | Rec: Positive] Fantastic all the way through. -banger OST -fun mechanics -unmatched aesthetics -huge levels with lots to explore My jaw dropped on multiple occasions throughout my first playthrough.  This game to me is E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy's spiritual successor, with a little more of an imsim twist.
[Date: 2025-03-10 | Playtime: 8h 35m | Rec: Negative] Sorry to say but despite the gunplay being decent enough and some of the visuals being neat the game's just not all that fun. Huge hallways with nothing at the end, a minute long elevator ride you have to take both down and up, and generally levels that are far too big for what little there is in them. This is all compounded by how dark everything is, the game might as well colour everything green by default because you'll have night vision on 24/7. Lastly the augments just aren't all that fun, and considering you'll mostly have night vision on it's hard to justify burning the battery needed to use them anyway.
[Date: 2025-03-10 | Playtime: 3h 36m | Rec: Negative] I really struggle to call it an immersive sim, honestly, and Looking Glass inspiration is barely noticeable. I played the demo back when it came out and the game was on my radar ever since. Granted, it is in early access, so potentially a lot of stuff can(and should) be fixed, so i'll wait. The general gameplay and movement is fun, but constant confusion on your whereabouts what do you even do, coupled with bugs and all sorts of ear splitting sounds all over the game is too much for me at the moment. For now it is a "euro-junk" stealth action at best, can't recommend it at it's current state, unfortunately.
[Date: 2025-03-10 | Playtime: 6h 33m | Rec: Positive] Great game filled to the brim with replayability but not perfect. Atmosphere? great. Writing? Generally great but as time has gone on, the plot feels like its more secondary. I couldnt give you much on why Marie does all these missions and after Belgrade im not sure what the plot is anymore honestly.  Fuck Belgrade.  Every other level has so many options to choose for how you play, and then theres Belgrade. Saves? Hardly existent. Supplies? Comically limited. Do you enjoy random scene swaps? Enemies with buggy hitboxes? An elevator that doesnt work? Empty shelves and lockers and empty rooms for no reason? No health kits so every last bit of damage you take can be a run ruiner? ON TOP OF AGAIN, HARDLY ANY SAVES. Worst level by far, which makes me glad that other levels open up just by interacting with previous ones so you can just skip ones like this worthless 'horror' level thats only scare is being stuck in it because your last save sets you back up to an hour.   Great game otherwise but the game should let you carry items mission to mission or otherwise let you spend some cash for a starting loudout since...you're a mercenary. Why is there no holdouts per level? Why are all your bodymods also forgotten? I hope the final product gives more consistency for the gear and narrative, especially with most levels having choices to make with different characters! Except Belgrade of course!  Did I mention I hate Belgrade?
[Date: 2025-03-10 | Playtime: 25h 23m | Rec: Positive] Being a Schizotypal vvisard is basically a cheat code for this game...  UPDATE; I was unsure as to how I would beat the final level, and surely enough it revealed itself to me in a dream during my tumultuous slumber.
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 26h 33m | Rec: Positive] half chaotic gunfights and half moody atmospheric open ended exploration, this game is a wonderful dissociative fever dream. it made my heart melt, it made me angry, it made me cry several times. i never stopped having fun (yes, even in That Level). i am SO excited to see what's in store in future content. also I adore Marie, i love the tired alcoholic sassy cyberdoll and I want to give her a big hug and 500 cigarettes
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 10h 0m | Rec: Positive] fun :)
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 93h 0m | Rec: Positive] [h1]Early access, so I kinda expected tons of issues and bugs[/h1] [b]Breakcore + 90s graphics + immersive sim + jank[/b] has a soft spot in my heart I'd rate this game 9/10 for an early access, there's already quite a bit of content and it's been a really fun experience so far  The world of Peripeteia is really immersive, allowing for a large variety of entries and navigation to each level, except for a particular level that was more frustrating than immersive ([i]yes that one[/i]). Every level can be replayed and you'll almost always have new discoveries each time you run it back  Unapologetic from their art style to the environments to NPC dialogues to the storyline, you're thrown into a world of randomness and chaos, or however you describe it to be. I found it to be a garbled mess, actually more of a garbled bless; a masterpiece where a game is so sincere and genuine it's tough to find faults in its faults.   If there's ever a needle in a haystack, this game is the one Can't wait to see what's in store for future updates (I'll probably speed run the game while waiting for new content [spoiler]and enjoy Kasia's company <3[/spoiler])
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 11h 18m | Rec: Positive] все нрав все крут, атмосфера ВОО! Погружение пойдет! было бы все более интуитивно, это у меня пол жизни в подобном геймдеве пропало, но умоляю, давайте я куплю авторам курс по левел дизайну...
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 23h 1m | Rec: Positive] Very promising Early Access so far! I'm really looking forward to the full release!
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 0h 50m | Rec: Positive] I love this game, I do. Its level design is inspired and massive, the weapons are punchy both ways and it makes combat feel fast and dangerous. The real only thing I have to complain about is a specific quest where you have to drag an object from one end of the map to the other, with the path back being almost inaccessibly difficult from what I can tell. I might just be going the wrong way but it's enough of a roadblock that I'm paused indefinatly for the time being.
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 12h 16m | Rec: Positive] Absolute Kino.   The mechanics, inventory, setting, visuals, and characters are all handled wonderfully. Granted, that handling is some of most unorthodox and quirky that I've seen in any game, especially one made in 2025, but that shows that there are devs on the other side that actually care about what they're putting out. Peripeteia has SOUL, a rare thing in modern gaming. I especially admired the gargantuan levels and towering architecture, scale I've only really seen in E.Y.E or panels of Blame!  Bugs are pretty common, like floating gurneys and crates, or characters holding cigarettes 2 feet over their heads, or the enemies in Belgrade unloading their entire mags from floating guns AFTER i've shot them dead! However, none of these caused enough grief to overcome the entertainment value and i'm sure the game will continue to be polished (hehe).  As a long time fan of the cyberpunk genre, Alita Battle Angel, Ghost in the Shell, Stalker Series, Immersive sim genre, and just about any game where you can play as a robotic anime girl, Peripeteia fuses its inspirations masterfully into a cup of tea that I didn't know I needed, but it's MY cup of tea for sure.  Would recommend. Looking forward to the full release. 
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 14h 27m | Rec: Positive] Get lost. No seriously, get lost in this game. You will want to explore every nook and cranny seeing if there's a goodie, some obscure thing to do, or secrets to find that either enhance or expand your experience with it. Genuinely take your time poking and prodding around in the levels as I spent about 4 hours just exploring it and doing all the missions and spots I found. Gunplay is nice, headshots feel gratifying. Use of augments and managing them through the stage to achieve your goal is nice just dont forget to turn them off. Music is ambience at times and in certain spots breakcore that starts with an initial loop that doesn't cut until the full extent of the song until you've been found or go loud if you've been sneaking around. There's a bunch of little details to pay attention to and overall this game is great just for only five stages being available right now with more to come soon.
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 109h 42m | Rec: Positive] Fun to explore and very immersive but please fix the inventory bugs!
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 11h 53m | Rec: Positive] Very cool concept, I really like the aesthetics, however I got lost very often idk if it was the level design or just me, but It felt like I was starting certrtain mission from the middle, I was talking to the npc that mentioned something major only to find out that I shoud've found it eariler in the level. I really liked the inventory system however I needed to get used to it. The only ability I used was the mobility enchancement one, I didn't found the rest very useful, maybe the nightvision from time to time. Overall pretty good game, it kept me engaged until the end of the currently available levels so that's a plus. I has some bugs related to saves and inventory so my advice would be to hard save very often. Definetely something to check out if you dig the aesthetics and the imsim nature of this game.
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 23h 44m | Rec: Positive] All copies of Peripeteia is personalised
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 27h 31m | Rec: Positive] Quite an experience. EYE devs got lost in the games workslop mines so this will have to do in any case. First and only good hacking minigame in the history of interactive entertainment. Manual ammo and magazine management immerses you in the role of a psychopathic spree-murderer before you even pull a trigger. It's ok because Marie's cute. My gut tells me the developers will never actually finish this game. Maybe don't buy it yet.
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 2h 50m | Rec: Positive] If you really enjoy older early 90s - 2000s game directions, art and level design, with a modern twist, then yeah this is the game for you.

[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 4h 58m | Rec: Positive] Я прошёл путь от ненависти до абсолютной любви и превознесения. Сперва меня отпугнуло огромное количество багов, отвратительная техническая реализация вообще всего, что происходит на экране, но с третьего уровня я прозрел, а Белград стал вершиной любви. Если оценивать её объективно как потребительский продукт, конечно же, это просто кошмар, игра буквально УСЛОВНО играбельная и я постоянно спрашивал себя: "А это точно так было задумано или это опять баг?". Вообще подобных проблемных игр, даже очень амбициозных в раннем доступе очень много, и крайне разочаровывает  наблюдать как они либо загибаются либо релизятся недоделанными [spoiler]Привет Shadows of Doubt[/spoiler] Почему же тогда абсолютная любовь? Вы помните эмоции, которые у вас вызывали ваши первые любимые игры в раннем детстве? Скорее всего было чувство погружения, нравилось разбираться как работают механики, было интересно заниматься исследованием и представлять себя в роли первооткрывателя, казалось что игра какая-то "НАСТОЯЩАЯ". Тогда еще мы не знали таких умных слов как гейм/лвл/саунд и прочие дизайны, да и сами разработчики их не знали, а делали как понимали и как получается. Не было никаких стандартов качества да и вообще стандартов технического устройства. Когда же они появились, а я играл во множество других игр я стал понимать как они работают, магия пропала, а новые игры могли уже цеплять разве что историей.А теперь я столкнулся с игрой, которая просто шлёт на три буквы почти всё к чему я привык.Я бы сказал, что это роднит её например с Вангерами. Я буквально заново учился играть и понимать как устроена игра и мои ожидания постоянно ломались, а мне подкидывали сюрпризы и чем дальше я продвигался тем приятнее они становились.  А как вам такое? В любой другой похожей, но отполированной игре использование багов в обычном прохождении я бы посчитал за читерство и найдя оные не стал бы использовать, потому что это ломает иМмЕрСиВнОсТь и вообще раздражает, думаю большинство считает так же, но здесь же из за смывания границ багов с механиками ты их используешь по полной, потому что йоу какая игра такие и правила, черт его знает это ты великое открытие сейчас сделал или сломал игру? А потом внезапно ты попадаешь в ситуации, в которых игра как будто вынуждает тебя их использовать, а это уже в свою очередь офигенно дополняет эту самую иммерсивность, даже с сеттингом неплохо вяжется, гениально же черт возьми. А после неприязни к визуалу и саунду я познал извращенное торжество лоуфая. Я не знаю как пойдёт разработка дальше и будут ли разработчики полировать её до блеска, но я считаю, что в текущем виде со всеми недостатками она идеальна именно в нём, жду продолжения. По поводу Белграда: [spoiler] Я считаю, что у любых иммерсив симов главное проклятие и благословение это возможность спама сейвлоуда. О какой вообще иммерсивности может быть речь по определению, когда ты можешь не беспокоиться ни о чем в принципе и принимать самые отбитые решения по прохождению, если нажмешь F5? Вы тогда скажете, так просто не сохраняйся! Но  ведь с другой стороны если возможность игроку дана, значит идёт рассчет на её использование, а значит от вас хотят, чтобы вы здесь и сейчас попробовали всё, что игра может предложить, потому что, ОГО, ЭТО БЛИН ВЕСЕЛО и не многим хочется проходить огромный уровень по 10 раз, чтобы всё это узнать. Так вот добавить один такой уровень с сохранениями а-ля дарксолс это был очередной приятный сюрприз. В совокупности с хоррорной приправой, нечестными конченными противниками и общей забагованностью игры, я испытал такой адреналин, какой не испытывал от игр уже очень давно. Чтоб вы понимали, в первом прохождении я ЧЕТЫРЕ ЧАСА на миллиметре хп спускался до самого днища, где тюрьма, не нашел ни одного сейврума и пал жертвой гениального лвлдизайна, попав в комнату из которой было никак не выбраться. А перезагрузившись я нашёл ещё СТОЛЬКО ВСЯКОЙ ИНТЕРЕСНОЙ ХЕРНИ, которой я пропустил, что меня было уже не оторвать. Прочитав отрицательные отзывы, я пришел к выводу, что люди больше всего жалуются, что вынуждены проходить один и тот же эпизод десятки раз и вообще не понял. Чуваки, это епт ИММЕРСИВ СИМ, где вы можете попробовать множество других путей, это так, просто напоминаю. Но всё же, конечно лучше было бы если это был дополнительный необязательный уровень типа длс, потому что он создает ненужный скиллгейт, да и вообще на любителя такие приколы.[/spoiler] КОРОЧЕ Если вы любитель олдскульных иммерсив симов да и вообще древних игр- это мастплэй. Если у вас "игровая импотенция" - думаю Перипетия поможет вам. Если вы любитель андеграунд пабликов со всратыми аТмОсФеРнЫмИ картинками всяких там дрим/хyим/коров и линолиумных пространств - это золотая жила Остальным соболезную.
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 20h 20m | Rec: Positive] Saw the trailer for this game way back in like 2020 when I was going through a big sewerslvt phase. Obviously the use of Mr Kill Myself in the trailer drew me in so I decided to wishlist it. But it pretty much went in the back of my mind since then. Occasionally I'd see the odd repost of trailer online or in various discord servers. It wasn't until January of this year that I started seeing people talk about it again cause it was finally going into early access. After like 5 years of waiting I kind of just assumed it was never going to come out. But having now played it I'm honestly so glad to finally have been able to experience Peripeteia.  As many other people have said the atmosphere of Peri is probably its strongest part. The environments along with the fucking amazing OST always add to this somber melancholic feel. Exploring these empty old megastructures with some soft atmospheric dnb playing in the background literally never got old for me. The sewerslvt music adds to that melancholy  a lot for me since I find her music to be pretty nostalgic. It really gives every environment such a haunting feel. I saw many negative reviews for the game say that exploration of these big empty areas was a bore but I really cant agree. The atmosphere of the game makes exploring every area of the game feel engaging to me. Even if there is not some reward at the end of some gritty old hallway, just walking through it felt like an interesting experience all on its own.  The characters too felt very well realized. I often found myself trying to choose the path that would cause some of the characters the least suffering. The setting really adds to the empathy you feel for the characters who seem to be struggling more. Especially so with the intermittent interactions you can have with a certain girl in the level select apartment. I'm very excited to see where things will go with her in the full release. Every interaction with her and Marie was adorable. Though even if the characters were good I did find myself struggling to follow the story a bit lol. It is very easy to miss a lot of crucial information as to what is going on in the greater narrative.   Ironically don't have all that much to say in terms of the gameplay. I see a lot of people complain about the jank but I didn't have much trouble with it personally. I found the gunplay to be pretty satisfying (espcially with the bullet time augment). The tetris inventory system is a gameplay feature i've enjoyed in like every game its featured in. And the need to unload ammo from every gun to put it into specific magazines was honestly fun for me too. That sorta stuff made for some really fun resource management. Though I do get how some people could be annoyed with it after a while.   Overall I honestly really enjoyed my time with the early access and I'm super excited to see how the full release goes. This is definitely already one of my favorite games I've played this year.

[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 1h 41m | Rec: Positive] A fun, immersive game with a cool story. Gameplay (Shooting) is okay... not much to talk about it. However, it more about the way you approach and interact with the environment. You can hide, slow time and control people which can switch up how you play.   Also, the fact that it's not a linear story, the ability to choose your own path is what really sold it for me. There is no illusion of choice in this game, the actions you do, the choices you make impact how the story will go and that's so cool (for me anyway).  Once bugs are ironed out, and there are some pretty major bugs that can hardlock a play-through, it'll be a really enjoyable experience.
[Date: 2025-03-08 | Playtime: 11h 49m | Rec: Negative] Я было хотел даже порекомендовать эту игру, несмотря на все баги, несмотря на отвратительный дизайн локаций и местами вырвиглазную картинку, но случилось оно... [spoiler]Белград[/spoiler]. Это просто треш, такое чувство, что я половину игры проходил только одно это место. И его структура просто нечто, есть верхушка с кучей опасных врагов и вот там где-то 4 безопасные комнаты, а ниже этого просто бесконечная дыра в никуда, только врагов ещё больше, и без комнат. А, ещё, кстати, без патронов [spoiler](они с врагов в этом месте не сыпятся, надеяться не стоит)[/spoiler].  Короче, именно эта часть игры вывела в абсолют, всё что было до этого, причем, в плохом смысле.  И именно из-за этой огроменной ложки дёгтя я не могу её порекомендовать, лучше подождать полноценного релиза, авось разрабы залатают дыры в игре
[Date: 2025-03-08 | Playtime: 5h 13m | Rec: Positive] this game screams mood and atmosphere, rough and gritty in most aspects but in a way that seems to work for it more than against it, i saved someones robot daughter and hopefully i can have legal guardian rights to her as well, great soundtrack and the way you can move around the levels feels fresh, it also has tarkov-esque inventory management with similar weapons + gunplay, i love poland.

[Date: 2025-03-08 | Playtime: 32h 35m | Rec: Positive] Задумавшись, я понял, что я убил столько человек ради 2300 злотых, серебряных ложек и часов. Хотя мог бы просто забить хер. И никого не убивать. Но я же все сделал тихо… и стандартно.  В целом мне игра очень понравилась, прям какая-то ностальгия по старым ночным картам из кс 1.6 типа backalley и зомби режима, музыка класс(только мейдкора и черниковской хаты не хватает, хотя кто мешает самому на фон поставить). Судя по 5-й миссии в игре можно вполне реализовать очень большую единую локацию, подумал что есть ограничения движка раз так локации по миссиям режутся без возможности реализации полноценного открытого мира, надеюсь такие будут.  Если исправить освещение на картах, улучшить ИИ противников и добавить побольше побочных квестов будет имба.

[Date: 2025-03-08 | Playtime: 16h 6m | Rec: Positive] Пока что жесть корявая, но очень хорошая в плане атмосферы, квестов и механик. Давно не играл в такие игры и мне очень нравится. К тому же, наконец-то мы дожили, что в игре есть реально треки северстали и вперемешку с сеттингом получается очень затягивающая комбинация, которая заставляет тебя эксплорить эти огромные локации и пялиться на атмосферные виды.   Отметить конечно можно, что по наполнению эти локации страдают сейчас, этот эксплоринг часто ничем не окупается, но всё-таки ранний доступ, а поэтому я надеюсь, что игра выйдет из раннего доступа аки очередной инди-гем, который будет популярен в очень узком круге аудитории. Хочу добавки и буду ждать, пока что очень хорошо.

[Date: 2025-03-08 | Playtime: 1h 55m | Rec: Positive] A lot of the usual "tuber game reviewer" style comments in these other reviews. i know the devs are saying this is based on looking glass-styled games, but im not seeing it. i have no idea what this game is or what its supposed to be. i think ive managed to find maybe 5 NPCs in my 90 minute playthrough thus far. the rest has been spent trying to reach the bottom of the city. It seems like the devs purposefully made a lot of the in-game materials (whatever Unity calls them) ugly, and a lot of the building meshes are purposefully... wrinkly? Like you purposefully have to go out of your way to subdivide and then sculpt a surface that should be flat (look at certain windows closely).  I think comparisons to other games and trying to categorize whatever this is kinda sells it short. It's unapologetic about deliberate design choices and kind of understands what it is. usually devs fall down the rabbit hole and end up trying too hard to be smart when its not always necessary. this whole thing kind of feels like a Serial Experiments Lain fan got a degree in graphic design, and then attempted to build an entire game without realizing they would eventually need to write custom code not covered by youtube tutorials.  its a definite buy if youre looking for a game that doesnt seem to care if you entirely miss whatever point its trying to make, gameplay or otherwise. i cant remember the last time a game had the balls to let me run down a hallway or up a staircase for two minutes, completely gambling on whether or not there will be some kind of reward at the end of it outside of the general decency to make sure its properly textured/closed off. or sometimes its just a staircase that throws you out of the bottom of a skyscraper. i also killed a girl and unplugged her fathers iron lung or something at some point. sometimes i dont want to sit through cutscenes or feel like im "missing out on quests and content" by not checking the log. some of us want to be able to do what we want when "new game" is pressed. let me have my "Soulja Boy Plays Braid" moment.  this probably all sounds condescending but at this point, if a game can keep my attention and surprise me like this, i cant *not* recommend it. its sincere- whatever it is.

[*]Исследования показывают, что игра находится на раннем доступе, что может означать наличие багов, но она получает положительные отзывы.     [*]Вероятно, игроки находят её забавной благодаря механикам, таким как лазание и хакерство, которые иногда приводят к комичным ситуациям. [/list]  [hr][/hr]  [h3]Обзор игры[/h3] [b]Введение в Peripeteia[/b] Peripeteia — это игра, сочетающая в себе элементы шутера, стелса и RPG, с возможностью переключения между первым и третьим лицом. Она вдохновлена классическими играми от Ion Storm и Looking Glass Studios, такими как System Shock, и предлагает оригинальный сеттинг: альтернативная история киберпанковской Польши. Вы играете за Мари, кибернетического суперсолдата и наёмника, которая действует в постсоветском городе, полном коррупции и возможностей.  [b]Игровой процесс и механики[/b] Игра предлагает широкий выбор стилей игры: вы можете красться, чтобы избежать обнаружения, или идти напролом, используя огневую мощь. Механика лазания позволяет Мари карабкаться практически на любые поверхности, что добавляет свободы в исследовании, но иногда приводит к забавным багам, например, застреванию в неожиданных местах. Хакерство представлено простым мини-игрой с соединением проводов, которая может неожиданно сработать или, наоборот, вызвать тревогу. RPG-элементы включают улучшение навыков Мари и управление инвентарём, что добавляет глубины игровому процессу.  [b]Юмор и отзывы игроков[/b] На основе доступной информации, игроки находят Peripeteia забавной благодаря её несовершенствам, особенно в раннем доступе. Например, один игрок отметил, как Мари застряла на карнизе, что выглядело как комедийный момент, а другой посмеялся над тем, как охранники иногда не замечают персонажа, даже стоя рядом. Отзывы также подчёркивают атмосферу: зелёный свет, серый дым и редкие прохожие создают мрачный, но захватывающий киберпанковский мир.  [b]Технические аспекты и потенциал[/b] Игра находится на раннем доступе, что означает возможные баги, такие как нестабильный интерфейс или проблемы с анимацией. Однако сообщество активно обсуждает игру, и разработчики, кажется, реагируют на обратную связь. На [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1437760/Peripeteia/]Steam[/url] она имеет рейтинг "Очень положительно" (90% положительных отзывов из 627), что указывает на высокий потенциал.  [b]Неожиданный факт[/b] Интересно, что сеттинг в Польше — редкость для киберпанка, и игроки шутят о польских культурных отсылках, таких как упоминания пирогов или польских денег (злотых), которые можно "заработать", грабя врагов.

Однако сообщество активно обсуждает игру на [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/1437760/discussions/]Steam Discussions[/url], что указывает на вовлечённость разработчиков.  [h3]Культурные особенности и неожиданные детали[/h3] Неожиданно, что сеттинг в Польше — редкость для киберпанка. Игроки шутят о польских культурных отсылках, например, о том, как можно "заработать злотые" (польские деньги) грабя врагов, и представляют, что NPCs говорят что-то вроде "Твои пироги сгорели!" на польском, добавляя юмора.  [h3]Заключение[/h3] Peripeteia предлагает уникальный опыт с комичными моментами, особенно благодаря багам и механикам в раннем доступе. Игроки находят её забавной, несмотря на несовершенства, и ждут улучшений в финальной версии. Сеттинг в Польше и киберпанковская атмосфера делают игру выделяющейся, а отзывы показывают, что она имеет высокий потенциал для фанатов жанра.

[Date: 2025-03-08 | Playtime: 5h 57m | Rec: Positive] Sewerslvt and System ST91 in a game soundtrack is an auto win. I even suck at this game, but in the Stalker sort of way where it's understandable and fun. Looking forward to future updates!
[Date: 2025-03-08 | Playtime: 30h 52m | Rec: Positive] The Good: Peropeteia aims for a very niche "vibe" with its post-soviet cyberpunk grunge anime aesthetic and it nails it. I'm not even particularly interested in the subject but I could not help but get sucked into it. The 2D art from graffiti and UI is both cute and a little unnerving. The sound quality and mixing is a bit poor -though this could be intentional to again nail the 'old-school' aesthetic- but the music especially can really help environments pop. I was intrigued by the story and setting and did eventually -despite some hang ups- complete the game. Dialogue can be funny yet grounded and several NPCs are memorable.  The Mid:  The gun sound effects are... serviceable. The shooting is only OK and while there are a few different abilities you can find and use, I never found any besides the ones you start with to be particularly useful. The options are nice, though. The game doesn't hold your hand and can be incredibly vague when giving directions or mission objectives; a positive or negative, depending on your view. You can get lost exploring, remember you have a mission to complete, and get lost trying to backtrack. The maps are sprawling, or at least feel that way -you will be spending a lot of time walking and jumping to get from one area to the next. Sightseeing during these segments varies from jaw dropping to sleep inducing. There is decent player choice for [i] MOST [/i] of the missions, although not as much freedom as you might at first think.  The Bad: Jank. Incredibly high numbers of jank. Enemies move in odd ways, and saying they have an AI is being generous. You can often find ways out of the map without meaning to. I've had a bug that prevents guns from shooting several times. Spoilers: [spoiler] Tanks in the 3rd mission clearly have treads but move in every direction. It's actually hilarious when a tank spots you and just sort of hovers in your direction. [/spoiler] The sound mixing, as previously mentioned, can reach hilariously low troughs; [spoiler] A monstrous enemy in a hidden area screams, but the ear-splitting sound can be heard through walls not connected to that area leading to a very surreal and confusing experience. Given its proximity to certain surrealist memes, the sound is also just a bit funny; I think it's unintentional but I'm not completely certain since there are some "memes" playing on the TVs scattered around the same map. [/spoiler] Sometimes dialogue and scripted events can replay when they're not supposed to, such as a mission update when you've already completed it... which replays every time you interact with that NPC or cross that invisible area boundary. All of these combined can rip you out of the experience or, in the worst cases, make the game unplayable. Save frequently and be prepared for jank shit to happen.  Overall? At $25 the price is a little high, but it's an incredibly niche game. If you want post soviet anime half life set in Poland then have at it. The Demo is incredibly generous, and so I recommend playing that first if you're on the fence. I leave a recommend, but strongly suggest playing the Demo first.
[Date: 2025-03-07 | Playtime: 11h 52m | Rec: Positive] Ive played through all 5 missions.   I really enjoyed my time in the game, mostly because of the level design and the art direction. Combat is really nice for a indie game, i liked stealth and normal pvp as well.  All 5 missions are really nice, all of them felt unique, belgrad is probably my favourite, it has a bit different vibe and save system is disabled (it works really well there). My only problem with missions was weird completion trigger in belgrad, not sure if it was intended? i unlucked 5th mission by just jumping around pretty much, didnt feel like i got anything done there when it unlocked.  elevators, edge grabbing, walking on catwalks and pipes works really well.  I didnt really use energy/ augments much except for nvg in first and 2nd mission. All weapons ive used felt nice, melee especially. inventory works nice as well and doesnt feel like a chore.  I hope that next missions that will come will also keep up to the level of the initial 5.

[Date: 2025-03-07 | Playtime: 32h 34m | Rec: Positive] This game will become a future speedrunner's staple. Just beat early access and it was a difficult but rewarding experience. There are some issues with lighting in some areas and some enemies being ridiculous, but I enjoyed it. There is only one level that feels crazy and you'll know it when you see it, but don't skip it because it is something else. You can cheese all the levels if you know where to go, but exploring and getting lost is part of the fun in this game.

[Date: 2025-03-07 | Playtime: 19h 53m | Rec: Positive] Cool sim, reminds of thos good ol' days of E.Y.E. and Deus Ex, lots of early 2YK open-world feelings all over the place coming back to me again while exploring the almost empty worlds, what a beautifully haunting sensation.   Lotsa potential, a true diamond in the rough, I expect to see the final result!
[Date: 2025-03-07 | Playtime: 9h 28m | Rec: Negative] i heavily enjoy inventory tetris and shooting people with items in said inventory and this game has alot of both, as of right now peripeteias honestly very enjoyable but i cant reccomend it simply because of the bugs (invincible enemies, items getting deleted on reload) and lack of an autosave which make the game very un-enjoyable at times, not even mentioning the ai which is honestly borderline brain dead and will either beam you or walk up to you, breathe in your face, and then move on because they didn't aggro  if you can look past these flaws however you get a very well made immersive sim with a LOT of guns (im four hours into the first mission which I haven't even completed yet because theres so much to explore and i am STILL finding new guns), good gunplay, and a fun to explore map  on a side note after finishing the first level and coming back to the review ill mention that there is no carrying over items between levels besides some stuff, its definitely not something that kills the enjoyment for me but I do wish you could stock up guns, if that sounds like something you dont enjoy then keep that in mind
[Date: 2025-03-07 | Playtime: 0h 14m | Rec: Positive] I played this for 14 minutes before closing it and telling myself to reopen it if i'm ever on acid. Would recommend.
[Date: 2025-03-07 | Playtime: 18h 6m | Rec: Positive] TL;DR lovingly janky and excellent game. 11/10 would recommend or whatever.  I think if I were to try and describe this game in the briefest manner possible that is still at least roughly informative of the kind of experience you can anticipate it would be Deus Ex set in dystopic Sci-Fi Poland with a healthy bit of the Bible and anime for seasoning (you're gonna be reading a lot of dialogue about communism, impoverishment, religion, and identity).  If you have played most any game that bills itself as an "Immersive Sim" (a very wonky genre category IMO) you will be immediately familiar with all the basic stuff, but this game most closely resembles the original Deus Ex in format - you run around a sandbox environment that has one major mission questline for you to follow, a smattering of side objectives, and a plethora of strange oddities and secrets to play around with.  One of the most distinct elements of this game that needs to be brought up immediately is the climbing mechanics - Marie cannot just climb up and down a ladder, rather most surfaces that look like they could be a ledge of some kind act as grab points that Marie will automatically latch to, and you have to press Crouch to drop down or Jump to climb up. This feels odd and  unintuitive at first, but once you get the hang of it you start looking at environments very different - level geometry with any kind of outcropping whatsover becomes a possible point of entry for a parkour adventure, and this means that you will rapidly find yourself clambering across the level architecture and getting quite incredibly lost in these absolutely MASSIVE environments and wandering. The design of the areas is such that it is incredibly hard to tell when your acrobatic antics have led you down an intended point of progression or if you have somehow circumnavigating a good chunk of the level on accident by just following your insticts to climb around (you can get away with A LOT in this game with careful use of one of your basic augs which boosts your movement).  Which brings me to my next point - the size of the maps is colossal, and they are desolate. In the first level you will likely wander into a nearby stairwell very rapidly that lets you physically run up and down all 40-something flights of stairs (I didn't count precisely - but it's a lot) to reach the bottom or the top of the current structure, and maybe about 5 of those floors have anything interesting in them (an odd NPC or one of many possible points of traversal into the Planetarium area). You'll get a feel for the kind of scale you're in pretty fast, and if I were to guess it will likely feel very sparse and at times even insultingly devoid of interesting points of interaction coming from more modern gaming sensibilities. I found myself deeply intrigued by the way it was possible to just get completely lost in this game world without ever feeling a total sense of loss of progress - it can be hard to find your way to points of interest due to the vagueness of directions and the sheer amount of level geometry available (oftentimes a cardinal direction and an insinuating of what kind of building you are looking for is all you get), but even if your mission isn't advancing per se there always seems to be odd nooks and crannies to make you feel a sense of reward for having bothered to climb the side of a skyscraper (up or down), even if it is just a dumpster with some ammo and a health fuse.  That being said as much as I love the sandbox environments of this game and the rules for traversal this game definitely isn't gonna be for everyone - it is quite janky in its' present state, and unless you are already accustomed to games that remain strangely playable even as they spontaneously combust trigger this will be a harsh vibe check. Dialogue trees you have already witnessed in particular will reoccur (sometimes many several times) if you happen to find another possible way to trigger it after having already done so. This hasn't yet impeded completion of a level, but even though I say it with love the truth is currently mission progression can and will most likely break on you on at least one level as the way events and flags are checked appears to be kind of a mess.  This can be especially frustrating in Mission 4 which prevents you from being able to save anywhere due to narrative reasons, and at present this seems to be the level with the most mixed reception so far. I think this map is brilliant personally, but I am also very patient. Even so discovering I had accidentally locked myself out of one possible ending event due to the way I chose to progress through the level was a bit of a downer (despite having dropped both the counterweights before my first time meeting the Hind the option to end the mission through it was never offered, nor was it offered once I climbed back up after beating the boss encounter).  It's worth noting reloading your save does does not, in fact, always reset the game conditions back to the way the save was when you made it - one NPC in particular had apparently been wandering for the entire hour I was playing Mission 1 and locating him took a very long yime as I had not yet figured out what had happened. I quickly discovered that returning to the main menu and then loading a save was the most reliable thing to do as otherwise enemy positions, aggro, and dialogue flags can in fact get com  Also ammo is *sparse* and guns are finnicky - you are expected to manually unload guns for their ammunition and be careful about how you make use of it. Not unreasonably or even particularly difficult, but plenty of guns full of perfectly good ammo have flown straight out of my hands and into the abyss due to the wonkiness of the physics. This is fucking hilarious to me, but might drive some people insane so I suppose it is worth mentioning. The game systems are nominally functional - as long as you can handle the fact that they will misbehave regularly you will be in for a good time.  And with that I think all of the most relevant bits of info to give about this game have been said - everything else you will be immediately familiar and at home with if you have ever played a late 90's or early 00's immersive sim of some kind. I love this game so much. <3<3<3<3

[Date: 2025-03-06 | Playtime: 13h 24m | Rec: Positive] An odd but heartfelt love-letter to games like Deus Ex and Stalker, Peripeteia has an amazing atmosphere and an intriguing protagonist. The worldbuilding is excellent with a unique-feeling setting in post-apocalyptic Poland, history trickling down to inform factions and individuals alike as you talk to them and decide who to support or backstab for your own gains. There are several ways to handle the very open levels you may stumble into, which may come as a welcome surprise in this hand-holding age. Combat is surprisingly well-handled and the cybernetics are an interesting challenge for your inventory-management skills. There is one level I think needs reworking and one or two combat encounters as well otherwise the game is fascinating and I look forward to the new levels both for the gameplay and the story. If you enjoy darker survival games with harder combat and resource management and love grid-based inventories and dialogue options with slavs, give this a chance and it'll hook you.

[Date: 2025-03-06 | Playtime: 15h 1m | Rec: Positive] An excellent (jank) doomer-Y2K-immersive sim that combines the feel of both Deus Ex and E.Y.E. in a pretty unique way.  You will never know where you're going or what exactly you're doing however the sheer scale and sights along the way will more than make up for it, I swear you could fit the entirety of Skyrim in most of these levels.  Your enjoyment of this game is entirely dependent on three things: how mentally ill you are, the exact point of the spectrum you're on, and whether or not you're lainpilled.  lets all love hallway girl

[Date: 2025-03-05 | Playtime: 31h 49m | Rec: Positive] First off, I really enjoyed the game overall. Found myself getting lost on accident and intentionally and most of the time, I'd stumble upon something new while doing so. Game is mind boggling in size especially after the first two levels.  First two levels feel a little more straight forward and easy to navigate while still providing plenty of opportunities to explore different ways to navigate, pretty good for learning the ropes. Third level really opens up and is what really hooked me.  Fair warning; fourth level is going to probably turn people off. This level takes the RE approach, only allowing you to save in "safe rooms." This prevents you from exploring with trial and error savescumming, which can really drag this level out way longer. I understand that the intention is to create tension, but I think the level design and the horror elements do that well enough. However, once you've got the way through figured out, it's not too bad, but that first playthrough is going to be rough for most people.  Fifth and currently final level is somehow even bigger, but a bit tough at first since your gear doesn't transfer from level to level, but if you explore enough, you'll find an easy way to progress and get some gear. Seeing how augments CAN transfer from level to level, I'm sure guns, ammo, and food/health items will be transferable in a future update.  There's a lot of jank here, but I didn't encounter anything that hindered my progress. It's REALLY easy to sequence break if you are like me and spend more time exploring than going straight to objectives. There's a lot of different weapons and mechanics to utilize, so no two playthroughs are going to be alike. I managed to miss a lot of things in this game, making this worth replaying and I think that replayability is a huge positive this game has.  Edit: I've replayed the first two levels and there's a TON of stuff I missed. Still, they seem to be made in a way to make a first time playthrough pretty easy. I didn't really get lost by mistake in them.

Any extra abilities you find are also taken with you, so you keep those too.   Now, the game itself - amazing. The first mission genuinely surprised me with how many ways I could complete it, and my favourite was, the best way, was also the most difficult , making it extra rewarding. Honestly, a fantastic game so far and worth every penny , for me at least. If you like Deus Ex, I would also recommend it, though do remember this game is still doing its own thing and is not a clone, so do not go in expecting the exact same experience.
[Date: 2025-03-04 | Playtime: 22h 41m | Rec: Negative] Игра была замечательной, интересной и вкусной ровно до Белграда, с него началась лютая дичь. Первые три миссии приучили игрока, что надо лицом исследовать вообще всю локацию, ведь так можно найти много чего интересного и полезного, но на четвёртой тяга игрока к исследованию обрубается отсутствием возможности сохраняться где ему вздумается, таким образом порождая проблему - Любая ошибка стоит времени.  И ладно это всего 5 минут, но ты можешь потратить 50 минут и умереть от... Правильно, резко перекрученного баланса в сторону противников, очень приятно погибать когда ты просто не можешь не дать отпора, не предсказать, что за углом противник, а Белград так-то весь такой, один неверный шаг - откат на далёкий сейв, решил пропрыгать в какое-то интересное место, молодец, но если назад невозмжно не вернуться - откат на далёкий сейв. И так всё на этом уровне, его прохождение утыкается в бесконечное ковыряние с запоминанием всех ловушек которые ждут на пути. Лично я в какой-то момент поставил Бепин и поверх накатил мод с АссетЭксплорером, получив доступ к консоли, включил возможность сохраняться в любом месте, и включил возможность бесконечного прыжка. Я честно пытался пройти этот уровень честно, но моих сил хватило только на 4 часа. 4 часа _ОДИНАКОВОГО_ маршрута. После Белграда в пятой миссии происходит тоже непонятная дичь, так-то как и во всей игре, но тут это что-то концентрированное, просто непонятно что куда и как двигаться, непонятно как получить хоть какой-то результат,  благо без наказания в виде запрета на сохранения. Здесь тоже геймдизайн переходит границу дозволенного исполняя самую большую ошибку - он делает Много. Это проявляется в вертикальной башне с вентилятором, где в верхней части уровня, когда надо вызвать лифт спавнит штук 30 жирных противников без головы, которые впитывают урон как губка, это не сложность, если тебя заранее ставят в условия в которых ты ничего вообще никак не можешь противопоставить, пришлось через консоль отключать этих противников на всём уровне. На острове художников в какой-то момент спавнится дружественный персонаж Искандер, у которого здоровье выкручено в около-бессмертие и это умноженное на то, что вообще вся ветка его сюжета это фактически линейный коридор в котором тебя принудительно тащат за руку. В конечном итоге, пробегая его сюжет вышел на непонятную концовку с телепортом на какую-то станцию и был не слишком доволен.  Мой совет, первые 12 часов(3 уровня) в игре - самый сок, дальше в неё играть не стоит, либо ждите фиксов, либо сделайте вид, что игры дальше нету. Вы разочаруетесь, очень и очень сильно. Негативный отзыв исключительно из-за двух последних уровней.  upd: Чуть дополнил про пятую миссию.

I'm reviewing positively because I see the vision, and they've already built enough that it feels likely they'll make it out of EA.  There are many moments of great atmosphere, level design, and gameplay. It's like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. set in the E.Y.E. universe and I love it. But, there were also MANY "is this area not developed yet, or am I stupid and just not seeing where to go?" moments. In its current state, it demands a lot of patience.

[Date: 2025-03-04 | Playtime: 20h 50m | Rec: Positive] Peripeteia is a game that i've been looking forward to since early 2021, was it worth the wait? well.. first and foremost, it is not yet finished, this early access release comes with 5 levels, and two bonus modes, the full release is planned for early 2026, with maps coming out every few months in 2025 alongside some extra polish (i would assume?)  Is this early access worth the money? this is actually a lot harder to answer than you'd think, let me explain.  As this is a game that is heavily exploration focused, each level could take you anything from a few minutes to finish (if you know what you are doing,) to 5 or 6 hours each to find everything, i already spent countless hours in each demo build, so i speedran the levels i knew, and explored what was new, so my playtime would be exponentially larger if i had never played it before, so take that into account, i spent something of a total of 26 hours in the demos, let that sink in.  What does that mean? it means the levels are god damn massive, a lot of this is is empty space - empty space that is supposed to convey a unique vibe, you either get Peripeteia, or you don't, my recommendation would be to play the demo, if you like what you see or feel, you'll be seeing a lot more (of similar vein) in the full game.  Are there any negatives? well besides your regularly expected jank, one of the levels could do with a bit of an overhaul in places, if you know, you know, but generally speaking, i personally don't have much negative to speak on so far, since i'm already expecting that the devs are well aware of where the game shines, and where it doesn't, this is a passion project, and i trust that they will see their vision to the end.  What i can say is that i've never played anything quite like Peripeteia, not even their influences are completely similar, what i'm trying to say is that if you want to play something that'll blow your mind, give the game a try? or at least the demo? especially if you miss games that don't treat you like a braindead toddler, this one's for the 90's kids.  Best of luck to the devs, be seeing you in 1.0 in 2026!  Let's all love Marie, let's all love Peripeteia.   (TL;DR: try the game out if you want a game that gives you the freedom back to be a dumbass, and have fun finding things out on your own, with a lot of replay value to boot.)
[Date: 2025-03-04 | Playtime: 30h 47m | Rec: Positive] Kind of rough around the edges presently. Navigating maps can be a bit confusing at times, you can sequence break and softlock easily, some level geometry lacks polish and dialogue triggers seem to be unimplemented for now.  I've had a lot of fun playing this despite the general lack of polish, though. The gameplay mechanics are sublime, the ensemble of characters you encounter across Marie's journey are definitely colorful and the levels are a blast to explore despite their confusing layouts.  Would recommend.

If you love dystopian settings, robot anime girls, and freedom to do whatever you want pick it up.  This part below isn't really too necessary for the review but I felt like putting it in. If you wanna see me recall a quite memorable event in my playthrough view the spoilered text. [spoiler]It's also one of the few games in recent time that genuinely made me tweak at one of the oddest decisions I've decided to make while playing a game. So I was on the mission Karabash, and I had already accidentally killed 2 civilians so my mental was already all over the place. But I walk into the church a little farther into the factory and I meet the priest guy, I listen to him speak and he tells me his whole body is burnt and he can't feel anything anymore or something like that, and I finish our conversation. But after he turns around I pull out my rifle and shoot him in the back of the head. I have no clue what possessed me to do that, I still can't believe I did that. In summary the game is good :)[spoiler]
[Date: 2025-03-04 | Playtime: 3h 28m | Rec: Positive]  !!! READ THIS PLZ BEFORE BUYING !!!   If you want to know if this game is worth 25 dollars, I can tell you at the time of writing this review that it is NOT WORTH IT FOR MOST PEOPLE.   This game is 100% for you if you really like games that aspire to the cryptic and janky feel of shooters from the early 2000s. If you have played E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy and said to yourself "I love this weird ass game, why aren't there more games like this?" then this is precisely what you're looking for.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Now I would like to go into my own personal thoughts on the game. I love games like this. My friends send me steam links to games like these and call them "Yangeeshnu type games" specifically because I express so much fondness for these little oddities. All of my criticism comes from a deep love of this game and games like it.   This game is an immersive sim, similar to the aforementioned E.Y.E., Dark Messiah, Deus Ex, etc. I think this game pretty much covers the basics: Physics puzzles, parkour, shooting guys, the whole nine yards. I think that most people who play the game would also agree that it really nails the immersive part. The game is going for this kind of cyberpunk/neo-noir aesthetic with an Eastern Bloc twist. Many cultural references made in the dialogue will likely fly over most American's heads lol. Anyways, the music and environments definitely give off a dense atmosphere of nostalgia. Unlike many similar games I've played, its pretty purposeful. I cannot speak from personal experience about this phenomenon (I have no attachment to the related cultures), but there is a sort of longing for the days of the former Soviet Union that exists in the real world which Peripeteia is clearly calling on. Its pretty effective. There was obviously once a stable society somewhere in the rubble, and its unclear how the world itself is even functioning, but people live on day by day in the concrete hell of the city. It feels lonely and dangerous.   Despite the music being great, once the battle theme is on it just does not turn off. Please make it go away after there are no more enemies.   Let's talk gameplay. Gunplay is fine, and movement is serviceable. My only real gripe is that the jump is deeply unsatisfying. It feels like I'm hitting my head on air at the apex of my jump. Inventory management is a huge part of the game and its complicated. The process of preparing my inventory by unloading enemy weapons and filling individual mags with the collected ammunition is almost zen-like. It feels awesome to create your own little system inside the inventory grid. Why then, is my inventory subsequently emptied at the end of every mission? The apartment hub would be such a nice place to turn into my own little gun stash, slowly collecting and selling weapons between missions as a form of permanent progress. Maybe even spending that money on decorations? Seriously devs, these are the kinds of things that make the game go from "A" to "S rank gamer must play instant classic." It totally fits the dark cute vibes of the main character.   Lastly, I'd like to talk about the actual models in the game. I understand that this game literally JUST launched in to early access, and you'd be right to argue that ugliness contributes to the feel and look of the game, but I still would like to point out a few things. The characters are... Clannad-esque. I would appreciate if she maybe looked more determined or something, like how she is in the art. Her movements are also pretty goofy. Everything needs a lot of polish (LOL BUT ITS ALREADY IN POLAND) I mean that even with artistic liberties in consideration I would say level design and lighting need a complete overhaul at some point. Its not even a skill issue really, it would just be nicer if I could see the singular merchant in the Archology without having to utilize night vision implants (how tf does he get any business if he puts up no lights around his shop???) ANYWAY THANK YOU FOR READING MY TOTALLY COHESIVE REVIEW LOVE YOU BYE.

[Date: 2025-03-04 | Playtime: 12h 28m | Rec: Negative] Overall i think the game is honestly pretty good, but i cannot suggest it in it's current state.  The gameplay itself is enjoyable and all around pretty fun, but the missions themselves, whilst offering a lot of ways to approach objectives, tend to be mostly empty and bereft of anything worth exploring. There's A LOT of bugs. Some enemies vanish beyond invisible trigger boundaries, only to reappear when you cross them and instantly head-shot you. Not super fun. These are all things that will change with time, though.  Some of the audio design is straight up just ear piercing, and some triggers bug out and play at twice the volume they should when you aggro an enemy. That being said; some of this does actually add to the experience pretty well, but a lot of it doesn't. Music fading in and out inconsistently is also a bit jarring.  The Belgrade mission is genuinely one of the worst things I've ever played. This is really not a game that feels like it needs arbitrary difficulty injections in the form of 'not being able to save because its not safe', when I can otherwise quicksave in literal combat-zones filled with Communists and headless robots everywhere else. Thankfully you can beat this mission in about 1:06 if you speedrun it, which was the only saving grace for me at this point of the game - which is a shame, considering there's more to this mission. A lot more. It'd be nice to revisit someday when it's made less arbitrarily punishing.  The gunplay and weapon sway is essentially a simulated ragdoll it feels like, and overall isn't that pleasant to use - until you get one of the augments that improves your aiming. Then it's manageable - but I didn't find this until near the end of the current 1.0 experience. It's otherwise enjoyable enough to use. Each headshot feels pretty rewarding.  Augments being the only thing to carry over is nice, but them unequipping each level is a minor annoyance. The [spoiler]Puppeteer[/spoiler] augment didn't seem to work for me at all, despite trying it on every enemy I ran into.  The movement of the game is really, really nice, actually. The clambering and wall-hanging to drop down off of stuff is done well (even if sometimes it doesn't work as intended). However; climbing ladders in this game essentially requires you to do it inch by inch, smashing your jump button endlessly to climb. There's at least a few decently long ladders in this game, and it didn't make me feel like a Snake Eater. An option for auto-climbing or mantling would save me from arthritis.  The game's actual atmosphere is where it shines; gritty, dark, neo-soviet cyberpunk is an aesthetic I really love, and this game nails the vibe. Much of the low-poly architecture and world attribute a lot to it - and the Pip-Boy esque artworks for Marie are all really nice. Music choice is excellent (again, when it properly plays), and the low-res USSR-era videos playing on some of the maps, coupled with distant and ghostly loudspeaker music, all brings together an incredibly cohesive vision of a cyberpunk Poland.  All in all; it's a fine game in the making, but its currently pretty laborious to play through. Obviously needs polish, but I enjoyed what was there in the 12 or so hours I played (and what didn't outright break on me, like the [spoiler]Hind-D bossfight[/spoiler] immediately ending when it started). Definitely a lot to re-explore when the games in a better state - and whilst I do look forward to new levels? I hope the already existing ones are given polishing precedent first. They really need it.

[Date: 2025-03-04 | Playtime: 14h 2m | Rec: Positive] Наполнение миссий увеличивается с каждым новый уровнем в геометрической прогрессии. Сильный шок от осознания сколько всего всего можно пройти, найти, открыть.  Последняя миссия в челябе тоже ужас для осознания. Иногда душат попытки предсказать мысли геймдизайнера. Думаешь, что там конец локи + невидимая стена, а через 5 минут "хождения вперед" в попытках найти невидимую стену оказывается, что все же там лока. При том что все говорит об обратном: от уменьшения количества объектов, до здравого смысла. Так что если будете играть и возникнет мысль, что там уж точно ничего нет. Скорее всего там что то есть. Слушать северсталя было приятно. У игры очень красивый дизайн и стиль. И игра постоянно удивляет способностью создать что то красивое и эстетичное. Это очень вдохновляюще. Игра мечты разработчиков и это видно. Продолжает идеи многих легенд. Очень приятно было пройти все доступные миссии, пусть даже последние 3 спидраном (ну уж супер огромные локации, я теряюсь. они нормально воспринимаются, только после первого прохождения) Может и сырая технически (особенно что связанно с сохранением, бывает нпс переместятся или оружие выпадет), но конкретных багов и софтлоков не было. Может и игра не дает раскрыться всем своим механикам, особенности карабканье из сплинтер цел. Но это очень круто.
[Date: 2025-03-04 | Playtime: 11h 20m | Rec: Positive] This game requires you to read. I have never felt so uncomfortable and yet so intrigued by an atmosphere of a game. It feels like s.t.a.l.k.e.r meets ghost in the shell, two separate worlds that i love and adore that i never expected to have a "collab". This, this is a game i am going to play slowly and enjoy every second of. Red some of the negative reviews of this game, there is a lot of complaints on how dead and lifeless the game is, in my opinion, it should stay that way, there is a certain charm to the stillness and dead atmosphere that really makes this a gem.

Уровни интересно исследовать в поисках альтернативных путей прохождения, а из оружия приятно стрелять, аугментации вносят глубину в геймплей и не кажутся лишними. С местным ганплеем каждый ствол ощущается чем-то уникальным, хотя и по большей части бесполезным, потому-что большинству противников достаточно одного выстрела в голову.  В общем, что хотел-то сказать... эээ... местам хуёва, но мне нравится.

[Date: 2025-03-03 | Playtime: 13h 32m | Rec: Positive] I want to preface this by saying, if you buy this game, you are not only buying an early access experience, but you are also buying a generally janky game. This game is not easy to wrap your head around, and I think that is the point. I asked myself while playing Peri, "Should exploration always be rewarded?" and I think Peri answers that with a "No, not all of the time." I think that is something you need to understand playing this game. You are going to get your time wasted, but that is why we play video games. Peri has more to offer than constantly stimulating game-play and level design. The atmosphere of Peripeteia is suffocating in the realest sense possible. I've never felt so claustrophobic in monolithic brutalist megastructures and I fucking love that shit. I don't need to look around every corner and find a hidden VSS, because I get to sit there and bask in the horrifying reality of this game's world. Peripeteia has so much to offer to someone who is willing to just inhabit the world than I can't even begin to explain my emotions on it. There are many sharp edges in Peripeteia, many out-of-bounds softlocks, many very loud noises, but I don't care. This game fuckin rocks. I saw someone state this game as the immersive sim's immersive sim and I agree with that. Fuck the garnish, it is a miracle that such a small team even accomplished what they did with this game. I only hope that they keep putting passion into this project as they pull it out of early access. This game is all the peaks and valleys of an indie masterpiece. I'll come back when the game is out of EA, but if you wish to support small devs, this is another game for the books.  Edit: addendum regarding exploration, also, there is nothing wrong with disliking the game. It has more than its fair share of abrasive qualities so it's not something I recommend lightly. BUT, I think this game is worth the time and effort it will take for you to get comfortable.

There is a huge amount of additional polish required to put it over the top, but there's a lot of stuff that bizarrely works in the game's favor.

[Date: 2025-03-03 | Playtime: 22h 22m | Rec: Positive] Peripeteia is an exercise in throwing the player into the deep end of a pool and trusting them to be smart enough to figure things out, and in this day and age of modern gaming it's VERY refreshing thing to see.  Labyrinthine cities and dimly megastructures invite the player to get lost, to get immersed in the game's world, with the absolute freedom to come at your objectives in so many ways, with every level so far in EA offering at least a handful of specific, individual endings per level. Special mention should be given to level 4 and 5, Belgrade and Karabash. Belgrade for it's wonderful, if a bit frustrating, upending of usual immersive sim systems with how the gameplay is altered for it, and Karabash for it's expansive selection of options and endings for each of the sections objectives.   Gunplay is also well done with tons of weapon mods and weapons themselves to compliment the game's focus on player freedom, although one has to go out of their way to find some of these weapons.   Of course, with all this freedom, and this game being in EA, it comes with a lot of jank as a result, but it's a charming sort of jank, with nothing particularly game breaking thus far, plus at least on my end, I've experienced zero crashes or the like.  But honestly, I think the thing I fell in love with most is the writing and the atmosphere, it's dystopian as fuck, but there's still pockets of hope and just general pleasantness persisting (Filemon and Nietzscha, Kasia) in spite of it. It's...just really engaging in a way I haven't seen, and the fact that this game is inspiring me to learn more about actual eastern european history to understand some of the political and social commentary going on it is real cool I find.  If any of this sounds rad to you and you're willing to tolerate some jank, it's should be an definitive buy. If you're on the fence, give the demo a try. This game WILL cause people to get filtered, and that's fine, because this is a game made by sickos, for sickos.

[Date: 2025-03-03 | Playtime: 37h 51m | Rec: Positive] CAPTAIN PRONIN, SUPERSTAR! Featuring: man-made horrors beyond comprehension!
[Date: 2025-03-03 | Playtime: 7h 10m | Rec: Positive] I only played 6 hours so far and  haven't gotten very far (only gotten the control chip), but that's mostly my own fault. this is an old school game, save often! that said, I LOVE this game. the atmosphere is great, everything is so BIG. this isn't a neon and chrome cyberpunk but concrete and rain cyberpunk. it can be frustrating because there is a lot of empty space and no markers or map. combat tends to be sparse but meaningful, you spend a lot of time just going from place to place, there is a LOT of walking. enemies have little fire control and use up their ammo so kill them stealthily or quickly because you need to scavenge it.  this little story is why I had to write this recommendation now: sometimes it's hard to tell if you're going where the devs intended or if you've gotten lost somewhere you're not supposed to be. BUT, you find some pretty cool loot way off the beaten path. I spent literal real life minutes just running up a spiral staircase just to see what was there; oh there's a section of broken stairs, well I'll parkour past it, keep running up, the doorways no longer have doors, do I belong here?, keep running up, there aren't even doorways, I cannot belong up here, keep running, oh hey I'm at the top. wait, what's that? a locker? with an awesome machine gun?! yes it is. but the building angles mean I can't just jump down, so more literal minutes of real time spent running back down the stairs. but totally worth it.
[Date: 2025-03-03 | Playtime: 30h 25m | Rec: Positive] After trying out the demo, I’ve decided to bite the bullet and break my ‘rule’ of not buying early access titles. I haven’t finished everything that is available in the game at the moment of writing this, yet I’ve completed first four levels multiple times and clocked in over 25 hours (adding ~six hours from the demo, which has a tutorial mission).  I’ve expected melancholic/depressing/heavy atmosphere and I got exactly that. The post-soviet reality and how it would look like if thrown into the blender with a bit of alternative timeline shenanigans and a hefty dose of cyberpunk. Sprawling, open-ended levels are something that would most likely tire me in any other game, but not here. Despite all odds and the fact I’ve spent a lot of my play time just exploring the levels, it never became tiring. Many times I have found myself stumbling onto some additional supplies, secrets or world building elements.  The number of weapons the player can use is quite staggering. They all have different characteristics such as recoil, accuracy, firing speed or damage. Though personally, I’m not sure how I feel about the recoil, as it seems extremely aggressive. No matter if you’re firing a machine gun or a small calibre pistol, the gun seems to fly all over the place. I feel it could be turned down a bit. Still, there’s plenty for the player to play with, provided they found enough ammunition and magazines. If the weapon is magazine-fed, a player needs to look for extra mags. I was not prepared for how far devs would go with this idea, and I must say: I love it. Sure, you can press the reload key and have your character reach out for the extra mag, but only if you have it in your inventory. What that, it’s half empty? Then tough luck, you should’ve made sure that all your mags are fully loaded before you’ve entered the fight. If you’re fast enough, you can refill them mid-combat, but remember that you may not be able to do it in time when enemies are rushing your position. It forces the player to think carefully on how they want to tackle each encounter and if they’re prepared to tackle it, guns blazing, or is it better to stealth their way around it, or if they should go back and look for a different path. No matter the circumstances, most (if not all) problems offer multiple solutions, or at the very least, multiple paths to the player’s objective.  Enemies may be numerous and they really don’t mess around. You can distract them by making noise, forcing them to investigate any suspicious sounds. However, if they notice and identify you as a threat, they will start shooting, and even if you manage to hide, they will continue to lay suppressive fire in the direction where they last spotted you. And they really want to make sure you’re dead. So much so, I had few hilarious situations where there were instances of friendly fire, making my task easier, as enemies would sometimes kill some of their own on accident. Overall, they have a serviceable AI, if a bit exploitable. While it probably could use some tweaks, what we got at the moment is not bad at all.  Our character is a top of a line cyborg, and as such, has access to some wacky, high-tech cybernetics. Some can be found scattered in levels and the game starts you with night vision, enhanced mobility (super speed plus higher jump), and reconnaissance drone. Those that you start with consume rather small amounts of your energy, so don’t be afraid to use them. Finally, you’re able to perform a mid-air jump that has no energy cost. As long as you haven’t jumped prior to your fall, you can still give yourself some extra boost, avoiding any potential damage, if you time that jump correctly. That said, please keep in mind that after a certain falling distance, mid-air jumps are no longer possible, so long falls are still very much lethal.  When it comes to inventory, you may be given an item or two, depending on the mission, but any other items you finished your previous mission with will be gone (with the exception of cybernetic implants, these carry over). Personally, I think it’s a great idea, because it gives an incentive for the player to explore every level thoroughly. Additionally, you still get money for all items you had when you’ve finished your previous level and there is a high chance that you encounter a merchant in the next mission pretty early on, so you can restock at a reasonably low price. Which, depending on your play style, may not be necessary at all, as you may be able to get by with what you’ve been given at the start plus things you’ve found and scavenged along the way.  As for stealth, it works as intended. Some light sources can even be destroyed for the player’s advantage. However, there is an issue with this system. The lighting in this game does not always make sense. There are in-door areas that are fully illuminated, but the player will have difficult time finding a light source, provided there’s any at all. Other times, one may appear to be completely hidden, yet the games shows that they are fully exposed. The opposite is also true, one may stand in the middle of an illuminated spot and yet the game will still interpret that they’re perfectly hidden, as if they were currently in a pitch black room. Luckily, it is rarely an issue, as such spots are usually found in places devoid of any enemies. Still, I advise anyone taking a stealthy approach to monitor their visibility meter closely just in case, as there are instances of borked light detection in places where you most likely wish this wasn’t a case.  I have been mostly singing praises of this game, but there are some other issues I need to highlight. I already mentioned enemies’ behaviour and lighting, but there are worse things that are worth keeping in mind. Saving and loading the game is all kinds of messed up, at least in my experience. The game would do weird things whenever I would save and load my game. Enemies would change their state or position. Items in the inventory would not be in proper places, or they would occupy double the required space (fixable by throwing the item onto the ground and then picking it back up). I even had a situation where all enemies in the level would have two and later three copies of their weapon for me to loot of their bodies. I have no idea what exactly caused that, but saving and loading seems a bit of a gamble at the moment. Mind you, it’s not completely broken and for the most part it does what you expect it to do, but it feels like there’s like a 30% chance that something is going to be out of place. Game breaking? Not really. Extremely weird and distracting? Absolutely, so you may want to keep that in mind.  The player may be tasked with retrieving a specific item for a specific NPC. Great, gives a lot of replayability, but what if the player already had the needed item, without interacting with the required NPC beforehand? Their only dialogue option will be the same as if they would have triggered the quest earlier. It’s not a bad idea for subsequent replays or for speedruns, I imagine, but for first time players this may be confusing. I had few situations like these during my playthrough and while it’s easy to connect the dots and realise it’s an alternative solution for beating the level, it’s still rather jarring and doesn’t make much sense narratively.  That being said, I believe the positives outweigh the negatives, as all of my gripes never went into the ‘game breaking’ territory and were minor annoyances at worst. All other systems in the game worked as I expected them to do, making the overall experience extremely addicting, satisfying and replayable. I think Peripeteia is already worth players’ time, especially if they enjoy immersive sims that prioritize player’s freedom and fun mechanics above all else. It may be janky and a bit rough around the edges, but oh, it is also extremely enjoyable and satisfying!

[Date: 2025-03-03 | Playtime: 34h 8m | Rec: Negative] In short: Fun game with lots of personality, but requires lots of polish.  Upsides: Quirky, cute, good soundtrack, ambitious worldbuilding, good movement, weapon variety, generous inventory, crusty weapons, strong shotguns  Downsides: Incredibly inconsistent texture sizes, large and empty enviroments with lots of walking but little to see or do, not quite dynamic music, deafeningly loud rain noises at almost all time, abhorrently bad grabbing mechanics in which the player drops whatever is held by bumping into stuff (including air) or turning too fast/slowly, assault guns suck in terms of accuracy, aiming down sights in general sucks as the weapon model flies all over the screen and the sights are poorly modeled, I have yet to decipher what half of the UI tries to tell me, a non-functional midair jump ability, weird climbing mechanics  UPDATE: As the game progresses, it becomes increasingly more gruelling and boring.  Difficulty is achieved by filling levels to the brim with unfun enemies that are both tanky and remove half of your health in one shot while forcing you to blindly stumble through increasingly larger, emptier and more broken levels with tons of empty dead ends and traps, punishing exporation and sowing frustration. As the game progresses, the level quality degrades as well, to the point where you will encounter unfinished sections and out-of-bounds areas frequently, even simple rooms have holes in them that make you fall out of the map. With the exception of the third level, there is practically no sense of direction; you are usually told WHAT to do but you rarelly know where to go,causing the player to stumble around until they incidentally discover the objective, oftentimes sequence breaks aswell. Finally, the gunplay, augmentation and stealth mechanics are bare-bones at best and unfun at worst.  The game also becomes progressivelly buggier; with level 4 I personally encountered crippling inventory bugs, making key items unusable or deleting them outright.  Items in the world may not spawn in properly either.

[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 24h 52m | Rec: Positive] this is essentially a slavjank fusion of EYE and Deus Ex, which also feels a little of Cruelty Squad at times, a very unique vibe to it. Good: Blame! but with brutalism and commieblocks type level design, everything is massive but wisely the clutter is very low. the mapping itself is excellent and improves with each level and even at the low detail, the overall scenes are often stunning, there's some great architecture work in there that i wish was real. fun gunplay, loads of guns (TKB bakelite bullpup monstrosities included), each feeling fairly distinct. i appreciate the inventory system where you're playing tetris (how fitting haha) though some may find it tedious.  vibes off the charts, seriously hard to describe how good the atmosphere and immersion are in this game. surprising variety in locations, each map felt very distinct and even in the early access levels you end up covering a large part of the post soviet space. Worldbuilding is actually pretty good, i'm invested in finding out how the world became such a mess, especially after where the current EA left off. maybe some won't like it but having techno/jungle/whatever blasting in some locations is actually great (reminds me of system shock 2) Controversial but a certain level changing up the games genre had me hyped, yes it was a difficulty spike but it was peak atmosphere, Love it! the ledge grab mechanic has not even once messed up, surprising for the jank level here, it's really good and traversal of the level feels great. Bad It's an early access but right now it's so incredibly RAW, barely cooked, still moving on its own and trying to run away from you. Most of the bugs were more just ugly and/or amusing like guns somehow splitting in two halves (both can fire) or some geometry not being closed and letting you easily go out of bounds. the animation is ass very consistently, i can live with the janky models (i even like them!) but the npc and gameplay animations are barely functional. mods take inventory space for some reason, just don't like this decision.  some might get filtered by the lack of hand holding, insane map design and overall jank. Overall, This would be a strong GOTY contender if it was actually finished.

[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 22h 19m | Rec: Positive] Gem.  Very, very rough. Lots of jank, some may say game barely works.  But denial of modern gamedesign standards, schizo leveldesign, unorthodox sound design (especially music) and unique, never before felt vibes triumph over everything.  There are few games that could make me stand for minutes on end inhaling atmosphere. This one did.

[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 15h 25m | Rec: Positive] This is shaping up to be one of my favorite games ever. Totally atmospheric and immersive maps, and maneuvering these levels is made convenient with the ability to grab pretty much ANY ledge; leads to some pretty open movement and parkour. Maps can be dark- that is what your night vision augment is for. The game doesn't give out objective markers or quests either, make sure to read dialogue and use your in-game journal.  Combat is also multifaceted: there's a huge array of guns, gadgets, and augments such as perceived slow motion and thermoptic camouflage. The inventory is a grid system, unload guns and magazines, put them into other guns and magazines, etc. A lot of items have their own little descriptions when you inspect them.  All the systems you engage with in Peripeteia are satisfying in their own way, including the setting and art direction, and when you combine all of them you just get a really fun experience. RECOMMEND

[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 2h 33m | Rec: Negative] This game is definitely... pretty. Beautiful, breath-taking, and captures a very unique vibe and aesthetic. I thought the level design was outstanding.. It's also a bit frustrating... in a more than an "Oh I have to search and explore like Morrowind" kinda way... I managed to get hard locked quite a few times. Taking elevators early by mistake and looping backwards to accidentally get myself stuck in a level because there was no recall button for the lift.  Combat is smooth and fun, but a bit difficult unless you go full murderhobo... It may have provided an enjoyable experience if you went in thinking that way... you know, not thinking too hard but the setting won't allow that considering how the factions and npc's are written..  The setting is.. well built. There's a lot of cool and in-depth lore. The factions... they seem to be mostly portrayed as all pretty 100% through and through evil... sometimes in an almost caricature-like manner. In order to befriend one faction you need to plant a bomb at a building but are told almost with emphasis that it's behind some innocent desk-lady. The only non-evil faction is portrayed as the Christian faction... and the priest npc you encounter almost seems to come off as "this is the NPC you *should* be able to agree with, if you have followed our clues about how everyone else is evil," and its just a bit... I dunno.. Agenda-pushy. The game definitely punishes you for attempting to side with either or the political factions, both the facist "PSR" and the "Subculturist" socialists, somewhat overtly bullying you for attempting to side with either (especially the communists).. while definitely building a distinct message of "politicism is why everything sucks in this world."   The game definitely gives off a very... *specific doomer-pilled centrist experience.* I enjoyed the first 30 minutes immensely, but liked the game less and less as it went on.

[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 22h 1m | Rec: Positive] Some of the most vertical level design I've ever seen. Incredibly smooth and fluid running movement, parkour, and especially climbing mechanics. So much atmosphere you could colonize Mars with this thing. Incredible aesthetics. Shooting mechanics executed well, once you figure out how they work, with remarkably snappy combat even if (in early access form, and I'll edit this if it changes) the enemy AI is fairly simple for an imsim. World is huge and empty, but that's definitely an artistic choice, emphasizing the inhuman scale of Peripeteia's world, enhanced by the protagonist being _smol_. Despite the ridiculously sized levels and the incredibly complex traversal, which is often a puzzle in itself, navigation is actually pretty easy thanks to excellent level design - though this game certainly gives my 3D spatial senses a workout they rarely get.

[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 8h 9m | Rec: Positive] This game is a broken mess. But, I like it a lot. This game feels like it is going to fall apart at every encounter. I just spent 2 hours during the AI tank encounter because half of them disappeared, and the rest started flying around the map at incredible speeds. I managed to destroy them but I was starting to get super super worried that I was going to be soft locked. The game under the bugs is very fun, and I hope they are quick to fix this because I really love what they are doing here. Also FUCK BELGRADE, almost stopped playing the game entirely, ended up just doing the easiest ending for it to save my sanity. Which is a shame because it had some really really cool stuff going on but playing it is WAY more trouble than it is worth.

[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 45h 16m | Rec: Positive] I literally bought this game after 3 minutes of a review because I'd already had a surreal cyberpunk dream the same day, 10/10 I'd put this up there with New Vegas and Deus ex.   Will update my review when my feeble brain can comprehend more than a fraction of the game itself. 
[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 30h 27m | Rec: Positive] This is easily a candidate for one of the greatest games ever made. I am not joking. I received this game for free, but only because I supported the developer's Patreon for a little over 2 years, so this is a non-biased review. The opening level is almost exactly the same as it was in the latest public demo, but a little more polished and a couple extra narrative bits thrown in to set up the world. It does a fantastic job getting you prepared for the rest of the game. The second two levels are actually from a much older demo build (around mid 2022 I think) but a couple things are changed for better map flow, and I think a few of the characters have new dialogue but I could be wrong. The two levels after are new to this build, for those who did not receive test builds before release, and while they are a little buggy and the AI in those two levels specifically could be better, they are still phenomenal experiences. Every level has multiple ways to go about beating them, some easier than others. Navigating the huge maps is also fun, because the game doesn't hold your hand and guide you through them. You're usually given a location with a name, and maybe a picture or a cardinal direction, and that's it. The rest is up to you. The combat is... oddly good? It's certainly not the main focus of the game, because there are almost always to avoid it, but when combat happens it's really fun. (I chose violence almost every time the option was given). The AI are really janky sometimes but just popping dudes in the head with a Makarov and zipping around with a shotgun is so much fun. And all of the abilities are well done, too. There wasn't a single one that was bad; They all had their uses, even if it's not obvious a first. Obviously my favorite was Reflex Enhancement because shooting things is fun.  This game is a beautiful mix of thought-provoking rhetoric, charming characters, great set pieces, a lived in world, good level design, and janky but well executed encounters. If you're a fan of immersive sims, PLEASE try this game. If you aren't? Try it anyways, this game is a work of art.
[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 7h 46m | Rec: Negative] I think the game is okay, and has potential.   It has a great atmosphere, and the gun fights can be lots of fun. I wish that energy fuses were more common throughout the map, especially since nigh vision is kinda necessary and experimentation with the augmented abilities is so fun. I also wish there were more combat encounters.   I think the level design design is pretty messy. Not giving the player way points is fine, but with so many dead ends in such a large map exploring can be frustrating or meaningless. Its just not very intuitive at guiding the player to interesting points. Still, I did like to travel across it when there was a clear flow to things.   Unfortunately the quest design and story is pretty subpar, and this is the games weakest point. The game is trying to be an immersive sim, but lacks the nuance in its writing. The story of Deus Ex was so refreshing in part because of how it could discuss modern day topics in a serious and complex way.  In Peripeteia I think these topics are too good vs evil, and too uninformed or ideological to be taken seriously. Hell, even Caesar's legion in New Vegas had more humanity than the Commies get in this game. Actions in the world also carry little consequence. In the first mission I could just kill the Polish officer past the waiting room and no one even cares.   I'd just try out the demo for now, and if you really like the vibe than get the game. Otherwise I'd wait a year or so
[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 15h 42m | Rec: Positive] I fell in love with this game <3
[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 11h 35m | Rec: Positive] I'm a gigantic fan of cruelty squad and mostly got this game after playing the demo because it gave me the same vibes, and in many ways my "guy who has only ever played cruelty squad, playing another game for the first time" analysis works. It's a janky ps1-styled shooter with obtuse mechanics and strange nihilist euroslav writing that gives me all the vibes of cruelty squad without the eyestrain. Its levels seem to all have 2 totally different story paths to go down which is nice, and there's a satisfaction in starting each level with nothing but a sword and gradually build up your arsenal and kill more dudes to get more guns and ammo, which is scarcer than I generally like in a shooter, it's one of those games where it's best to switch all guns to semi auto and carefully plink heads instead of spaffing 30 rounds point blank into one dude, missing most of them due to recoil, and having his friends turn you into swiss cheese while all your guns are empty.   The atmosphere is impeccable and each level definitely gives the feeling of being in a place that wasn't built for people; the levels are WAY too large and makes poor use of the space in the level but I imagine this is intentional to drive the dystopian feeling, but it does mean you can walk down a hallway for 5 minutes, find out it leads nowhere, and have to walk back, or load a save, and load you will. I don't like the phrase "savescumming" but you kinda need to when you're first exploring these levels, as the game is a bit scummy itself with how quickly you can die, which brings me to my major complaint with this game.  Level 4, Belgrade, tosses out the bits that work from the previous levels and tries out being a horror game for a while. Scarce ammo, no augments, enemies that kill you very quickly, weird jumping robots that somehow do damage to you when they look like they shouldn't, and crucially, it removes your ability to save. I hated playing through Belgrade, however, much like some of the worse bits of cruelty squad, gets much easier when you actually know what to do, but of course for someone playing through for the first time, isn't really possible, so it's a horrible glitchy slog. Oh and there's lots of bugs too but I assume they'll be fixed as the game progresses.  If you're playing through this game and not wanting to play Belgrade I would say just look at a walkthrough and get it out of the way as quick as you can, because my favourite level and last level at the time of writing, Karabash, is locked behind it.  TL;DR: Good game, weird game, obtuse game, has one shit level that almost made me hate the whole thing but it's chill.
[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 16h 17m | Rec: Positive] This game smells like heavy fuel oil on a cold early morning.  The maps are gigantic and exploration is rewarded with items, secrets, or alternative ways to complete an objective, curiosity overall is rewarded. The level design is very unique. It's obtuse, makes you feel lost, but it really works. Ambiance is on point. The music is pretty good and doesn't get stale. Very little hand holding. NPCs might tell you what and where, but it's up to you to figure out how to get there and achieve what you need to do. No map, no objective markers. Just a notebook to remind you in case you forget. Movement is amazing. It's hard to gauge what you are able to do early on, but after playing a couple hours you get the hang of it. The gunplay is alright. Ammo and equipment in general is usually not plentiful so make your shots count. You can use some augments in some ways that aren't explicitly told, leading to some interesting plays. Energy management (for augments) is a bit of a miss. The lighting in this game makes you use night vision a lot, which drains a minimal but constant amount of energy. Energy is restored through uncommon consumables. Which brings me to the biggest problem with this game: the lighting. Having to use night vision constantly makes any ambiance null and void, besides the constant energy drain issue. Difficulty is okay, besides one level. Belgrad is extremely though to get through. Stealth and AI are passable. No opinion on the story, while I have finished the game (or rather all the levels present in early access release), I have not experienced all the content. You will miss a lot of stuff on your first playthrough.  Looking forward to play more of this. Definitely try the demo first. If you like the demo, you will like the full game.

Peripeteia follows this recipe: Mix a teeny tiny bit of Scorn, add a gentle scoop of Lorn's Lure, pour a generous amount of E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy, and as a finishing touch add a sprinkle of Polish pre- and post-Soviet culture.

[Date: 2025-03-01 | Playtime: 15h 53m | Rec: Negative] Peripeteia - early access is really “rough” in current conditions ;and it's not for everyone. I need to say it now, on the beginning, that I really have fun in this game. I could praise Peripeteia for a really “curious” atmosphere ,absolutely beautiful music ,greate movement / Parkour ;and this dystopian feeling of cyber post soviet architecture in the level design ,and a lot of little Polish references.  I know that developing a game is hard … but to be fair … after playing a demo of this game I expected a little more polished game to be released to early access. But I guess Early access is just for this purpose … to fix the broken parts … and a lot is broken. Like in the second level automatic doors are still broken just like they wear in the old demo. I don't know why but true my whole experience with this version of the game I was constantly thinking one thing: Broken design is not an Art direction for a game ,it just makes a broken game ; and Peripeteia feels like going just into that direction ;Into being Broken or schizophrenic … by design …(It might be my personal delusion after a long session with the game). And … Like “yes” all elements that make the game fun are there but they are soo … soo unpolished or sometimes disconnected. Like … it is really impossible to walk 15 minutes without something breaking.  Things like items in inventory disappearing ; weapons not working or totally breaking so the player can not shoot (Fixed by loading save); or the bug that I found that allows me to despawn any item ; or save system loading wrong positions of NPC ;ah… NPC themselves sometimes just attack the player without any reason in the middle of conversation ;loping conversation telling me again to do some mission even if I just came back from doing it ;or item duplication.  The level design is something totally unhinged, there is no “one” map that fully works … :( I do not have a problem with how big the levels are and Yes levels feel kinda empty sometimes. The problem that I have is how easy it is to get hard stuck … sometimes because of lack of energy for movement augmentation ,or just because most of the elevators do not have recall buttons or they just go one way. And to add to this mapping augmentation that is supposed to “help” drain energy too, so if a player gets stuck with no energy there is no help other than to load the save that hopefully you did make (Right ???). There are some areas on maps that are unfinished but it feels like you can go there only to find out that it leads out of bounce … and it is impossible to go back… Oh... and there is no map so good luck in exploration … and getting stuck.  Inventory management is nice … and questionable. Augmentations sometimes take half of the inventory instead of having a separate place for them. Main problem with inventory is the fact that inventory is sold at the end of the mission ,which normally would not be the problem but … it makes money and items found true exploration kinda worthless. Why buy guns, ammo or augs if they are gone anyway at the end of the level (Except augs)? … and the shops don't even have enough energy fuses in stock to support the use of augmentation while exploring the maps ,or being in combat due to high energy cost.  I can only hope to see this game getting fixed because the current stare feels deeply underdeveloped. That said ,If all the problems are fixed ,I can see how wonderful this game will be… I hope so…

[Date: 2025-03-01 | Playtime: 16h 50m | Rec: Positive] After finishing my first playthrough and starting another, I wanted to share my thoughts on the game, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses. It's also a first lengthy review I will post on steam - I do believe that the game has a huge potential and I love most of the things that are present in the game at the current stage. There are some issues that I will point out later in the review. I will also avoid going too much into details on the story, world and gameplay I consider discovering a lot of the things by yourself a huge part of those types of games.   First off, huge congratulations to the team. You’ve created something truly amazing. Generally speaking, I love the game, the music, the gameplay loop, and the story so far. It’s an excellent Early Access release with decent price to content ratio, even at the current stage. As the game is around 25 euros and I am pretty sure I will hit at least 20 to 30 hours of gameplay of the current release at this point. I would call that a reasonably priced access to the unfinished product.  [h3]Atmosphere[/h3]  The atmosphere is phenomenal. The sheer scale of the levels makes me feel like an ant in this brutal, massive world. The setting is also strong, and perhaps my Polish background makes it even more immersive, but the alternate-history universe is excellently executed. There is some hidden lore here and there, but generally speaking - game leaves a lot to players imagination.  [h3]Gameplay[/h3]  Gameplay should be somewhat familiar to people with some experience in the immersive sim genre. There are some elements from Thief, original Deus Ex and some other games. You can move boxes and hack the computers and all that jazz.  The game currently suffers from various bugs like for example: AI behavior, repetitive NPC dialogue, some quests breaking here and there and minor issues that will likely be fixed over time. Also dialogue options feel rather limited at the current stage. There is a fair amount of jank but due to the fact that we are not limited with saving the game for most of the game - if something breaks you can reload the game and it's usually fine afterwards.  Weapon selection is impressive but underwhelming in practice. The lack of noticeable differences in accuracy and damage, combined with enemies dropping from a single headshot most of the time, reduces the need for diverse weapon choices. Ammo scarcity and inventory management create some type of strategy as it forces us to have multiple weapons on us - each one with limited supply of bullets, but fights often feel too easy, especially with poor enemy AI.   I do not have any comments on the stealth approach to the game yet - my first playthrough was very much a guns blazing one. As the game also offers a stealth approach (staying in shadows mechanic, silenced weapons, invisibility / silent steps augmentations), this is something that I am going to test over my second playthrough of the current release.   [h3]Level Design[/h3]  The large, spacious levels are both a strength and a weakness. They effectively establish scale and atmosphere, making traversal feel lengthy but unique. However, exploration lacks meaningful rewards. Small ammo caches or batteries are not enough. Hidden lore, worldbuilding elements, NPC interactions, or even environmental storytelling would add so much. The game’s visual design is fantastic, but the world sometimes feels too empty. The well-lit windows suggest life, yet there are few signs of it beyond that. I understand the technical and artistic reasons for limiting NPCs, but more environmental and audio cues, like for example public announcements, distant conversations, more city noises and other types of worldbuilding elements would surely make the world feel more alive without breaking the oppressive loneliness. But that's my perspective based on my preference in video games so I do not consider that as a negative, just pointing that out.  [h3]Sound design and music[/h3]  The sounds and ambience are promising but badly mixed. Volume levels are inconsistent, with music sometimes being too loud or drowned out by ambient sounds. Enemy sounds also lack variety. They tend to repeat well too often. The game could also benefit from more environmental audio, as currently there is a lot of silence or we can hear a lot of repeating sounds over and over again. Music-wise, I love the selection, especially as an ambient/breakcore fan. However, area-based tracks can feel awkward when they restart too frequently. A more dynamic system would help, but I understand that’s a really complex system to ask for in an small indie game.  [h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]  Despite its current problems (It's an Early Access!), the game delivers an excellent experience and I had a lot of fun with it so far. At the end of the day it's a small passion project run by a handful of people.  I’m excited to see how it evolves and look forward to both future content and replaying in new ways.   I would strongly recommend the game to anyone with a soft spot for dystopian vibes and to anyone that likes to dabble in the immersive sim video games genre. There is quite a lot of jank. But it's great jank.

[Date: 2025-03-01 | Playtime: 20h 52m | Rec: Positive] As a fan of dishonored, deus ex and other few immersive sims i realy enjoyed the game even tho bugs tend to stand in the way to enjoy it, hopefully most of them are fixed by rebuting the game. But still some stuff feels realy stupid, like climbing ladders or important information about quest doesnt appear in journal.  I saw many people didnt like that you loose all your gear after mission but i imagine how people woud brutforce 3th and 4th lvl wich simply woud made them feel like nonliniear doom 3 but you actualy have night vision instead of flashlight, or in short boring. Overall game definitely not for everyone, but if you like it in the start you gonna love it by the end.

Other then that I honestly didnt expect to really enjoy the 4 hours I spent playing the game. It was some of the most fun Ive had in a very long time! I also cant not mention the treat that awaits you after each level. If it means I get to see The Hallway Weirdo every time I will gladly trek through hell to get to see her again ;__;

[Date: 2025-03-01 | Playtime: 15h 8m | Rec: Negative] [i]Semiconductor whispers reveal ancient secrets, entwining with medicinal mysteries of bygone eras[/i]  Не рекомендую, но по скидке на пару вечеров можно заморочиться. Как писали до меня: "Замах на рубль, а удар - на копейку"; если Вы давно вынашиваете хитрые планы по созданию своего крутого иммерсив-сима, то эта игра - пример, как лучше не делать. Игры в данный моммент хватает часов на 7-8 для одного прохождения, дальше можно на карте арены только пушки разные поиспытывать. Хочется посмотреть, что будет дальше с проектом, но, как мне кажется, это очередной вечный долгострой в вечном раннем доступе, пока автору не надоест  Плюсы:  - Локации большие; исследовать их интересно ровно до момента, пока ты после первой же своей миссии не потеряешь всю свою снарягу, а на полученные деньги не сможешь себе даже расходников купить впрок, не говоря уже о нормальных пушках (потому что НЕГДЕ) - Мрачный и суровый сэттинг, который вопросы киборгизации делают только интереснее - Управление приятное и в большинстве своём отзывчивое (кроме момента с "прыжком mid-air": он может сработать, а может и не сработать если падал чуть больше нужного) - Копаться с пушками интересно, стрелять - тоже. Оружие ощущается по-разному, но приоритет естественным образом рано или поздно сводится к просто точным огнестрелам для хэд-шотов - Свобода в своём выборе (который ни на что не влияет) делать что хочется - ради уникальных пушек NPC можно попросту убить; да и карты вообще можно пройти грубой силой, просто перешагивая через трупы - Всё ещё целостнее и лучше, чем Cruelty Squad  Минусы:  - [b]ЛУТ ПОСЛЕ МИССИЙ НЕ СОХРАНЯЕТСЯ[/b] (представьте, что у меня было с лицом после того, как я всю первую миссию носил в рюкзаке два MG42 и после завершения оной пулемёты просто испарились вместе с остальным лутом); полученные деньги девать просто некуда. Конкретно для меня это главный и самый ощутимый минус всей игры - он просто кхуям стирает всё желание к хоть какому-то эксплору и подробному обшариванию локаций на предмет разных редкостей. Единственное, что от эксплора сохранилось из полезного - это новый имплант на стрельбу с двух рук - С какого-то перепугу я думал, что тут единый большой открытый мир, а по факту - просто большие и не связанные между собой локации. Да даже пусть бы были отдельные локации - но со СВОБОДНЫМ перемещением между ними (как в той же Deus Ex или VtM: Bloodlines) - Беды с инвентарём вообще: несуразица с размерами самих предметов (короб ПКМ размером такой же, как магазин от пистолета), неработающие напитки на восстановление энергии и категория ВРЕМЕННЫХ расходников вообще ("нормальных" расходников острый дефицит каждую миссию, а "нормальный" фонарик блондинка-ГГ проёбывает вместе с остальным лутом - если вообще находит на миссии) - Подпункт предыдущего: импланты ВНЕЗАПНО занимают место в рюкзаке вместо каких-то условных спецслотов - удачи с собой поносить "парус" термооптического камуфляжа - Досаждающие баги и недоработки всё ещё остаются (отключающийся ЛЦУ; прицелы, через которые невозможно целиться; слетающая из слотов имплантов кибернетика и т.д.) - Ошибки левел-дизайна: залутать булл-пап АК со штык-ножом можно в первой миссии, только из этой ямы потом уже никак не выбраться (даже если все патроны игломёта в стены выпустите - не хватит, чтобы по ним выкарабкаться). Лифты, поднимающиеся один раз в какую-то сторону и с другой стороны их не позвать; или вообще "чердаки" как таковые, на которые ты запрыгнул откуда-то сверху, залутал крутой ПП и выход оттуда подразумевается через лифт, на котором ты поднялся (а ты на нём не поднимался) - Тупорылая фича некоторых мобов бросать после себя пустое оружие (даже если его убили в затылок одним выстрелом). ИИ мобов вообще слабоват, но опасность они всё же хоть какую-то представляют - Музыкальное сопровождение вывозит только за счёт спизженных breakcore трэков - Белград. Полагаю, много кто рефанднул бы игру, если этот уровень втретился бы в первые два часа игры, а не спустя несколько миссий

[Date: 2025-03-01 | Playtime: 19h 24m | Rec: Positive] Особо ничего от игры не ждал, запустил демку от скуки. Ни карты, ни целеуказателей нет. После стартовых плюшек пошел наугад.  И тут накрыло атмосферой. Как-будто кто-то марафонил без передышки Морровинд, Фоллаут, Аркс Фаталис, Деус Экс, параллельно читая Блейм и Боевого Ангела Алиту, после чего перед сном решил чуть-чуть послушать Северслата, это стало фатальным для организма и Перипетия - это предсмертный опыт, воплотившийся в [spoiler] кривой [/spoiler] код игры. Примерно такие ощущения были от демки, так что чуть-чуть подумав (и дождавшись окончания скидки) купил полную версию.  По итогу игра оказалась не совсем тем, чего я ожидал после демки и прямо скажем расстроен, что магия окраины огромного мегаполиса развеялась уже после первой части, но даже эта малая часть стоила своих денег.  Игру рекомендую только если вы ищете экзотики, у вас здоровые глаза, вы не боитесь темноты и гудков паровоза. ----  Поиграл еще, первые 3 уровня интересные и проходятся на одном дыхании, а вот Белград уже перебор и отбивает желание продолжать. Впрочем ютуб подсказал что уровень можно заспидранить за 3 минуты (спасибо за это).  Игра всё же восхитительная 10из10, давно такого наслаждения не получал.

[Date: 2025-02-28 | Playtime: 10h 37m | Rec: Positive] A true cyberpunk dystopian game not made by a studio with millions of dollars and thus not beholden to shareholders. Made by independent developers; this game is a great immersive sim  that does little handholding to the player (get ready to be lost with no map) and has an awesome soundtrack with music I think fits the vibe of the environment well.  Set in an alternate history Poland, this game has witty humor and is enjoyable to explore and fight enemies in despite being a little janky and buggy at times. I'm sure the game will improve with time!

Only finished the first level so far, but it's already a strong contender for my indie GOTY.  PS. If White Orchard in "The Witcher 3" reminded me of holidays spent on the Polish countryside, then "Peripeteia" is made out of my literal nightmares and daydreams straight of out post-communist Poland.

[Date: 2025-02-28 | Playtime: 12h 53m | Rec: Positive] Игра очень затягивает своей атмосферой. Очень. Сочетание такого необычного стиля, кибер-панк пост-апокалиптического сеттинга игры, в котором она выполнена, быстрого геймплея(в котором играл лично я) и очешуительного саунда на каждой локации каждого уровня, которые идеально подходят под ситуации и визуальную составляющую вокруг игрока, и делают эту игру лучшей для меня за конец 2024 - начало 2025 из-за огромного количества полученных мною доз дофамина. Я очень люблю музыку в играх, и, как по мне, это одна из самых важных составляющих любого прохождения. Peripeteia, по своему саунду, стоит на втором месте во всём топе из 200+ игр, в которые я играл(на первом SIGNALIS). Ибо разрабы точно знали, какой должна по геймплею быть игра. За музыку я выражаю им отдельную благодарность. В сюжет разрабы тоже смогли, но, как по мне, без их личного перевода играть бывает тяжко, но, благо, нам сказали потерпеть и русскую версию, думаю, да завезут. При том, что игра активно поддерживается как и вдохновлёнными фанатами, так и отзывчивыми разработчиками, я думаю, что все корявости, по типу фьюзов в ноже на BEL будут искорены в скором времени.  Самая большая проблема в том, что я попытался задонить на патреоне разработчиков, но российские карточки патреон просто не читает, что для меня есть большая утрата.  Советую всем, кому нравится иммерсивный стиль игры, где ты сам выбираешь, кем ты будешь: скрытным и чётким убийцей с глушителем, или тушей Рама-два-Вандама, которая с маузерами в двух руках пробивается среди коммуняк. Ну или пробиваетесь через коммуняк с глушителем, опционально.

[Date: 2025-02-28 | Playtime: 10h 37m | Rec: Positive] If you are a fan of the immersive sim genre there's really no going wrong here. Take your time with this one. It takes a bit to get a sense of your limits and options as well as the scope of the maps. Once it clicks and once you learn the climbing mechanic it has the immsim magic. Some may find the environments somewhat "empty", but the game is at it's best when travelling the city and soaking in the atmosphere, exploring for the sake of exploring and testing the game's boundaries.
[Date: 2025-02-28 | Playtime: 5h 0m | Rec: Positive] Might just be the best game ever. No joke. Everything is perfect, from the cities that hide from you in the distance, to the rats you find in some ol' junkyard. The style is unlike anything I've ever seen. Cruelty Squad, Fallout, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, ULTRAKILL, Cyberpunk, Mirror's Edge, and Metal Gear Solid all violently mashed together to create, well. THIS. Like, how the FUCK do you even do that? I'm impressed.  true masterpiece. I see myself logging over 100 hours onto this game for sure. This is officially my new favourite game of this entire GENERATION. I'm not geeking out, YOU are.
[Date: 2025-02-28 | Playtime: 5h 14m | Rec: Positive] SUPER DUPER GOOD. its still in development but its fantastic to play. the pacing is fantastic, the gun play is great, and I really enjoy messing with the guns and managing them in my inventory. The world is really good as well, the weird anime cyberpunk combined with eastern european wartorn dystopia really rules, some characters feel like they have masks on, but that's because the other characters, usually the soldiers, have proper sized heads and cool gas masks, but the civillians have heads as big or even larger than the gasmasked enemies, its a weird mishmash that makes it feel a little uncanny (good uncanny) but I could definitely see people really not liking it. Maria's kinda odd as well, I think the Devs think shes cooler than she actually is, her smoking at the end of levels makes her really dorky and not really that cool, like someone who thinks that's cool is making her smoke rather than that being something shed actually do. shes a much more mild mannered and fairly polite person, she IS cool because shes a cyborg who can do some sick ass gunplay, not because she smokes or looks like the art of those 2000s coded emo failgirls. this is subjective though, I won't shit or piss my pants over a cigarette. Bonus nit pick, picking things up kinda stinks, I haven't figured out how to toss a bottle yet but holding anything medium sized kills me because you tend to stumble into it alot and it stops your movement. Other than that this game fucking rules.
[Date: 2025-02-28 | Playtime: 4h 7m | Rec: Positive] Pros: The gunplay is insanely fun, the lore is incredible, the soundtrack is wild, and the retro art style is very satisfying.  Cons: Audio levels were all over the place, and I ended up accidentally soft-locking the first story quest on a Twitch stream.  Overall: In this case, I feel like this developer deserves a chance to cook. What I played so far is very promising, and I hope for so much more in the near future. A risky purchase, but I believe in Peripeteia and want it to succeed!

[Date: 2025-02-28 | Playtime: 13h 14m | Rec: Negative] Its alright. Some rewards for creative parkour but mostly leads to dead ends and out of bounds areas. Stealth is probably the most well refined part of this game... and even then its fairly jank. Shadows usually don't line up with actual shadows and enemies can actually just be shot from the dark without any real threat.  Lots of empty nothingness in the levels. The atmosphere is cool but not cool enough to warrant seeing the same location 15+ times (and climbing a certain set of stairs for a single fairly mediocre weapon).   Honestly I'd rather just download stalker again or something.   DEFINITELY not worth the full £20. maybe 10-15 at most. I'm still gonna play the game for Hallway Weirdo anyway. Silly Kasia and her made up words.
[Date: 2025-02-28 | Playtime: 0h 18m | Rec: Positive] Already this feels like a solid return to the free-form immersive sim elements everyone was fearful Deus Ex stepped away from and which were so wrapped up in insane interfaces for the game Eye: Divine Cybermancy the barrier to entry was astronomical. This is a happy medium: an interface you can understand but so many options you aren't just playing a 'pew-pew' shooter. Want to climb to a new vantage? If you can see it chances are you can reach it. Want to hack the machinery of your foes at a distance? You got it. Want to turn invisible and slip by? You can do that! This is clear attention to world building and gameplay breadth over graphics, although the graphics are charming. So far so good! I bought the game, let's see where it goes...

[Date: 2025-02-27 | Playtime: 2h 12m | Rec: Negative] After playing the first 2 levels I can say for certain this game is not at all worth the money as of now. The game does look nice sure, the music and atmosphere is amazing, and the gameplay is pretty fun but, it is VERY rough. The levels I played felt hollow, devoid of any detail, and just a bit of a pain to navigate. There are no environmental pointers that help explain where you are allowed to go or where not to go. Oh but you might be thinking "well yeah cause you have freedom to explore and pick your path!" but then you go where you aren't and end up in a pit you can't get out of cause there wasn't like a simple warning sign, hell there aren't even exits signs in interiors for that moody and helpful sorta vibe. Everything is very barebones, lots of empty walls and corridors, barely any furnishings or decorative set pieces. A lot of the gun fights I fought happened out in the open with no cover besides some concrete wall or beam, singular. And when it comes to fighting enemies it is kinda a bit too easy. The way the "stealth" system is right now is broken. Lighting does NOT AT ALL WORK. You have no idea what is supposed to be shadows or lights cause none of it works right. And when it does you can cheese any gunfight you want. And when it comes to pin pointing enemies they make a noise when they hear you but good luck figuring out where they are cause if they are above or below you it will just loud like they're behind you. And the music, yeah it's good but, why does it start playing AFTER I kill everyone? Shouldn't it play whilst I'm fighting? And why does it keep playing after everyone is dead anyways, it's confusing. Player progression doesn't exsist, you don't really feel like some hitman cyborg, collecting guns and gadgets and hiding out, you just feel like Mario picking a new level.   The game is like this review, kinda not put together not so good.  5/10

[Date: 2025-02-27 | Playtime: 11h 17m | Rec: Positive] Incredibly ambitious indie immersive sim that no doubt has it's faults in the gameplay department, but the atmosphere, art direction, writing and overall vibes make it a truly one of a kind experience. This is someone's unfiltered vision, and I can't help but love it. Can easily see this becoming an all time favorite for me once it leaves early access and all the rough spots are ironed out.
[Date: 2025-02-27 | Playtime: 9h 2m | Rec: Positive] Of course, it's not an immersive sim or even a shooter - it's an art-experience, and if you treat Peripeteia in this way, then other claims (bugs, very bad AI, loss of inventory between levels) somehow lose their meaning. For some reason, the analogy with Pathologic comes to mind, which was intended to provide the player not with a “gaming” experience, but a more theatrical one, focused on visual art and performance. In that sense, Peripeteia is a great project, and basically doesn't even need to come out of early access.   All of the above is overridden by one fucking Belgrade. The most visually and scripturally impressive level, apparently, should be so firmly imprinted in the player's memory that the developers forbade saving during its passage. As a result, the smallest mistake in parkour or encounter with a new enemy with unknown AI habits sends us back again and again. Well done.  Getting back to the narrative, Peripeteia does an excellent job in terms of flirting with post-Soviet heritage, from looped Soviet TV programs on screens and household items to references to popular sci-fi writers and descriptions of alternate paths of famous historical figures (most of which are completely fucking unreadable due to the texts' fucked-up font) and much more. All this doesn't seem, as in similar other projects, to be the cringe fantasies of authors unfamiliar with the reality of the Eastern Bloc (so-called “клюква”), although it's obvious that the author was born much later, he still belongs to the native space of collective memory and treats it very carefully.
[Date: 2025-02-27 | Playtime: 5h 2m | Rec: Positive] Ситуация, как бы, странная. С одной стороны играть интересно. Есть множество мест, которые можно исследовать. Можно по разному проходить уровень, достигая цели при помощи разных NPC (удивительно). Можно находить секретки с аугментациями и оружием. Да и в целом бродить по такой версии Польши достаточно интересно, но есть тут и другая сторона.  Начну с того, что мест для исследования много, но вот только места с наградой за это самое исследование размазаны по всей локации настолько тонким слоем, что легче просто весь этот контент скипнуть, чем наткнуться на один единственный шкафчик на гигантской крыше и обнаружить, что он пустой. А некоторые ивенты будто вообще забагованы. В качестве примера: в жилом комплексе я нашёл девушку с её инвалидом отцом, который, находясь в капсуле, был подключен к питанию через кабель. И вот само ведь напрашивается, что если с ним что-то произойдёт, то от девушки последует реакция! Но нет, её не будет вообще. Хотя звук смерти, как бы, был достаточно громким, чтобы стоящая в 5 метрах от своего отца девушка его услышала. Есть шанс, конечно, что это не баг, а просто обычная недоработка. Также тут есть проблема с переносом оружия и аугментаций на следующим уровни. Ну, точнее была. Спустя некоторое время разработчики всё таки выпустили патч на перенос аугментаций. Да и в целом этого достаточно. Обидно конечно, что о пропаже оружия из инвентаря даже не предупреждают, но это в теории могут поправить в будущем, учитывая ситуацию с аугментациями. В целом то игра неплоха, даже можно смело заявить что это ИГРА. На 7/10 она точно тянет, а если учитывать, что это лишь ранний доступ, то остаётся только надеяться на лучшее, а если игра всё же станет лучше, то хайп разрабам обеспечен

[Date: 2025-02-27 | Playtime: 5h 19m | Rec: Positive] Only completed the first level so far, but it's pretty good. Found a bunch of bugs, enemies turning friendly for some reason, dialogs seemingly not updating despite the quest objective having been completed (the cryo keycard dialog was stuck as not completed, but having looked at other people playing it, showed me that the quest actually worked). There are plenty of ways to softlock yourself if you run out of energy since like any game with resource management, it doesn't regenerate even at a 0.01% rate, could be fixed if there were more boxes or anything at all to jump on top of so the boosted jump aug isn't mandatory. The shooting is "unique", feels better than most indies that have guns despite the janky animations. Having night vision instead of a flashlight is better, and it's pretty much impossible to see in some areas without using it. It consumes barely any power, but if you get stuck and start going back and forth in dark areas the power drain starts mattering. Movement feels decent, though I haven't gotten the hang of when Marie decides to grab onto things so it still doesn't feel right. Grabbing objects is busted as fuck, trying to move a box either sends it flying or drops it instantly because she can't hold onto it, even if it's one she could hold with both arms since it's small enough. Some objects also like disappearing when you drop them. Footsteps sometimes stop working, seems to only happen in some areas and also happens reliably. Enemies will shoot at your last known position (possibly also through walls) for at least a minute, maybe more, I got bored of waiting to check. They don't see the laser of your mosin, might be intentional, and it's probably for the best. It took me a minute to understand that the hacking is literally button mashing until you hit the right key, that's honestly pretty good instead of having some shitty hacking minigame like many immersive sims do. Not a fan of losing all the gear I got when I switch levels, I willingly used as little ammo as I could to keep it in time of need, just to only find myself with the stealth aug once the mission was over. The first map feels pretty big, but many areas out of the way are just there to fill space. I found a few hidden weapons and stashed ammo, but one weapon wasn't worth climbing 30 flights of stairs for, because the pistol did a better job without taking up 3 rows of inventory space. Something about the environment textures doesn't feel right to me, they feel pasted on top of the models instead of actually being part of them, but as long as the game doesn't look like Cruelty Squad, it's bearable. I'd give it a 7/10 so far. Price wise 25€ is a bit steep for what I've played, but 15€ is fair I'd say. EDIT I've reached up to Belgrade, the level design of some maps is really confusing especially because you're given no direction to where your goal is in some cases, but that's most likely intentional so I can't really blame the game.
[Date: 2025-02-27 | Playtime: 21h 37m | Rec: Positive] I finished the early Access after about 16 hours in and still have yet to complete all the alternate routes, I have very high hopes for the full release. The Tutorial Mission, Belgrade, and Karabash are absolutely dripping in Atmosphere and have some interesting story beats and characters I hope the game elaborates on in the full release. The gunplay is exactly what it needs to be, and feels delightfully janky and chaotic with a plethora of weapons being at your disposal. Scrambling for ammo to reload from enemies mid firefight will never get old. However, despite the game having some very high highs the lows are quite low as well, Memorial Tower and The Chasm felt relatively bare and/or unfinished but I understand this early access and I hope these stages are fleshed out more in the future. As well as this there is currently no way to take items from one stage to another which sometimes feels very unrewarding when you might find a rare weapon near the end of a mission or want to try out various augments on missions other than ones they are found in to try to optimise missions. I've heard an item smuggling mechanic is planned to come to the game in the future which will hopefully let you smuggle weapons and augments without becoming too overpowered letting the difficulty remain the same. Despite it's flaws I would still recommend the Early Access of Peripeteia to people, I know I had plenty of fun with it and am very excited for what the future will bring for this game :)

[Date: 2025-02-27 | Playtime: 21h 53m | Rec: Positive] Bought it after watching the trailer, spend 3 days of my life playing at it, enjoye each piece of the game (except Belgrade, like it's something really interesting when you step upon, really hard and lot of stuff understand, maybe one of my favorite but at the end it was a big pain to play at it, but love it).  Ok the graphism are not the best but you know what? It rock hard when the music is blasting in you ears and you're on a kill streak moment in the sewer, so if you enjoy game with good story and good music it's shouldn't be something that stop you to play at it. I recommand it a lot, also, am i the only one that roll is head on the keyboard just to be able to surpass all the minigame hack?

[Date: 2025-02-27 | Playtime: 9h 41m | Rec: Positive] Excellent immersive sim with good systems, an interesting slavic/soviet setting and good story premise. Levels are large and have hidden secrets but they have no visual language to guide the player to where they are supposed to be going; You will need to think outside the box to play and not always in a good way. Peripeteia starts to break down in flow and stability during the "Belgrade" and "Karabash" levels. Belgrade in particular has a boss which is an unmarked, grey sphere with the same texture as a wall. You need to figure out you are supposed to shoot it. The game is very flawed but has a distinct, unnerving charm. 7.5/10  Pros: + Objectives are fun and varied + Interesting and granular inventory/firearm system + Hacking minigame is fun + Unique setting + Unique art style + Nails the dystopian vibe + Has that "immersive sim" feel ala Dishonored series  Cons: - Stealth crutches on Map drone and Cloak abilities - Doesn't account for all possible player paths during levels which can lead to sequence breaks unintentionally - Gunfights unfairly stacked against player in later levels - AI is basic and you can outrun their turnspeed during gunfights, removing challenge - Poor level design, especially in later levels. Intended paths can feel and look incomplete. - Story starts to fall apart badly in the "Karabash" level.
[Date: 2025-02-27 | Playtime: 15h 31m | Rec: Positive] Huge fan of the aesthetic and soundtrack. Game play can be slow at times, but the combat makes up for the brief periods of downtime. World building and lore is interesting so far with the minimal time I've played. Brings back that flavor of the 2000's back to the modern age with influences from: Ergo Proxy, Texhnolyze, and Deus Ex coming to mind.

[Date: 2025-02-27 | Playtime: 9h 33m | Rec: Positive] This shit is phenomenal.  The exploration, for one. I've heard people say the levels are a bit empty, and honestly, I'd *maybe* say that about the tutorial level, but it's kind of absurd to see written about almost anything else in it. That said, this game has so much freedom of movement with its level design that the answer to "I wonder if I can get over there" is more or less literally always yes unless you have fallen down a really big pit.  The game is janky as anything and it is beautiful for it. Let nobody tell you your game needs to look like a AAA quality plastrene dream mess to be awesome. It takes simple systems and lets you get so much mileage out of them that you can basically do anything. You won't necessarily be doing those things *well*, but you can finagle your way into so many different ways of interacting with the world.  The music slaps. The artstyle is very distinctive, I think that's all been said a million times over, but I swear. despite its clear inspirations and roots, it is the most distinctive game I've had the pleasure of playing in a long time.  If you're worried about whether you'll like it, try the demo. If you have the patience for the first level, then the rest of the game will feel fucking great.

[Date: 2025-02-27 | Playtime: 1h 57m | Rec: Positive] This is a game I never thought anyone would have the courage to make. Just exploring this hellhole really puts into perspective how much fluff people give other games. "Labyrinthine", "haunting", "dystopia", all seem like hollow descriptors after playing this. What I was struck by the most is the, in some ways, rather minor warping of realistic structures and places to highlight the sheer emptiness you find in the real world. This is absolutely a mood piece, but it is also a real game as well. What made me laugh was the much much more complicated inventory system in this game, but also works to highlight the general insanity of the game. I think this game is promising and looking forward to seeing and playing more.

[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 11h 45m | Rec: Positive] If I could put a middle thumb I would, I overall love the atmosphere of the game and what it's trying to do, so I'll give it a thumbs up. I DO NOT however recommend buying this game for the time being at all. Keep in mind that this review has the potential to spoil you so consider yourself warned.  Don't get me wrong that this game has insane potential, but its the equivalent of "cooked on the surface, and poorly baked inside and underneath".   The setting is really pretty, insane atmosphere and design aswell as very natural dialogue with npc's, the gunplay is pretty nice aswell nothing too fancy but it works well, maybe some weapons have insane recoil/bad accuracy but it's nothing dramatic. The movement is also pretty nice, along with the "Augments" the game offers to give you different abilities both for combat and movement, it all combines itself to make a pretty fluid experience of gunfight & dodging bullets.  That's however all the positive I have to share for this game, as the rest is just either rushed or horrible.  The music of this game being mainly breakcore is not a bad pick, I do enjoy that genre in itself, but when it comes to said music, it really chooses some very unfortunate timing to be played. For example, im going to be walking in a completely empty hallway or take an elevator, and suddenly a turbo hyper breakcore song is gonna start to play. It fits for a fighting sequence of course, but exploring & looting the enemies while listening to an insanely high paced music is the equivalent of an Epic Battle music inside of a waiting room: It doesnt really make much sense. It wouldve been better if these songs would play during actual fights rather than being area-triggered. As the songs would play depending on where I was at, instead of if an enemy was nearby or a fight would start.  Next, the overall linearity/exploring of the game: I get that this game will not hold you by the hand by giving you some shiny yellow paint telling you where to go like a lot of games do, and I honestly respect the game for not doing that. They instead let the player figure out where to go by themselves and I honestly really appreciated it.  However, some levels were pretty comical in their approach of beating it, for example I'll be confronted with a pack of enemies, but one of them is locked behind a gate. I just gunned down all of his colleagues and he's looking at me, my first thought is to get a move on and try to maybe kill him or just avoid him. However, that same NPC, who is hostile towards me if I catch him from behind, has a questline to give you if you talk to him in front of that same gate. A questline which seemed to have bugged, as he required a PDA from one of the enemies, but when I try to give him the PDA, he tells me that I don't have what I need, even though my journal specified that I need that item for him.   Right now, I am stuck on the Belgrade level and have no other choice than to look for someone else on youtube who has beaten the level to know where the fuck I gotta go, because the game is not being very explicit in terms of telling me in which direction I should be going, where a previous level taught me that jumping from pipe to pipe will lead me to a secret pathway, the next level punishes me for it. I really don't understand that. The game does give you different approaches & paths to get to where you want to be, but some of the levels dont ?   Next is the AI: Honestly the AI is very stupid. I can just hug a wall with a 12 gauge, wait for them to arrive & blast them in the face, and going in third person allows me to see when they are within reach which makes the entire thing very easy. Some might think that you should just rush in & go guns blazing and honestly yeah, thats the correct approach since their worst enemy is a fucking wall. Would've been nice if they try to flank you or throw a grenade on you if you camp in the same spot over and over, as this would not allow "cheese" like this. Other times, they'll be aware of my presence, but decide to just run across a completely random wall, facing it for no reason & not point their gun at me until I shoot, even though I just shot half of their comrades.  Lastly, I think having some sort of choice on what to keep for the next area would be nice, as you'll be looting enemies left & right for weapons, only for the next level to start and you only have a saber & something to regen health & energy. I could understand not letting the player keep everything as they could potentially miss a new weapon in the next level since they'll already be loaded & not care about them, but at least give the player a choice on what to keep from last time, like a shotgun, a pistol, but just something more than a saber. Otherwise, you're back on fighting for scraps & having to find another firearm again, which is what happens on every level. A new patch dropped to let you keep the Augments in between levels so that's a step forward sure, but it shouldn't stop at that.  The overall confusion on exploration & quests to keep progressing the levels, the buggy AI and the very messy placement of songs leaves a "rushed game" taste for me. Im praying that future updates will get to work on some of those issues I mentioned, as this game like I said has a high potential in my opinion and I don't think it is a bad game, it was just a very very rushed game.  TLDR: Good game on surface, buggy & messy in the inside, wait for future updates.

[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 14h 7m | Rec: Positive] [h3] Стиль. Эстетика. Дизайн. Элементы, ради которых стоит играть в PERIPETEIA [/h3] Если вы такой же своеобразный эстет как и я, если вам по душе разгуливать по совето-кибер-панковским гигахрущам с величиною в карту из Daggerfall, где чрезвычайно легко затеряться имея при себе топографический кретинизм, то игра определенно займет свою нишу в вашей душе.  Местная инфраструктура - главный плюс и минус этой игры. "К черту современные веяния геймдизайна!" - сказанули авторы. И замудрили локации, на которых современному геймеру будет весьма некомфортно. Просто потому, что местные уровни настолько огромны и витиеваты, что это сбивает столку. Но, пожалуй, это именно то, за что я больше всего полюбил эту игру. Она нарушает устоявшиеся каноны. Я почувствовал впервые за долгое время дух первооткрывательства - с интересом изучаешь каждый закоулок. Ведь он обязательно куда-то приведет.   PERIPETEIA ощущается, как сон шизофреника, который начитался манги "BLAME" перед сном на фоне работающего телевизора с социалистическими программами забыв при этом вынуть наушники из ушей, в которых играют треки в BreakCore стилистике.   Но если всё же уделить внимание не самым однозначным аспектам, то сюда точно стоит внести огромное количество багов, которые порой способны ломать квестовые скрипты. Кривые анимации, на которые без слез не взглянешь. Тупейшие противники, которых по интеллекту уделает даже полный имбецил. Странная политика в отношении инвентаря, который нельзя переносить с миссии на миссию и пр.  Можно ли назвать игру той самой "мессией иммерсив-симов"? Не совсем. Игра, благодаря структуре своих заданий, имеет чрезвычайно внушительную вариативность в способе достижения цели. В обучающем прологе я насчитал как минимум 3 способа прохождения главной задачи. И это, скажу я вам, круто. Но в остальном всё выглядит весьма скромно. Не хватает деталей и глубины. Некоторые механики, которые предлагает игра, вовсе не востребованы.   Игра своеобразная, не каждому она понравится. Все же слишком уж она выглядит кривенько на данный момент. Игра очень, очень чудаковатая. Её философию примет не каждый. Но даже так своих людей она точно найдет.  У игры большое будущее. Если её зачесать, прилизать, хорошенько вымыть обновлениями - выйдет нечто великое.   Я влюбился в эту игру. Даже не смотря на то, что проблем у неё хватает сполна. Мой личный Guilty pleasure.   Если вы желаете переползать с одного гигахруща на другой по ржавым трубам под дождем попутно слушая треки Sewerslvt - то игра однозначно для вас.

It's incredibly janky and the world feels really lifeless, nothing is explained and the mechanics rarely make sense and often violate the "principle of least astonishment." To me it's fun, quirky, and has a great atmosphere, but it has a few glaring enjoyment issues that need to be ironed out before I can honestly recommend it to other people.   Thankfully this game has been in development for 5 years now and only just entered early access so I don't expect it to stagnate or be abandoned, so I have faith to turn this into a resounding YES in the future.

[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 28h 19m | Rec: Negative] You know how the devs say they've been inspired by Deus Ex, Stalker and E.Y.E? Well, it's certainly like E.Y.E in a sense - with all the jank tuned up to eleven and anything fun cut down to minimum.   If you come in here expecting deep emergent gameplay from an interplay of well-designed mechanics making you go "huh, now that's clever!" — don't. The game might possibly trick you into that impression with several prescripted routes you can go about to solve a mission (That you more randomly stumble upon rather than figure out and pursue purposefully), but the actual gameplay involved has next to zero variety.  Even something as bread and butter as stealth (Thief as one inspirations too, remember?) is so poorly designed it's not actually a viable option: the actual in-game lightning does not correlate at all as to what the game considers to be a shade, invisibility empties out your reserves just after a few seconds, and the level design often forgets that it *probably* should give you another route of entry other than going guns blazing through the front door. Did I mention there's a whole budget Return to the Cathedral horror mission with forced stealth and enemies overdosed on crack later on, by the way?   Augmentations are what appears to be the game's imsim toolset and for what they are, they're extremely underwhelming. The vast majority of them need too much energy, have too narrow a niche and even within it have too small an impact to warrant ever actually using. Okay, this one lets you throw heavy objects – but is it of any use outside of the optional tank section the same level you get it? Okay, this one lets you dual-wield weapons – but with the ammo scarcity why would you ever use it over simply headshotting enemies even with something like AK-47 that actually does get regular ammo drops? Even keeping them in your pocket in case their niche ever does come up is a questionable choice as they, for some reason, take up space in your inventory that could've been used for more useful things like extra ammo. Which is also quite damning in light of the augmentations being, thus far, the *only* long-term reward for exploration. Pretty much the only ones you'll actually use are the two default ones  – nightvision, because you often can't see anything without it, and the movement booster, because running and jumping around the countless megastructures without it is excruciating.  The only thing outside of these that actually felt like it shook up the gameplay in any meaningful way was the needle gun weapon giving you an actual tool for clever traversal. On a lucky day when the devs decide to give it to you on that level, that is. Otherwise, the game plays just like an extremely budget shooter with a joke of an AI, gunplay somehow even worse than Deus Ex from decades ago, and some parkour thrown into the mix.  When you get to shoot, that is. Because the devs want you to keep running through endless emtpy hallways while the (buggy) breakcore plays in the background to keep soaking in the *vibes* and *aesthetics*. As, apparently, immersive sim is when you keep going up the same staircase with the same poorly-textured assets at the same pointlessly gargantuan empty level for a solid ten minutes and holding back from offing yourself out of tedium. Maybe the point is *immersing* you into the experience of being a Pole? But I already went through that phase with Pathologic as a wee child, so I'm not really about to be gaslit by some shallow "mood" into thinking a subpar experience is something transcendent.   To wrap up my wall of text with something, underpinning all of this is one fundamental issue of a schizophrenic identity. As far as I can see, Peripeteia appears to try to be all of the following: 1. A classic imsim with tight resource management, a variety of mechanics and tools with mindful, highly interactive level design for the player to get creative with.  2. A pure exploratory experience with swathes of space void of any gameplay interactions, meaningless pretty much on every metric beyond aesthetic one. 3. A psychosis-induced daydream about walking through a dead industrial hellscape of megastructure commieblocks in out-of-bounds PS1 cyber Eastern Europe.  It somehow did not occur to the devs how inherently dysfunctional a polycule of these parties would be. Reconciling the first two would already be a tall order for an experienced team, but now there's also the third actively working against both. As such, you end up with an imsim where the core gameplay mechanics are broken jank, content is spread extremely thin over the megastructural loaf of incoherent ("dream-like") level design, exploring which is mechanically unrewarding. At the same time, you also end up with an "exploratory experience" that is visually uninteresting and artistically meaningless – because while the backrooms commieblocks might sound cool in your head, all of the crumbling megastructures and tubes and bridges and hallways containing nothing and leading nowhere repeated ad nauseam for an entire game just all meld together into one grey mass.

[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 13h 46m | Rec: Positive] [h3] Shortest way to describe the game is this. [/h3] Deus Ex meets Thief meets Cyberpunk meets Hitman meets Stalker meets a dystopian Midwestern, Eastern, wherever Europe. And Russians. And a bit of wonkiness. It's like Bethesda's level of acceptable wonkiness, but without being Bethesda! WHAT A DEAL! [url=https://90s.graphics/about/] if you want to read something that's more well put together, read the official website of the game here. [/url] otherwise, i recommend stopping here. perhaps consider getting the game!  [h3] Best way to describe this is what you'll be reading below. [/h3]  [b] Basics: [/b] - Peripeteia is an immersive semi-open world "hardcore" boomer-esque styled video game with a handful of mechanics inspired by multiple different popular games like the ones I mentioned above. In heart, the game feels and behaves like it were developed in the early 2000s, but with modern tweaks to make it smoother. If you want to know more about the game's lore and setting, read the game's description itself. or that link I posted above.  [b] Gameplay: [/b] - The navigation gameplay is somewhat why I mentioned the game being "hardcore" and "boomer-esque". If you have a low attention span and are used to easier kinds of navigation within video games that gives you a marker or the infamous "yellow paint" solution to help you head to the next place you need to be at, Peripeteia will not show you the way to go. By talking to NPCs, they will give directions, and everything beyond that is up to you and your intuition and navigation skills. I myself was left sometimes wondering, "am I supposed to be here, or am I, like, out-of-bounds?" when in reality it was all nicely put together, meaning yes, I was able to be there, and I didn't cheese the game. The big thing that this game has, is its awesome vertical movement. EVERY ledge can be grabbed, and strafed alongside of. If you stick a sharp melee weapon into the wall horizontally, you can grab and climb onto it! I find it super satisfying, and there are plenty of cool interactions and opportunities that involve this in the game. There are many, many secrets laid about that can be solved with this. As an avid Psychopomper, this game has a lot of things hidden from you. - The combat gameplay offers a wide variety of styles you may choose from. If you value stealth, this game treats it a lot like the classic thief games, where darkness is your friend and stealthy weapons will keep your presence unbeknownst to anyone and everyone. With the help of weapon attachments, including silencers, as well as special cyborg stealthy equipment (Cloak) and a usable flying drone, you can become the ultimate predator. Or perhaps you prefer going loud, because if you do,[strike] you're lame [/strike] there is a plethora of potent weaponry such as LMGs, explosives, and more aggressive cyborg implants such as Enhanced Speed, Duel Wielding, and Enhanced Strength. The freedoms of combat in this game is a lot like Hitman. - The story gameplay gives you a lot of freedom as well. The game offers multiple choices that you may decide to choose to benefit a certain person, faction, or perhaps only yourself. This involves dialogue choices and in-game physical choices that you make. This is where the RPG segment of the game comes into play, and it has definitely hooked me into this bizarre and grim world. And no it's not like a Detroit Become Human kind of deal. i think.  [b] Final Thoughts: [/b] It's quirky. Can be pretty wonky at times. But I find it all acceptable. The game's immersion was enough to convince me that I needed to play this game front to back. It has a really special charm to it that ended up controlling my hand to immediately purchasing the game the same day it was released. It's a modern game with a dated feel to it, and me being someone that has an open mind, a bit of patience, and a fondness for PS1-styled graphics and older game design choices, this game has actually just become one of my favorite games. Anyway, thank you for reading. If you liked reading this, you're welcome. If you didn't like reading this, why did you read all of this lol.

[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 28h 42m | Rec: Positive] Peripeteia is a wonderful piece of outsider art in the form of a FPS-RPG immersive sim. whether if you like it or not will depend on this:  do you like Francis E. Dec's rants? do you like the Blade Runner aesthetic and Viktor Antonov's (RIP) early concept art for Half-Life 2?  are you a huge, taffer-freak Thief fan? have you played System Shock 1 and 2 at least twenty times?  do you love Warren Spector's Deus Ex and wish its specific brand of paranoid fiction was taken up to 11?  do you like Phillip K. Dick's writings and his themes of alienation and altered states of being?  do you like EYE: Divine Cybermancy and wish its level design philosophy was applied to another game?  do you want to save misunderstood eldritch terrors and give them a second chance? do you like guns to a worrying degree and wish someone made an tactical shooter with the same amount of guns Brigade E5: New Jagged Union or 7.62: High Caliber has? do you want to get interrupted mid-sentence by an autistic railfan, correcting you on what the specific name of a train is?   if so, then you should probably play this. semper games

[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 22h 6m | Rec: Negative] Je ne peux pas recommander ce jeu. Outre les bugs qui sont normaux pour un accès anticiper. Mais dans le design du jeu, là j'ai des profondes critiques.  Le choix du low poly est tout à fait acceptable, mais la qualité de texture est dégueulasse, ce n'est pas beau, j'ai l'impression que c'est juste là pour différentier le vrais du faux, toutes les textures ont une saturation qui rend toutes les détails floues.  Le level disgn est moyen. Pour chaque zone "d'intérêt" il y a 1-3 chemins avec un choix de camp(pol/com) s'impose. La taille des bâtiments, leur verticalité sont bien mais nuit à là l'exploration dans le sens où chaque salles sont un peu vide(manque de meuble) donc tu rentres dans la salle, tu crames si c'est un cul-de-sac.  L'IA est nul à chier, tous les PNJ ont 2 modes patrouille / attaque et l'attaque, c'est du putain de tout droit MDR. Je ne vois pas de system d'arbre de décision développé. (Théorie : je crois que des PNJ sont en mode attaque, mais sont empêcher de tire pas un mur invisible pour laisser leur parlée pour des quêtes)  Suite au précèdent, avec cette ia, le gun fight est moyen. Le tire est bien mais pour tiré des cibles qui bouge vers toi dont certains qui ont speed 3 est qui s'écrase contre le mur comme des bagnoles, d'accord.  La narration ça va mais la continuité de l'histoire, tu passes à amnésique à l'appartement puis prochain niveau, genre pourquoi ? En plus sans ton stuff.  La LUMIÈRE, c'est un jeu d'infiltration pourquoi y a plein d'endroits la texture est claire je suis dans l'ombre et inversement, pourquoi ? il y a des endroits où je suis dans l'ombre mais par rapport a l'ennemi, on me voit grâce au fond claire.   Donc le jeu n'excelle en rien, la seule chose d'impressionnante, c'est la direction artistique. L'ia n'a pas de "planning based system"  ou au moins un cover system ou encore moins ajouter plus d'action dans l'arbre de décision. C'est du low poly pourquoi il a pas plus de [b]vrai[/b] bâtiments, de meuble, de PNJ, de chemin et de meilleur texture. La lumière devrait être du simple path tracing vue que c'est du low poly. Donc c'est quoi cette gestion des ressources pour visé plus haut de ce qu'ils sont capables.  Ils ont dit 1 an la sortie. Donc en 1 an pour passer de jeu d'artiste au vrai jeu. Que le destin soit avec vous.

Most weird places you have access to have some sort of thing it leads to, a secret, or an alternative way to end the mission. I like it, curiosity is rewarded with items. The music is great, only thing I'd wish is for the cassette player to carry over between missions, so I can play the EP 1 in the apartment wherever I go
[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 1h 56m | Rec: Positive] I don't even need to completed this game to make this review, this is absolutely amazing, its everything I could've dreamed of. Seems like its inspired by hl2 beta and oh man how I personally wish hl2 beta existed, would've had the best atmosphere out of any game... well except silent hill 4 or any of the original silent hill games of course but anyway This is super close to what I would like to see in a cyberpunk game

[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 19h 50m | Rec: Positive] As someone that thoroughly played all of the game older demos I already expected some jank which doesn't bother me a lot for the kind of game it is.   The expansive levels and player choices in either dialogues, objectives, how to tackle those objectives, where to go, etc. really keeps you hooked.   All that is great but on top of that it presents a pretty interesting story for Marie and the factions involved with her (albeit unfinished as of now).  The early access includes 5 complete levels (excluding the hub aka Marie's appartment) which took me around 20h of playtime to complete tho I explored a lot and tried to find and interact with the maximum I could.  With all that said I think it's a good choice for anyone craving an expansive immersive sim with huge level design, this is exactly what I've been craving for a while.
[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 2h 54m | Rec: Negative] in it's current state, i wouldn't recommend. the style and ambiance is great. shooting and movement is pretty fun but the world is lifeless and not really any secrets to find. the loot you find can't be taken to the next leve. There's alot of dead ends with nothing in them and a long treck back to wherever you actually need to go with nothing in between. lots of places to softlock yourself and waste a ton of your time.  still down to support small developers but I hope they can do more with this game.
[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 20h 16m | Rec: Positive] Very good and original concept, very good work mister developers, am loving it, the atmosphere, the art and the freedom of the gameplay are incredible, keep it up, it is a great project.

[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 25h 2m | Rec: Positive] It's only in early access but so far it is one of my favorite games of all time, the atmosphere is great, I love getting lost in the levels for the first few hours before being able to pretty much piece its whole layout, besides you only get lost in the level if you want to, usually from where you get the quests, you get enough pointers that you could head directly to the quest objective if you wish.  There is a lot of walking, which might put off some people, but I personally love it because of the visuals and the atmosphere, and even then, it's a lot of walking only the first time you play a level, one part of the magic of this game is that you usually have multiple ways to end the levels, ranging from taking a few hours to a mere minutes, best example of that is the first level of the game which is so far imo the best one, and best of all, it's included in the demo of the game.  You only get to keep your augments and money after each level ( Except one where you lose everything unless i've missed something ) but I think that's for the best as it would kinda ruin the exploration of the other levels if you just kept your guns  from the earlier levels and would just turn the game into call of duty after the first level if you explored thoroughly.  Gunplay might seem a bit jank at first, but it's what i'd call purposefully jank, the guns handling is kinda bad, but i'm pretty sure it's meant to be that way, the game would have been way too easy ( and tbf I don't even think it's hard ) if the guns handled like any other classic shooter.  Another great thing from this game is that you can basically grab onto every horizontal surface, and I really mean any, ( so many that i got out of bounds once because of this ) which just complements another thing I love about this game which is how much vertical it is, if you see a place, unless it's in the skybox, you can most likely climb there.  The very few things I didn't like about the game, I got used to by playing more, and it honestly was just a few nitpicks, the only issue I really have with the game is that stealth is broken if you've got any weapon with a silencer ( And even without in some areas with good verticality ) but stealth is at the same time very inconsistent, because in most games with stealth mechanics, I know instantly when i'm visible or not, in this game, there are some areas where lighting is basically the same a few steps father, but somehow I end up being visible as if I was right in front of a light source while visually i'm in the complete darkness, that is pretty much the only thing I would like to see fixed about this game.  And for last, another reason why I love this game, is because it's pretty much the only game ever since i'm not a kid anymore that genuinely scared me, this is probably the only game that I know of that allows you to save freely whenever you want, but in a specific mission, they take that away from you, only allowing you to save in two very specific areas ( that i've found at least ) and even if they didn't, i'd have probably been savescumming at that part because of the enemies and the atmosphere, but the developers knew what they were doing, and even if it's unlikely, I really do hope I get scared again like that when the full game comes out, as much as I dread seeing "You feel unsafe" in the upper left corner of my screen, at the same time, I really want to see it again.  But what I'd recommend, if you wonder about getting, this game, just play the demo, it's got what is the best level in the game, the first one, and i'm guessing it's because it was the most polished level ( even tho a lot more walking endlessly than the others except one ) and if you like the game from that, it's pretty much just as good.
[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 49h 13m | Rec: Positive] Одуряющая прикормка для всех рыбок изголодавшихся по E.Y.E. и недоедающими эстетику HL2 Beta  Буквально как и сказано на сайте: это не просто игра - это целый мир, в котором можно раствориться. Мир сотканный из многочисленных источников вдохновения, которые формируют у этого проекта ярковыраженную индивидуальность, которая не многим придётся по вкусу. Если по стилистическим решениям у многих останутся положительные эмоции, то вот с геймплейными уже беда бедовая. Для людей привыкших к геймдизайну Глаза тут не будет практически ничего удивительного(кроме Белграда), во многом это ужатый Глаз, но с меньшим количеством раздражающих вещей по общим ощущениям. Но так как среди источников вдохновения здесь есть Splinter Cell и Thief, а один из основных это первый Deus Ex, то у игры как минимум присутсвует перечень и иных систем, которые совершенно непреспособлены к игре на данный момент. В миссиях где игроку даётся полная свобода проблем с недоработанными или корявыми механиками нет, развлекаешься подходящим тебе инструментарием, но вот когда один раз заставят прибегнуть к иному подходу, возникнет лишь фрустрация(благов всего раз)  Сюжетно пока нечего сказать кроме "интригующе", игра крайне поломана по скриптам и квестам, разработчики на данный момент приоритизируют починку багов, только потом сядут за полировку квестиков. Но количество развилок на уровнях поражает, приятно обрадовался когда поговорил со случайным бомжом и он позволил мне сократить крупный участок игры. Миссии просто огромны и хочется попробовать все варианты их прохождения  Если запрыгнуть за порог вхождения, то непосредственно играть в это крайне весело. Потенциал у проекта огромный, очень жду полного релиза и буду с энтузиазмом наблюдать за каждым апдейтом!  Хотелось бы ещё полного ребаланса системы инвентаря, при которой все айтемы не будут теряться на следующей миссии. Очень не хочется терять инструменты для более весёлого травёрсала или какие-то редкие вещи по типу барабана для калашика, а уж тем более ВСС Винторез, к которому идёт всего ОДИН магазин на миссию. Преступно! Не создалось ощущение что сохранение инвентаря повредило бы опыту, напротив, менеджить инвентарь было бы куда веселее будь с ним больше проблем, сам я на миссиях редко с таковыми сталкивался. А как баланс можно время от времени их обнулять такими ситуациями как в Белграде  p.s. спасибо разработчикам за ключик в ту же секунду запроса
[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 14h 30m | Rec: Positive] high tier immersive sim, the player freedom is actually nuts. it's jank that requires you to connect dots, remember routes, and revel in its utmost scale and beautiful skyboxes. the emptiness feeds into the atmosphere with so many long stretches, miles high buildings, and concrete labyrinths, shining in neon hues. you have a general idea of where to go, and treacherously tall skyscrapers to climb or plummet from.   adventure and dialogue first, combat second, and immensely polish. i already love urban exploration in my adventure games, and the verticality complements it well. insane inventory tetris, lovingly clunky weapons, and a roster of amazing shotguns. i used a gun for almost everything, but there are many ways other than guns to treat situations. it's worth the most going in completely blind and with time and patience on your hands. the game's got heart and soul every which way, and i'm looking forward to more!

[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 17h 22m | Rec: Positive] peripeteia is an immersive sim in every sense of the word. zero hand-holding, you are raw dogging exploration and let me tell you - its incredibly refreshing. however, it is important to understand that the game is THE definition of jank in its current state. this is early access though, so it can only get better from here!  all of the levels are incredibly expansive and all have multiple points of interest, offering different routes. if you can see it, you can go there. there are no invisible walls or barriers preventing you from accessing any part of the map. you are quite literally given so much freedom to approach your objective that you just end up becoming lost.  that's the most common criticism of the game right now; getting lost. it doesn't give you any indication of where you're meant to go, only vague notes and dialogue from NPCs. while it IS a nice change of pace from the typical 'go here' quest markers, the maps are way too big to not have clear directions.  most negative reviews also seem to be bringing up the fact that your inventory does not carry over from levels. this is strange at first and was off-putting, but it's clear that the levels are not designed for you to have an entire armoury going into it. it's designed for a Metal Gear Solid esque on-site-procurement playstyle where you have to scavenge around for equipment. you got the drop on an AK guard? great, now you have his weapon with whatever ammo that's left in it. you're never meant to be a one-man (woman) army, instead the game wants you to either fight for your life or avoid conflict completely.  i haven't even gotten to the aesthetics yet. everything has a very bleak, brutalist design, reflecting the concrete apartment complexes of the USSR but with a cyberpunk flair. the combination of the styles results in these imposing megalithic cityscapes that make you feel tiny. there is also an underlying theme of bodyhorror and surrealism which is conveyed through the narrative and through certain set-pieces which I will not be spoiling.  the soundtrack is honestly insane too. there is an incredible mix of ambient genres; jungle, breakcore, shoegaze etc. most surprisingly, the majority of the tracks (if not all) are produced by various indie music artists. i did not expect to hear sewerslvt or pisca while playing if i have to be honest. haven't seen an indie game with a line-up quite like this. the vibes are immaculate.  if i had to compare peripeteia with an existing game, i guess E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy comes close. they both share a surrealist atmosphere and are insanely ambitious. there's the obvious Deus Ex comparison as well.  overall, i would say that it is completely worth the price to support the dev. peripeteia shows so much potential in a genre that is slowly losing its meaning. we need more games like this.  tl;dr, great immersive sim, has huge potential. very jank right now though, only buy if you want to support the dev.  belgrade is the the best worst level in the game.

[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 5h 21m | Rec: Positive] An unexpectedly good I-sim that accurately portrays an average day in Poland. Definitely seems to be more of a shooter than a stealth game but maybe I'm just bad and it's still plenty fun anyway. Other than that, it's kind of hard to describe what the game actually plays like but if you're interested in I-sims you'll probably enjoy it. Also, robot girl supremacy
[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 21h 3m | Rec: Positive] [h1]БЕЛГРАД - ну пиздец конечно сон собаки в пьяном бреду, а не уровень.... [/h1]  [h2]PERIPETEIA[/h2]  Вообще иммерсив симы странные, игры, в которых игрок должен получить удовольствие от всего понемногу - стелс, стрельба, решения, локации и продвижение по ней, а главное игрок должен сам получать удовольствие от того, что его стараются не вести за ручку. Gloomwood, Thief, Systemshock, они все скомканы в одну кучу и предлагают разные начинки, но основу держат одну - как игрок пожелает подойти к решению задачи.  [h3]вот тут наш новичок и вступает в игру[/h3]  Перипетия в плане прохождения задач дает большой простор, наверное даже слишком большой, отчего игрок, не игравший в такое, теряется на ровном месте, а значит может сразу выйти из неё и больше не устанавливать, потому что тенденция современных игр совсем другая, она не плохая или хорошая, она просто такая, как есть.  Сперва стоит упомянуть локации игры, так как это её, наверное, главная "фишка". В большинстве случаев это ОЧЕНЬ ОГРОМНЫЕ локации из зданий с кучей проходов и добраться куда-то не составляет труда [i](в большинстве случаев)[/i]. Однако понять зачем и почему игроку туда надо помогают NPC, которые предлагают квесты и решение может быть от убей цель, до добыть информацию, передать нужным лицам, полученная информация еще не решение задачи и получить новые цели (КРОМЕ СУКА БЕЛГРАДА)  Дизайн же тут, как смесь совковых гигахрущей, темного неба из Deus ex и японских связок медных кабелей из Лейн, все это, опять же, в очень огромных масштабах, что одновременно и добавляет шершавого шарма и одновременно раздражает. При этом локации могут перетекать друг с другом в абсолютно неизвестных местах - из одного конца вернуться в начало локации. В этом плане игра отлично держит планку, [b]почти[/b] (да белград?).  Графика у игры, мягко скажем, своеобразно ленивая. А вот про свет в игре могу сказать одно - вот бы видеть что-то без ПНВ, сделать бы его не требующим энергии.  ГГ тут выступает в роли киборга [strike](вставьте слово шутку)[/strike], на подобии 2b из Nier, тоже думает, осмысливает, бухает водяру с пивом и пользуется большим арсеналом вооружения. Имеются импланты вроде быстрого передвижения, манипуляции над мобами и камуфляж для невидимости, и на все это уходит энергия, а тут с ней есть проблемы, потому что ресурс в игре не так часто предоставляется для восстановления этой энергии.  Вооружение в игре - типичные пушки копии ак, галилы, спасы и все в этом духе, однако для оружия надо самостоятельно снаряжать магазины и вешать обвесы, поэтому тут отношение к оружию более деликатное. Стрельба же из них нууууууууу, ну паршивая будем честны, это просто улетающие в воздух от отдачи стволы, у которых импакт от попадания в большем случае неинтересный.  NPC в игре это просто болванчики с довольно, бывает, интересным чтивом, но в большинстве случаев просто массовка, тут тоже нечего добавить. Противники в игре тоже самое - они тупые, непонятные, сломанные, глупые, описывайте, как хотите, но вот солдаты советов учтем в белграде  Квесты тут уже поинтереснее, как и выше вкратце описанное, предлагаются разные подходы - от мирного, до мирного решения не будет, и так может быть с несколькими квестами, например в туториале можно прости 3 способами: найти "лампочку" для бармена, получить данные с радио вышки, сдать бармена местной фракции, может быть есть ещё способы, однако уже это подгоняет игрока к исследованиям карты, простор есть, искать интересно, тут большой + в копилку игры.  Ну вроде все рассказано, а теперь к проблемам или своеобразности геймдизайна разработчиков данной игры (ранний доступ все равно дает поиграть в игру, а значит надо и описывать что плохо) Начнем с того, что разработчики ласково шлют игрока на все 4 стороны без карты и говорят исследуй как хочешь и где хочешь, запоминай маршруты и получай удовольствие, и в вышесказанном было написано, что такой подход отпугивает игрока, который привык к маркерам и карте. Тут такого нет в помине, в игре очень легко потеряться и сбиться с маршрута, однако бывает "ахуй" момент, когда идешь куда-то, выходишь из другого туннеля и оказываешься там, где уже был, офигеваешь и радуешься, а может нет, не всем нравится такой подход, но я лично люблю такое, как в dark souls 1.  [b]ИГРА ОЧЕНЬ СЫРАЯ[/b] В ней куча багов, много недоделанности, арсенал бывает просто не стреляет, где-то похерены скрипты, БЕЛГРАД ТАК ВООБЩЕ КУСОК НЕПОНЯТНО ЧЕГО, В некоторых локациях ощущается просто пустотность и непонимание "нахера и зачем надо". Некоторые решения разработчиков озвучены как их личное видение на игру. Простите меня, однако не переносить оружие между уровнями и оставлять только импланты, ладно хоть оно продается автоматически и возвращается в виде деняк, но зачем мне эти деньги, если у вас торговцы продают с каждым уровнем все меньше лута? Я вот уже ушел с туториала на сумму в 4000 местной валюты, а что я с ней могу сделать? Купить АК на 30 патрон и пару аптечек - не густо это мягко сказано  В локациях бывает такой просак происходит, есть в игре лифты и тележки, но тогда вопрос, а что сложно сделать кнопочку, которая возвращает лифты в исходную позицию, а не остаются окончательно? Бывает просто хочешь вернуться, а все, больше в этот лифт ты не сядешь. В локациях бывает часто такое, что вообще не вдупляешь че делать, куда идти, в цель непонятна, "нахер я сюда залез", много такого будет происходить. Все это тот самый оправданный геймдизайн авторов игры, однако я с таким не согласен и считаю, что можно это все доделать и приделать  [b]Отдельно про звук - сразу говорю, в игре частенько будете в прямом смысле ахуевать от звуков местных солдат и их выстрелов, они бывают к хуям разрывают перепонку своими звуковыми сопровождениями, поэтому ставьте сразу звук тише на мобов[/b]  Ура я дошел до самой важной части - БЕЛГРАД Вкратце? Скипайте к херам эту дичь, настолько она вам принесет боли в первый раз при изучении локации БЕЗ почти что СОХРАНЕНИЙ. Все начинается отлично в локации, нагнетается атмосфера, хоррор, звуки, локации. По началу очень доставило удовольствие, пока не дошло до части с сферой. Надеюсь, когда разработчики проходили эту локацию они испытали всю ту недоумеваемость от происходящего и также страдали при первом прохождении, назвать это все нормальным геймдизайном невозможно. В локации имеются бесполезные ответвления, которые кажутся путем, но вводят в заблуждение, мобы в данной локации делают лютейший EAR RAPE и носятся как угорелые , их много, они бьют больно, в локации со сферой ломается скрипт с солдатами, которые должны помочь, но при загрузке сохранения они все мертвы и поэтому сфера с 3 компьютерами превращается в адскую дрочильню, куклы это отдельный треш, которые летят в тебя на всей скорости и бьют очень больно, финальный босс - ебучая сфера, которую надо ломать, но куклы тебя убьют быстрее, а близко к ней нельзя подойти, поэтому приходится уничтожать сферу до скрипта с активацией босса, боеприпасов почти что не хватает, а против сферы дробовик бесполезен и лучше иметь на какой-нить винторез патроны..... Я говорил про тупики? А стой там ямы ещё, а хер пойми что и куда. И это тот самый БЕЛГРАД Понятное дело, что после первого прохождения локация становится куда проще, но тут показывается весь тот самый геймдизайн разработчиков игры и их халатность, надеюсь они переделают весь этот бред и игроку не придется идти через начальный проход или прыгать с обрыва до скрипта окончания уровня, ну, потому что все сделано плохо.  Музычка у игры просто кайф, тут прям похвалить только команду можно.  Стоит ли внимания перипетия? Наверное да, все-таки я получил удовольствие от игры, и я люблю гипергигантизм с такой атмосферой. Ранний доступ и сделан, чтобы игру доделывать, слушать игроков и решать проблемы игры, надеюсь разработчики доделают данный проект, отполируют его, уберут этот EAR RAPE у солдатов, пофиксят пушки и выпустят, так называемый, [i]hidden gem[/i], в который будет приятно играть и проводить в ней время.

[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 35h 18m | Rec: Positive]  I don't have many words to describe this game. I have too many. It is unfinished yet after 20 hours (probably includes my time with the demo) I haven't finished the third level out of 5 available. You can, if you'd like, finish it in 6 or so. But I want to drink in all that is to offer. Play the demo. You'll know if this game is for you or not.

[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 10h 39m | Rec: Positive] I think the game is very good I was just confused about what the goal was exactly  no spoilers, but there's several missions you can do in the game, and when you do "new game" you're just doing the first mission which is basically accessing the train so you can leave, and when you do get to that train you get to access the other missions.   The current mission is basically a playground of quests and objectives to do. But you don't carry inventories between missions, so just use what you have when you have it if you want to, don't worry about hoarding.  You don't have to do the "quests" in the maps, but they give you objectives within the "playground" as an excuse to look around talk to npcs and kill bad guys. very fun

[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 10h 14m | Rec: Positive] It's so good. If you like any of these series at all you should at the very least try the demo. -Deus Ex -Stalker -Fallout -E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy -Cyberpunk 2077 I don't even know what to say besides try it honestly, the demo will get you hooked. The atmosphere is great. The levels are massive and reward exploration. It has the best hacking minigame possibly ever. The gunplay is satisfying. It's one of the most perfect jank games I have ever played. Some things may take getting used to but once you get the hang of it the experience is fantastic.
[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 12h 11m | Rec: Positive] For past few years I’ve played two demos of this game and can tell that I really wanted to play more.  Slavjank at it finest: stiff controls, very dark environment, almost to no directions, bugs etc. Main issue is a bug with save/loading states: when you kill some enemies, complete objectives and try to load before it, not everything reverts to that state - you need to go in main menu and load from it.  And jumping/falling ladders is kind of derpy. But. Big open environments (I like that they are kind of empty), free movement in it (I mean it, almost everywhere you can take your path). ATMOSPHERE. From neverending rain to post-apocalyptic backgrounds, big skyscrapers and endless stairs. Interesting lore (it’s about slavs!).  I really like that you lose inventory through missions, because it’s FREEING from caring about what to keep, and what to use (play fun, not play safe), not hoarding useless junk (OP guns to the end of the game etc.) and use everything according to situation. I may change my opinion on it when get to mission 4 (what people say in another reviews) but it is what it is. Music. Story. Stupidly loud and satisfying guns. In summary: Today Peripeteia is in a raw state (early access) and when it be POLISHED (ha, pun) will be spectacular game for niche auditory. PS: blocky ladas are the best.

[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 2h 42m | Rec: Negative] I don’t normally write reviews… normally I just give a thumbs up emoji or a 100 and smash the recommend and call it a day..  However in my short time with with release + the demo I feel inclined to give my two cents on my brief experience.  Ultimately in its current state I cannot recommend it.  The atmosphere is incredible. But the world is huge and empty there’s nothing to fill it. It feels very lifeless.   Currently, your inventory (with exception of your augments) does not transfer from one level to the next.  Which makes exploration pointless really.   The lack of controller support is also a pretty big deterrent at the moment.  As 90% of all my gaming is done on a steam deck.  I have many more thoughts however, I’m not the most articulate.    At the end of the day, I don’t regret buying this as I’m glad to support smaller developers making interesting games.  This game does have so much potential. But as it currently stands. For me. The game is far too incomplete to recommend.  I really hope I can adjust my rating in the future.
[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 18h 28m | Rec: Positive] "Pay out or I'll throw this PDA out the window like a baby in hong kong."  Very fun game, if you don't mind getting lost. A lot. Lot to find in each of the levels, even in places that really feel like you've gone out of bounds.  Still pretty buggy, haven't had anything gamebreaking, but, keep that quicksave button handy.
[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 23h 43m | Rec: Positive] this is literally imsim jesus
[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 9h 10m | Rec: Positive] The game is beyond broken in several ways (general bugs expected in an EA title, terrible AI, various jank, unfinished systems), but for some god forsaken reason, it KEEPS ME IN and does NOT let me go.  It has to be the mood. It has to be the honestly already stellar level design. It has to be the atmosphere and OST. There is something in here.  Someone more pretentious than me would probably call it "soul". I don't know man, I just really like it. Hope it gets every patch and fix that it needs, and even if it comes out on the other side being a little rough, if the main issues are adressed and hammered out, this could get into the very reduced pantheon of im-sims. If Cruelty Squad did it, this can do it too.  Keep up the good work.  
[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 1h 41m | Rec: Positive] I have barely scratched the surface of this game but initial thoughts are that this game is just wildly impressive. The maps are almost incomprehensibly large and incredibly vertical, with a lot of stuff to find. Barely any hand holding so you actually have to pay attention to the environment and the guidance that npcs give you. Gameplay feels really good all around. The setting is dark, dreary and just right up my alley. Reminds me a lot of EYE Divine Cybermancy actually, which is a compliment lol. Looking forward to keep playing!

[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 9h 50m | Rec: Positive] The best open world game I've played in awhile.  Now, to call this game OPEN WORLD isn't fully true... the game runs off "Missions". You have a sort of "Hub" house, where you select the next mission (or replay previous missons), you arrive in a set area to explore, talk to people, find the main task, and then leave.   So, its not really 100% Open world? but Honestly? Thats great!! Open world games suffer from being TOO OPEN, and end up being more overwhelming than fun.  But the way THIS game works? Its AMAZING. You get little (huge) sized chunks of area to explore, without it being over stimulating.   You can climb just about anywhere, with very simple and fun climbing mechanics. You just have to really plan out where your going to go, or else there's a very small chance you could get soft locked (this is very rare).  There's a few bumps and bugs? Like... in mission 3? Where you have to clear an apartment block of reds, or help the reds blow up a reactor? If you Kill the Commissar, before killing his soldiers, you will trigger a skippable dialogue cutscene. Which wouldn't be an issue at all, if the soldiers weren't still alive, and hunting you. So while you sit defenseless reading text, you can get jumped by reds (this happened to me twice, almost three times).   THEN, in the same mission, you are tasked to kill a tank cllumn. A TANK, COLUMN. ALONE. I stared at the text box for so long lol, thinking "what". Until going to the tanks to "face" them down.  I must have died at least 20 times trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do here. And as of writing this review, i still have not completed that mission yet lol. Are you supposed to find anti tank explosives? an Anti Tank rifle? i have no clue dude. That mission put a serious stop to my fun.  Otherwise? love this game to death so far!!  Only other complaint id have, is that the Iron sights?? Terrible, awful. I understand the guns are supposed to be low poly? but MAN. I always end up just using the hipfire reticle, because missing shots in this game is seriously punishing.  If the devs are reading this?? AMAZING work. Beautiful, Ive been keeping up with this game for some time now?? and im SO happy to see it!!

[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 13h 34m | Rec: Positive] After playing the first and second demos for 23 hours, I can finally support the developer. This game is simply enjoyable to play.  I don't fully understand why, because you will spend most of your time traversing the levels, occasionally shooting or engaging in some dialogues. I can't quite articulate it, as I'm not playing solely for the narrative (which is good), nor am I playing solely for the actual gameplay (which is decent). Perhaps the dystopian atmosphere is captivating, and the music is fire. It might be the level design, which you wouldn't find in any other game, where you feel completely lost, but after playing for 2 hours, your mind begins to connect the dots. Maybe it's the thought, "Am I even supposed to be on this roof?" or "What if I try to take this route?" when the path is just a random wire or pipe that can't be distinguished from the surroundings, as this game lacks decorations, and everything is climbable, physical, and walkable with almost no invisible walls. Perhaps it's the moment you watch someone's playthrough and realize you've missed 80% of the content, 10 alternative routes, 3 alternative solutions to objectives, and 2 alternative endings. Maybe it's the satisfaction that you've managed to beat the level in your unique way, when the game wasn't restricting you and wasn't treating you like a child by giving a map and quest markers. Or maybe it's everything combined. I don't know.
[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 7h 18m | Rec: Positive] Please add in some way of detemining the direction of mission objectives... i am 4 hours in and have found nothing. Havent found anything for the first mission because I have no idea where to go. Super frustrating. I also hear that I'm going to lose all my stuff including augments after every mission which is also a huge problem. Please fix this stuff so I can actually enjoy the game. The atmosphere is great, i love the fact that this is basically Eye Divine Cybermancy with a proper stealth system, there's so much to like here, but without being able to figure out where I am or being able to keep my items and augments I'm having a REAL hard time recommending this. Please fix. I can live with the jank and the frequent slowdowns. Though these would also be good things to fix. Controller support would also be nice as I'm playing on a steam deck.  5/10 due to above issues. LOVE the atmosphere, stealth, night vision, female protagonist, and... atmosphere. My god I love the atmosphere.  EDIT: I tried making some suggestions in the discussion board and the fanbase for this game was extremely defensive about keeping every aspect of this game exactly the same, and basically insinuated that I was too dumb to find my way around the map and that I should just go play something else despite having spent $20 on this game. Because of the pretentious d****bags comprising this fanbase; I won't be bothering with this game anymore as it seems evident to me that the community will go out of their way to put down any reasonable suggestions that may help the dev improve the game. I'm good on all that. Life's too short to deal with people like that. You can call me b***hurt, but honestly im not upset that they were rude, Im annoyed that they are discouraging the creator from making improvements to the game to make it more fun. Wandering around aimlessly is not fun.

I was intrigued by the horror aesthetic it had but the game barely gives you any ammo. That wouldn't be so bad if it didn't have enemies that will literally teleport behind you and blast your fucking brains out. If they are going for sneaking, they should fix the lighting on it, because i have no clue when i'm visible and i'm not because the shown lighting versus actual lighting doesn't match.

[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 9h 35m | Rec: Positive] [h1] Одна чертовски долгая поездка [/h1] [i]Сначала вкратце[/i] В первую очередь [b]Перипетия[/b] - это имсим. И один из лучших имсимов, что выходили хотя бы в ранний доступ за последние годы, на мой взгляд. Невероятная атмосфера, огромные открытые уровни, разнообразие поднимаемых в игре тем, множество путей прохождения и концовок каждого из доступных уровней, ганплей – игра выглядит и ощущается любимой. Не без огрехов, но ранний доступ создан именно для этого, верно?  В любом случае [b]Перипетия[/b] – невероятный экспириенс на десятки часов прохождения одного только раннего доступа и я советую приобрести её всем.   [hr][/hr]   [h1] Теперь подробнее [/h1]  [h2] Плюсы [/h2]  [h3] Атмосфера [/h3] Сильные ноты работы кисти Цутому Нихэя, дуновения идей Масамунэ Сиро и в целом мрачность киберпанка так и пропитывает этот проект. Каждая локация выглядить по-своему, но составляет общую картину задыхающегося города. Небо, что заполнил едкий дым, улицы, что погружены в вечную ночь тени домов, обваливающиеся куски мегаструктуры и былой славы, эта безысходность ощущается всегда. Мягко вплетённые элементы [spoiler] хоррора в Белграде [/spoiler] заслуживают отдельного внимания.  [h3] Ганплей [/h3] Каждая пушка стреляет по-своему(А какие-то и вовсе не стреляют???), отдача ощущается через монитор, каждый выстрел оставляет приятную декаль дыры на текстурах, ствол дымится после выпущенных пуль, а дульная вспышка освещает лицо и выдаёт местоположение. Можно долго продолжать говорить об этом, но я подытожу – стрелять весело и приятно.  [h3] Сюжет и лор [/h3] Сюжет и лор подаётся порционно различными персонажами или записками(Ооо как я люблю записки). Не буду лукавить, полностью данный мне материал я не смог понять, либо потому что я не умею читать, либо потому что я не умею искать, либо потому что он так подан. Одно могу сказать точно, от того материала, что я понял, я в восторге.  [h3] Отношение к игроку [/h3] Игра не ведёт тебя за руку. Она выкидывает тебя в Польшу, даёт отцовскую саблю и говорит тебе развлекаться. И ты развлекаешься. Ты облизываешь каждую локацию в поисках интересного, ищешь обходные пути до цели и найдя, как казалось, самый секретный и хорошо запрятанный – видишь ещё один, ещё более тайный и неисследованный. Игра поражает размахом и количеством разных подходов, о которых она тебе не говорит. Да, некоторые нпс могут рассказать тебе об одном или другом способе прохождения, но попробуй их ещё найди. И от этого получаешь удовольствие, игра не держит тебя за дурака и уважает тебя за то, что ты ломаешь её, забираясь туда, куда не следовало или находя то, что не нужно было.  [h2] Минусы [/h2] Переходя к минусам я не могу разделить их на чёткие категории, так как в целом вытекают они из одного. Игра, откровенно говоря, сырая. Некоторые огрехи локаций, ломающиеся скрипты, некоторое оружие вовсе отказывается стрелять без видимых на то причин. Отдельно стоит выделить проблемы с оптимизацией, но они несколько незначительны, по сравнению с другими. Также хочется подметить проблемы с ИИ врагов(Да и союзников тоже) он…странный, по меньше мере. Иногда враги начинают крутиться на месте, иногда просто останавливаются и пялят по сторонам, иногда реагируют на смерть товарища, иногда же нет – в общем стоит как минимум поработать над поведением.     [hr][/hr]   Подводя итог я хотел бы поблагодарить команду разработчиков за их титанический труд, за часы разработки, за всё, Ninth Exodus, надеюсь ваши труды окупятся. Отдельную благодарность заслуживает творческое комьюнити игры, спасибо тем художникам, что привлекли моё внимание к игре и тем, кто поддерживал моё скромное творчество по игре, творите и дальше, оставайтесь крутыми.  Дорога к полному релизу уже начата, и я надеюсь застать его вместе со всеми уже очень скоро. 
[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 16h 4m | Rec: Positive] [h1] Preamble [/h1]  Well to start things off, this is a wonderful game for a very specific audience. If you're not enamored by the music and screenshots themselves I am afraid this title may not be for you. It is an immersive sim, yes. But one with the degree of freedom teetering on the edge of breaking itself apart.  From the objective point of view: Is the game rough around the edges? Yes. Does it have incomparable charm and soul? Yes. Are there bugs? Yes. Is it sometimes hard to discern an actual issue from 'slav-jank' charm? Dear God, yes.  Taking all that into consideration, let me go slightly more in-depth on this title that I fell in love ever since the first demo. If you value your time, quick TL;DR is at the bottom of the review.  [h1] Gameplay [/h1]  The game itself revolves entire around physics based movement and combat, which as usual carries a lot inherit jank. Your characters always turns her head first, then rest of the body follows. When using few available melee weapons enemies start rag-dolling wildly when stab, effectively skewering them. All that causes the movement and combat to carry degree of unpredictability. Enemies are quite durable, while without implants Marie is a glass canon. Thankfully as long as you aim for the head most enemies can be killed even with the shittiest pea-shooter. Alas if you do not really like aiming that much and engaging enemies at a distance larger than arms-reach there is a way for you to engage enemies and emerge triumphant. Marie is very quick, very, very quick. As long as the player is running you can dodge bullets, explosions, aggro and whatever else you want. No enemies (except a single type in late game, present in a single level) can match your speed or even outrun you. When combined with inherit lethality of every single shotgun within the game, you can lay any opponent with a single blast at medium-short range.  The second part of gameplay that takes advantage of that is exploration/parkour. Our protagonist, Marie, can climb ladders, jump across rooftops, hold onto ledges, fire from said ledges and in general easily scale the concrete jungle of the levels.  By default You use space to jump and move up the ladders. control to move down them and let go of ledges. You tap the buttons you move and grab, you hold them, you let go until you press again. Thanks to Marie grabbing all available ledges and ladders without any button input scaling every nook and cranny is  very responsive and hassle-free. Preventing most of accidental falls. But if those occur, thankfully Marie is very resistant to fall damage, but you might damage your legs if you hit the ground too hard.  The third'ish part is stealth. It's a... thing you can do for sure. Enemies efficiently react to sounds, you can distract them by throwing things around and dispose of them without alerting others to your position using supressed weapons and melee. There are even few interesting things you can do like hijacking enemy brain to kill their allies to then watch as no one is suspicious of you. Of course such approach shits the bed the moment enemies are firing first, asking questions later.  [h1] Story/World [/h1]  Story of Peripeteia is something you need to discover by yourself, but if I were to compare it to something it would be a road-trip. It's not really complicated by any stretch of the imagination, but it requires you to read journals, talk with  NPC's and pieces stuff together. So far, it is not really fully explained, there are no definitive answers given to the questions revolving around Marie, but that's fine as she plays mostly second fiddle to the problems of people within the areas you are unleashed upon in each level. Helping them, helps you advance further in search of the answers. Characters are written well, their dialogue is charming and deeply soaked in cultural stew boiled within a mythical land of 'Poland'. Rain-soaked dystopia, grimy and putrid, all thanks to the textures, art directions and moody colors of every surface present. Despite all that, under that Blade Runner'esque facade is world filled with people truly styled after the creator's homeland: content with the shitty world they live in. Postive despite their grim outlook on life.   Will some things fly over the head of foreigners? Yes. Is knowing stuff about Soviet Union and its satellite countries required to enjoy the story, world and set pieces present? No. The environmental storytelling of the Peripeteia's is strong enough to carry everything present without need for prior historical knowledge. But if you'd like to know more... just use your browser. Everyone has access to Wikipedia, go educate yourself if you're willing.  [h1] TL;DR [/h1]  Game includes: 5 playable levels (ranging in length from 30 minutes to 6 hours) 1 HUB area  3 Semi-sandbox areas to just fuck around in Metric shitton of different guns No hand-holding and objective markers (you have to look at your notes and diary for directions)  Grid-based inventory system Augmentation system (not many ground breaking aug's but are still fun) Smoking and drinking that is actually good for your health Weebs and mentions of yaoi  Some unsaid things (in terms of gameplay): Between missions you only save your augments, so don't hoard stuff, use it up. There is no 'Continue' function in the game, nor quick saves. Save whenever you get a chance. You start each new mission with augments within your inventory, Sabre and some healing items. Hold your attack when using melee, both LMB and RMB do different things but holding theme yields much better results than mashing.  I give this game 9/10 on the virtue of its atmosphere and presentation. But depending on how many bugs and little issues you can deal with, alongside its early-access nature I am objectively willing to rate it closer to 7/10. Give it a spin if you’re able to afford it, it is not a triple A title it is thankfully not priced as such.   
[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 3h 5m | Rec: Positive] This review is based on only 3 hours of gameplay so far. Maybe when I get more time or get a better understanding of the game, I'll redo this.  The best way I can describe this so far is that it's Cruelty Squad with slightly better controls and you're not on some kind of drugs. On one hand, lots of the controls feel better like already just being able to hit 'R' to reload and aim with right mouse is great, plus having abilities either bound to the Function keys or to your hotbar is useful. On the other hand, it's a very dark game visually. Either you're in a bright area where you can see or you pretty much always need your Night Vision ability on with how dark areas are. I don't see this as a plus or a minus, just something that these games that call themselves 'Immersive Sims' like to do: bizzare visuals and wacky yet functional controls.   Something I do like, at least to some degree, are the firearms. I haven't used them all yet, but I love when games make their firearms sound like a thunderbolt, especially since we've all grown up with guns in AAA games that sound weaker than this.   However, something that I and probably plenty of others have criticized this game for is it's ambiguity. If someone tells you about something you have to do you should make sure to keep it in mind. You do have a journal and while it does help keep track of what you need to do, the very massive level doesn't help. Maybe my criticism isn't fair since I'm still stuck on the first level right now, but it is massive, dark, and only has a smattering of enemies here and there to help you feel like you're on the right path. Sure, it's nice that these enemies can pack a punch, but it's still relatively big and empty and I hope the other levels aren't like this.   One last positive that I can think of immediately is the inventory system, which is like RE4 but more exacting. Sure there's stuff like healing and restoratives and the usual, but any weapon you pick up needs to have a large space dedicated to it with some angles that cause it to jut out and adding certain attachments can change the shape for better or for worse. Still, it's a satisfying system overall.  Overall, I do recommend this game just for those like me who are fascinated by the weirdness of it. Sure there is jank, but you're buying an early access game. You know what you're getting into.  7/10 - Lots of really great stuff that (possibly for now) is hampered by problematic level(s) design and a lack of solid direction.

[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 20h 34m | Rec: Positive] the gigantic architecture and the bleakness and decay of it all in the game really hits hard: pressuring, overwhelming, upsetting. Marie, the protagonist, tries to struggle through this world, and this struggle is sometimes broken by moments of peace and beauty there. The struggles of Marie resonate with me because of my own struggles, and in that way the game is quite comforting. I really vibe with the entire aesthetic of this game, and whilst the game is a bit janky (expected, its EA), it honestly adds to the experience of struggle, desperation, and survival in a bleak world. I am really glad that this game exists.

[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 22h 49m | Rec: Negative] 現状バグが山盛りだしNPCのAIもガバガバ。セーブデータをロードすると変な位置にNPCの座標が移動してクレイモアが爆発したり砲塔が外れたT-72がそのまま襲ってきたりインベントリ内のアイテムが容積だけ増えたり増殖したり(よりにもよってキーアイテムまで増殖する)もする。何なら鍵や武器が消えて進行不能になる事もあるし、拾ったアイテムがリスポーンする時もある。エレベーターやリフトが動かなくなるのは茶飯事で、仮に動いてもプレイヤーキャラクターが床抜けしてエレベーターシャフトでフリーフォールしちゃったりする。 (エレベーター関連のバグは2025年2月24日のアップデートで修正済み) まだアーリーアクセスだから仕方がないところはあるがデモから大きく進歩しているわけではない。古いデモだとマップとか多少便利な機能があったりもしたが実装した途端プロ気取りのプレイヤー層からハラスメントを受けて削除されたりしたので本当に色んな意味でこれからどう変わるのか予測がつかないところがある。 ゲーム的な面の感想は個人的な部分があるが、売りの一つのオーグメントはレベル毎に引き継がれることはないし(2025年2月24日のアップデートで引き継ぎ可能に)、正直初期の三つ以外はほぼ使わないしスペース取るしでまあ飾りみたいなもの。武器に関してもAKクローンやVz.58、あと幾らかのピストルなど以外は互換性のあるマガジンを入手する機会がごく一部のレベルを除いて極めて乏しいので大事にとっておくだけ無駄。探索の部分も、レベルのクリア方法として様々な選択肢が存在するのは良いものの、共通の目標が用意されている場合は兎も角手段によって取る道筋が文字通り大きく違う場合があるので数時間かけて歩んだ道のりもやろうとしている事に全く関わりがなくほぼ全てが無駄だったなんてこともある。まあファンが喜ぶならいいんだろう。 リリース前はとても楽しみにしていたのではあるが、今の所好意的に評価できる部分の方が少なく感じられる。ある程度の改善が認められるまで他人にお勧めできない。 又、ゲームシステムとは別に開発者の著作権に対する姿勢が疑わしい部分がある。作中で明らかに許可を得たとは思えない音声や映像の素材(オウム真理教のアニメシリーズ、調べてみると元はポルノグラフィーらしいもの等)が用いられているのが目立つ。   付け加えると間違えても掲示板でどんな機能が欲しいとか調整が必要とか言わないように。このゲームのファン層を占める多くのユーザーは「Im-Sim系を遊ぶ自分達は知能的にエリートの水準にあり平均かそれ以下のユーザーはこのゲームを遊ぶ権利はない」、「開発者はお金を稼ぐよりも(自惚の強い自分達のために)同ジャンルのゲームの伝統を守るのが懸命で、新機能の実装やフールプルーフを要求するものは病気か余程の間抜け」とレッテルを貼るタイプの毒々しいタイプのゲーマーで、この手のジャンルがニッチ化した理由を切実に物語っている。首を突っ込むな

[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 10h 58m | Rec: Positive] This is a pretty long review, so here's the tl;dr:  I easily recommend it if you like exploring large open levels, like Thief's, and can take some(a lot of) jank. Especially if you don't mind getting lost in the beginning. However, note that stealth in this game's current version is bad, so ghosting is impossible, but ambush stealth is fine. However, I don't recommend it, if you dislike getting lost. Also, if you dislike exploring levels for its own sake. There's plenty of dead ends with no reward at the end.  I love Thief, Thief 1 and 2 are two of my favourite games of all time. I also really like Deus Ex. However I don't like the "immersive sim" genre as a whole. I like that the games in it usually have good level design, which can carry a game for me on its own.   And it easily carries this game on its shoulders, despite the rather large load. The levels, with its large, sprawling design, are incredible, and are by far the best part of the game. I love the maze like design of the game as well, wandering around and then finding some alternate route and finding a new way around is super cool. There's also a lot of ways to not exactly get out of bounds, but just wander on the edges of the map, and that's fun too.  Personally I haven't really had the issue of getting lost either. I mean, on your first run, obviously you don't know where you're going, but the level design is overall very distinct, where you can easily tell where an area is once you're familiar with it.  And the visuals really compliment it. It has amazing atmosphere, with beautiful skyboxes and lighting. Mission 4's start is a great example. Like the mall in mission 1 was one of the moments that really grabbed me when I first played the demo.  Another cool part of the level design is the open-endedness. Usually in games like these when you have alternate ways to complete a level, you tend to rethread the same routes, even in Dishonored, you still basically take the same route, with small diversions, although that can vary level to level. And in this game, you have routes that take you to completely different areas. Mission 3 is a great example of that, but so is again, mission 1.   The sound design is solid, even if the music tends to be behave a bit strangely at times. Music will play even if you're not necessarily in the area. But it does fit the game's tone well. And some of the tracks are really good.   That was the pros, now for the mixed.  The stealth is bad. I usually play these games as a ghost so, non-lethal + no detections, but I don't bother in this game. It's extremely difficult to tell when you are and aren't hidden, except when you're in complete darkness, because of the game's lighting system, and in general, while I love the level design in terms of exploration, it sucks for stealth. It's one thing to sneak around small tightly designed levels like in Thief, it's another doing it in these huge ones.  So combat is the way to go, or at least lethal stealth. Open combat seems to be very difficult considering how rare healing items are. Maybe if you're good at fps, it's not an issue, but I'm not. The stealth archer playstyle is the only way to play this game in terms of the combat.  I don't really care for losing my items at the start of each level either. I play Thief very minimally anyway, so it doesn't effect me.  Finally it's time for the cons.  The npcs have a lot of problems. Open combat is difficult because of the lack of healing items, but it becomes impossible when you look at the npcs. They have unlimited ammo, and usually have bullet hose weapons and will kill you very quickly. Even worse with enemies that have leg augmentations and are so fast they almost teleport around. They also tend to get stuck a lot. I exploited this, because the enemies are simply not fun to fight against.  The dialogue is also broken. If you start/finish an objective, and talk to the npc again, they will repeat the exact same dialogue that finishes or starts the objective. So they'll keep telling you what to do, or thanking you for what you just did.   Finally it's time for mission 4.   It has great visual design, like the rest of the levels, especially the skybox, and its sheer size is also really cool. But the gameplay changes from what was the case in other levels, to something that I think is best compared to RPG maker horror game design.  And what truly sets it apart is that you can only save in designated rooms. I'm in the camp that despises checkpoint design(At least in this type of game; it's fine in FPS, or other types of games). I understand the arguments, but I completely disagree. I like being able to save at any time, especially when platforming, which this level has a fair amount of. One of the best parts of Peripetia is being allowed to go where ever I want, which I can't do because of the checkpoint system. On top of that, the level is more linear than others. From what I can tell, there is only one way to finish it, and  you will need to explore most of the level anyway to do that. I actually ended the level with a ton of ammo, especially because I cheesed a few encounters, but you are very low in the beginning. So the level lacks almost everything good about the game, and is incredibly tedious to play through. I get what the devs are going for, but I don't care for it.  To finish of. I really like this game, and I hope it gets updates in the future. The level design has stayed top notch since the level, and I hope it keeps going. Hopefully they also polish off the rest of the game too sometime.

[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 27h 12m | Rec: Positive] I'm going to have to save my full thoughts for a future video, but its good. Damn good.  It has an episodic level structure and there's not a lot of levels from what I've been told (i'm only on level 3 at the moment), but the levels are pretty big and there's multiple ways to complete them. I wish there was more stuff and characters to interact with, but what's here is really fun. Like, there's quite a lot of "empty space" if that makes sense? It'd be nice if I were rewarded for exploring by finding new characters and interactions (such as the daughter and the Iron Lung). There's lockers and stuff that you can find, but they're pretty sparse. You're usually just procuring weapons from vendors or from corpses.  I really like the parkour system. Its a step beyond something like Dying Light or Mirrors Edge and kinda dips into Assassins Creed territory (i've never played Thief, but that's seems to be what the system is based on). The guns are also very satisfying to use once you get to grips with the inventory management system. It reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid in the sense that you go into each level with a small starting loadout and are expected to procure weapons and gear as you explore the map and carry out your tasks.  Overall, i'm having a lot of fun playing this. I haven't been this excited about a game in years.
[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 9h 54m | Rec: Positive] Finished the early access segment in one sitting, and I loved every second of it. I have never in my life been as impressed with a games stylistic choices as I have with Peripeteia. I am very excited to see whats to come on the road to 1.0.
[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 8h 49m | Rec: Positive] Rough around the edges, gameplay needs some tuning, enough bugs that saving often is required but it's one of the few games that earn the "immersive sim" tag. I don't think any other game has captured the feeling of wandering megastructures like Peripeteia has.
[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 5h 37m | Rec: Positive] It still needs work, but its currently really enjoyable. my main criticisms at this point in time are: one, the stealth mechanics don't work quite right. oftentimes the players light meter and the actual environment lighting will be wildly different. Two, the gunplay is kinda shit. There needs to be some kind of smoothing on the guns. Aiming down sights is incredibly twitchy and every time you move the crosshairs go way out of alignment and it takes a good while to reset. Three, lighting/reflections are strange. Oftentimes reflections from small puddles will be massively exaggerated and cause horrible visual artifacts. Four, third person camera controls and animations are incredibly jank Five. Understanding mission layout is a nightmare. I would love a thief style map for missions (purchasable at a vendor perhaps)  that gives you a vague idea of the layout of a level Six, audio for enemies. Enemies are extremely loud from far away and audio does not seem to be affected or muffled in any way by walls or doors or just about anything.

[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 38h 54m | Rec: Positive] 非常有魔力的亚文化大杂烩游戏，我玩了一下就完全停不下来了。喝水想吃饭想睡觉也在想，一秒不玩浑身难受。  这游戏有着僵硬到搞笑的动画，大而空的几乎没有可交互物品的地图，99%都是黑色和绿色的瞎眼的色调和光污染，失智的敌人AI，单一的敌人种类，东欧游戏典中典的反人类交互和买bug送游戏…放到其他游戏妥妥的多半差评，那么这个波兰游戏到底有什么该死的魔力，让我如此如痴如狂？？  那必然是他超棒的场景氛围，你没法在第二个游戏找到这种感觉的场景。雨夜中苏式巨构静默地伫立在后苏联时代荒废的城市中，肮脏的无人居住的毛坯房里满是泥土和瓦砾，为数不多幸存的平民绝望地生活在其中…大而空的场景放在其它游戏里会让人出戏，此时却奇妙地加强了这种强烈的荒废感。还有大量的赫鲁晓夫楼可太贴近中国人的生活了，赫鲁晓夫楼的中国仿版“筒子楼”可谓遍布全国，尤其是北方地区，搭配上如此氛围给人一种熟悉又陌生的梦境之感，更别提我确实经常做和这游戏场景几乎一模一样的梦，所以玩到这个游戏时颇有梦境成真的感觉。  游戏的音乐也是非常有品的，从ambient到jungle到techno应有尽有。巧了你怎么知道我喜欢这个，原声带上线必买爆。  因此虽然地图大又空，很多看上去值得探索的地方探索完后没有任何东西，但我特别享受在地图里漫游的感觉，哪怕没有任何奖励我也很乐意这么干，我觉得“步行模拟”可能就是这游戏核心体验的一个环节（非贬义，我并不排斥步行模拟游戏，尽管很多人用“步行模拟器”来讽刺一个游戏很无聊）。可惜的是在一个关卡里捡到的东西并不能带到下一关，首发版本只能把钱带到下一关，截止到写这篇评测时更新了能把义体带到下一关。  有时在地图角落里也会发现一些对玩家角色强度提升完全没有但是很有意思的小东西，从这些东西可以看出来这游戏制作人是老亚比了。比如会发出野兽先辈恶臭嚎叫的小蓝人（他真的叫blue man），和反康米主义版弗朗西斯德克对话（很有意思的是能和他触发对话的那块屏幕在无线电塔塔顶，符合设定了属于是）。而且游戏主角疑似是从作者oc发展来的…  再说战斗环节，由于主角是人造人所以可以往自己身上装一堆增强型义体（游戏里叫augment）。然而这些义体往往会占贼多背包格子，所以你没办法买下所有义体然后全往自己身上招呼。义体分主动和被动型，主动型使用时会按时间消耗能量（法力）值。能量值只能用消耗品补，我没找到像网络奇兵或者prey2017那种可以给自己无限充能量的设备，所以我一直没怎么敢用像隐身、子弹时间这种烧能量贼快的义体。而且目前还有个bug就是除了初始义体外其它装备在快捷栏的义体会在读档后从快捷栏卸下来。  枪械可以就地改装，前提是你能找到配件。而这游戏的弹药系统和军事模拟类游戏更像（军事模拟怎么不算一种沉浸式模拟呢）：对于栓动步枪或者霰弹枪（我目前没看到弹匣或弹鼓供弹的霰弹枪）你需要一粒粒地上弹药，这个一粒粒是指你要按多次R键，按一次压进去一粒。而对于弹匣弹鼓供弹的枪械，则是先要在背包里取下弹匣，然后把弹药填进弹匣，再把弹匣插回枪上，插回弹匣时会自动把一粒子弹压进枪膛，所以如果你想卸下所有子弹不仅要卸下弹匣还要卸下枪膛里那一枚子弹。你可以准备多个弹匣，装填时并不会像通常的射击游戏那样自动魔法般变出一个满弹匣插上，而是在你准备的这些弹匣之间轮换，所以换弹癌玩家有难了。这种弹药系统在非军事模拟类射击游戏里还挺少见的，一时间给我一种我在玩arma的幻觉，不过我喜欢。  射击体验给人一种奇怪的感觉，介于爽和不爽之间，手感可能需要一段时间熟悉。现实里武器开火那离谱的后坐力算是完美被复刻进游戏了，自动武器一连续开火枪口瞬间飞到天上去，而且很多武器的弹药挺吃紧的，所以强烈建议换到单发或三连发而非自动的射击模式（默认键位z切换射击模式，游戏教程完全没提我还以为这游戏切不了射击模式，后来才发现的）。从这个角度上看，快慢机的意义在这个游戏里也被很好地复刻了。  近战手感那就属于是很烂的领域了。基本没有击中反馈（尤其是电棍），根本不知道打没打中人，判定范围也很迷，总之希望后续更新能修正。  弱智敌人AI前面已经提过了，有时会在莫名其妙的地方卡住。潜行判定也很粗糙。游戏有常见于偏潜行的imsim游戏的根据声音和光照来判定破潜难度的系统。目前没有潜行处决系统，也不像gloomwood那样潜行状态下可以蓄力一刀秒杀敌人，但是在敌人开枪之前把他打死就不会破潜。  作为一个imsim游戏，本作很好地实现了“一个关卡多种解法”的自由度。四通八达充满捷径的关卡让你能够自由选择潜行还是正面对决，同时让你进行探索时能够不断地感到“这个地方原来通向这里”的惊喜。虽然采用了弱引导的方式，但是由于很多关键信息都记录在了日志里，我也有用心去看npc的对话（npc对话和地上捡到的各种PDA、报纸也会记录在日志以供查阅），所以对“我是谁我要干什么”的问题并没有感到任何迷茫，反而感觉这种引导程度还很不错。  不过游戏欠缺打磨的问题还是比较严重的，由于本作场景很大并且提供了很多探索自由度，远超3人小工作室的精力范围，导致了地图里有很多会导致游戏进度卡死的坑洞。因此我的建议是准备多个存档栏位并且勤存档，尤其是去那种看起来能探索但是一眼就是单行道的地方之前一定要留个存档，不然到时候坏档就只能求助于卡bug卡出来或者等修改器出来了。  所以我还是挺建议先玩一下demo看看适不适合自己，能不能忍受多如牛毛的bug和glich，毕竟这游戏还是挺挑人的。如果不是特别疯狂地喜欢但还是想玩的话，不妨等后续更新完善并且打折后再买来尝试。

[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 7h 18m | Rec: Negative] с демки 23 года в плане механик, багов, анимаций и т.д. практически ничего не изменилось. если инвентарь, который не сохраняется между уровнями, они пытаются оправдать каким то дибильным геймдизайнерским ходом, то что на счет всего остального? скажите еще что то, как выглядит гг, когда передвигается, как локации выглядят в некоторых местах, как неудобно целиться из некоторых ружей, что все это геймдизайн, который специально не менялся, если не с 23, то с 20 года. много наболевшего, непонятно зачем вообще добавлять третье лицо, если все, на что оно сгодится, это ПОПЫТКА в скриншоты. короче, если покупать, то с надеждой, что игра кардинально изменится к релизу, но после оправданий разраба в отзывах, такого может и не произойти в принципе.

[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 5h 7m | Rec: Positive] [h1]Deus Ex e Waifu si Incontrano in Peripeteia![/h1] Prima di iniziare, desidero ringraziare dal profondo del cuore Ninth Exodus per avermi scelto ufficialmente come content creator e Vtuber italiano per recensire e streammare questo capolavoro. Raccomando caldamente al pubblico italiano appassionato di videogiochi strani e a tratti dimenticati di seguirmi sui miei canali Twitch e YouTube, dove troveranno una community con passioni in comune per delle bellissime chiacchiere in compagnia insieme ad una vasta gamma di contenuti simili. https://www.twitch.tv/tsuhirito https://www.youtube.com/@TsuhiritoLive  In un panorama videoludico sempre più affollato di titoli d’azione e giochi narrativi, "Peripeteia" di Ninth Exodus si distingue come un audace tributo e un’evoluzione del genere immersive sim, quello stesso filone che ha fatto la storia con capolavori come System Shock e Deus Ex. Ambientato in una Polonia cyberpunk in una storia alternativa, il gioco unisce elementi di sparatutto, stealth e gioco di ruolo in un’esperienza che premia la creatività e la libertà d’azione del giocatore, con tanto di waifu perché "Peripeteia" non si fa mancare nulla!  [h2]Gameplay e Design[/h2] Nel ruolo della cibernetica supersoldato Marie, il giocatore si trova immerso in una città post-sovietica decadente, in cui ogni angolo nasconde misteri e pericoli. "Peripeteia" offre una visione duplice, permettendo sia una prospettiva in prima persona che una terza, e integra meccaniche di parkour, hacking e combattimento con una struttura di livelli ampia e stratificata. Il sistema di interazione, che permette molteplici approcci per superare gli ostacoli – dall’evitare furtivamente una pattuglia all’abbattere con violenza controllata un nemico – richiama i principi di gameplay emergente che hanno fatto la storia di System Shock e Deus Ex, offrendo soluzioni sempre alternative e premiando l’ingegno del giocatore.  [h2]Riferimenti Storici e Influenze[/h2] È impossibile non riconoscere in "Peripeteia" l’eredità lasciata dai titoli che hanno definito il genere. System Shock, con la sua atmosfera claustrofobica e i sistemi interattivi innovativi, e Deus Ex, che ha elevato il concetto di scelta e conseguenza a livelli narrativi e ludici senza precedenti, hanno gettato le basi di un design che ancora oggi ispira. "Peripeteia" non si limita a riproporre quelle atmosfere distopiche: il gioco le rinnova, inserendole in un contesto originale dove la tecnologia, la storia e il degrado urbano si intrecciano in maniera impeccabile. È questo mix di tradizione e innovazione a rendere il titolo una vera e propria dichiarazione d’intenti per gli amanti degli immersive sim.  [h2]Aspetti Tecnici ed Estetici[/h2] Sul fronte visivo, il gioco presenta ambientazioni ricche di dettagli: luci al neon, edifici in rovina e paesaggi urbani decadenti creano un’atmosfera unica, in perfetta sintonia con una colonna sonora energica e inquietante che amplifica il senso di immersione. Pur essendo in accesso anticipato, l’attenzione al dettaglio e la profondità dei sistemi di gioco lasciano trasparire un potenziale enorme, con meccaniche che, seppur non prive di qualche difetto tecnico isolato, promettono di evolversi ulteriormente in vista della versione definitiva.  [h2]Conclusioni[/h2] "Peripeteia" si configura come un’esperienza imperdibile per chi ha fatto la storia degli immersive sim e per coloro che desiderano scoprire un nuovo capitolo del genere. Con una libertà di approccio che ricorda i grandi classici e innovazioni che ne rinfrescano il concetto, il titolo di Ninth Exodus rappresenta il ponte ideale tra il passato glorioso di System Shock e Deus Ex e il futuro degli immersive sim. Un’esperienza intensa, stimolante e, soprattutto, profondamente immersiva che non solo celebra il retaggio di una tradizione, ma ne traccia anche le linee evolutive per le generazioni a venire.

[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 0h 54m | Rec: Positive] The game is great, just dont get discouraged if you feel lost, that is part of the charm
[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 2h 53m | Rec: Negative] This game has potential, but (at the time of this review) is pretty awful from a gameplay perspective.  So the game basically plays like a metal gear / hitman game with some platforming where you just take requests, run to their location then kill them. So what's the problem? The lighting, parkour and the map design.   Dev, do lights not exist in this future? It's literally impossible to see unless you always have nightvision on. Run out of energy? Looks like you can't see anymore, restart.  Parkour is jank. For some reason you only get a double jump if you fall off a ledge. Climbing up stuff is weird, like instead of climbing up a ladder you have to jump off each peg like its roblox. Another issue is if you take enough damage to your legs you can't sprint so good luck trying to parkour. What's that? You barely missed the jump, took fall damage and now you can't sprint? Restart from save because now the jump isn't even possible.   The maps are huge, but there's a whole lot of nothing. The guy will tell you "find x" and you'll spend an hour running around the rather empty map trying to figure out where tf to go. Add with with complete darkness and it's literally hell. Please just give me a map and some waypoints.
[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 8h 22m | Rec: Positive] This is a really creative sim with a lot of ways to get the missions done and can be really fun, my favourite part of the game is  the climbing mechanics as it really makes the mission locations feel big and can be approached in many different ways for example there a part in one of the missions to get to a top of a tower to broadcast information which will help you complete the mission and this building was protected and hard to get into. I then looked over to a wall and saw it was a jumble of pipes and air condensers and wondered if i could climb them to the top or get close enough and in doing so found it was another route that i could take to do the objective without fighting which was the moment in the game that i felt that it was great   a lot of games make it very obvious which route means what theirs normally a go loud route or a quite route but this game has so many ways to finish a mission that it all just feels really fun and great to play. The story so far is interesting and makes you want to see more of the world and whats going on which is a good drive but i mostly just like to see the different routes and ways that the mission can be completed which there is a lot of different ways to get the job done.  I think this game is worth your time and hope to see it at its completion as for now it is not finished. i hope the achievements will be added soon as well im glad they changed it so you can keep your augments as before you lost all equipment when starting a new mission which was a much needed fix. I would say that losing your weapon is annoying but you can just sell them all and then buy some in the next mission as well as it gets you to look around the map again to find a weapon to use as if you kept all your weapons you would be come very op very quickly.   I hope you enjoy the game like i am and cant wait to see the rest that they add to this game.

[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 20h 54m | Rec: Positive] Absolutely beautiful Eurojank game.  If you're a fan of S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Deus Ex, Cruelty Squad and immersive sims in general then this is THE perfect video game for you, very cool PS1 style graphics(looks like something your older brother would play back in 2004) and very nice gameplay. The first thing i must praise is the way parkour works in this game, the main character can grab into ANY ledge which works very well with the way maps are built in this game and it's also pretty fun. The levels are insanely big with lots of stuff laying around to be found and soooo many paths for completing the level and at the same time having a beautiful Lain aesthetic. There are also a ton of weapons that each feel different to shoot and feel dynamic in a way. Exploration is also key to falling in love with this masterpiece, if you think you can go there, then there is a high chance you can because this game is 10 times bigger than you think, so take your time and immerse yourself in the athmosphere.  The negatives i have for this game are the obvious bugs but we can't forget that it's still in Early Access, another issue that needs to be adressed is the athmospheric lighting in this game, sometimes it's wayyy to dark and since the latest update(24.02.2025) some places have lost their uniquely lit sections. The game also tends to sometimes softlock you so never forget to make manual saves at certain times throughout the levels. Another bad feature at the moment is that your items do not save inbetween levels which can be exhausting for some people. The maps can also sometimes feel empty after some time.  In my opinion the game is a strong 9/10 but for the general audience i would give this game 7.9/10, it has so much potential to become one of the best immersive sims we've ever seen, but at the same time still needs polishing, map rework and some lighting rework.
[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 29h 13m | Rec: Positive] I've been waiting on this one for years, it's worth every ruble. Buy if you like walking around sad rainy cement cities and shooting people sometimes.  EDIT: After playing through each level so far - there is a lot of depth mechanically and narrative-wise, but also A LOT of jank and empty searching around. There's gold in them there hills but it takes looking past some glaring flaws.
[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 11h 59m | Rec: Positive] I REALLY love the aesthetic, design, and gameplay of Peripeteia. There are some bugs but they've never been completely game-breaking and even though I personally love exploring the levels and getting lost in the design or running along the rooftops, storming an apartment bloc filled with Communists, I PRAY FOR A MAP! Even if we get a map added I personally wouldn't like an actual quest marker, I love using the compass and directions from people, using the area around me to find my way around. So far I don't know what the devs have in store for the future but i hope for more or something similar, I personally think Y'all cooked :)
[Date: 2025-02-24 | Playtime: 6h 15m | Rec: Positive] I was looking for a stealth game when i stumbled upon this gem. i played the demo which is just the first mission and it was jarring at first but after about 15 minutes it starts to make sense and the mechanics feel good. if you get the full game it does carry over your progress from the first mission so you can just carry on where you left off. i only encountered 2 very minor bugs that were solved by reloading a previous save. also save often this game has no auto saves as of yet and you will be dying frequently. the volume does need a little mixing personally i turned off the music but the sounds do get repetitive. i'm on the third mission as of typing this and i'm still enjoying it. i cant wait to see where the dev takes this. if you don't like not having a quest marker or some kind of compass telling you where to go this probably isn't for you.

[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 4h 42m | Rec: Positive] probably not worth the price in its current state, very janky as well.  I was on the third mission and took a tram to blow up a reactor without even knowing why and ending the mission, didnt really get an explaination.  Maybe it was a pick a side to team up with mission, between the Poles and Russians, idk. I just skipped the two optional paths by accident I guess.  I would still recommend this, but I'd wait till it fully releases, cause it can be very confusing.  Probably gonna need an explaination video once this game gets more attention.  7/10 right now but I would give higher if it irons out its issues.
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 56h 50m | Rec: Positive] what a game what a game what a game what a game  fuck i cant wait for the rest of the levels  it hurts so good, trying to do right never goes right, and when it does it will backfire later on somehow, the world keeps you and everyone down.  the maps are amazing to navigate and discover with so many secrets, bits of lore and unique characters  the styling is fucking amazing in every sense creating an atmosphere so captivating and beautiful while at the same time being extremely oppressive and unsettling , all the named characters are so unique and interesting making me want to know more about them.  You constantly feel how Marie is doing whatever is needed to reach the bunker while leaving a path of death and destabilizing everywhere she goes, and it consumes her   i cant put it in to words, everything in this game aligns so well with what i seek
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 5h 55m | Rec: Positive] Прикольная игра, но нихуя не видно без ПНВ, а с ним весь вайб пропадает. - Уши на втором уровне от какого-то сверх-экстенда в канализации (да и вообще звук хреново работает). На локациях особо не полутаешься, а какой-то норм лут спрятан в ебанутых местах(вал, патроны от рпг и иногда даже квестовые предметы). Левел дизайн - топографический ад, везде можно запрыгнуть, куча каких-то проходов с нихуя идущих в бесконечную даль. Но играть интересно, поэтому если игру чуть подкорректируют и допилят, то будет неплохо.

Мне очень нравится,что с каждым уровнем игра становится все интреснее и интереснее,Белград и Карабаш это просто нечто,словами не передать. С нетерпением ждал релиза раннего доступа. Обязательно буду ждать дальнейших обновлений и буду перепроходить игру,ибо в ней очень много контента!  Хотя и очень сырая и в том же Карабеше невозможно не напароться на баги,как и на других уровнях,что отчасти начинает неебически душить со временем,но я верю,что в будущем ее хорошенько отполируют и будет она в разы лучше своего нынешнего состояния! Спасибо большое Ninth Exodus,вы лучшие ! Такого восторга и любви от игр я не испытывал до этого никогда! Я также очень рад,что этот проект набирает все большие обороты и все больше разрастается.
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 14h 54m | Rec: Positive] Playable freedom. Personally IDC about the inventory reset since I´d have steamrolled all hostile AI too easily from the start of each mission. Also you get lost, a lot, which only speaks to the freedom of this games level design. Speaking of which, you might end up playing some levels in reverse if you don´t watch out. Baller game.

[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 2h 54m | Rec: Negative] I was really, really looking forward to this game. Even though the demo was largely broken when I played it with the inventory of both the player and NPCs emptying if you saved and reloaded, I thought it had a lot of promise and charm and eagerly awaiting it.  Unfortunately it turns out that there's not really any 'RPG' in this game.   Unlike Deus Ex or EYE: Divine Cybermancy, there's no skills or character progression of any kind, there's no way to make your character better with a weapon type or activity so you can't really specialize in a way that expands the utility of a weapon type (less recoil, faster aiming, less sluggish weapon handling ect.) or makes options like hacking or platforming more or less viable as options.   Likewise all of the "implants" apart from the base ones you start with are just inventory items for some reason, not actually ya' know - implanted in you. When this is combined with the fact that the inventory doesn't carry over between levels (something the dev is apparently working on but even then I've heard it described as a 'limited' inventory transfer so whatever that will be) it means that even though there is a weapon attatchment/upgrade system even that doesn't allow any kind of lasting progression.
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 19h 12m | Rec: Positive] It runs absolutely fine on my rig, but mine is probably a bit more powerful than average.  About the game itself?

[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 0h 33m | Rec: Positive] [I wrote this for the demo and it automatically applied for the full game, but it still applies!]  demo was excellent! It feels a healthy balance of jank and mysterious adventure/fun that makes the experience worth it. Someone described it to me as something like "Breakcore meets E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy!" It's got the iconic E.Y.E style and feel that I personally am a sucker for, and the color and aesthetic feels like a domineering and oppressive environment of dark greens, black, purples, and gray in a metropolis cyberpunk society. All in all, I liked it enough to buy the game on release, so that's my review haha.  Check out the demo for yourselves!! ~ 🤖👍🏽🏙🎶
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 52h 15m | Rec: Positive] An immersive sim with a giant world, oppressive, dark and melancholic, large levels with a lot of places to explore and a huge verticality. The graphics may look simple, but that's also part of the charm, the giant buildings with the rain falling and the gigantic background with glowing lights can give you some of the most beautiful dark futuristic scenarios. The gameplay is simply fun, is also disguised as a platformer, with that being said you will be jumping and doing some crazy parkour in order to explore more parts of each level, which you could find some secret weapons, informations or shortcuts. The gunplay is very satisfactory with a very unique movement, it have a lot of different weapons, and you can carry as many as you can manage in your inventory, fitting them like a tetris, together with the ammo, healing items and other stuff. Each level have several ways to be finished, offering different paths for you to pick and go in order to achieve them, increasing the replayability, always having something new to discover each time you replay it. The stealth mechanic can be show with Marie's picture on the corner of your screen, giving you hints if you're being loud or if you're covered by the shadows, is such a creative way to show you the information. You also have access to different skills which cost energy, you can have dark vision, a drone map for you to explore a bit of the area around you, enhance your mobility making you faster and being able to jump higher, as well other hidden skills which you can find by exploring.  Because it's Early Access not everything is perfect, of course. There's some bugs and some areas are way too empty. The way the game already is it can be described as a precious gem, but it can easily achieve even beyond that as the game development progress, just need to fix and add some extra stuff here and there. The levels are great the way they are, it just can get better if they focus on polishing them more, by filling more the areas with content (secret weapons, more quests, more NPCs) or even objects and interactions. Anything that could improve the replayabilty even more and expand the experience will always be welcome.  It isn't a game for everyone (and that's not a bad thing), you need patience and be willing to explore without any guide aside for some clues from NPC dialogues, journals or some minor visual information you can spot with your own eye, it reminds a lot of old games, which is great. You will get lost a few times and may even have trouble finding your objectives on the first time, but it is quite satisfying when you discover a way out and extra paths to explore.   In the end, Peripeteia is such a unique experience, is one of those games where the ambition is way higher than the budget, but in the best way possible, in a setting rarely seen in games recently. I can't wait to see how the game will progress and I know it will only get better.

[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 3h 11m | Rec: Negative] Рано. Даже по меркам ерли ассеса игра нуждается в куске наждачки с пузырем уайт-спирита. ИИ противников слишком часто выходит покурить (и не возвращается), стелс работает через жопу, паркур работает чуть лучше, чем стелс, а гигантомания в дизайне локаций кажется неуместной. Мелкие баги и недостаток QoL-приколов можно потерпеть.  Тем не менее, видится предпочтительным вариант закинуть разработчикессе злотых на атаракс, после чего закутать игру в полотенце и поставить в сухое темное место этак на полгода - потенциал тут имеется.  а еще по местному телевидению крутится аудиодорожка из нетленки про лютого негра, застрявшего в укупнике. лолшто?
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 36h 25m | Rec: Positive] GAMEPLAY:  The game has a unique taste of fast, slow and high-pressure. It has so many ways you could play and having that ability opens doors for all kinds of people. The health system is simple in an RPG fashion.   Inventory is difficult to fit what you want and what you need which challenges you as a player to decide what to keep, and what to throw away. Attachments, magazines, barrel length all needs to be considered when picked up. Not just that but now you need to worry about space for the right type of ammunition.  Health items, energy items, ammo, weapons, power-ups. Everything you can pick up needs to be considered. Climbing is creative and the perfect way for the player to discover spine chilling rooms within the decrepit rotting buildings in the universe. Being able to approach the levels at different angles give replayability. It's a straight forward concept when you understand after collecting the right information to complete the level. But once you're rewarded with the amount of kills you've avoided, or gotten with the timestamp underneath- the game encourages the play to run it back.    The perfect scuff with handling weapons adds an unreliability aspect to it which makes you second guess when going in guns blazing. Its difficult to maintain your aim consistently when using certain weaponry. Vast amount of weapons you suddenly want to discover, melee, guns, grenades- the weird universe gives you a weird arsenal which you're forced to bear with. Not only do you have to resource manage whatever you find in the levels, but you also have to                  𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.  ENVIRONMENT:  They created this imaginary dystopian life where you get to learn all about it through character dialog, visuals, and items. The world building is ominously captivating. I find myself wanting to know just as much as Marie (Your character) wants to know. Not only does she have no recollection on herself, but you as a player don't know either. Its truly up to both of you to understand it.    The foggy retro PS2 graphics compliment the world in more ways than one. Having the twisted calm music play with every different sector you discover. Then amidst combat, some future Breakcore starts boiling your blood for intense action. It's hard to put it in words besides making it bias- its a grey feeling I can't describe. The strong sense of nostalgia, and the weird out-of-body experience of feeling like its 1999 and this game was released early 90s. The graphics compliment the gameplay                 ​𝐭𝐨 𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐞.  FINAL WORDS:  In order to understand how I feel, you need to try it yourself. I highly recommend this game to the physiological horror fans, the PS2 graphic fans, and anyone who can accept the fact that this entire game feels like a dream-core. If that's up your alley then please help yourself in the world of                  𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐢𝐚.

[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 12h 40m | Rec: Positive] It's a fine game, sadly yet in Early Access which might be a bad thing for some. Tolerable level of junk inside, some bugs, sometimes you can be stuck, sometimes dialog may loop. Cute MC, nice setting, weird art-style as a treat, there a lot of things to explore. Sadly, no map, which can make finding stuff really hard, more than one way how some locations loop on itself(especially training level, which is bigger than some maps in EYE). Cool choice of weaponry. Some of music isn't good imo, but it's fitting even if I don't like it. 8/10, good game.

[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 10h 26m | Rec: Positive] Никогда не  умел получать удовольствие от иммерсив симов, а потом купил перипетию, и спустя 6 часов игры обнаружил, что все это время перепроходил туториал разными путями... Игра- шедевр
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 16h 34m | Rec: Positive] So I want to just cover a few complaints I have with the game, and there's 3 major ones I feel need addressed.   Secrets:  It's easy to get literally anywhere in the game if you know what you're doing, I with there were more secrets to find in out of bounds locations and the far corners of the map... This game makes me want to leave no stone unturned, and it tries to encourage exploration by hiding things in some areas, but others are left without any reward. I walked down a tunnel for 5 minutes only to find nothing.   Just in level 1, I feel both ends of the long pipes the river flows through should have something, (especially the long one, I feel like I got blue ballsed for walking 5 minutes), the underneath of the sewers, the area near the tank/parking garage buildings, and the lower rooftop outside of the tutorial location with the market in view (the skybox lighting is bugged here but I think you should leave that in).  Augs:  I also feel like my energy runs out too quickly. Using the movement aug is essential to exploring some of the locations, and cutting down on backtracking, but only being able to activate it for 30 seconds at most feels not very good. I think this could be fixed by adding more fuses (not batteries, those drain far too quickly to be viable in most situations), adding an upgrade function (this is probably too ambitious), or simply reducing the battery cost of augs (probably the best option). I also wish augs were permanent, but I assume this would go against the vision of the developers. I found myself almost instantly throwing away my first aug because of how much room it occupied, and because of how much energy it drained to use.   Navigation:  Finding the path towards the next objective is often times more difficult than it should be, there's very little signposting and not even a map posted of the city anywhere, very little telling you where you are at any given point aside from a compass. Which feels odd, because there's many points in the game where a map would feel natural, particularly near several of the monuments. I think the majority of players would struggle without a guide, hopefully more of those are made in the future. I think the best way to solve this would be to make the journal more clearly track your objectives.  Conclusion:  With all of that being said, I fell in love with what's here, and only bring my complaints because I want it to live up to its potential. In the state that it is in, I think it's still well worth the price, especially seeing the devs committed to addressing many of the issues.
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 5h 0m | Rec: Positive] Game is pretty cool, Keep cooking dev! Just make sure to sell your shit, aside from the augs, to get money as it and the augs are all that are retained throughout levels.

[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 2h 50m | Rec: Positive] I wish I could give a mixed review, but I suppose I recommend it more than I don't as long as you try the demo first. Oozes soul, but has a number of clear issues that need seeing to - the levels are labyrinthine and require backtracking with no map, which is often more frustrating than enjoyable, and you can't bring equipment between stages making exploring those labyrinths for their secrets pointless.

[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 6h 34m | Rec: Positive] personally I really enjoy this game even though i can understand a lot of the complaints especially for the vast open space but despite that its really fun to explore regardless thanks to its art style, atmosphere and scale of the levels. Ive reloaded save points despite completing objectives just to  see what other options there are or if theres any other better routes to take and im always surprised how much freedom there is and what routes to take.   Dont be afraid to abuse the save system and make your own save checkpoints i came across one instance of me soft locking myself in an area and i wouldn't doubt there's  more considering the scale of levels.    The art design is great there's a ton of downright breathtaking visuals even down to the UI elements. Its great playing a game with this much personality present in almost all of its aspects. The Shooting isnt too bad either, the enemy AI isnt the best, very serviceable but the guns feel weighty thanks to the sound  The dialogue is really charming too  Overall im really enjoying a lot of elements in this game and its one of the better games ive played recently even if its not as polished.

Despite it having the sound and light detection from Splinter Cell, I'm getting vibes it is more combat focused. I'm bludgeoning a guy with a sword despite being not detected. Although the rooms look dark, its still counts you as visible to the enemy. Hardly any health and energy fuses.

[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 6h 22m | Rec: Positive] I loved this game. It's beautiful. It helped me to come out as trans and accept myself as who I am. Marie is a complex female character whose journey resonated deeply with my own struggles.   Playing as Marie allowed me to explore aspects of femininity and strength that I had long suppressed. Her resilience in the face of adversity mirrored my internal battles with gender identity. As I navigated the desolate landscapes and made choices that shaped her fate, I began to confront my own feelings about being trans. The game’s emphasis on personal choice and moral ambiguity encouraged me to reflect on my own life decisions, ultimately leading me to question the constraints society had placed on me.   The emotional depth of Peripeteia was further amplified by the community surrounding it. The peri community, fostered an inclusive environment that celebrated diversity and encouraged players to embrace their true selves. Their open discussions about identity and representation in gaming inspired me to take the brave step toward transitioning. Knowing that creators of such a powerful narrative supported individuals like me gave me the courage to express my authentic self.   Through Marie's journey, I learned that identity is not merely a label but an evolving narrative shaped by our experiences. The game provided a safe space for exploration, allowing me to envision a future where I could live openly as my true self. I am immensely grateful to the peripeteia community for their encouragement and for crafting a game that transcends entertainment, becoming a catalyst for self-acceptance.   In conclusion, Peripeteia was more than just a game; it was a mirror reflecting my innermost desires and fears. It helped me embrace my trans identity and embark on a journey toward authenticity. For that, I will always be thankful.
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 40h 15m | Rec: Positive] Early Access brings a total 5 of the 10 planned levels and these levels will take hours to explore. Just keep in mind that some of the more advanced features are currently unavailable or very limited.   Otherwise its one-of-a-kind experience which is a rariry even amongst indie titles and anyone who's interested in its atmosphere of pure dystopia should give it a try.

[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 22h 41m | Rec: Positive] As someone who's been eagerly awaiting this game for a couple of years now, I'm not disappointed in the slightest. If anything, I'm a little bit pleasantly surprised. Perhaps I had a preternatural ability to sense how this game would feel in early access, but I've received what I came here for. If you're looking for Deus Ex or Dishonored, this game isn't quite that and although it's certainly inspired by them, I don't think it's ever supposed to be. If you, like me, came here for more experiences like EYE: Divine Cybermancy, then I think you'll be very happy. I am so looking forward to playing more, and seeing how this project develops. As it is, I'm sure I'll replay it a good bit.   A few specific notes:  I was initially surprised and a bit disappointed by the loss of all items after missions. One of the key design choices considered core to immersive sims is the sense of character development as you gain new skills and items. Initially this felt like a strange decision. But as a fan of Pistol-Start DOOM maps, it's a very reasonable choice. The inventory reset allows for a full journey of progression per level, and greatly enhances the ability to balance each level. Money being kept across levels then allows for a tuning of player experience in how a level is approached from the start, and I look forward to seeing these systems developed.  Although I've enjoyed the gameplay, it is currently fairly buggy. I've so far not encountered any bugs which cannot be solved by returning to the main menu and loading back in, but the inventory system has some issues and the grab-physics which can certainly enhance the gameplay once polished currently makes some intended routes nearly impossible.   This game is not for everyone, and is for a small subset of a small subset of people using Steam, but I've enjoyed it lots as both an art piece and as a fun video game.

[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 1h 11m | Rec: Negative] Game's levels are extremely sparse with lootable items few and far between. Inventory management is annoying, every item having their own shape is cool for the first few times, but having to rearrange everything to fit the bad guy's shitty AK inside so you can take the magazine and laser sight off gets really damn old the fifth time it happens. Music is nice, but also does not ever stop playing once combat starts and the same minute or so loop gets really fucking old after the tenth go around.  Also there are shittons of ways to softlock yourself in an inescapable pit, asked on their discord for help getting out inbetween all the slurs and was told I was SOL.  Enemy AI doesn't seem very good right now either, they dont seem to take into account things between you and them, several times I found an enemy after they spent a good few minutes spraying bullets into a pillar situated between me and them.  Cannot overstate how lame exploration is, I ran up a massive building's staircase to the top, and there was nothing at the end of it except a big building i could throw myself off if I wanted to.  Maybe wait a few months/years for early access to clean this game up a bit.
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 12h 22m | Rec: Positive] At the time of writing this review, Peripeteia is still in early access so I won't take any bugs into consideration for my review because I know that they'll be ironed out.  I've been eagerly anticipating and following this game’s development for about 4 years, so I'm personally pretty disappointed with this early-access version. The core idea for this game is so beautiful and has so much potential, but, in my opinion, is held back from greatness by bewildering design choices, and limitations of player autonomy. I love this game but it has a few fatal flaws.  The game progression is linear, but the maps don’t reflect it. The maps of levels are so large and expansive, yet downright punishing to the player by rarely providing guidelines or easy-to-follow level design. Player exploration of the huge maps isn't rewarded, because more often than not there will be a complete dead end after minutes of meandering or a straight-up inescapable pit. I understand that this can be fun for some players, but it would be nice to have some relative guidance for objective after a whole lot of meandering. Additionally, the grand scale of each map will often cause story beats to be mixed up or conflict with one another due to player over-exploration when there actually is something to be seen. This is a huge problem for me, because I WANT to enjoy the story and understand what's going on.  Non-lethal and stealth-based play styles are often very difficult to regularly access, and require an extensive amount of exploration in order to get these play styles set up. E.g. a silenced gun tucked away in the corner of a map, obscure dialogue from an NPC telling you about a way to bypass an entire area. These play styles are also limited severely by the fact that the enemy AI will know exactly where you are and relentlessly seek and attack. The implementation of darkness is fantastic on paper but ultimately doesn’t mean anything if an entire building of the enemy faction can automatically detect you, even when you’re completely obscured by darkness. There were many times during my playthrough where there just wasn’t a logical throughline of how every enemy knew my every move, past and present.  Having each level dependent on vertical design is visually stunning, and it’s evident how much care and hard work went into the visuals of the game. Being able to grab onto any ledge is a great feature on paper, but the geometry of the objects in the game makes climbing a very clunky experience. Even after sitting down and seriously learning to traverse the environment a bit more, it more often feels like hitting your head on a pipe or air conditioner instead of being a badass anime cyborg gracefully scaling the side of a building. Skill issue, but an issue nonetheless.  I completely understand that the development team has no intention of incorporating modern game design philosophies, but I feel like there's still a balance that can be achieved in giving players a more succinct level design. Much of this game feels very unintuitive, and the “f*ck around and find out” nature of it makes it difficult to interface with when f*cking around is oftentimes the only option. This game wears its influences on its sleeve but fails to meet the standards set by those influences, and the unique experience that the game provides is held back by it's flaws.  I feel as though this could be one of the greatest immersive sims of all time if it were tweaked and streamlined, without fully bending the knee into objective waypoints and difficulty selection of modern games (although it would be appreciated, and would make the game accessible to a LOT more players). Having vast, grand expanses of dream-like moody 90s graphics Poland 2 is an experience I haven’t had before from a video game, let alone the cyberpunk genre as a whole. Having no guard rails and falling to my death when missing a jump is fine, but genuinely trying to interface with the game and meet it at its level, only to be met with frustration is… frustrating. The bugs didn’t help either.  I really do love this game. Originally I left a review where I did not recommend the game, but an additional 8 hours later, I can't stop coming back to it. Maybe I wanted Peripeteia to be “Dishonored but Cyberpunk”, and my expectations were what soured it for me. However, in its current state, I am still left a bit disappointed.
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 2h 29m | Rec: Positive] Hi, I'm a firm believer that we are in a massive game drought. This game however has quenched my thirst like pure ambrosia from the dining hall of the Gods. Never in my life have I been more pleasantly surprised by a video game. I wish I was joking or that this review was purposely over-positive, but I mean it. The developers and writers of this game are true artists.  Best game of 2025. You need to play this.
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 25h 30m | Rec: Positive] I already played the demo for like 5 hours, I enjoy exploring. It's funny, has charm. My only gripe is sometimes it's just SOOOOO EMPTY and you might eventually give up on an area.If you cannot handle jank I say do not play this. I had a blast though.  Following up upon playing this last level, I absolutely DESPISE it, I love everything but the ammo scarcity, the AI shows it's absolute worst side of itself here, there's few save points. Very frustrating, I will still say I like this game but this part is just no good. I first posted this review at 4 hours of gameplay and I have been exploring and getting frustrated on this 4th map for 6 HOURS.

[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 25h 22m | Rec: Positive] Absolutely atmospheric and a game that lets you go pretty much everywhere even though there will probably be nothing to interact with. I always felt like I was sequence breaking every map after the first 2 just by the shear amount of places to climb or jump because you can very easily climb out and back into the map. However every time I thought that I broke something, the game "just worked" and I could get to the end.  Every map has a evil, neutral, or good ending depending on what faction you choose to do the missions for. This alone can change how long the map takes to complete and you are able to switch factions on the fly.  Loved taking in the sights, finding secrets, the story, and the funny bits that are sprinkled in here and there. Honestly can't wait to play and explore more maps.
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 1h 18m | Rec: Negative] I hope this gets better. The setting seems pretty great. I cant get past how poorly put together the combat and gameplay are.  Enemies lock on to you through walls and prefire you from around corners. The lighting is broken, areas that are pitch black dont give concealment yet areas under an actual flood light do. If you play with the recommended brightness settings you cant see anything. Tiny objects on the floor completely disappear, forcing you to either use a flashlight that cant be used with a weapon, or drain energy for maybe 30 seconds of nightvision. Enemies can take more damage than the player can but every weapon one taps to the head.  The chain link floors and banisters can be seen through, the slots can be fired through, and enemies will lock on to you even though they dont have direct line of sight through those materials. They will spam fire with their unlimited ammo until bullets randomly make it through gaps that you cant use because you have limited ammo.  The coyote time jump is a neat mechanic, but it shuts off after a certain fall distance and there's no indicator of when that occurs.  The whole game is hostile to the player in ways that arent fun. its not "fair" to the player because nothing that happens feels justified.  These are issues that looking glass solved with Thief and System Shock. Please do better.
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 7h 43m | Rec: Negative] I  I want to like it, a lot, but right now there's a lot wrong.  First very specific thing that comes to mind. Level 4, Karabash, i walk around and find 2 weird masked chicks. "poison the frogolist-whatever shes gonna take all our tarot reading customers" says the 2 weird masked chicks (only one talks but w/e). Use these frog eggs and aerolize them into her lungs while she sleeps so you can get into this club and progress.   Ok lol.  I try over and over to do it stealthliy without waking her (frogoloist) up, killing all the guards while gmod jump spamming and instant killing with the negative range sword (really is like gmod melee!). There's a breakable window I assumed I was supposed to go up to and get into her room with, but it alerts all the guards and wakes her up. Can't do it that way. 10~ish times i try. I do succeed in killing everyone without waking her up! But then, she wakes up anyway. This one time everything goes swimmingly, I go to poison her in her sleep for the first time, anndddddddddddd it doesn't remove the frog eggs from my inventory. Plays a cutscene flash of her lungs getting frogged!  Weird? I reload the save to do it all again because I'm not confident it did anything. Starting to doubt myself since I've seen a lot of jank up until now. No journal update or cutscene when I did poison her, in the discord someone says she wakes up and vomits after doing it correctly. I didn't get that! I've got the this area down now, though.  Can't poison her now.  Huh?  What changed? Something bugged out.  Ok fresh run no save load just retrace my steps.  Still can't poison her.  What the fuck. Disheartening is all I can say. I close the game at that point and reflect in this review.  ROLL BACK THE CLOCK R3TARD!!!!!  First level just like demo pretty good.  Second level, Chasm. I kinda rushed through but there's a lot, music's great. Some tracks like swinging in his cell could use a better loop but otherwise superb shit. Me like gun shoot.  Third is the highlight. Belgrad. Horror section. You go through a roof and there's abunch of nervous systems in glass cases like a pinned bug display in a library. Can only save in safe areas. I'm interested. Then a bunch of kids in metal vats. Hmm, someone cooked here? very hl2 beta esque vibes ive been getting up until this point. You go throughout this skyscrapper school prison place and get attacked by potato sack robots (I'm assuming dead kids? Idk something on the wall called them dolls that's what I'm going with). You go around scaving weps, finding keys and notes getting stringed along, and don't have a lot of ammo to work with. This is great! And it's not even the only route, I'm gonna go back and do the other eventually!  I sided with the meat monster girl thing living behind a locked door in this eugenics school. She told me go find her in the basement so I did. Turn's out shes apart of this reactor now and had some sort of radioactive multichromatic akira creepypasta ascension. Can't go near her or she mind rapes you. "Go through this hole lol". Yes ma'am!   I am sent down a sewer pipe thing with flashing green lights and get stuck on props as snares earrape. HUH?!?!  Then im in pocket dimension train killing school prison wardens from before with my handful of bullets. I fuck with with it.  I get out of train dimension, and go through more fucking misery. A bunch of survivors living in this blood sewer section that I have to carefully headtap or they just eat 9 gorbillion bullets.  I am the ceo of HATING health/high damage npc = difficulty. The AI isn't as bad as gmod npcs snapping onto you and hit scanning your soft spot on your head, but it doesn't leave a lot of breathing room. And likes getting stuck in corners. A lot of weapon's aiming/scoping is just dogshit, so trying to headtap something with fucked aiming, isn't satisfying.  I manage and move on, then got to karabash (lvl 4) and I enjoyed it until frog eggs shit. That just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Sure there was some weird sequence breaking before, like in Chasm where I set off the reactor and a helicopter spawned? But there was nowhere for me to go and fight it, I think? I did a bunch of back tracking and got to a lower level and saw it high above in the skyscraper (there's a lot of skyscrapers in this game btw) and it just kinda didnt do much. Shot a lot of bullets at me but missed em all, I couldn't really do anything to it.  Oh and the other thing about karabash, flamethrower guy who wants you to kill meat monster in the sewer? Yeah he just gets to her and rambles for a while. Was he supposed to light it on fire? Don't know. Killed him and did it myself. Didn't feel much impact from that.  I've seen other negative reviews saying this is dogshit fanfic, trivial gooner slop and masked fetishes for head dev. Whatever. It's easy to shit on stuff from a distance. I do it all the time! I see the validity, but I think there's a vision here, muddled. I don't mind a game asking for my attention, it just needs lots of bugfix and polish in this case. Not crazy about walking sims and empty maps, wish there were more items to cop. Empty lockers are STUPID. Even if its fodder items, it will make it feel more filled in. Had some inventory bugs that resolved themselves with reseting saves a lot, but over all I'd say its a 10 dollar game. They've been deving this for 5 years, and while I'll say its clearly a good labor of love, it has a long way to go still.   Please keep working at it, prove the shut ins and hyper critics wrong. Don't fold or disappear, you've clearly netted a big yet niche following for a reason.  52.501/103 needs more pirogi and time in the oven. nothing ever happens? I think not... high hopes for this. I hope. could care less about inventory not carrying over but it does ruin finding rare weapons. Devs will fix it water is wet.  will edit when more updates come out/when i feel lik it      
[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 15h 12m | Rec: Positive] Peripeteia is a well-made immersive simulator with a not-so-intuitive map/level design. Often times in game I'd find the city lifeless, the hints and clues too sparse, but it is part of the fun. Getting "lost" is one of the reason why this game is unique, elevating it to one of the best games I've ever played; yet, I won't recommend it to my friends that are not already into this genre due to the caveats listed above. However, if you are already familiar with imm. sim, then this game is an absolute gem.

[Date: 2025-02-23 | Playtime: 3h 29m | Rec: Positive] Found out about this game awhile ago from following the artist Hirotonfa who does some of the art for the game. Played the demo and eagerly awaited this release. And, in short, the game is rough around the edges but is already very fun in its' current form, and shows a ton of promise moving forward.   I like doing no kill stealth in games that give the option, ended up having to kill a few people in lvl 1 because going no kill was too difficult. A lot of the stealth systems feel quite buggy and inconsistent, some of that may be my own fault though.   A very charming game, worth getting now if you're really into ImSims and the aesthetic, and definitely worth keeping your eye on if the game intrigues you. I'll probably come back later to write a more detailed review.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 6h 11m | Rec: Negative] Very cool atmosphere, movement feels pretty good, the visual design is all great. The gun aiming makes me nauseous but I have issues with headbobbing in games so that's probably me and solvable with hipfiring/laser sights.  The issues with the game however make it tough to recommend to anyone. The levels are super massive, extremely dark (your nightvision and movement aug costs energy which only comes back through finite items), and navigating is a pain in the ass. Its not like Morrowind where you are given clear instructions, you get told something as vague as "go across the canal to reach this objective" then you're supposed to climb an apartment building, find a tram car, then take that to cross. If you jump across you waste 10-15 minutes walking to an easter egg that just gives you items that you lose upon exiting the level.  Money carries over, but none of the vendors have sold anything that wasn't dropped by enemies, or was an extremely expensive restorative item. Exploration is solely for the Vibes which if there was more to that, would be fine, but its walking down a 20 yard hallway to find a single health fuse. A basketball. A few guns that weren't in the level prior. UPDATE: Augs do carry over now, which is slightly nicer. But means exploring is only worth it if you're hurting for resources on that level, or hope to find an augment.  The music's pretty fun, but its one track looping in an area and because those areas can be massive, you'll be hearing the same track for a while. The sound design otherwise is pretty nice, rain falling on different surfaces sounds great combined with the screen effects of the droplets.   The story's pretty good too from what I experienced but when you have to walk for ages to get to any of it it's not really worth it.  I wish I could recommend this game, its almost really cool, but actually being in this space is more annoying than interesting. Its something that probably depends on the person, but without a better way to navigate (the compass that's built in? Was able to use it once when one NPC said something was north of something else. Nothing else references cardinal directions.) it's not very fun to play through.  edit: Also if I play another game that thinks the SPAS12 is fire-able when its folded up for storage I'm going to cry.
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 1h 13m | Rec: Positive] this game is made for a very specific type of person and i am not that person
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 2h 16m | Rec: Positive] Haven't played much, but I'm hooked already. I really like the brutal Level Design which reminds me of Half Life (as several other Reviews already mention). Since I haven't played the Deus Ex games, I can't compare them with this game, other Reviews go much more into detail for this. The Art Style is what catches me the most, as it really complements the already mentioned Level Design and Character Design. The Mechanics are easy to grasp, but I'm not utilizing them to the max either. The only thing I might change is a clearer Objective System. I feel like I'm running between places without knowing what to do. Sure the Journal tells me to go somewhere, but it doesn't tell me *clearly* which Objectives (specifically Side-Objectives) are still unfinished. I'm not asking for a full blown guide, but maybe a few Checkboxes like "Go here, this NPC might tell you something". It is not a huge problem however, and maybe I'm just too bad to understand the Journal. Should my opinion change in the next few Playtime-Hours, I'll edit this review, but right now it feels really special, and I like that.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 32h 11m | Rec: Positive] 10/10! Я просто в шоке от инди студий! Это алмаз, который я случайно нашел на свалке стима. Великолепный киберпанк экшен в нереально большом мире. Это определенно игра года! Стиль, атмосфера, интерактивность... и немного косое управление. Система имплантов, вариативность прохождения, квиксейвы и возможность выбирать камеру - от первого или третьего лица!  Спустя почти 30 часов, я таки освоил если не весь, то почти весь контент ЕА. Да, тут +- 30 часов, и это не "бесконечная реиграбельность" Хреньвуда, это 30 часов  крутейшего контента. В Перипетии использована великолепная система связности мира, позволяющая проходить локации и квесты множеством способов, в любой последовательности и направлении.  При этом почти нет квестов, обрезающих какую-либо часть контента. Более того, исследование локаций не ломает квесты.    В игре десятки пушек и они ощущаются по-разному. Стрельба хороша, но есть определенные проблемы с мушками у некоторых стволов при стрельбе себе под ноги. В остальном - достойно. Есть возможность стрелять с двух рук, в прыжке, на лестнице, в висе на руке на карнизе... и это все еще и в слоумо можно запилить. Или невидимость, скорость и акимбо замутить с парой пулеметов, а-ля Мотоко из Призрака в Доспехах.  ИИ врагов специфичен, рандомен, но количество, огромный урон и приличная живучесть врагов компенсирует его недостатки.    Стелс работает нормально. Главное - он не раздражающий, прощающий и понятный. Плюс физон отрабатывает на все сто. Я и врагов разных фракций стравливал, и засады делал, и ловушки в стиле "кирпич-бошка" устраивал.  Сейвскам во  все поля в наличии.  Паркур - идеален. Можно хвататься  за все уступы, создавать лестницы из ящиков, мечи-ножи и гарпуны - тоже прекрасно втыкаются в стены и на них можно залезать. Бегать по проводам, как Рейн или скользить по лесницам в стиле Соулсов тоже можно. Есть даже дрон-парашют.   Взломы консолей, контроль нпс и убийства окружением так же завезли.  Моральные дилемы и тотальный мрачняк и безнадега? Два ведра с горкой вам нальют еще на первой миссии, причем одно ведро - вы нальете себе скорее всего сами, не разобравшись в мотивах.  Чего нет, так это расчлененки и оверкила. Даже попадание РПГ оставит за собой скромный труп.  Перипетия имеет на данный момент 5 уровней, и этого уже достаточно чтобы стать событием инди сцены. Даже если еа загнется прямо сейчас - это уже шедевр достойный хвалебных од. Экспириенс, который надо ощутить самому. А если разраб  допилит еще 4 + обещанных уровня... Ух! Тогда это будет игра десятилетия! Рекомендую!
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 3h 34m | Rec: Negative] I was stoked for this game but it's just not fun. The level feels like something out of a fever dream. Giant empty spaces with nothing in between. I get that it's an immersive sim but it's so hard to navigate, everything is just too dark you can barely see anything. I'm at the point where you have to carry a cyborg to the person who gave you the quest and it's such a pain to drag the cyborg all the way back. Even the slightest collision makes you drop the cyborg. I cannot count the number of times I've just ALT+F4ed out of frustration. I'm sorry but I can't recommend this game.

As a big fan of massive brutalist architecture and non-linear quest structures I feel like this game was made for me. I understand the complaints about massive "empty" levels (they aren't) but it really does add to the experience. It's a game about getting lost and stumbling into your objective before locking in.   There are some rough bits for sure but if you like EYE Divine Cybermancy or Deus Ex you'll probably find a lot to love in the available levels.  As a PS I'd like to say that it would be really hard to judge this game within the first couple hours, the lack of handhold8kg means that you'll likely be confused on the objective locations long enough to prevent you from completing the first level within the refund period. I would play the demo rather than abusing the refund policy to try it.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 10h 4m | Rec: Positive] An immersive sim RPG set in an alternate history, cyberpunk, post-Soviet Poland.  Mix of Deus ex + E.Y.E + Thief + Ghost in the Shell + Blame!  Interesting world, characters, great atmosphere, maps are non-linear, interestingly designed, very vertical and fun to explore thanks to efficient movement (and the saber). You can approach each problem in many ways. Exploration is addictive and rewarding, you can find a lot of different arsenals, finds or upgrades that give us new abilities.  At the moment in early access it has a Eurojank vibe, the AI of the enemies still needs a lot of work, but it's so worth it to keep on exploring.  I recommend trying the demo, there is a large first map, lots of side activities, places to explore, you can easily spend 10 hours there and then decide if you want to wait for the full release or enter the early access.  I've been waiting for this experience for a long time, and for me it's an absolute gem. There are moments when everything just clicks, and when it happens, it's just amazing. Certainly not for everyone, but there are plenty of treats for nerds, it has a soul and you can feel that it was made by people who loved Ion Storm and Looking Glass games.  And don't be mean to Kasia!

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 0h 45m | Rec: Negative] the atmosphere and ambience are beautiful. i love love love how the city goes on forever in every direction, it reminds me a lot of BLAME! the music is sick af too. unfortunately thats the only good thing i can say about this game. there are many many glaring flaws.   one of the biggest is the ai. the ai is just straight up so stupid it is inexcusable. they will get lost in wide open rooms, forget that theyre engaged in combat with you, cant pathfind, and in some other cases theyll be aimbots and delete you in 2 seconds. i dont expect games to necessarily have GOOD ai, but it should not be so bad that it takes me out of the immersion. this also ties into the second biggest flaw that the gunplay does not feel good. theres very little feedback on both ends. enemies will just take several hits and then fall flat on the floor with little indication if youre even hitting them. and enemies will be hitting you and its not obvious youre even taking damage until you look at your health indicator in the bottom left.   the level design leaves a lot to be desired. there are some very questionable design choices. certain paths feel like youre meant to just quicksave before you go through because after you climb down a chasm or walk thru an excessively long hallway or a certain 30 story apartment bldg youre rewarded with nothing. and i mean that literally. i can tell they were trying to go for invoking the magical feeling of getting lost in the streets of hong kong in deus ex for the first time. it just falls flat because there is SO MUCH space, and SO LITTLE of it has anything worthwhile. it definitely delivers the feeling of being lost, its just in a way thats frustrating. the only moments i actually felt rewarded were when you could see vistas of the endless megacity.   the writing is just uninteresting from the lore and talking to npcs. theres not much to say about it. tho i did like the one character who comments on how some guy hacked all the tvs in the arcology to go off on schizoid rants all day.  and then i got to the second level and all the stuff i gathered previously just vanished from my inventory. im not sure if thats a bug or not, but if intended is just completely contradictory to what this genre is supposed to be from a game design level. that was when i felt compelled to refund.  anyways this review ended up way longer than i intended it to be. i found it to be profoundly disappointing. beautiful atmosphere but atmosphere can only carry a game so far. it gives the illusions of having deep mechanics and systems to play around with. and thats all it is, illusion.  tldr: would be a good walking sim or 3d art exhibit but its not a good game

Misery and rebar. 7.62 shards. Failed ideologies. Misunderstanding. You pause in what remains a labyrinth. Raymarched lighting from a sky that may as well be infinitely far away. It streams glittering through glass and wires and struts. It's beautiful. All the moreso from all that surrounds. You still have this. A masterpiece of Polish jank. Needs some polish but damn me, it's moreish and atmospheric in ways few games are. Supremely recommended.

You can hack into vending machines, blow up cars and drink battery acid. You will also die in this game a lot. What else do you need?  As of writing this review I've encountered audio bugs and some dialogs got stuck with no way to quit them, so my advice to new players is to quicksave a lot. Don't forget the game is early access.  Some players are unhappy with losing progress at each level, but IMO this is a plus. The game already gives you a lot, though ammo is quite limited, but either way you solve your problems only with the tools that you find laying around, and this gives you a challenge. This is something that old games did a lot, btw. Hoarding with this level design makes no sense since it will quickly make you into unkillable tank that just runs and kills everyone.

Off in the distance i heard a faint sound of shoegaze so of course i had to find it. The source of this music was a collection of TVs with a guy's face on it. The music was loud now and i just sat there for a bit just taking in the atmosphere.   If this appeals at all to you, please buy this game. You won't regret it.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 1h 25m | Rec: Positive] До релиза поигрывал в демо-версии, занимая себя в основном перепрохождением одного ОБУЧАЮЩЕГО уровня.  И, бля, в моменты когда ловил себя на мысли что всё - весь доступный контент вдоль и поперек изучен, то потом приходилось брать свои слова обратно, так как РАНО ИЛИ ПОЗДНО НАХОДИЛ ЧТО-ТО НОВОЕ!  И вот... игра релизнулась. Что могу сказать? Немного походил по новым уровням и... я словил тотальный ахуй, во-первых, от их количества... а во-вторых - ОТ ИХ РАЗМЕРОВ.  Лично мне проект очень полюбился возможностью исследовать огромные уровни, за изучение которых игра поощряет, награждая как лутом, так и просто каким-нибудь интерактивом.  Короче, если вам любопытна тема эксплоринга и вы не особо придирчивы к графике, то игра вам должна понравиться, хз.
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 13h 15m | Rec: Positive] I don’t remember exactly when, but I recall Valve News Network covering this game a long time ago. I added it to my wishlist, and when I finally saw it available for purchase, I couldn’t wait to get home and play it. Right now, I’m completely lost in its world—but that’s okay. The exploration aspect is fantastic, and the game feels truly unique. I definitely recommend picking it up and supporting the developer!

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 1h 23m | Rec: Positive] [h1] Deus Ex + Eurojank + Parkour + Waifu + Est Europa = Peripeteia  [/h1]  Ho messo gli occhi su Peripeteia nel (lontano) 2021, incuriosito dalla sua estetica e dal gameplay sulla falsa riga di immersive sim quali Deus Ex o System Shock: possibilità di scegliere tra diversi modi (più o meno convenzionali) per approcciarsi alla missione, mappe aperte e liberamente esplorabili, impianti cibernetici e gestione totale dell'inventario.  Devo dire che mi ha sorpreso in positivo! La trama è piuttosto criptica e da quel poco che ho avuto modo di capire (e giocare) il giocatore veste i panni di un'androide di nome Maria, risvegliatasi in una discarica ed intenzionata a scoprire di più sul suo passato. Il gioco è ambientato in una realtà alternativa, più precisamente la Polonia, rivisitata in salsa cyberpunk.  A livello di gameplay ho trovato molto interessante la meccanica del parkour e dell'arrampicata, non siamo ai livelli di Assassin's Creed o Mirror's Edge, ma la possibilità di appendersi ai muri e sfruttare l'ambiente circostante per crearsi delle vere e proprie shortcut ambientali l'ho trovata un'aggiunta molto gradita!  Il gioco è uscito in early-access ieri (21/02/2025) ed è possibile giocare i primi cinque livelli della campagna. Ovviamente, ciò potrebbe comportare la presenza di alcuni bug (che io personalmente non ho ancora incontrato) ed alcuni elementi di gameplay, principalmente lo shooting, potrebbero risultare ostici ai neofiti non tanto del genere ma di questo tipo di produzioni: ho trovato infatti alcune somiglianze con la trilogia originale di STALKER per quanto riguarda lo shooting ed in generale le animazioni, molto legnose (Eurojank per l'appunto), caratteristiche tipiche dei videogiochi "low-cost" est-europei dei primi anni Duemila e che a me personalmente non dispiacciono.  Consiglio Peripeteia? Sì, soprattutto se siete fan di Deus Ex o degli immersive sim in generale. Non vedo l'ora che esca la 1.0!
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 24h 29m | Rec: Positive] Waited for 3 years for this game  I love the whole game, the music especially is the reason it made me curious about the game at first, watched a couple of walkthroughs.  played the demo myself, got hooked with the gameplay.  the moment I saw the release date, I had to get it.  brought it after release date.  holy shit, I LOVE IT <333
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 15h 51m | Rec: Positive] I don't want to write a huge paste, so I'll put it simply :  if you want a stealth action immersive sim(aka deus ex, thief), this game might get boring after the first 40 story staircase.  But if you want an incredibly atmospheric sandbox with HUGE levels, you're in for a treat. I also want to emphasize - do not be afraid to use speed boost augment (f2) and quick save|load to speed up the exploration of locations.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 28h 28m | Rec: Positive] Peripeteia is the greatest game I have ever played, and I don't say that lightly. It's arguably the most fun I've ever had playing video games since I started playing them. This game has such a unique living, breathing personality. I dare to say it possesses a soul in an industry saturated with soulless games, and the companies behind them. Not only is this game a breath of fresh air, it's just a wonderfully fun game to play. I had been interested in this game for years, and, finally being in a better financial position I was able to invest in their patreon, and get access to the game much earlier. In the stage of development I had gotten access to, I was already aware that this game was going to be monumental, stellar, and was going to provoke people in ways games haven't done in a very long time.  I don't want to spoil much as this game is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, but, there's so many memorable moments in this game that stick with me, you'll love this game, I hope. I'm thankful to be around to have played it.

Gives me that "Figure it out, nerd" feeling that I miss from old games. fyi like other folks are saying you don't bring stuff home that you find on the field. Money does carry over tho. If that's a deal breaker I get it. I don't mind it tho.
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 3h 1m | Rec: Positive] I like the premise, but as other said not being able to keep your inventory is a really weird choice. You have an inventory system that wants you to organize these items and you tie a value to items which gives you the idea that like any other RPG that you should decide what to take and maybe even sell or keep and use. It also is an incentive to explore and find hidden items, but then you just lose it all when you go to the next level. THAT IS AWFUL DESIGN. Could you imagine if in Deus Ex or Cyberpunk you just lost all your items in the next level? AWFUL. It means all your exploration to find items meant nothing, it was a waste of time. All the choices you considered on what you start with in the first level, meant nothing!  Edit: I am willing to change my review to positive as I like the scenery and the gameplay. I like that we now keep implants and I like that our inventory is liquidated into cash automatically although I still feel like it is a bandaid to the problem of not keeping items. If this is the developers vision for the game so be it, but why not just add flavor text saying you cannot keep items on the train or whatever reason you lose all your items? It is clear that the game is made with passion and I can finally at least be somewhat rewarded for finding items that I can sell. What I didn't like was the first experience wasting my time with my inventory juggling by not telling may "Hey you should go sell or you will just lose everything" as at the time items were not liquidated automatically at the end of the level. I also do not like the apparent non-reactions to what you do sometimes: [spoiler] In the first level you can find a woman sweeping and she mentions her father who happens to be in an iron lung and you can unplug it and kill him effectively, and she does not react to this at all [/spoiler] I also do not like the way you can suddenly find yourself in the middle of a storyline. I was exploring and suddenly this man blew his brains out saying something to the effect of I will never catch him alive. I wouldn't know the text box closed automatically and he killed himself only for me to find out later it was to get this chip for a separate quest. The A.I. is still incredibly broken and janky, shooting and nothing or at times either staring at you or shooting away from you. Friendly A.I. wander away from their original spots as I watched Fillemon and all his guards wander towards the train station and get stuck at a door. Overall, all I want from an immersive sim/RPG is to actually feel progress and feel rewarded for my choices and exploration, and it is taking steps in the right direction, but still is not quite there.   I do still stand by the belief that a good immerisve sim/rpg will gradually escalate difficulty and start you off with lower quality gear or equipment and let you progress through the story so that it feels like you are living in this world. It feels far too like a video game to have you lose everything for seemingly no specific reason that Fillemon could easilly have some flavor text saying why you can't take weapons on a train or something to that effect. For others to just say it is meant to be like scenarios and levels you play through is pretty cope still

Exploring the world and finding secrets feels absolutely pointless, despite the great artstyle.  Would refund it if i could.  EDIT: Although steam gave me a refund even though i played over 2 hours (steam Nr.1) i have decided to buy this game again because i really like it and want to support the developers.  My point still stands: losing everything between missions is a kick in the face.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 8h 52m | Rec: Positive] as a fan of immersive sims and the cyberpunk genre, im glad this game scratches BOTH itches. I remember seeing the trailer YEARS back and being so excited to explore this dystopian world and play as the enigma that is "Marie" . Did this game deliver after all these years? YES 100% The atmosphere, the music, sound design and the melancholic ambiance. Absolutely amazing. The weapons are a bit janky but still very fun/satisfying to use. The augments add a helping hand to whichever situation you get yourself in, that you can never keep the same ones each play through. Exploring these levels is so fun and rewards you for doing so, like any good Immersive sim does. If you like many other notorious immersive sims like Cruelty Squad, Deus Ex, And Bioshock with the inspiration of Blade Runner and Ghost In the Shell then You're going to LOVE Peripeteia. Peripeteia goes to show that "Indie" games are more creative, passionate and dedicated than Triple AAA games. Frequent Updates and posts on the official Peripeteia discord and steam page. This one is for the record books for sure. Please Buy it. worth every cent in my opinion

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 0h 54m | Rec: Negative] Currently, no. Future? Sure!  It's very much one of those "learn to like it" sort of games, I love an imsim and this gave me DX1 vibes, I liked that I could climb up stuff, use augments to approach situations, all very neat. Hacking is really cool too! I didn't like how often it felt like playing a multiplayer Gmod map all by myself, however. I'm all for dystopian open areas, but when a good 90% of the areas are dystopian open areas with *nothing in them* with limited "faster sprint" due to it using energy, you start to lose me a bit.  Shooting is functional, aiming is annoying as it has the seperate camera movement on the arms and not just the camera. Maybe there's a setting to change this, but I'm mixed on how much I like this. On one hand, it makes the combat more challenging and that's cool, on the other hand, it makes aiming more annoying as you try to line up a headshot just for your whole ass gun to continually get in the way.  I remember playing the demo of this ages ago, and I thought it was really cool. This release wasn't enjoyable for me, and I'm pretty bummed about it. Maybe I'll try again after some updates + discount.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 1h 17m | Rec: Positive] I've not played much, but it definitely reminds me of some of my fonder memories of gaming... classic immersive sims like Deus Ex/Thief/System Shock... some STALKER... some Cruelty Squad... my time with a little gem called Sir, You Are Being Hunted... I've barely played EYE but this is startlingly reminiscent of it.  But, it does remind me of some of the... shall we say, less endearing things about all of those games. This is definitely a jank Early Access, and the openness of the initial level (and the rest of the game from what I hear) is a bit daunting, a bit unwieldy from a player's perspective. But, having played over an hour, I'm leaving a positive review because this game VIBES. I never knew how much I needed a dark, stormy, cyclopean cyber-pocalyptic setting like this, a sick album like this while fighting for my life, the constant falling rain, the splashing of your feet through puddles. The sense that it's a world I could get lost in and never be found again. I've been waiting for this one for awhile now. I can see it being an addiction in future. As of now, I'll wait a little longer. I'm just glad I got it at all.  Also, bug report: I stopped playing to write this review because in my desperate attempts to figure out hacking, once I finally did so successfully, the hacking screen wouldn't go away. And it was still there when I reloaded a save too. Pretty frustrating. Sort of breaks the immersive experience when I gotta restart the game entirely. I trust the developers will handle it.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 23h 1m | Rec: Positive] Good soundtrack. Intriguing art design.  Shit ass level design. First objective took me 2.1 hours to complete because I ended up walking around endless staircases and tunnels, and almost got softlocked at the ladder by the fan room (if you know, you know), then when escorting the planetarium bot back to the guy, my save point would spawn more and more goons each time. Interesting? The goons too have deadly accuracy but also are dumb as rocks when they aren't lining up sights on you.  The game is very directionless. "Get lost" is the philosophy here and honestly, it just isn't for me. I like exploration and immersive sims but there needs to be more direction and less thirty story staircases with same doors copy-and-pasted for every bloc you come across.  EDIT:   So this is the only game I had bought and then refunded, only to buy again. For some reason the day after, I couldn't shake this game from my mind. It was calling me back as if I was missing something, and honestly, I'm glad I did.  Basically, once I got over the fact that the game is willing to let you get lost and waste your time, I started to appreciate it more. Starting with the second level, the gameplay systems between inventory management, exploration, shootouts, etc. started to all click and make a lot more sense than the tutorial made it out to seem. Honestly, I blame the first level for being a bit too big for its own good. It's not a bad level but there is so much dead space. When I got to Belgrade though, man, this game made me realize that I have grown to like it so much. Belgrade is such a cool level with so many secrets and ways to go around it. I can't say so much the same for the last level that actually sucks, especially if you do things out of order and don't take the train. If you don't do the train, you are going to waste sooooooooooooooo much time.  But really, if you don't mind killing time exploring a single direction that might or might not have anything there for you, this game is great for that, because most of the time there was something there! It's amazing actually how it accomplishes that.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 12h 44m | Rec: Positive] I think this is one of the most games to not be biased about liking.  There's not much else like it-- There's a lot of heart and genuine soul built into the experience in what is essentially a hyperniche project which will only appeal to a select few, being developed and self-published, essentially trying to recreate the magic that previous projects only could with some of the best of the industry of their time at the helm. Going after Looking Glass's example is a high task.  Do they do it entirely? No, not really. Gunplay is awkward, enemy AI is frantic and frankly incoherent sometimes, the story is mostly told through worldbuilding and most things, somewhat similar to EYE (honestly this game in its coherence and raw themes is closer to EYE than Deus Ex or Thief, by all means, including the near-empty giant levels at times, cough) and yet, while its frustrating? I can't help but love it.  The artystyle, the themes, and raw personality written within the dialogue and experiencing some of the cultural referencing and locale with my Polish friend has just been a raw joy. The moment to moment gameplay and travel especially need work, but it IS Early Access. Even so, entire levels can have random seams, some buildings are floating, I saw a tank disassemble and transform into two parts on the third level, and sometimes certain things can be done outright out of order and completely bug the game.   Once the player is given way more direction and the journal is updated, improved, etc. I think we could look at a really solid product. The levels need like, ten times the content or detail to justify their size most times, or at the very least some sort of map/flagging function. It's genuinely horrifying sometimes to navigate.   There is nothing like Peripeteia. I don't think there ever will be again. Let it cook for a while, but enjoy what's there. I'll remember this game for a long, long while.

Patience and a knack for exploration is needed to play this because the game does NOT hold your hand. Firefights require you to get a little creative, but is super satisfying when you succeed. There is some minor jank and a few rough edges, but it is early access and i expect some of that to get fleshed out as the game reaches 1.0.   Definitely recommend if you like EYE or any cyberpunk media tbh

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 42h 58m | Rec: Positive] I got this game for free by means of supporting the devs, and this is my second review (first one felt too forced and unoriginal).  Long story "short", I really, really, really like this game, It's fast when it wants it to be fast, it's frustrating when it wants to be frustrating, and it's beautiful when it wants to be beautiful. The gameplay is fun, you can go from being a little sneaky snake to fully armed and augmented. The world is huge and confusing (which can be a turnoff to some), but at the same time, you can find little moments to appreciate the world you are in. The story is awesome, with different details presented to you depending on how you tackle an objective and who you side with for a level. I will admit there are some slight issues with it (I overlook it though), but I put my faith into the devs to tweak it and get it to an even better state than what we have now.   My first review was long, but this one is definitely shorter and I think more coherent, and as some loser who put over 60+ hours into this (22+ hours in the demo and 40+ for this) please get it for its immense replayability, each time I go through, I find something new in the world and learn something about it.  TL;DR, bery fun game, replayable, awesome, plus cute MC.
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 25h 23m | Rec: Positive] [h3] ディストピア パルクール アクションゲーム [/h3] [hr][/hr] ストアページの説明欄の 「歴史が変わったサイバーパンクのポーランドで、サイバネティック スーパーソルジャーが腐敗と機会に満ちたソ連崩壊後の都市で傭兵として道を歩む」 の一文に惹かれるものを感じる人ならオススメ。 映画のブレードランナーみたいな雨が降る夜景などゲームの雰囲気も良い感じ。 一作目のDeus Exを知ってる人だとサイズの決まったアイテムを収納するインベントリ、オブジェクトを掴んで足場にする、体の部位ごとにHPが設定されてるなど既視感のある設定に気付くと思う。 [h3] 特殊アクション [/h3] このゲームの独自の要素として、梯子、建物の端、箱、自販機など操作キャラの背丈を超える障害物全てに掴まることができ、そこからジャンプして別の場所に掴まるパルクールアクションがある。 道に沿って進む以外にも建物間を飛び移りながら自分だけのルートを見つけて進むこともでき、逆に高所からの落下中に手すりに掴まって高速で降りることもできる。  バッテリー消費することで光学迷彩、体感時間を遅くするバレットタイム、ナイトビジョンなどサイバネティックス能力を使用して戦闘を有利にすすめることも可能。 デフォルト装備のナイトビジョン、エンハンスモビリティ、マップドローン、ミッドエアーブースト以外はステージ内のインプラントを回収して使用可能になる。  自販機、端末へのハッキングは制限時間以内に文字数分のアルファベットを入力するもので、ハッカーがキーボードを高速で打ち込む要領で対応するキーを入力することで解除できる。 （２回しか挑戦できないので、直前にセーブして１回目はひたすら適当に別のキーを打ち込み、答えの文字を絞り込む）  ※車を調べてSeconds ０でBlou it upするのはオススメしない [h3] ステータス [/h3] 操作キャラのMarieの体力は％で表示されており頭部、左腕、右腕、胴体、左脚、右脚でステータスが分かれていて被弾した箇所で数値が減少していく。 胴体が総HPでゼロになると死亡、頭部にダメージを受け続けると視界が不明瞭になり、脚部にダメージを受け続けると走れなくなるなどの影響が表れる。 正面切って撃ち合うとすぐ死亡するバランスなので確実にヘッドショットを決めるか物陰からリーンで狙うなり工夫が必要。 [h3] 銃火器に関して [/h3] ハンドガン、ライフル、ショットガン、サブマシンガン、アサルトライフル、ライトマシンガン、火炎放射器と種類が多い上に、銃によってはリロードも一発ずつ装填とマガジン交換の２種類あり、ゲーム序盤から銃弾は少なめで倒した敵の銃から弾を抜いて入手する必要がある。 あとマガジンを外しただけだと銃本体に装填してある弾１発分が残り続けるのでUnlordして取り出す。  本作のマガジンを使った銃のリロードが少し細かく、例えばAKでリロードしようとすると弾を装填した別のマガジンが必要。 AK１丁しかない状況だとインベントリ内で銃本体からマガジンを外し専用の弾をドラッグして装填、弾の入ったマガジンをAKに付け直す必要がある。  一人称視点は通常クロスヘア表示で、構えるとアイアンサイトで狙いをつけるシステム。 素早く銃を動かすと構えのアニメーションの位置がズレる為、銃撃戦での難易度が上がってる要因になっている。 カメラを引いて操作キャラが見える三人称視点での戦闘も可能。 [h3] 総評 [/h3] サイバーパンクの世界観を取り入れた他のゲームだとDeus EX、Cyberpunk 2077等があるが、本作Peripeteiaは光と影を強調したようなグラフィックのゲームで全体的に画面が暗くナイトビジョンを多用する場面がある。 例に挙げた２作と比較するとサイバーパンク要素よりも退廃的なディストピア要素が強く感じられた。 正面からの強行突破以外に段差に掴まって別のルートから敵の裏を取ったり、暗闇に潜んで敵に見つからないようにするなどステルスを活用した銃撃戦が楽しめた。 あとジャンプ未使用で落下すると空中ジャンプできるミッドエアーブーストと掴み状態でしゃがむと手を離すアクションを忘れないように。  ただBelgradeのレベルに関しては、良し悪しで交互に傾く天秤のような評価のステージで最初は所持していたインプラントを没収された上にセーブ機能も制限された状態で、見つかると高速移動してくる敵に襲われる理不尽なレベルだと思っていた。  簡単にクリアしたいだけなら [spoiler]初めて人形と遭遇する部屋で夜景の映ったガラスを破壊して進みパソコンにPASSWORDを入力し扉を開放して先の存在を破壊すると敵が消失する[/spoiler]  Belgradeは、どれだけ早く配置してある銃に気付けるかで難易度が変化するレベルで、決まったルートを進まないと奪われたインプラントが回収できないのも評価が分かれるところ。
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 5h 20m | Rec: Negative] A foreword, my review focuses on multiple aspects including the development team, my personal perception of what I THINK it's happening based on other trends I witnessed, and the game itself all of those through a CYNICAL lens, if you don't like what I have to say, there are multiple other reviews that do nothing but glaze the game.  I was surprise to see that it's releasing (finally) after all the years that passed since the  demo, for a second I thought it would become another perpetual "project" that just continuously leeches of off Patreon money or something related to that, now i'm interested to see what will come in time and how development will continue to unfold as in "will it ever get finished".  THE GOOD: I like it, the artistic(story and art style) direction is good, atmosphere is there, sound design is on point and I can't even complain about the soundtrack(even tho I PERSONALLY hate their artists ((((((the slut from the sewer and the likes))))))since they done irreparable damage to the real breakcore genre through mislabeling but that's another story). Game gives you a variety of weapons to use, their details are pretty nice and the way their mechanics work isn't too boring or complex, it's just right. I was surprised when there was a second option to complete the first mission honestly and that you can essentially play both sides if you want, genuinely great. No hand holding(almost), I personally really dislike being told exactly what to do since I try doing most of the things in a non linear way through my way, but the starting part where you received like 4 journal notes in 2 minutes telling me even the smallest things like "i should climb the ladder" or whatnot, its kinda "ughhhhhhhhhhhh" to me although it may be just that starting part and nowhere else but I can't say for sure yet. There aren't that many things I can say without going in many details, the game IS A GREAT BASE(this is important later).  THE BAD: Unfortunately there are many bad things to speak of, first are the bugs, and lots of them, for example, problems with weapons falling through the map, problem with inventory, I accidentally put a magazine over another and then it disappeared, ghost weapons in inventory, weapon seemingly disappearing from stashes but still being there like empty space, sound issues that need to restart the game, and the list can go on. Unfinished map(s), can't speak for any other but the first location(I can't imagine the subsequent maps are more complete than the very first) since I took my time to explore, but my experienced was a lot of running around through space with not that much in it(some lockers with items if you're keen eyed), I wouldn't have a problem with that if I did have something to traverse terrain at a faster pace consistently since for now this extra terrain serves to only keep me away from the places that actually have something happening in them with almost nothing in between to fill up the space(secondary objectives, world building, NPC interactions, loot, enemies, anything but empty space like the staircase of hell with lots of unusable doors please). The A.I. for now its not that great either, they investigate the place where they heard you shooting then if you get found they just W + M1, you can just stay behind a wall and shoot them as they come so it got no essence, make them be more interesting to play against like, make them throw grenades at you, make them swarm you, make them take cover when needed, etc. There may be more but these are the more glaring issues I have faced.  The QUESTIONABLE: I feel like for an android or a robot or whatever you are, you take falling damage too easily even from places that you don't expect to, I guess that's what that aug is for but at the same time to me it just feels like a way to ignore this minor inconvenience. The game runs kinda bad for a game that has these specs, depending where I am on the map and where I'm looking I experience FPS drop to 50s from 75(my monitors refresh rate), this is disgraceful considering that I run more demanding games by comparison at a very consistent frame rate across the board, I should be able to run this game at 75 fps in all scenarios(my specs are Arc A770 16GB, Ryzen 7 5800X, 32GB of RAM and the game is installed on an 970 EVO Plus). The game lacks some general QoL things, like why can't you close menus by just hitting ESC, some more inventory space or a way to carry more things at once, being given so many weapons from enemies or lockers you'd think you'll have a bigger place to store them but if you carry 2 weapons, their ammo, some recovery items and your augments, half of your inventory is gone and each enemy drops their own weapon, that means doing multiple runs to the vendor from 1 side of the map to the other to be able to sell them which takes a lot of time and considering the empty space between where you are and where you're going, it becomes tedious really fast. The enemies only drop the weapon they were using and the ammo left loaded in the mag before dying.  CONCLUSION: The point I want to get at is that it needs some more work and in my opinion the game is not worth buying at this moment at this price for what it has to offer, that's why I can't recommend it, I will happily rewrite the review after it gets a couple more updates with improvements but as of right now, whoever is buying this is only paying for whats essentially just a proof of concept. Even taking that into account I have to actually commend the launch for the fact that it's actually playable unlike other games that literally don't open up on launch day.  P.S. Please include a melee weapon like a knife or something  or a quick melee attack with the butt of the gun or pistol, I think it would greatly benefit this game.
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 22h 39m | Rec: Positive] this game does have its fair share of jank and choppiness, and although i haven't finished the game yet, I'm loving it so far.  The levels are big and the buildings are bigger, there is a lot of empty space but it definitely fits the ps1/ps2 aesthetic and style of the game.  the guns are fun to use, and i really enjoyed having to manage my inventory since i was using a bunch of different guns and ammo's. my biggest complaint/hope is that some type of direction is added to assist the player in finding out what to do next. I was so lost and confused for most of the first  level especially when having to cross the canal to get to the signal tower, eventually i found the gondola lift but it took me awhile.  maybe its just me but the story (at least in the first level) is a little confusing, the dialogue is sort of frantic and quick with not much explanation, like every instant of dialogue is trying to get straight to the point.  Also some things were mentioned in dialogue that made me question  whether or not i was in the right place at the Right time.  overall this game is sick asf.
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 3h 55m | Rec: Negative] Great art direction, music, and ambience, the dev knocked it out of the park with that. Unfortunately it's the actual game part that really matters here and what IS here is not great. I would even call it pretty bad at times.  Inventory management is genuinely awful. On paper it looks cool to have items take up unique shapes on a grid but in practice it makes managing ANYTHING in your inventory a massive pain. This wouldn't be too much of an issue if looting enemies wasn't also awful. There's no way to just unload guns or pull attachments from stuff on the ground. You have to individually pick up every little thing off the ground to interact with it. Expanding the right click context menu to stuff lying in the world would make inventory management so much easier.  On the topic of looting, enemies JUST have guns. Nothing else. Oh and sometimes if you are lucky you'll kill an enemy while they are reloading and their gun wont even have a magazine for you to loot. So if you aren't supposed to get items from enemies, that means you would find them in the world. And you would be right for thinking that but the levels are so MASSIVE and EMPTY that exploring anything is a massive chore. I bet this game will be awesome for all the walking-sim girlies out there who just want to get high and stare at all the cool lights and buildings but brother I'm trying to dome some dudes and I gotta explore for 20-30 minutes just to find a bag of chips so I can heal for like 5 health. The game is also SUPER dark. You will be using night vis for very large portions of the game (or you'll just turn up the brightness which works too but kinda, yknow, kills the vibe). Night vis probably shouldn't use energy, or if it is then energy should recharge naturally back up to 25% so I'm not freaking out about not having enough energy if I need it later.  Enemy AI is genuinely brain dead too, at least sometimes. I've seen them prefire rounding a corner and completely delete my health, other times I will be like 5 feet away and they will face the exact opposite direction of me and shoot at the wall across the room. It 100% needs work. On the topic of shooting, guns feel pretty okay to use. There's a lot of intended jank with shooting, and while I think its fine for the most part having my arms flail around wildly while holding a pistol and crouching can be pretty distracting. Also some guns your character doesn't even hold correctly while using ADS. I think an option for just a zoom instead of ADS would go far for a game like this, especially since hipfiring is super accurate.  Finally, losing your inventory between levels is INSANE. Like, I have to run around you E.Y.E.-tier levels looking for scraps and you yoink it all away because??? I get that the game is trying to be sorta "scenario-based" but if that's the case, just give me a level select and a loadout system like Cruelty Squad. I feel like that would fit the game way better instead of punishing me for climbing your 50 flights of stairs just to find your LMG and then have it taken away.  Anyway, tl;dr: game looks crazy good but plays like booty cheeks. Hopefully the dev reworks a lot of the stuff in the game cause it ain't great right now. Anyone lookin to buy this game I would wait for a few big updates first. I think you'll have a better time then than now.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 5h 50m | Rec: Positive] enjoying the game a lot. Sewerslvt in the soundtrack is so perfect.
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 14h 59m | Rec: Positive] I played the demo years back and forgot about it. Now that it's out I'm really happy to say that it's worth checking out even in it's unpolished state. I would like to compare it to other games and media such as Deus Ex for example, but it doesn't really do it justice. The levels are MASSIVE and have multiple interconnected routes allowing you to complete missions in multiple ways. Even so, it's still very simple where you can go in guns blazing or sneak around, but you can't really talk your way out of most situations. The visuals are unique in a way and harken back to late 90s and early 2000s anime and games.  The gunplay is punchy, but the weapons feel stiff and need more polish to feel good. I really liked the S.T.A.L.K.E.R style inventory system as well as the magazine and ammo management. You'll also notice Sewerslvt on the soundtrack which is nutty to hear her stuff in a game. It really fits the setting and mood. I'm looking forward to the full release and more of what the devs are cooking up because there's tons of potential here .
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 16h 36m | Rec: Positive] I wish there was a neutral option for these reviews  So yes the game has beautiful visuals, nails down the aesthetic, I have been liking Marie and hallway weirdo as characters (all the other characters are kinda ok), the story is alrigth and I don't mind the giant obtuse levels I like them they aren't too big once you make sense of where everything is.  But the jank sadly breaks the game a lot, I had a couple of times on the second level where the game broke because EVERY NPC IN THE MAP kept instantly dying whenever I loaded my last save and this was somehow because of 3 random enemies that didn't spawned until I went back to a previous save.  But back to the point, the game is still underdeveloped. There's a lot of minor things like the the aiming sway being too slow, the ironsights and well aiming in general being janky as fuck, being unable to climb ladders the proper way (you have to spam jump to climb them), the bad AI, enemies shooting thru the walls, not enough rewarding for exploration, certain items like an augmentation not transfering over missions, sequence breaking and items dissappearing that taint what could be a great game.  Not to mention that certain side missions can feel pointless, on the prologue/tutorial level you meet an NPC who tells you that he can help you cut off the electricity in a certain area if you go and get a chip he needs so after travelling what feels like 5 km and killing a few guys then backtracking he keeps his promise but the area he cut off power to is filled with mostly friendly NPCs and there isn't too much of a difference between lighting stealth wise I felt like the enemies could see me as clear as day and forget about me when I left the room no matter how well lit up or not the area is.  So besides getting some beautiful sights and seeing a guy kill himself the sidequest felt kinda pointless, and with that said the stealth in the game is kinda janky too with what I mentioned previously as an example.  I know the game is still in early access and all but god I had wished that many of the bad things the demo had would be fixed by now. I hope the dev can keep working and polish (heh) the game well enough in the future but for now it's a solid 6/10 for me. I hope this can become another gamedev redemption story because I have been enjoying the game so far despite all the negatives and still plan to finish the missions that are currently in the game but probably wont touch it again until the next big update  p.d Hallway Weirdo a cute

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 0h 32m | Rec: Positive] People really like their comparisons, to some artists and game devs it might feel a little demeaning to their hard work, but I say this with utmost respect for this game without even clocking an hour into it. This game reminds me of Mad God (2021). That is a high HIGH honor to have. There is not a single other game that remotely comes close to that film in terms of vibe and setting. I respect the shit out of this game for its art direction alone, the rest being stuff I already like about immersive sim genre games is an added bonus. If you come out of the early access craving more stuff, give Mad God a watch (keep in mind it is a disgusting film visually), and then go replay this game and make a separate account and buy it again.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 5h 51m | Rec: Positive] Jogo bem legal, apesar dos graficos "feios", ele impressiona em quase todo restante. PERIPETEIA é um immersive sim, um que eu realmente fiquei imerso no mundinho dele.    O sistema de combate e as perks da personagem funcionam perfeitamente, por mais que algumas dessas habilidades pudessem gastar menos energia, que é um recurso extremamente limitado, isso não o torna pior.    Efeitos sonoros são o ponto mais alto desse jogo, das musicas até o som da chuva caindo... É maravilhoso, você pode parar a qualquer momento e ficar apenas escutando. Até o barulho da Rola-carpideira colocaram no jogo [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA1s5oF6fs] (nostalgia bird se for pesquisar) [/url].    Mundo do jogo é vivo, você pode interagir verbalmente com quase todos os npcs do dele, alguns tem ate mesmo suas rotinas pelo mapa (melhor que avowed).    [h3] WALKING SIMULATOR [/h3]é o que esse jogo se torna depois de certo ponto. Com objetivos vagos e extensos e variados caminhos, você vai passar a maior parte do tempo tentando se localizar nos corredores e escadarias que parecem um labirinto muito bem decorado.   Não vou falar se a historia é boa ou ruim, porque não entendi quase nada. Pelo nome que vem do grego você ja pode deduzir que o jogo tenta ser criptico com seus textos extensos cheios de interpretações.   [h2] Considerações "Finais" [/h2]   Tenha em mente que se trata de um jogo em early access, e ele foi lançado literalmente na data que essa analise foi publicada. Ele precisa de bastante polimento e melhorias, que (eu espero) virão com o tempo. Hoje dou uma nota 7/10 pro jogo, recomendo pegar em alguma promoção se tiver muito interessado, não é um game pra todo mundo, mas da pra se divertir bastante com ele.

There are a lot of big and empty spaces that take minutes to run through and having an option to move quicker and in a more fun and dynamic way would great lessening the travel time and giving you something to do instead of just holding w.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 47h 50m | Rec: Positive] I love this game, but man Slav-jank is real with this one.  On one hand there is an amazing atmosphere (especially in the spooky level) and unique guns that generaly feel really great to try out and play with. On other enemies seem stupid or even braindead. And level design is... hmm... personally I like it once I finished the level and have some basic idea what to do... but first time can get really bothersome (level 1 and 3 took me comically long time to finish - at ending I was almost laughing at how long it took for the timer to count how long it took me to finish them) Well, certainly it is an experience. I love it.  As well the tanks suck. And you cant play Poly-Play so 3/10 And stairs... stairs can go fuck themselve.
[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 6h 39m | Rec: Positive] Perpeteia is a surrealistic take on a Deus Ex style immersive sim by way of the PS1.  In a post-Soviet dystopic Poland, the future is bleak and inhabited by directionless cyborg populations housed in a crumbling moldy brutalist concrete mega-city torn between competing criminals, gangs and political ideologies. And you're a third wheel with a mind-wiped brain who woke up in a junkyard without her memories, except for the image of a bunker that you have to find. Finding this place will require you to work with unsavory characters from gangsters to bureaucrats.  Currently Peripeteia is a strong skeleton of a game that needs to be filled with organs and skin. It's incomplete and unpolished in several areas.  Quests and scenarios, while offering several means to complete them, sometimes have an issue where you can get railroaded into certain solutions.  In the first zone you work with a local junker to get a train ticket, in return he wants a light bulb from the local planetarium projector. So I traveled across town to find the planetarium is controlled by a local gang who propose a trade, access to the planetarium in exchange for planting a bomb in the local police station. Not wanting to participate in terrorism, I instead went to the police and got an appointment w/ the commander to report the crime. But when I was talking to him the crime I was reporting was the junker's intention to pilfer the light bulb! Not wanting to have the friendly junker arrested I attempted to leave the dialogue, only to find I couldn't. There was no option to back out of reporting him to the police, no option to report the attempted terror attack, nor an option to come up with an excuse to leave to avoid reporting anything at all. So I had to load a save to continue the scenario.  A second issue is the lack of continuity of equipment between levels. After completing the mission and getting on the metro I loaded into my character's apartment (which was a bit confusing) but discovered the apartment is a sort of rest stop between missions and a hub where you choose the next level. So I chose level 2 and found all my weapons, equipment and augments were gone; exploring and digging around for hidden items was pointless. It really disincentivises from engaging w/ the world. Like if STALKER took away your inventory when you go through a loading screen. If it's intentional, it would be understandable that weapons wouldn't be allowed on the public metro, that makes sense, but your augmentations and things like a flashlight or tape player shouldn't disappear. And if it IS intentional, the game doesn't tell you that all your stuff would vanish.  Augmentations aren't equipped into your character, rather they continue to take up space in your inventory and are used like any item, but with a dedicated F# hotkey. Like if JC Denton in Deus Ex had to carry around all his abilities, still in their nanobot canisters, in his inventory to use them. A bit silly.  The level design is unintuitive and hard to consistently navigate, and sometimes the path to your objective is hidden in literal darkness. Locations, paths to new areas, and what I assume are intended means to access different places are often poorly lit and confusing. One moment you might fall down an air vent into the sewers only to climb out a mile away into the local mall. This isn't that big a deal for me since I like wandering around and exploring every little side area in games like this, but I can certainly see it frustrating other players.  Now I feel bad that the previous paragraphs are negative, so let me tell you about the game's positives. The art and atmosphere are top notch and the choice to use cartoonish styleization for the characters will likely let the game age well. It contains an impressive and fairly intuitive climbing system that allows you to shuffle, climb and leap along edges, coupled with your enhanced cyborg strength, lets you clamber into all sorts of nooks and crannies. The stealth is intuitive and easy to utilize, aping Thief The Dark Project, darkness and noise are considerations when you sneak around (though the materials your walk across don't play as much into it as it does in Thief). The writing and examination text when you inspect items is charming and informative (finding out your character literally eats batteries was amusing), and the UI (with adorable art from @hirotonfa, surprising to see that from an artist I'd followed for a few years) and inventory system is really cool, physically rolling into place from the side of the screen when you manage your equipment or look at your character sheet. And the soundtrack, used sparingly in game, has some techno bangers.  Peripetia is a gritty, dark and atmospheric cyberpunk adventure, likely a cult classic in the making. But certainly needs some work in a few departments.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 9h 17m | Rec: Positive] Peri is... what is Peri? You could say it's an immersive sim inspired by the classics of the genre, and you wouldn't be wrong. If that's what you're looking for, Peri will deliver. But there's more to it. Peri has a soul—the kind only small indie games, personal projects, truly have. It has an uncompromising vision it's determined to realize, no matter how difficult or unconventional. It knows what it is, and it's not afraid to show it.  It's hard to describe Peri, but for me, it's like wandering through endless halls and corridors in a dreamlike haze, exploring the unknown... fucking around and finding out (lol). It's about introspection, faith, choice, and consequence.  It's kinda like... Yume Nikki with guns, cigarettes, and vodka.  Ah... the jank. Smell it, feel it, accept it. I'm sure the game will be less buggy on release, but a lot of the weirdness seems intentional. So... you have to embrace it, at least a little.  It might take some time to get used to the gameplay... but give it a chance, and it'll click with you. Maybe.  Do it for Marie.

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 1h 55m | Rec: Negative] Twór z niezwykłym potencjałem w kompletnie zdewastowanej, nieułożonej i niedorobionej formie. Peripeteia nie powinna w obecnym stanie wyjść nawet jako early access, na nowego ciekawego immersive sima jeszcze chwile poczekamy...  Największym problemem gry zdecydowanie jest ilość błędów. Dosłownie każdy element, który może się zepsuć prędzej czy później trafia szlag i niestety wcale nie przesadzam. Od jakichś dupereli graficznych aż po sytuacje, które zmuszają do wczytywania zapisów, wszystko tu jest - przedmioty czasem działają a czasem nie, wrogowie walą przez ściany, łatwo się zablokować na pierwszej lepszej przeszkodzie, dialogi po prostu się urywają, a wczytywanie zapisu to jedna wielka ruletka gdzie może zniknąć ci pół ekwipunku, przedmioty z mapy czy nawet postacie... Mógłbym wymieniać jeszcze naprawdę długo, nie mam pojęcia co wydarzyło się przy produkcji, ale nawet demo, które wyszło już chwile temu nie było tak zmasakrowane.  Rozmiar map spełnia swoją funkcje wizualnie, lokacje wyglądają naprawdę świetnie i wszystko aż ocieka klimatem i naprawdę ma swój własny styl, ale niestety gameplayowo wychodzi to bardzo słabo. Wszędzie gigantyczne, puste i jednakowe miejscówki ułożone bez jakiegoś większego zamysłu, często losowo i zwyczajnie nielogicznie. Wielokrotnie dochodziło do sytuacji, gdzie widząc coś w oddali maszerowałem tam pare dobrych minut żeby dowiedzieć się, że tak naprawdę absolutnie niczego tu nie ma i mogę maszerować następne parenaście licząc, że za rogiem coś może jednak znajdę - w najlepszym wypadku był to pojedynczy i bezwartościowy magazynek, ale niestety prawie zawsze kończyło to się w ślepej uliczce bez nawet jakiegoś easter egga... Takie podróże zadziałają raz, może dwa, gdy gracz czuje, że jest tylko mrówką w gigantycznym świecie, ale na dłuższą mete zwyczajnie zniechęca to do eksploracji i próbowania innych ścieżek, każde rozwidlenie to pytanie "czy powinienem ryzykować stratą czasu?". Nawet główne punkty, o które gracz powinien zahaczyć są zwyczajnie puste i nie oferują nic poza aspektem wizualnym - gigantyczne hale z jednym interaktywnym elementem, tyle. Bardzo dziwnie mieszają się też szczegółowe elementy otoczenia ze zwykłymi bryłami z nałożoną teksturą, niektóre rzeczy są zrobione starannie, inne wyglądają, jak z kompletnie innej gry.  Trzony rozgrywki wypadają tak sobie, wiele funkcji po prostu istnieje i nic więcej o nich powiedzieć nie można, dużo tutaj raczej takich niepotrzebnych elementów, jak to nieprzyjemne zarządzanie ekwipunkiem. Strzelanie jest całkiem ok, ale błędy i AI przeciwników, które ledwo istnieje, bo aktualnie wszyscy po prostu biegną w stronę gracza nawalając na oślep, nierzadko nawet w podłogę i raczej nie stanowią wyzwania o ile nie są zbyt blisko wszystko psują. Walka jest niesamowicie nieciekawa i mało dynamiczna, bo lepiej trzymać dystans. Eksploracja nie ma zbytnio sensu, Implantów w sumie niekoniecznie opłaca się używać tak samo, jak skradania, które zresztą działa, jak chce...  Fajnie sobie chwile pospacerować po lokacjach, ale jako gra jest to po prostu bardzo męczące doświadczenie i jestem zawiedziony, bo każdą informację o grze, każdą wzmiankę i demo dogłębnie badałem i śledziłem...

[Date: 2025-02-22 | Playtime: 3h 18m | Rec: Negative] THIS REVIEW WILL SERVE AS A LIVING DOCUMENT:  Aesthetic Grift - brought to its logical conclusion.  This game is made to pull in suckers with a shallow aesthetic sensibility stolen from other industrial runoff media. Lain fans, I'm talking about you.  There is no substance aside from this. The developers clearly put zero effort into gameplay. They were too busy self congratulating their horribly written fanfic about Poland. Roleplaying as people who have an ounce of legitimate input, culturally or politically. Instead its just regurgitated garbage from their favorite animes. Teenagers have more developed artistic voice.  Do not buy this "game" if you want something actually worth your time, as youll be sorely disappointed. It offers very little gameplay wise. Flimsy combat/gamefeel, poorly put together interface, nonsense story/missions. It masquerades as a game that would have more complicated mechanics, or any amount of depth, but it just isnt there. Run down another empty hallway, fight broken AI, jump around levels laid out by the scribbles of a toddler. Youve seen everything the game has to offer in the first 15 minutes. And this is without mentioning the horrific bugs and jank. This shouldnt even qualify as an alpha.  I honestly dont even know what else to write about this sludge, I am floored by what passes as a game these days. If the developers are truly as simple minded as to think that mashing together the 5 basic mainstream pieces of media they consume ad infinitum constitutes a complete idea, I dont know if i can help them with any amount of feedback.  There is no amount of twitter fanart and "shes just like me fr"posting that can make this game legitimate in its execution.  Selling other people's artistic vision is detrimental to all art, not just this product.  Your Sewerslvt Deviantart OC belongs in the same place as the game itself, in the wastebin.

This game will make you work for things, don't expect to be given a map, guide or waypoints, you are responsible for getting yourself through this game.  The story is interesting, if somewhat hard to follow at times. The setting captures the dreary tone of a dystopian Poland extremely well and I'm looking forward to revisiting it throughout the game's development.  Go in with patience and an open mind, and I'm sure you'll have as much fun as I've had.

[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 1h 54m | Rec: Negative] The potential is there, but the current state is jank as hell. I managed to disappear some items by just dragging them over to the inspect screen Climbing ladders just doesn't work, it's treated as any other parkour ledge in the world and you have to spam space over every space, which is just the least intuitive way to climb a ladder in at least the last 20 years if not more. Dragging things is just so damn finnicky and infuriating, especially when one of the early missions (or at least one way of doing it?) has you drag someone across quite the long distance. You end up dropping whatever you're holding randomly at the slightest inconvenience. Also, and this one is not quite a negative as much as a warning: the maps are HUGE. And I mean, HUUUUUGE. Unless this has changed from the demo, you can go the completely wrong way and keep going for 2 hours and still keep finding new areas that seem like they should be important, but aren''t, at least in the early game. So better pay attention to the directions you're given, or risk getting lost for 10 hours with no objective in sight.

[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 10h 15m | Rec: Positive] It's.. Interesting. I like the gameplay loop for the most part, but there is a lot of jank. Do mind that the game just came out. Carried physics objects (robot wife) will collide with you if you move too fast or jump (This is really annoying). The mouse in the inventory assumes that you clicked at the center even if you didn't, so positioning items is annoying at times. The enemies are not very smart (I really do not mind this much). You cannot carry over items between levels (currently, this is apparently planned for later in a limited capacity) The ladders are actually several ledges that you jump up and down.  The story is intriguing, I would like to see more of it.  The setting is very unusual and rare, and especially curious if you are eastern european yourself (BELARUS MENTIONED). The guns feel good to shoot. Reloading guns with magazines is a little annoying, but I suppose that's how it is in real life as well, unless you carry several on you. The levels are huge and you have to look for things yourself, you really do feel as lost as the protagonist. You need to explore and pay attention. That said, I was able to find the things I needed just fine in the end. The character designs are great, at least the unique ones are. A lot of the characters are very similarly looking since almost everyone wears gas masks. The dialogue text is all great, but the dialogue box is a little too small I feel like. It only really fits about 4 lines of text or so and the default is to automatically scroll the text when it overflows. It prints way too fast and I could not find a setting to adjust the speed, but there *is* a setting to just disable printing text like that, so I had to do that. The FPS is not great at times, but it did not drop enough to make the game unplayable for me. In closed spaces it's a little better, and that's where most shootouts happen either way. This will probably get ironed out during early access. Early access banner currently says there are 5 levels, and just the first one took me about 3 hours. If all of them are as big, that would amount to a pretty good amount of playtime.  I liked it, but it really does need more polish (ha, get it?).

Some players are going to love this game for its atmosphere, tactical encounters, and extreme player freedom. Others are going to absolutely loathe its disjointed storytelling and lack of meta progression.    As it stands, there’s at least 20 hours of solid entertainment in this post-Soviet playground. Ifyou love the strange intersection of ambitious jank with sweaty tacti-cool combat as much as I do, you’ll probably take a run through these crumbling cities once again when the game hits 1.0. It's easy to see this game turning into a cult hit, if the early access period manages to sand down some of its jagged edges into finer points.  https://youtu.be/l8xfOk98UUg

[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 15h 56m | Rec: Negative] cool art direction, but the game itself is janky as fuck. also a lot of empty space in the maps, but little of actual content inside them. also plot is barebones and has no substance. also, unlike deus ex and thief the journal is quite useless and doesnt help in directing player towards a goal improved a bit from demo release but still a long way to go   forgot to mention in the first draft on rewiev, but unlike in deux ex, thief or ss2 melee combat feels way to slow and useless
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 7h 4m | Rec: Negative] 在我第一眼看见这个游戏的时候，他让我想起了blame这部漫画，漫画中独特且巨大的构造体，对应的，则是游戏当中的庞大且“空洞”的苏式美学建筑  时至今日，游戏终于迎来了发售，但不得不说这么长的时间仍然是测试性的首发，并且八十多的售价对于一款独立游戏来说，在独立游戏里面，这属于价格略高那一档了  首次进入游戏，我就被这优秀的美术风格和环境渲染吸引了，但在接下来四个小时的游玩之后，我深刻的意识到，这款游戏并没有这么的神乎其威，X上繁多且优秀的同人创作给这部作品套上了一层滤镜，实际上这款游戏漏洞百出，bug层出不穷，游戏不仅没有中文，且文本量繁多，没有良好的英文基础游玩起来是极其费劲的，但对于处在EA阶段的游戏来说，语言不全尚可理解  接下来，我将阐述我四个小时游玩所经历的灾难，游戏的任务指引模糊不清，以及没有地图系统，给探索带来了很大的挑战，得益于没有地图且游戏昏暗的渲染氛围，有时候真不知道哪个地方才会有路，走哪条路才是正确的  接下来就是游戏的存档系统，游戏当中没有自动存档系统，倘若死亡只能读取上一次存档的位置，游戏当中每个破译密码的环节有且只有两次，一旦失败，从今往后破译失败的密码锁将伴随着你的存档直至游戏结束，但玩家可以在每次破译之前先存个档，这样就又拥有了无限试错的机会，真是自相矛盾，游戏死档的概率也极其之高，很多地方当我以外可以探索的时候，实际上都只是死路一条，没有说犄角旮旯处会给我带来惊喜这种说法，这也印证了开头我所说的“空洞”一词  敌人的ai堪忧，当他们发现你的时候只会朝你冲过来并疯狂射击，当他们清空弹夹以后，他们就会在你跟前，当着你的面换弹，对于这样一群没有战术不会寻找掩体的敌人来说，弱智一词是最好的形容  游戏当中甚至有一台没有呼叫按钮的小电梯，能理解这是什么意思吗，这就像是电梯从未被人类发明过一样，不知道作者把它放在那的意义是什么，不如给我造一条高达二十层的步行楼梯然后在顶层的小柜子塞一把隐藏武器算了  有一次我费劲到达了一个正常玩家都不可能会去地方，那儿有个不起眼的小柜子，里面的的确确有着一把价值很高的武器，当时我的背包已经满了，所以我想先整理一下背包，于是想随手把刚捡到的武器先丢一边，结构它仿佛是穿透了墙壁一般，直接消失在了游戏中  游戏中还有许多繁杂的问题我没有罗列出来，为什么只说缺点不说优点，第一，目前这款游戏的优点屈指可数，其次，历经这么久的开发依旧是bug不断，我希望能给想购入这款游戏的人一个警示，如果这款游戏的问题在日后得到了解决，我会重新审视它的
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 7h 33m | Rec: Negative] Peripeteia is an incredibly confusing, buggy, incomprehensible mess. /ak/ types may flock to it after seeing art on twitter but will find the game itself sorely lacking. Terrible map design and horribly written diologue/mission objectives will only serve to confuse you as you navigate labyrinthian maps of absolutely fucking insane scale. Don’t take my word for it, have fun traversing the 90 story apartment building in the first level. Or try finding the blackmail in Level 2 which requires you to climb out of the map and locate a PDA on a random building ledge. Bugs galore with audio cutting out, music triggers not working properly, aggro’d enemies persisting through load after dying, Marie’s head popping off in 3rd person, softlocking in dialogue prompts and having to restart the game, etc.   Also not sure why there’s so much emphasis on inventory and weapon customization when you can’t take anything between levels. Nothing carries over, you start each mission with the sword and that’s it. Also for some reason the basement of your apartment contains every weapon in the game in-case you wanted to spoil the most interesting part of Peripeteia after the first mission. Btw the M16A2 is clearly an M16A1 please fix.  I understand the hype esp given how much art exists of the game online, but at the end of the day this is just really buggy DeviantArt Deus Ex. Sadly that isn’t worth the 25 dollar price tag lol.

[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 1h 7m | Rec: Positive] Played the first mission.  My only complaints are: * There's no quick save, quick load feature * Can't loot ammo out of guns without putting them in inventory * The game is too short! (of course, it's early access but I see the vision with this game) Very nice immersive sim elements in this game. Every NPC is killable, and lots of intractable objects/clutter around. Many ways to tackle missions, whether it be stealth or loud.  I'll say recommend for now, however there isn't much content yet it seems. The sandbox itself should be very fun though.

[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 32h 57m | Rec: Positive] 10/10, this is one of the most atmospheric and immersive games I've ever played. It has a really unique way of making the world feel organic and like nothing is out of bounds. The writing is often really beautiful. The level design rewards exploration, I often felt like trying things not only to follow quest objectives but just to see what else I could find. It feels like playing games as a kid used to feel, where you just want to explore for hours and everything feels new and interesting. Often even open world games can lock you into a very linear experience but this game is the opposite of that.   Also it made me want to spend a lot of time doing inventory management, it's really fun for some reason.
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 0h 54m | Rec: Negative] Из плюсов: - Неплохая концепция. - Механики крутые. Из минусов: - Оптимизации нет. - Лагает как попочка. - Механики, которые должны работать, работают не так, как нужно (при использовании захвата разума твой персонаж передвигается вместе с контроллируемым противником, да и прицеливаться не возможно за захваченного противника; дополнительно способность с дроном тоже странная, так как сказано, что ты сможешь стрелять с этого дрона на боевых миссиях, а по факту - нет, стреляет твой персонаж, но никак не дрон, тогда какой смысл?). - Нет фонарика, когда вся игра супер тёмная. Нет, конечно есть ночное зрение, но оно тратит энергию, которую тебе в начале игры не объясняют, как восполнить.  На данном этапе супер-сыро. Думал, что игра будет чем-то вроде Cruelty Squad в мире киберпанка, но игра смотрится как ни рыба, ни мясо. Смесь сралкера и Cruelty Squad.

There's a lot of exploration and multiple endings for each level so it has a ton of replayability especially for the later levels. It has its quirks once in a while but I feel like it actually adds quite a lot to the game itself.  Save your ammo if you get to Belgrade!

[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 29h 15m | Rec: Positive] [h1]Eastern European Ghost in The Shell[/h1]  Peripeteia is a fantastic imsim, the atmosphere is so thicc, it's gonna grab you right away, it's the result of the perfect combination between art direction, lighting, sound design.  The world is unlike anything you've seen yet, its a near future scenario set in Poland, with distinct factions, having their own ideologies, like anarchists, "fascists", gangsters, cultists etc. You play as a cute cyborg and can set yourself loose on these fellas, pretty cool ways to kill em all if you want. You can also sneak, or negotiate/bribe in order to complete your objectives.  You get augs, just like in Deus Ex, added speed and jump height, nightvision, thermoptic  camo, silent running, but also original ones such as pupeteer, an aug that lets you control enemies, or a drone you can use to check areas, akimbo, slo-mo.  The shooting is awesome, the guns feel punchy, there's lean mechanics, you also get non lethal stuff, such as a stun prod, gas grenades, non lethal mosin, and a nice cavalry saber, you definitely have freedom of choice here. I just wish ammo and enemies were more plentiful so I could shoot more.  There is a very large amount of guns, very nicely modeled, some are soviet, some Western, some are modern, and the inventory management is innovative, you have loose ammo, that you have to load into clips, and have em ready if you wanna reload, there are some exceptions, such as the Mosin, other than that it's tetris.  The traversal is the most fun part imo tho, if you activate the enhanced mobility aug, you can parkour around the levels, and land some uber nice shots on enemies from the top of a roof, you can play it like 500 Caliber Contractz.  For now its janky, but super enjoyable and fun, the jank is just because of the slav branding.  [h1]This is truly peak gaming[/h1]
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 18h 5m | Rec: Positive] hidden gem right here Peripeteia has many great ideas from a few genres all coming together into a unique experience. This game has given me some good playtime (on demo and other downloaded versions). It's still in it's early stages, but certainly ironed out enough for a great playable experience.  two things that stood out to me are;  the level design is not linear, exploring is very rewarding  the pacing between chill, atmospheric exploring and crazy ass gunfights is very enjoyable.  try out the demo!
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 12h 54m | Rec: Positive] Been supporting this game for awhile and I can tell you, even with beta access to the game, this game has been shaping up to be something amazing. Also, it continues to get better. If you want a game that doesn't hold your hand with massive sprawling maps with tons of horror elements and weirdness mixed into one grand FPS, then look no further, than Peripeteia.
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 2h 20m | Rec: Positive] Peri is finally here and it's glorious! The game is one of the imsimmiest imsims to ever imsim. It is absolutely stellar with a bit of a learning curve and outside the box thinking required, just what you'd expect from the genre. The levels are massive, with a ton to explore. The game is heavily atmospheric, with giant monolithic structures and large empty spaces used to sell just how small you are in this world. It's a bit jank at the moment, but it's to be expected with the sheer scale, and it's often part of the charm.
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 25h 5m | Rec: Positive] It certainly is a game.
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 3h 18m | Rec: Positive] Game isn't easy, you have to find solutions yourself. Sometimes you can get lost. For example I spent 10 minutes walking on infinite bridge with no result. But it is an unique experience and worth to try!
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 33h 59m | Rec: Positive] My copy was provided by the devs*  I cannot deny that Peripeteia was extremely junky and full of bugs, and yet, I enjoyed most of the game specifically because of the immersive and intoxicating level design, it has many genuinely cool moments of navigational escapism, I thought the zones like Refinery looked amazing, and I can't help but feel mesmerized by the scope. I guess more of a 'guilty pleasure' for me, sometimes you get awesome locations with good narrative context in the environment, allowing you to get lost in the world, and sometimes you just run around with nothing to do. There are 5 different levels that usually have more than a few ways to complete or navigate them, you should be able to experience most of the main content in 10 to 15 hours, more if you explore every little possibility.  The game also has a lot of misleading 'feedback' on quest triggers, and while getting lost is intentional, there are other technical things and their implementation that make it more confusing on top of it. For example, when you give items to quest characters, they will often ask for them again, even though the quest was completed. On top of it, many relevant quest milestones are not marked in the journal, so sometimes you might do something on the map, and you will have no idea if you accomplished anything. Even some of the wording in the journal can be a little confusing for no reason. Like these are not really "no hand holding" choices as people are claiming, there are already examples of intuitive quests in this game, and it's more of a half-baked implementation.   I assume Deus Ex was the main source of inspiration, but I am also getting some Half-Life and Fallout vibes as well (mainly because of some level design philosophy), kinda going for that navigation based immersion if you know what I mean. The level design for me is the most curious part of the game, it almost feels like every time you turn a corner there is a mysterious and vast environment, making you feel like you are alone in this dystopian and decaying world. On that subject, even though I think the exploration is the best part of the game, that exploration is not always rewarded as much as it should be, and I would like to see more ammo/health hidden around the game, as well as more characters or side quests for world-building.  I don't mind the gameplay feel overall, although there are very few types of enemies, and to be honest the enemy AI is not all that great, they get stuck on nearly every corner, or get combo aggroed from a huge distance. There are also enemies in this game I like to call "speed hackers", not entirely sure what the devs were thinking, it just looks silly, breaks immersion for me. There are a ton of guns, as well as some interesting modifiers for the character, granted you rarely get to fully utilize them in action. Funny thing that often happens to me is that I have 9 guns, but only like 5 ammo in each. So what do I do with the dual gun mode, go blazing for 3 seconds?  [h1] Pros: [/h1]  (+) The level design was generally very compelling in both navigation and its communism themes, the game has a strong sense of escapism as you get around a giant megalopolis that feels abandoned and foreboding. Not every locations has good substance, but when it does, I loved it, especially the art district and the halls of the 'refinery'. I could nitpick many pacing issues in the game, but generally speaking, the level design is 80% of why this game is fun, with its many secrets and shortcuts.   (+) The maps usually allow you to complete them in different ways, as well as do some optional objectives, in some cases more than 2 ways to navigate them. You can complete the base content in maybe 9-10 hours, but you probably will only explore 60%.  (+) Occasionally there are some great world-building and immersion moments, they are relatively rare, but when they happen it's great. I think my 2 favorite moments were the library in the art district and the nervous system part of the Refinery.   (+) Now the game has a lot of ideas and tools to experiment in combat, it's just that, enemies are junk in this game, so you only get so many situations where any of that matters in a practical application. To be honest I found it easier to kill enemies with a melee around corners instead of using my 5 ammo guns and opening inventory every 10 seconds.  [h1] Feedback: [/h1]  [u]Exploration[/u] - there are so many places in the game that will catch the attention of the player, they will try to explore every part of the level, but most of the time you don't even bother hiding some ammo or consumables. Like, if the place looks interesting to climb, make sure you hide something there, you only do it like 10% of the time when I explore, maybe some basic items, some ammo, or even more characters for lore. The first level specifically I think could use a little more content in the lower parts, I think if you choose the moving platform path the game feels more uneventful than the balcony.  [u]Agro range[/u]- sometimes you will kill an enemy, and for the next 10 minutes an enemy from like 5 different floors will come down on you. Which I would not mind in a faction location, but if it's just some random building, it feels weird that you can basically agro entire zone sometimes.   [u]Journal Milestones & Quests[/u] - when you deliver items to characters, they often ask for them again, but ideally they should confirm the delivery in the dialogue. It would help if you marked any objective related buttons/switches in the log, as well as completed quests. Sometimes I would interact with something and like, What did that do though?   [u]Just random thoughts:[/u]  - increase the models for ammo and consumables if you can, they are too tiny. Also regular enemies almost never drop anything other than a gun, maybe they should have a random chance to also drop some random consumable or currency   - maybe a button to only take ammunition out of guns on the ground in addition to pick up (if it has the option I did not see it)  - the boat ride is buggy AF, also I am really confused why refinery landing is so far away from where you want to be  - the game overrides my GPU's custom settings for FPS, I used the v-sync in the game which helped during gameplay, but it seems it runs uncapped when I alt-tab (making the GPU accelerate)  - those commando enemies and speedy weirdo dudes feel very clunky to fight, to a point where it's actually breaking the immersion for me, it's almost like I am trying to fight teleporting glitches, I mean I like the challenge, but maybe make them a bit more realistic   - the Belgrade level or whatever it's called, I think you overcooked those 'terminator' enemies. It's a cool level visually and in terms of horror atmosphere, but I think you made it a little too trial and error, especially with limited saves.   [b] Overall Thoughts on EA: [/b]  Even though Peripeteia might be the most inconsistent game I ever played, there is a good game underneath its many cracks, and perhaps with too many ideas pulling it apart in every direction. The level design specifically was unlike anything else out there, vast and full of mystery, even when it does not always deliver in substance, it always provokes curiosity. Even getting this far is arguably an achievement for the devs, but at the same time, I can't help but feel that it could have been handled much better in both polish and general pacing of the experience. I am skeptical that this game will ever be truly finished because it's a bit of a junkyard of bugs and half-baked mechanics, with that said, some games are fun regardless, and I think it's one of those.

[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 3h 36m | Rec: Positive] Extremely atmospheric, super crunchy imsim that deserves your hard earned money. Also made by some truly wholesome people :)
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 8h 29m | Rec: Positive] Just want to preface this with saying I played the Steam release version early via a code sent by a dev. And as of right now, the game only has 5 levels and is not currently complete.  I've been waiting for this game for quite some time about 5 years or so? So much of it's aesthetics just gel with my vibe and cyborgs/robots with full cybernetic bodies but a human face is like peak character design for me.  Anyway about the game, it's an immersive sim more focused on exploration, and I REALLY mean exploration each of the levels are massive with so many paths some obvious, some not so much, hell you can just make your own path you can jump, climb or jank your way across most of the levels, it's really quite rewarding. And there is usually only a vague gesture at what you are supposed to do each level which I love. The combat is visceral and usually fast paced, guns are loud and dangerous and head shots instantly kill most enemies. it seems the first person camera is reliant on your character's model in the actual game world, think Thief: Deadly Shadows, but unlike that game it's less wonky (most of the time). There is a variety of augments you can find or buy all of them seem to do something unique and interesting.  The level design is... mesmerizing, almost hypnotic. Like I said, each level is colossal in size, and almost entirely devoid of life in comparison to it's size, now that sounds bad, but allow me to elaborate. From what I can tell so far, people talk about the city like it just... appeared out of thin air, and just like it's abstract origin, the structure of the city is just as strange, it's actively hostile to normal humans which is deeply interesting and cool.  There's quite alot of jank to this game obviously, it's not anything I'm not used to and I find the jank quite charming in this game, however there's quite a few bugs that will have you reverting a few saves back, so yeah save often.  The one problem that I can definitely see people having problems with other than the jank or bugs is well basically the writing. What do I mean by that? Well the game takes place in a hellish shithole of a city so the people act accordingly, there's a few r-word drops, there's several computers that take you to what is basically 4-chan and all that entails and some of the characters you talk to say some weirdo sleezy shit, again I don't really have a problem with it I think it's quite thematic. But there you are. On the other end of the spectrum I quite like how Marie is depicted she comes off as autism-coded in a way good way, also your neighbor is a fujo.  Unfortunately the enemies are dumb as shit, most of them just full sprint at you wildly spraying their gun at you. And the stealth is... bad. It seems that dark zones where you are less visible are completely random, a dark corner in a building is apparently fully illuminated, and you are completely invisible standing in the middle of wide open room, really doesn't make sense.  The soundtrack is great! it's mostly a mix of several different artists with a few original compositions thrown in. (Sunday Summer is such an awesome song).  Anyway yeah I like :)

[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 32h 4m | Rec: Positive] Incredibly peculiar, non-linear, janky with literally, and I mean literally zero hand holding beyond some notes and some dude in a gas mask telling you a vague direction, but brimming with style and atmosphere to the point where it engrosses you before you even think about playing it. No other game made me feel things like this one does and I love it. No other game (or media in general) has shaped my music taste and art quite like this one either.   Check out the demo if you are on the fence, because it is a polarizing game by design, but if it looks interesting to you, you will probably love it like I do.
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 10h 15m | Rec: Positive] A great homage to the Ion Storm and Looking Glass Studios immersive sims of old, but with a fresh coat of paint and some interesting spins on the formula. This game will filter a lot of people, and that's a good thing - it tells you right from the get-go what it's about and you can figure out pretty quickly whether this game is for you or not.

[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 2h 22m | Rec: Positive] Video review here: https://youtu.be/a6jQsb0q0X4  This one has got most of what you want in an immersive sim: box stacking, environments being to be explored as they loop back on each other or give you different levels of elevation to sneak around guys or attack them full on, tons of cybernetic enhancements like invisibility or a drone,  rainy cyberpunk atmosphere in a postcommunist dystopia with a synthy soundtrack, etc. It's all going to hit for those who love Deus Ex and Thief and the like. The only barrier may be how open ended the objectives feel to the point of leaving you logically stranded and how the combat could be tighter. I got stuck pretty early on and was fairly shocked when a dev revealed to me how an objective was to be completed so mileage with this one will vary greatly. Overall, though something far more than the sum of its parts and if you can crack it, there's something special here.

[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 8h 19m | Rec: Positive]  "Перепетия - это тот случай, когда игру делают люди, которым нравится свое дело. Игра - искусство, особенная во всех планах. Она - путешествие в тщательно созданный мир, предлагающий взгляд на будущее, которое одновременно чуждо и знакомо. Это свидетельство творчества и страсти его разработчиков, приглашающее игроков погрузиться в его богатую, сложную вселенную. "  Однозначно стоит покупать, ибо такие игры на инди рынке очень редко появляются на свет и еще реже выходят в релиз. Поздравляю разработчиков с ранним доступом и в последствии с релизом.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UE7C9o4uE0
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 24h 27m | Rec: Positive] I've supported this game for the past 3 years on patreon and have been in the community for it since the start of me supporting it, I played the early builds and now getting to play the game release on steam has been a true joy.  The game as a whole feels like a fever dream at times and I wouldn't ask for anything else.  Thank you Shod, Snake, and the rest of the team at Ninth Exodus and the plethora of contributors for getting this game out here to the world, it's a breath of fresh air. <3

[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 4h 36m | Rec: Positive] Countless demo hours not shown.  Imsim is back baby  Peri is a phenomenal love letter to imsims that transports me back to playing Deus Ex, E.Y.E. and Dark Messiah for the first time. Filled to the brim with the eurojank that I love, Wonky Tetris piece inventories and so much soul you'll be yelling "We're so back" while you carry your robot wife in your hand and spam the spacebar up an abnormally long ladder while Marie screams "hup hup hup hup hup" just for you to fall off the ladder or drop your robowaifu and do it again.  10/10
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 19h 14m | Rec: Positive] My fav. game! I Love it!  But a few things about the early access: The game is still buggy (far from 2 years ago but still very buggy.  The jank is part of the game. What I mean is stuff like npc's breaking or scripts freezing).   You will have to save often and reload maps completely from time to time. The levels are absurdly big an full of ways to do things, so many I'm sure you can not see them all on 3 Playthroughs.   The game ends after 5 missions (currently) and more will come later in early access. The levels are unbelievably large and how much work must go into them I can not even imagen. Also:  Sometimes there are game breaking bugs that force a full restart of the game from the beginning because it is inside the save files.  This game can be the dream game for some and others wont get the appeal. I love it A LOT and will replay the early access many time and new level as soon as they come out, but i also recommend trying the demo to see if this game is something for you
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 2h 30m | Rec: Positive] Finally. Poland.
[Date: 2025-02-21 | Playtime: 13h 42m | Rec: Positive] [i] It takes the gameplay of Deus Ex, the sprawling level design of Eye: Divine Cybermancy, a Fallout style UI, and the haunting atmosphere of Stalker, then stuffs it all into a PS1-era rendered pierogi. If you’re expecting a game shaped by modern design tropes, think again, this is pure, unfiltered vintage PC gaming, complete with all the glorious Slav-jank you'd hope for in an immersive sim. It’s the best thing to come out of Poland since babcia’s homemade pierogi.  Peripeteia feels like what every American movie producer thinks Eastern Europe looks like – Raw and gritty. [/i]  [h1]📝 Main Pros, Cons, and Suggestions, followed by the Review:[/h1]  🟩 Pros:   + Unique and practical climbing mechanics + A vast arsenal of distinct, customisable weapons + Classic inventory Tetris – Flip, rotate, and perfectly fit your gear + Well-executed directional lighting that enhances immersion + Atmospheric soundtrack that perfectly complements the game’s tone + Serviceable stealth mechanics, emphasising light and sound dynamics + Expansive, explorable locations that create an impressive sense of scale + Multiple perspectives – First person, third person, and zoomed view options + Variety of enhancements, including strength, speed, bullet time, night vision, and stealth + Unique (though arguably tedious?) mechanic of manually emptying and reloading ammo clips + Nostalgic early 2000s aesthetic, reminiscent of Deus Ex, but with modern lighting and reflections + Flawless Soviet-era atmosphere – From architecture and character designs to colour palettes, language, propaganda, and hidden Easter eggs  🟥 Cons:   - Occasional softlocks, forcing a reload from an earlier save - Oversized levels with long, empty hallways that lead to nothing - Quest dialogue, at times, offers little direction, making objectives unclear - Buggy loading sometimes spawns enemies where there were none before - "File Saved / Loaded" text permanently stuck in the top-left corner, requiring a reload to remove - Some areas are too dark – Yes, there’s night vision, but the complete pitch-black sections feel unnecessary  🏷️ Suggestions:   ~ Display date / time on save files for better tracking ~ Implement an auto-save feature to prevent progress loss ~ Improve optimisation to reduce stuttering, especially on high-end systems ~ Allow ammo clips to be removed from weapons without needing to add them to your inventory ~ Add subtle environmental details to guide players toward objectives (without relying on yellow paint or obvious signposts)  [h1] Straight Outta a Soviet Fever Dream [/h1]  You play as Marie – Basically, anime babica, who’s on a mission in a post-Soviet world – A borscht made with Czech, Hungarian, Polish, and Soviet influences if you will. The opening hands you a quest and some simple instructions, but in true immersive sim fashion, you’re free to tackle it however you like. Go in guns blazing, sneak through the shadows, or discover hidden paths – The choice is entirely yours.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3436139092  This is why I loved Peripeteia. Modern games have conditioned us to follow, not to think. They bombard us with dialogue, markers, and waypoints, ensuring we always know exactly what to do and where to go. The result? Predictable experiences, stripped of creativity, exploration, and that raw sense of freedom and wonder older games once thrived on.  I crave unpredictability and vagueness – I don’t want a checklist – I want to get lost. I want to piece things together on my own, not be spoon-fed solutions. Exploration, trial and error, the thrill of discovery, that’s what Peripeteia delivers. It’s an off-the-rails experience, a throwback to the untamed game design of the 90s.  [h1] Heavily inspired by Deus Ex, Among Others [/h1]  Like Deus Ex, Peripeteia offers unparalleled freedom in both exploration and quest design. Combat, stealth, and other mechanics are just as serviceable as they were in Deus Ex, giving you plenty of options for how to approach each situation. However, the level design leans more toward E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy – Massive, sprawling, and borderline labyrinthine. It’s something I both loved and hated in equal measure.  On one hand, the levels feel too large and directionless – I often found myself wondering if I was making progress or just wandering aimlessly. But on the other hand, they’re designed in a way that makes exploration genuinely enjoyable. If I can see it, I can go there, and that sense of freedom is exhilarating. It’s a level of scale and openness that modern games rarely embrace, and I’m absolutely here for it.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3436139669  The UI’s colour scheme instantly brings Fallout to mind – Bold, distinct, and easy to read at a glance. Everything you need is neatly displayed – A stealth indicator (factoring in sight and sound), health and battery (energy) bars, an inventory hotbar, your equipped item, and a compass. The menus, from equippable skills to navigation, reinforce that same classic Fallout-esque feel, making everything both functional and nostalgic.  Finally, the atmosphere is where Peripeteia truly shines. With sprawling apartment complexes, hazy horizons, long, desolate corridors, and dark, rainy environments, the game creates a distinct, dehumanising, and oppressive world that feels deeply real and believable. The NPCs, scattered throughout with no clear indication of whether they’re friend or foe, add to the tension and mystery. The atmosphere is best compared to Stalker, capturing that eerie, uncertain vibe.  [h1] Closing thoughts [/h1]  Ultimately, Peripeteia is an acquired taste, one that you'll either love or hate. It’s steeped in Czech, Hungarian, Polish, and Russian (among others) influences, with just enough jank to transport you straight back to the 90s. The game offers minimal guidance and none of the modern QOL features I’ve come to rely on, yet that’s exactly what makes Peripeteia so special. It’s raw, unpolished, and unapologetically old-school, and that’s precisely why I love it.  It’s a breath of fresh air and has made me realise just what’s been missing from modern games. Sure, I won’t sink 100+ hours into it like I would with some modern titles, but during the time I spent playing, I was more engrossed than I’ve been in a long while. If you’re looking for a game that follows the standard modern development formula, this isn’t it. Peripeteia is packed with vintage PC gaming tropes that take you back to a time when games were about freedom, exploration, and creativity.
