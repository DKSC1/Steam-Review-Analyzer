==================================================

Date 2025-03-27 Playtime 6h 40m Rec Positive My time in-game has been (as of writing this) spent exclusively playing the multiplayer version with one other friend, both of us playing survivors against an AI controlled Bigfoot. With that out of the way; I have deeply enjoyed this game, the shooting feels pretty good, the looting feels pretty good, Bigfoot is scary when he sneaks up on you.   Many of the the aforementioned, and not mentioned, parts have some rough edges to them. For instance, the shooting feels nice, but is kind of samey due to an either real or perceived lack of hip-fire inaccuracy. The looting can be a bit tedious at times, especially when you lower the amount of loot on the map, finding maybe 2-5 items in any normal sized location seems to be the norm.  Now, my favorite part of my experience so far has been the titular character: Bigfoot. Fighting Bigfoot can be very thrilling both when you are not armed to the teeth with every explosive and weapon on the map, and even when you are, seeing how much damage you can do in one go is also a blast. Throughout the close to 10 rounds I have played of this, across all the maps, it has been very interesting to see how the environment changes how both you and the Bigfoot play. To explain, within the Redwood Forest, you have access to many camp sites and cabins, leaving you often with resources to spare. However, due to the amount of wildlife and trash within the map, Bigfoot also has many chances to heal, leaving both sides pretty well balanced.  My only example of game-breaking jankiness was in the second round I played, wherein Bigfoot got stuck on some rocks in a river and could not move, which ruined any fear and tension that was established in previous Bigfoot attacks.  Overall, very fun with friends, a bit of jankiness can be expected, but nothing game-breaking happens frequently.

Date 2025-03-25 Playtime 6h 31m Rec Negative бигфута не появилось за 10 ночей, пересоздавали даже лобби с другом, всё равно нихера. а когда нажимаешь кнопку в игре "сообщить о проблеме" игра просто крашит) разрабы, вы мрази
Date 2025-03-25 Playtime 1h 33m Rec Positive Игра отличная, только вот про игру с тем самым другом у которого вечно нет денег придётся забыть. (Стоит дофига)
Date 2025-03-25 Playtime 14h 11m Rec Positive you know what they say about big feet...
Date 2025-03-25 Playtime 13h 47m Rec Positive Fun but quite buggy and the AI gets stuck on everything so he doesn't attack at all

Date 2025-03-24 Playtime 14h 35m Rec Positive Possibly the best game I have ever had the honor of playing. I was brink of suicide before playing this game saving my life and the bullies at my school so thank you bigfoot for my life.    FOOT.
Date 2025-03-24 Playtime 5h 39m Rec Negative I picked the black guy with my friends, and the ONE rule in any horror movie/game is that the black guy dies first... ALWAYS!!! so like i told them protect me because we all knew what would happen, so the AI bigfoot jumped off a cliff 360 me and ONLY TARGETED ME!! ignored the 2 white fellows and only got me the black guy, then after he killed me right away, he proceeded to ignore them and not attack for 9 NIGHTS!!! (based on a real story...) (I do actually recommend the game its funny asf)
Date 2025-03-24 Playtime 8h 40m Rec Positive i cant believe i played this fucking game

Date 2025-03-23 Playtime 9h 38m Rec Positive pretty simple game just set traps and try to stay hidden. long nights and short days make for tricky or slow looting but with the right team and a set of mics this game can be a lot of fun.

Date 2025-03-22 Playtime 8h 13m Rec Negative This game was fun until the new update where it is now unplayable. it used to run fine with no issues but now every action is delayed and when we were 5 min from beating the game it crashed on us.

Date 2025-03-21 Playtime 6h 0m Rec Negative I nearly shit myself when a bear jumped out from the bushes at me would recomend
Date 2025-03-21 Playtime 5h 41m Rec Positive The game was pretty good, love the atmosphere it creates. I do feel while playing with AI Bigfoot it can be a little dead during the day. We have also experienced issues with AI Bigfoot getting stuck in some parts of maps, this really slows down the game and honestly ruins the experience. Other then that the game is nice and makes you feel on edge. Despite the let down of the AI I still recommend this game.

Date 2025-03-12 Playtime 12h 8m Rec Positive Great game but I'm worried for the future of it... I understand that the game is in early access but it feels like it has slowed down in updates over the years. Part of this could be the fact that the developers are currently dealing with the war with Russia. It still feels like a buggy mess even with it being in EA for almost 8 years. Some of these bugs are visual while others are game breaking, such as Bigfoot getting stuck in a river and not moving the whole game, and achievements not working. I will still personally recommend this game to who ever is feeling like playing it. It is still an amazing game and fun with friends. I would just keep in mind that this game is more than likely never to be finished at the pace it is moving in the development process.

Date 2025-03-09 Playtime 4h 43m Rec Positive Game can range from horrifying to funny depending on who you play with, which is a real plus. A good game that involves a decent amount of strategy and critical thinking. While the game description makes it seem as though the player is hunting the titular Sasquatch, the actual feel of the game shows its the other way around, which was a pleasant surprise.

Date 2025-03-01 Playtime 7h 21m Rec Positive I genuinely love this game, it's so much fun and I can't wait for the official release. That being said, I despise the resurrection ritual shit. I'm not saying that I think the idea is bad because I don't, I actually really enjoy it as a concept but I have some issues with it. First off, it's hard as fuck to find and if bigfoot comes in and wreck's someone's shit and now your teammate is dead before you find all 5 totems and the ritual sight then they're just like there waiting for the rest of the team to bring them back. Which imo is boring as fuck being the person waiting but I digress. The second issue is how buggy it is when you're carrying a body, like it's funny at first seeing them flop around in your arms but it lost it's novelty and I hate when their big ass forehead flops in and out of frame. I understand things will change and that it's early access and I'm still learning the game but personally that's my opinion and besides those 2 issues again I really like this game it's super fun and I highly recommend getting it.

Date 2025-02-25 Playtime 96h 27m Rec Positive I love this game to play with friends but the only thing I dis-like is that the skins for big foot, so you have to choose for him to now look snowy and have the skin or for him to be snowy and not have the skin you paid for...
Date 2025-02-25 Playtime 26h 58m Rec Positive This is a scary and fun game!
Date 2025-02-25 Playtime 14h 17m Rec Positive good concept starts out good getting a challenge out of Bigfoot but does not last long. pulls back and never attacks again after getting hit. game play begins to get stale and just drags on game can probably last days in real life lol if you can never find him you would at least think he would pick off solo people make some effort game can definitely make improvements on the AI i would say we love a scary aggressive big foot ready to do battle or even continue to stalk you and your friends but just the constant hiding does not do it for me.  It would be nice if he could change between scared hider to aggressive depending on how far one is from his group again good game just need small tweaks with the AI of Bigfoot
Date 2025-02-24 Playtime 12h 34m Rec Positive This game is crazy fun with friends, I'm waiting for the major update that reworks most things!

Date 2025-02-23 Playtime 177h 11m Rec Positive Thrilling. Great concept. Nice sceneries. If you want to play a game where you are being hunted and can shoot back and has co-op, this is a very good one.
Date 2025-02-23 Playtime 8h 23m Rec Positive Ich grüße euch Fans des Horror-Genres, Ich und mein Genosse haben uns dieses Meisterwerk für unglaubliche 20,00€ erworben, und wir sind zu tiefst begeistert, was die Ersteller da erschaffen haben ist echt umwerfend. Kommen wir zum Punkt, dieses Spiel hat zwar nicht die beste Grafik aber es macht wirklich sehr Spaß und hat den Effekt eines Horror Spieles so wie es sich auch gehört,die 4 Karten sind sehr verschieden mit verschiedenen Außenposten, Camps, und kleinen Dörfern, es gibt an diesen Orten verschiedene Beute sowie Waffen, Munition, Nahkampfwaffen und verschiedene Briefe der verlorenen Bewohner dieser Orte.Der sogenannte Bigfoot kann Fenster Kameras und Fallen zerstören sowie auch Türen,die KI vom Bigfoot ist hervorragend, er kann mit Straßenschildern und Gitarren angreifen und im Wald Fallen platzieren z.B umfallende Bäume, und Seile die einen hochziehen und dann spitze Stöcke die in die Person eindringen.Das Kamera System ist auch besonders gut man kann Kameras auf dem Boden auf verschiedenen Objekten und auf Dächern einer Veranda. Ich bin besonders überrascht von diesem Spiel und empfehle es jedem Horror Liebhaber der mal auf Jagd gehen möchte!  Capetz.

Date 2025-02-15 Playtime 2h 38m Rec Positive Bigfoot is a game that started out small and simple, but has grown over time into something that I can only describe as a horrific adventure in the best way possible. The splendid graphics and sound design combined with multiple ways to complete a game make this an innovative game that stands out against the rest. I would recommend this game, especially if you have friends to play it with.

Date 2025-02-11 Playtime 1h 22m Rec Negative [h1] Bigfoot 2025 Güncel İnceleme: [/h1]  Bigfoot ister 4 kişi ister 5 kişi ile oynayabildiğiniz bir ekip oyunu. Klasik 1 katilin 4 hayatta kalanı öldürmesi ya da tam tersini esas alıyor. Çeşitli maplerde ister bigfoota karşı ister bigfoot olarak oynayabildiğiniz oyunnn açıkçası baya sıkıcı. 1,5 saate yakın şans verdim ancak beni ve arkadaşlarımı sarmadı. Arkadaşlarınızla bir haftasonu oynayacaksanız tercih edilebilir ancak sürdürülebilirliği kesinlikle yok, peki neden? Sırayla anlatalım:  [h2] Oynanış: [/h2] Oyuna karavanınızda başlayıp harita boyunca yolları takip ederek çeşitli yerleşkeler bulup, çeşitli lootlar toplayarak bigfootu öldürmeye çalışıyorsunuz ya da bigfoot olarak hayatta kalanları öldürmeye çalışıyorsunuz.   [h3] Eksileri (-): [/h3] (-) Harita tasarımları çok boş ve tekdüze. Yerleşke adı altındaki birçok yer 3-5 aynı tip binadan oluşuyor. Çeşitlilik yok. (-) Loot ve eşya çeşitliliği de düşük yine tek tip tuzak, tek tip savunma aracı, birkaç silah ve mermileri ve medkit. Bu kadar. (-) Mekaniklerin sığlığı ve azlığı, yine tuzak bul üzerine et koy. Bitti gitti kadar basit her şey. Çeşitlilik hiç yok (-) Aşırı hızlı sıkıyor. Oyunun size sundukları yaklaşık 15 dk içerisinde bitiyor ve sonrası loop şeklinde devam ediyor. (-) Bigfootun can barı ve silahların vurdukları hasarlar çok saçma değişkenlere sahip ve oynarken neden diye sorgulatıyor. Orta seviyede canavarın canı 1657 gibi saçma bir rakam ve siz de ona 15-7-9 gibi hasarlar veriyorsunuz, mantıksız. 2000 can ver madem silahlar da belli bir hasarda vursun, bitsin gitsin. Saçmalık. (-) Oyunda çeşit çeşit buglar mevcut. Kapıyı kapatıyorsun diğer arkadaşında bazen kapanmıyor. Kapalı kapıdan bigfoot geçiyor vs vs gibi (-) En büyük eksik ise yapımcının oyunu terk etmesi Steame göre 15 ay, oyunculara göre ise yaklaşık 2 yıldır hiçbir update gelmemekte. Yani bu hale getirip kaderine terk etmişler. Bir oyuncu olarak bu tür yapımcıların desteklenmemesi gerektiğini düşünüyorum.  [h3] Artıları (+): [/h3] (+) Boş bir haftasonunda gerçekten oyunsuz kaldıysanız sizi bir miktar oyalamayı başarıyor. Çıtır çerez biraz vakit geçirip çıkmalık. (+) Harita çeşitliliği olarak bir çeşitlilik mevcut. İstediğiniz haritada bu garip deneyimi yaşayabilirsiniz.  [h2] Sonuç: [/h2] Oyunun iyi yanlarını ortaya çıkartmak için uğraştım ama gerçekten elimizde çok ham bir iş var. Boş kalsanız bile şahsen ben vaktinizi bu oyuna harcamanızı önermem.   [h2] Genel Skor: [/h2] [b] ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ [/b]
Date 2025-02-11 Playtime 39h 24m Rec Positive Game is fun multiplayer, but I'm not sure it's worth the $20. Unfortunately, it doesn't go on sale often and never sub-$10.
Date 2025-02-11 Playtime 199h 55m Rec Positive Hello All, ****My Review will be updated at the end.**** My review is certainly a different take from the majority of those who play this game.  I am a 56yr old man who, as a grade school student in the 1970s, grew up during the "hey day" of Bigfoot popularity.  Consistent newspaper articles, news reports and countless TV shows and documentary appearances back then kept Bigfoot in the public consciousness, seemingly on a weekly basis.  The Patterson-Gimlin film made Bigfoot a star in 1967 but the show "In Search Of" & the movie "The Mysterious Monsters"  in 1975, made him a creepy legend.  It is because of this & my life long interest in the subject that lead me to play this game.  To the developers credit, this game captures the "creepy" innate fear people have of the dark woods, especially at night, as well as the primal fear of being hunted by a creature that is looking to savagely kill  you & eat you.  As a 1970s kid, there were few things more terrifying than the thought of being stranded out in the woods & having Bigfoot slowly reveal his face, not to mention what he may do to you once he does.  For myself & many kids nationwide back then, that thought kept you from exploring the woods or even playing outside near dense tree lines close to sundown.  This game does a pretty fair job of presenting the player with that kind of fearful anticipation but in a breezy manner that condones fast & smooth play.  As a kid, I never did "buy into" the notion that Bigfoot was a friendly tree huger creature.  My gut always told me that a fair number of the disappearances in the forests & wilderness parks were due to this legend's evil devises.  This game wears that premise like a glove.  So far the game has been a great deal of fun for me... a guy who grew up on Bigfoot stories from my grandmother & a constant barrage of scary Bigfoot news reports, movies & shows.  I have only played 3 of the maps & only Redwood & Yellowstone with regularity.  The map layouts & visual quality are excellent & very immersive.  There are a few touches that the developers have added that mimics supposed behaviors of Bigfoot such as upside down tress jammed into the ground and stick/log structures. The equipment available lends to a natural & logical selection for such a mission as the one presented the player.    My experience has been that as you first play, the games, no matter the difficulty selection, are easier so as to help you acclimate to game play. What I mean by this is that you have fewer bears and wolves that show up to attack you, more prey animals appear so that you may harvest more of the important & necessary meat, more ammo & explosives spawn & ole buddy Bigfoot is not as aggressive.  All of this seems to change the more you play.  Each map progressively becomes more difficult...at least to a degree.  As far as the 3 maps I have played, I do have an opinion as to their difficulty which may not be shared by other players.  My experience is that the Winter Park map presents a higher degree of challenge than Redwood and Yellowstone.  Less spawned ammo & equipment & a Bigfoot that seems to be more inclined & able to kill you. Most of the game play holds to some degree of realism or thought so perhaps this is intentional?  Could this game be better...absolutely. In the two maps I play the most, Bigfoot gets hung up or becomes an eventual "no show" 1 out of every 4 games.  That is extraordinarily frustrating.  (As a point of reference to the developers, ROCKS pose a problem for Bigfoot in the pond at Grant Village, the large lake in Yellowstone to the northeast of the island as well as below the Fire Tower.) This is a flaw that I hope is  very seriously attended to by the developers if they wish to grow this game & keep the customers they have. I have also had some crazy surprises when Bigfoot magically appears behind me on the top of Fire Towers when I have run him off and then trapped the heck out of the stairs. (Did he climb or use a zipline?) On some occasions he will also ignore the car battery effects and even the flare gun.  To make this game a polished & consistent offering, these glitches must also be fixed.  As far as recommendations, players might really enjoy an AI for Bigfoot that allows him to be more stealthy & creepy as he stalks you.  Hiding behind trees and spider crawling in the grass. That would be a huge thumbs up though I would not have a clue as to how to implement such behavior.  I might also recommend having two, simultaneous creatures hunting players when there is a team of 4 playing the AI.  That would be epic. Game thoughts said, I certainly enjoy this game & the premise on a number of levels & hope that more maps become available.  **UPDATED**  Having played much more since the first review, including some multiplayer, I would rate this game an 8.2.  Bugs such as your guns going off while you are not even attempting to shoot are really annoying and frustrating but the more I play, I just truly enjoy it.  Extreme intensity, lots of jump scares and creepy angst.  Sincere compliments to the decision maker on the music.  It is an excellent and chilling pairing with the feeling of the game.  Make the AI Bigfoot harder somehow in Players vs AI  or add a second to that option of play and you will basically own this Bigfoot game type for years to come. Best of Luck.
Date 2025-02-11 Playtime 10h 25m Rec Negative how do you work on this shit for 9 years and still haven't made a decent game
Date 2025-02-11 Playtime 53h 37m Rec Negative Been supporting this game since 2018 and have had the same bug that wont allow you to load into any public server or even your own custom one for almost 2 years now, Devs have never been regular updaters nor do they care enough to have the accountability to address the many concerns to the people who have always been there funding their project. Dont buy the game and dont support people who not only gave up on all of us but also refuse to take any short amount of time to give the people a much needed courtesy update.

Date 2025-02-06 Playtime 15h 8m Rec Positive Ein finsteres Spiel für jene, die den Nervenkitzel nicht nur suchen, sondern ihm ins Auge lachen.  In Bigfoot jagt man nicht einfach eine Kreatur – man jagt das personifizierte Grauen, das im Schatten lauert, während man selbst zur Beute wird. Jede knarrende Planke, jedes Rascheln im Dickicht flüstert: Du bist nicht allein.  Die Atmosphäre? Dicht wie ein Leichentuch. Der Nervenkitzel? Ein ständiges Kitzeln an der Grenze zum Wahnsinn. Es ist kein Spiel, es ist ein Vertrag mit der Furcht – unterzeichnet im Blut der Unvorsichtigen.  Empfohlen für jene, die bereit sind, nicht nur Bigfoot zu jagen, sondern auch ihren eigenen Verstandt.  Müsst ihr wissen!
Date 2025-02-06 Playtime 12h 11m Rec Positive Bigfoot, c'est l'expérience parfaite pour ceux qui aiment les frissons, l'exploration et la chasse à l'inconnu ! 🌲👣 Ce jeu te plonge dans une ambiance oppressante et sauvage où tu dois traquer... ou être traqué ! 🧠💥  Le gameplay est super immersif : que tu sois un chasseur courageux ou le terrible Bigfoot, chaque partie est pleine de surprises et de tension. 🎯🦶 Les environnements sont magnifiques, mais attention, ce calme apparent cache toujours quelque chose. 😱🔥  Jouer avec des amis rend l’expérience encore plus fun (et flippante). 👥😂 Les cris, les pièges, et les moments de panique quand Bigfoot débarque te garantissent des soirées mémorables ! 💀🌌  Si tu veux un jeu qui mélange horreur, stratégie et adrénaline, Bigfoot est un incontournable. 💪💯 Prépare-toi à survivre... ou à semer la terreur ! 🐾🔥

Date 2025-02-06 Playtime 5h 16m Rec Negative O jogo é muito legal, mas o multijogador deixa totalmente a desejar, uma vez que é muito difícil de achar partidas públicas e as que você acha simplesmente não consegue acessá-las, umas por não estarem mais "ativas", outras porque você não pode participar de um jogo em andamento. Minha sugestão é que desenvolvam um método que permita ingressar na partida mesmo que ela já tenha iniciado, pois se fosse assim sequer estaria solicitando o reembolso. Se melhorar, volto a comprar.

Date 2025-02-05 Playtime 10h 16m Rec Positive i've always loved the concept of this game, and I think the developers have done quite well in execution. It's pretty fun to play with friends. One thing though is that at least for me it's annoying that every single time I try to join a game I am stuck on a loading screen, or searching on how to fix it. now yes I am reinstalling the game, but the fact that I have to go through this trouble upsets me. still a good game though

Date 2025-02-02 Playtime 8h 14m Rec Positive In single-player mode, players face an AI-controlled Bigfoot, utilizing various tools and strategies to locate and subdue the creature. The multiplayer mode introduces a dynamic where one player controls Bigfoot, employing its strength and abilities to outwit the hunters. The game emphasizes strategic planning, resource management, and survival skills, as players must navigate through dense forests, set traps, and remain vigilant against the formidable Bigfoot. The game features multiple characters, including hunters Rick, Jessica, Thomas, and William, each with unique attributes. Bigfoot itself can be controlled by a player in certain game modes, adding depth to the gameplay.

Date 2025-01-29 Playtime 3h 24m Rec Negative It's a shame that you pay for a game that will never allow you to play.  As others have stated, you can try to join a lobby only to be stuck in an infinite loading loop that will never allow you to enter.  Unless you're fine with throwing away your money, don't buy it.  Have followed others suggestions regarding signing in with the admin password, tried hitting refresh over and over and over to confirm that you are trying to get into a new lobby.  Nothing works.  Don't waste your time.

Date 2025-01-18 Playtime 13h 53m Rec Positive After playing this game by myself and with my friends for 13 hours, I've enjoyed my experience with it, and would recommend it. It has a good feel and a surprising amount of amusing features. Bigfoot will definitely surprise you with the things he does, and can do, especially if it's a player and not the AI. At the current time of writing I have noticed that there is a couple bugs that have affected my gameplay a couple times. Specifically the weapon system while pulling out a weapon shows my hands empty, but changing weapons in the moment and changing back has fixed it for me. AI Bigfoot also tends to get stuck in the water on Ross Lake Park. In conclusion it has been an enjoyable time, the game does need continued work but it seems the development team are still working on the game.

Date 2025-01-17 Playtime 15h 9m Rec Negative Going to have to not recommend it just due to the consistent price tag and unbeatable boss.  Buddy of mine and I tried to kill bigfoot several times over the years, our final attempt we used a trainer to get infinite ammo as the only ammo on the map isn't enough to even get the guy down a quarter of his HP, so we stacked infinite ammo, 360 degree bear traps and it still took about an hour or so to get the guys health down and eventually the game crashed so we never did actually beat bigfoot.

Date 2025-01-14 Playtime 12h 16m Rec Negative Game hasn't been updated in two years, left in a broken state. When it works it's fun, but Bigfoot tends to disappear into walls and render the game unplayable (if you haven't gotten a picture of him). Forced to play the game at 3% game volume with my headset at 40% because everything is SO LOUD. Devs made achievements unachievable somehow and the game has been in early access way too long. I can't justify a $20 price tag. Get it on sale or don't bother.

Date 2025-01-13 Playtime 12h 49m Rec Positive More like beg freak the way he sneaks up and pounds you.
Date 2025-01-13 Playtime 7h 23m Rec Positive The game's atmosphere constantly immerses you in fear, the fear of being attacked by Bigfoot at any moment. Teamwork with your teammates is essential to either kill Bigfoot or prove its existence. However, if Bigfoot is controlled by a bot, the challenge becomes far too easy, even if all of Bigfoot's stats are maxed out. Its attacks aren't devastating enough to force us to hide when night falls. There should be a mode where Bigfoot becomes significantly stronger—like a difficulty level 5—with additional abilities and faster health regeneration when it's controlled by a bot.
Date 2025-01-13 Playtime 492h 59m Rec Positive if you like horror games that are controller friendly , give this game a try. there are some things, like bigfoot getting stuck is my mane issue, but the fun games far out do those where he gets stuck.absolutely love this game.

Date 2025-01-11 Playtime 2h 24m Rec Negative BIGFOOT Is a real bullet sponge that's for sure. He's also very easy to find so that's convienent right? The problem is that there's no real hunting, on the second night the Bigfoot is already killing your team, there's no suspense or buildup whatsoever. Which is a shame because the equipements could be very interesting to use in alot of different ways. If the game was early access since a few months I would give it a pass but 8 years in EA and this is the result.

Date 2025-01-08 Playtime 2h 55m Rec Negative The game is so bugged. Spent 6 in game days trying to find Bigfoot only to find out that, when he isn't controlled by a player, he almost always bugs and disappears or gets stuck somewhere unfidable on the map. Complete waste of 30$. If you don't have enough people to play with, so that at least someone can play as Bigfoot, don't waste your money.

Date 2025-01-07 Playtime 3h 57m Rec Negative The Game itself is exiting and fun to play with friends but there is a very annoying and long unfixed bug which gives an infinite loading screen when trying to join another players lobby. This is because you can join a game that has already started but i think it would be appropriate to have an option to cancel trying to load into a game instead of having to close manually close the game to reopen when the same thing will likely happen again. I would only recommend the game when they fix this issue, cant really play with randoms until this is fixed.

Date 2025-01-05 Playtime 4h 55m Rec Negative 16 quid with one GLARING issue... when you try and join a server that has already started its game, you will be stuck in an INFINITE loading screen. There is no connecting and maybe getting a spectator option while you wait for it to end and another to start, none of that,   not EVEN a cancel button in the loading screen. This means every time that you pick a started server, which are not differentiated in ANY way from ones that are not that NEED players, you will have to cross your fingers and fully restart the game if you pick wrong.  You're only option beside that is to sit in lobby of your own creation for 20 mins waiting for other players...  After 10 wrong picks of low population lobbies I'm not sure ill play this game again, i just want a quick game man...  my mate got this for me for me, and we had some great couple games, i love the graphics, game play, optimisation, all fantastic, there's just this one large barrier for entry.

Date 2025-01-04 Playtime 9h 40m Rec Positive this is a cool game and stuff
Date 2025-01-04 Playtime 0h 20m Rec Negative The game crashes whenever I start, and the developers don't respond to the group discussions questions. DO NOT BUY.
Date 2025-01-04 Playtime 7h 2m Rec Positive bigfoot
Date 2025-01-04 Playtime 1h 36m Rec Positive BIGFOOT to niesamowita mieszanka horroru i survivalu, która błyszczy w trybie multiplayer. Wspólne tropienie legendarnej bestii z przyjaciółmi to czysta adrenalina – każda noc w lesie to walka o życie. Bigfoot jest nieprzewidywalny, inteligentny i z każdą rundą coraz bardziej przerażający. Grafika, dźwięk i klimat lasu sprawiają, że czujesz się jak w prawdziwym filmie grozy. Polecam, jeśli lubisz dreszczyk emocji i dobrą kooperację!

Date 2025-01-04 Playtime 3h 20m Rec Negative This game is fun but i cannot reccomend it. It has game breaking bugs that will make bigfoot get stuck in one spot and be unable to move, I have seen reports for this as far as june 2024 so its safe to assume that its probably not going to be fixed.
Date 2025-01-04 Playtime 4h 32m Rec Positive this big hairy ape is the reason for 8 missing people including me he booty bumed me and spread his delicous bigfoot on my face and made my booty cheeks turn red. 10/10 game would recommend

Date 2025-01-03 Playtime 31h 56m Rec Negative Timed me out because i wasn't playing for around 3 minutes. Horrible game
Date 2025-01-03 Playtime 10h 0m Rec Positive very creative and story lined game would recommend
Date 2025-01-03 Playtime 23h 52m Rec Positive OK the facts:  audio is really good, immersive and scary  visuals are amazing , even without bigfoot, the forests look beautiful.  gameplay can get repetitive but its really good fun for a while hunting and playing bigfoot. both teams are not too unbalenced but depending on the team players the matches are not always perfect  story is the classic bigfoot folklore , good fun.  i found a bug recently that stops me from joining over players lobbies, this has fully stopped me from playing until futher notice.  overall its good fun when there are no bugs and updates frequency is alright
Date 2025-01-02 Playtime 1h 9m Rec Positive Good with friends. boring without them. I'd give it a 6 out of 10
Date 2025-01-02 Playtime 128h 1m Rec Positive Alright i actually recommend this game the reason i changed my mind from Dislike to Liking the game is that the lobby issue is a bit easy to get around there just old lobbies that already started thats still floating around for some reason bigfoot is really fun with other people especially with a max hp bigfoot ai or player main critiques are that stun lock is too easy for both sides meaning that its easily abusable and just keeps you in a loop with no hope of getting out my suggestion is to limit stun lock for bigfoot meaning he cant keep you in a limbo and for humans  less stun items spawn and that he cannot be stunned after 10 seconds rough estimate. Also one last Critique please fix the amount of clutter meaning items that are causing the game to lag that doesnt need to be there. In short I would recommend this game when 5.0 releases which is apparently going to fix a lot of the bugs and ai issues and and exp and bonus systems to characters so I do not recommend getting this game a full price now but would wait until it goes on sale or 5.0.
Date 2025-01-02 Playtime 3h 40m Rec Positive muy bueno, recomiendo jugarlo de a 3 o de a 4 sino se pone muy complicado

Date 2025-01-01 Playtime 23h 7m Rec Negative this game suffers from unreal engine 5 upscaling that makes the game fuzzy and blurry even at epic.  I think developers in this day and age should use tricks to optimize the game like we use to do instead of brute forcing everything and removing features and making the game look bad to "optimize"

Date 2024-12-31 Playtime 15h 35m Rec Positive OMG         It has changed so much but it feels more scary compared to the old.  The DLC's for skins is just unacceptable. The game is very well made. It is probably one of the best games i have on steam. It's multiplayer is so easy to navigate so you can play with other people. I would very much recommend this to people that like horror games.    ALSO TAKE AWAY HEALING IT IS SO ANNOYING!!!

Date 2024-12-24 Playtime 26h 14m Rec Positive stunning visuals,pretty scary,Bigfoot looks great,good mechanics,easy to learn,few bugs and glitches but not many,and its multiplayer,and the AI is good. I think the only things holding this back is its only got 4 maps,and has been in early access for 8 years,it barely gets updates, and it needs more equipment,like a UV light,and Bigfoot should be able to knock down trees.That's all i have to say.P.S add more zip lines pls. i would recommend you have friends make a lobby instead of playing with randoms cause half the time it gives you an infinite loading screen.

Date 2024-12-23 Playtime 1h 30m Rec Negative It's a bad game. We hunted bro with military grade rifles, a sniper a shotgun an AR aswell as dynamite. It took 10 shotgun shells to the face, 20+ sniper shots, 60 ar rounds and a dynamite to kill him yet the only reason he died and couldn't run away is because he got stuck to a rock because of a glitch. So not worth 90 Iminutes and $15
Date 2024-12-23 Playtime 1h 30m Rec Negative The bigfoot died after being lowest hp setting put. Only took 60 AR shots, like 30 shotgun shots, 40 sniper shots, a fucking c4?! and a glitch to kill the mf. Btw he runs from u and heals too. Its a very cool concept tho, i wish it was made a little different. Would be a great game then.

Date 2024-12-22 Playtime 1h 28m Rec Negative It’s a suspenseful singleplayer game but you cant join other peoples lobbies or some reason or it takes like 20 minutes. You should fix this and also make it 10 dollars to allow more people to be able to buy it.

Why the F4CK am i going from 160fps-50fps while im either walking randomly or when fighting bigfoot. This game is actual dog water. I play black myth wukong on all high settings, 160fps (barely any drops). Id say that's pretty impressive to f4ck a game up that bad with bare minimun graphics and janky mechanics, i applaud you devs!

Date 2024-12-15 Playtime 6h 5m Rec Negative This game is poorly optimised It showed me error for days and after making tweaks in my PC it finally worked.  Its funny that such a big titled game which almost every youtuber played , which was released in 2017 is still in early access till date. Ig if someone has a monster or gaming PC might work fine but for me it just took days just to figure out the problem to run this game. Even the support group of discord was unable to help and left a comment saying there's a problem on my side lol  About game-play, [spoiler ]I liked everything, the game feels real except bigfoot just walk over my trap like a robot felt very unreal to me. I mean if yeti can try to kill you by attacking from different windows when you are inside a cab then why he dosen't show any reaction on a meat lying on trap with no bush on it. [/spoiler]   I will not recommend  this game bcos there are simply too many bugs including multiplayer or joining others lobby. Even the admin knows about it but ig devs are not bothered with it

Sometimes its not clear what is even triggering him. I have tried to do alot of research to learn more about the game, but its not always very conclusive. Still overall a pretty good game play with friends!

Date 2024-12-12 Playtime 46h 12m Rec Positive Merhaba, oyunun kapsamlı inceleme rehberine hoş geldiniz.. öncelikle oyunun iyi yanlarıyla başlayalım ilk çıkış tarihinde çok kötü garfiklere ve geliştirilmeye devam ediyordu, yapımcı firma kazandığı  ücretler karşılıhında oyunu hemen cecik yeni nesil grafiklerle donattı  gerek lwl dizaynları gerek gerçekci doğa görüntüleri olsun herşey cuk oturdu. karakter dizaynları, sonra model efektleri ,gölgelendirme, atmosferik efektler derken oyun büyüdü kocaman oldu bıgfoot gibi oyuna girdiğinizde heşeyin yeni nesil olduğuna hemen anlayacaksınız..  Oynanış kısmı : Gayet akıcı ve realistik bir oyun deneyimine sahip ister korku teması ister askıyon teması arayanların tam isteyebileceği bir karışım  silah çeşitliliği, loot mantığı ve hayatta kalma mantığını harmanlayıp gayet hoş  vakit geçirmenize olanak tanıyor. üstelik loot haricinde oyunun size sunduğu  met kit sınırlı sayıda herşeyi dikkatli kullanmanızda fayda olacak mermiler değerli bulunan her tuzak, patlayıcılar, kapanlar akkılıca konumlandırılınca güzel damage ler verebiliyorsunuz yaratığa. Bildiğiniz gibi oyun hem solo hemde eşli bir yapıya sağip bozulmayan sunucu alt yapısı sunucu problemleri bulundurmamakla beraber arkadaşlarınızla keyifli vakit geçirebileceğiniz yer yer korkacak yer yer aksion yaşayabileceğiniz bir türevde. solo oyuncuysanız benim gibi arkadaşınız olmadan da bigfootla mücadele edebilir eyer şansınız ya vert giderse loot'a önem vererek bigfoot'u avlayabilirsiniz..  Eksi yanlar : evet her oyunda olduğu gibi bu oyununda hala bir geliştirme aşamasında olduğunu unutmayalım. Malum canavarımız haritanın sulak, gölet, nehir gibi noktalarına düştüğünde tekrar sıçrama yapamadan orada baga giriyor ve bıgfoot artık peşinize düşemiyor bir çok yayıncının da bu yüzden oyunu sildiğini bozuk dediğini hatta koca ayağı küstürdük diye videolarda görmüştüm sorunun kaynağı sulak, nehir, göl gibi noktalarda nehire giren bigfoot geri çıkamıyor baga giriyor malesef. konu baglardan açılmışken oyundaki tek bag bu değil elbette... Save bagı bir kez save aldığınız ve oyundan sıkılıp tekrar saveden ilerlemek istediğinizde, yukarıdaki baga benzer bir bag açığa çıkıyor ve bıgfoot yine bizi peşlemeyez oluyor. Altını çizmekte fayda var bu herzaman olmuyor tabiki.  Nesnelerin gereksiz sesleri : Oyun sizi içine çekebilmek için yapay çalı sesleriyle dolu bir anda bi çalının sesini duyup arkanıza baktığınız da hiç bir şey göremiyorsunuz buda çok doğallık dışı geliyor insana o seslere alıştığınızda oyunda ki ürkme seviyeniz azalıyor hatta yer yer oyundan asla korkmadan geceleri bile gezinmeye başlıyorsunuz bu da oyundaki bağlanma sürenize eksi bir detay olduğunu söylemek zorundayım ilerledikce ve vakit geçirdikçe ne demek istediğimi iyi anlayacaksınız elbette.  Ani fps droplanmaları : Evet oyunda gece, gündüz , kar yağışı ve yağmur yağışları atmosferik detaylar mevcut fakat gündüz ve gece dönüşümünde yani şafakta ani bir fps kaybı yaşıyorsunuz belki 25 fps yer yer 35 45 fps lere 160 lardan düştüğünüz de oyun kasmaya başlıyor bu oyunu ilk Rtx 3070 Tİ ve rx 5700 xt ve gtx 1660 süper ve rx 580 ekran kartlarında testlerini yaptğımda rtx li sistemle bile ani fps düşüşleri malesef yaşıyor belirtmek isterim ki sadece akşam, sabah döngüsünde bu fps kaybı oluyor akıcılığa büyük zararı  oluyor ki iyi yanı ortalama 2.3 dakika sürüyor olması sonra oyun toparlıyor ve devam edebiliyorsunuz. akşam süresi uzun gündüz çok kısa olması iç karartıcı bi durum alışmak çok uzun sürüyor buda oyunda kalma sürenize yine bir darbe olarak düşünebilirsiniz gece gündüz gece gündüz kafanız dönüyor belli saatten sonra ya bu süre uzatılmalı yada sırf gece olarak kalmalı oyun...  Fiyat abestliği : Malum türkiye sıtandartlarında artık bi oyun satın almadan önce 2 kere değil 10 kere düşünmek gerekiyor ben oyunu çıktığı dönemler 72 tl gibi bir parayla satın almıştım sonra steam dolara geçti ve oyunun fiyatı türkiyede 1200 tl gibi rakamlara fırladı buda yapımcının bu duruma insiatif sunmaması oyuna her yılda 1 kere indirim getirmesi bi eksi yanı oldu oyun çıkalı 2 sene 3 sene olmak üzere ve sadece yılbaşı önceleri oyunun fiyatının düştüğünü söylemek zorundayım oyunu alış sebebim önceleri twitch de yayıncı oldğum için ekiple 3.4 gün atıp oyunu bitirip rafa kaldırmaktı altını çiziyorum ekiple eyer oyunu satın alacaksınız ve arkadaşlarla takılırız oynarız diyorsanız önce arakdaşlarınıza oyunu aldırın yada hediye edin derim sonra yanlızlık çekebilirsiniz evet sunucularda insanlar var ama ağarlık olarak avrupa sunucaları ön pilanda ve tek kalma olasılığınız çok yüksek ve ben tek kalanlardan oldum ekibe oyunu aldıramadım sevenler sevmeyenler kızdım aradan 1 yıl gibi süre geçti solo olarak 3 mapte de oyunu oynadım bıgfoot'un tekniklerini kavradım ve artık av konumunda ben ken bıgfoot av konumuna geldi solo oynayacaklar gerekten kafa vererek canavarı ablayabilirler eğer yorumumu okuyarak oyunu satın almaya karar verdiysen bana ulaşarak takımıma gelebilirsin dostum iyi eğlenceler.... :))

Date 2024-12-09 Playtime 21h 11m Rec Positive Played this game a fair bit with the girlfriend, and some friends. gameplay is good, the game is directly what you'd expect given the title. ran into some bugs past few days. So BigFoot gets stuck in water ways sometimes, and one time he was stuck on a rock and couldnt get off on yellowstone- but getting water stuck is every map so far. If Devs read this maybe theres a code you could add where if hes stuck inside a X radius he can respawn home retaining HP. Keep up the good work, if you guys get into Wendigo monster game ill buy it also
Date 2024-12-09 Playtime 23h 18m Rec Positive I've been playing this for a couple nights, it's fun but Bigfoot keeps getting stuck in water, tonight it even got sfuck on top of a mid size rock that it could have easily just jumped off. It happens way too often and I really wonder if nobody else has reported this.  Sometimes we make it to night 4 or even 5 without being attacked and find him stuck in the river. It is very disappointing.  Hopefully gets fixed.

Date 2024-12-07 Playtime 13h 37m Rec Negative Also ich muss echt sagen, das spiel ist von der grundlage eigentlich gut, man kann soooooo viel draus machen und das potenzial ist mega aber was macht der entwickler frage ich mich? das spiel gibt es schon seit anfang 2017 und es sieht einfach aus wie gerade rausgekommen, zudem ist das spiel seit fast 8 jahren anscheinend im early acces, zudem bezahlt man viel zu viel! wie kann man für das spiel, für das wenige inhalt 19,99€ verlangen? Das spiel müsste 3€ kosten mit dem momentanen inhalt und das sehr wenige sich negativ äußern geht gar nicht! Es wirkt hier einfach das man mit dem namen BIGFOOT einfach geld scheffeln will. An dem entwickler, ey ich liebe das es ein bigfoot spiel ist, die grundlage ist gut aber bitte mach ein vernüftigen preis für das spiel, nutze das geld was du hast um mehr leute ins boot zu holen, hau mehr content raus, hol es aus dem early acess und bombadiere das game mit content aber vernachlässige dabei nicht denn support.

Date 2024-12-04 Playtime 21h 8m Rec Negative The game can be fun with friends, don't get me wrong but I refuse to ever play this game again due to one simple horrendous bug that must be fixed. At random whilst playing, lightning can strike a near by tree and THE LOUDEST SOUND EFFECT KNOWN TO MAN WILL PLAY! It will make your ears ring, it will shake your bowels, it will cause heart issues. And you might be thinking, "Oh just turn down the volume?" It literally does not matter what volume you have the game on, the thunder will always play at maximum volume. I had all game sounds at 3% and still incurred hearing damage. Class action lawsuits for damages have been levelled for less. Just remove the sound effect if you can't fix the problem. I won't play again until I see an update fixing this beyond stupid issue.

Date 2024-11-30 Playtime 47h 43m Rec Positive This game is so fun and clueless. Wish it was a bit better but it is a good time with friends.   I personally do not like that friends as Bigfoot can basically take you down first night.   Bigfoot sometimes gets stuck which is a big bummer.  Friends have also gotten stuck.   Very fun game but not something to take too seriously.

Date 2024-11-30 Playtime 7h 48m Rec Negative Game is unwinnable without exploiting the enemy AI, it will spawn on people, it will teleport to people, it will not spawn in sometimes locking the players in an endless match. Game was ported into UE5 for some god forsaken reason, only hammers the performance more and all achievements are broken. Waste of time unless you hate your money and the time you spend on this earth.

Date 2024-11-27 Playtime 5h 16m Rec Negative I usually don't leave reviews, but, I felt so inclined in case my review changes anyone's mind. If you're looking for a spooky co-op game to play with your friends, just don't. Waste of time and energy, wandering around the woods for hours, looking for a single scratch mark across 20 kilometers of land. Meanwhile, Bigfoot plays hide and seek after getting pegged with a paintball pellet. I would've loved to recommend this game, but the lack of hints or clues after wandering around attempting to collect the final piece of evidence is infuriating. It's so infuriating that I have to believe it's a ploy to make you play the game long enough so you cannot refund it.  3/10 had some good laughs and good jump scares but holy shit I cannot stand a treasure hunt.

Date 2024-11-25 Playtime 5h 1m Rec Negative You can get a solid run and a half in the new Hades in the time that it takes for Bigfoot to show up in this game. Genuinely so much downtime and none of it is spent in giddy anticipation. Effects, animations, lighting, and AI for this game is atrocious. Sound is alright. There was an XP mechanic after each successful hunt but either they've gotten rid of it or it just isn't visible anymore. If you were to pay $5 for this game, it would still be too much.

Date 2024-11-24 Playtime 20h 36m Rec Positive I got this game a week ago on my steam deck to try out as it was listed as playable on the deck. I am enjoying the game very much and i appreciate the developers for having a single player mode. i am so happy to see game developers putting a single player mode back into games. My only request for the single player mode is to have the player be able to play a team game with bots against Big Foot and a mode where the player can play as Big Foot against a team controlled by A.I. right now we can only play as a survivor against big foot and that's a good start but i personally think that if the devs made these upgrades to the single player mode of the game then the game would be a lot better.

Date 2024-11-23 Playtime 24h 45m Rec Negative The game is good as an idea, but the game mechanics & balancing need improvements. Guns take a few seconds to load in after equipping & can't be fired during that time, clues are way too hard to find, leading to hours of searching without being able to find them all, etc.

Date 2024-11-19 Playtime 30h 33m Rec Positive I used to play this game for a bit right before the Ross Lake park update came out. The reason I stopped was because the update made it unable to run on my PC with a built in intel 630 GPU. I've been wanting to play again ever since and finally got a new computer. The max graphics look amazing and it really sets a mood perfect for this game.only thing that sucks is how Bigfoot gets stuck now. other than that its an amazing game to play by yourself or with others.

Date 2024-11-17 Playtime 4h 36m Rec Positive Replace the flag at Ross Lake with a white one for more realism.  Bigfoot is like a draftdodger trying to cross the Dnieper (never makes it), which bugs the game, and he just waits for the players to come put him down.  So I don't recommend maps with lots of water.  Other than that, its a lot of fun.

Date 2024-11-14 Playtime 5h 57m Rec Negative So far not terribly impressed. After seeing this online many times and the advertisement on the game it obviously fails to address that it does not have a matchmaking system. This will result in you joining lobbies that are outdated and stuck on loading screens unfortunately. When I finally did find a working lobby it had a hacker who was able to fire the flare gun like an assault rifle, could spawn infinite cameras, then when he played as Bigfoot he had 999,999 health and the rest of the lobby and myself obviously quit(Among other various invasions of the system but those were the most notable). Seems this game may have been abandoned or something seriously wrong is taking place. Only way I've been able to play for full experience is against AI which is not what I bought the title to do. Had requested a refund but got denied even though I had spent the entirety of the time trying to figure out why the game was not working and that was due to outdated lobbies still being listed as they aren't join able which as stated above ends up in infinite load screens. Game needs love and I'm assuming with friends it's probably great but very hard to recommend to friends when that is the off the bat experience an individual has with the title and based on the reviews it looks like people just quit instead of giving feedback so here it is. We want all games to do well and this game honestly looks promising.

Date 2024-11-09 Playtime 12h 56m Rec Negative This is a really cool game and fun but very difficult to actually play with other people. Apparently there is a bug where when you browse games to start, it shows you games that already started or finished. Except you don't know this by looking at it in the server lobby. Then, when you go to join the game, you get stuck at the loading screen because the game is dead/already in progress/etc. and have to close the game out and try again with a different server. This makes playing the game outside of using a discord server to coordinate pretty much unplayable if your looking for a team. Because of this I can't even really play except a solo game. I've spent up to half an hour attempting to join games and then restarting just to try and find a game. I think the majority of my play time is doing this and maybe only 2 hours in actual games.

So dieses Game beinhaltet alles was man sich als Mann im Wald vorstellen kann den in diesem spiel sind sie beauftragt den Vater von Morgan Jones zu Jagen und an die #ENSLAVEJONES society auszuliefern und ihn dabei auszupeitschen. Wem das nicht fällt ist kein legaler mensch den der Jones gehört eingebuchtet wie Tyreese und T-Dog #FÜRJONESDERN...   Ich und der gute Castle waren schon überall (WW1, WW2, KANDAHAR, WW3 usw.) aber das war bisher unsere größte herausforderung.  Denn wenn du nicht aufpasst ist Papa Jones auf einmal hinter dir und fängt an dich anzufassen dann bete zu gott dir kann  dann nur noch jesus persönlich helfen(RIP JESUS TWD). Ein anderes mal haben wir eine schrotflite gefunden und dem Pa Jones eins in die Eier geknallt das hat ihn jedoch nicht interessiert und ist wie Gerokomis einfach lachend weggerannt #GEORGEDERGEILEMONKEY.  Zum schluss kann ich nur noch sagen passt auf euch auf den vor dem seit ihr nie sicher.  Müsst ihr wissen.

Date 2024-11-06 Playtime 7h 23m Rec Positive good 
Date 2024-11-06 Playtime 40h 58m Rec Positive I recommend this game because I love it a lot. But if you need a game to be polished and reliable to really enjoy it, do not buy this game. My favorite part is trying to 1v1 Bigfoot, but I have to be prepared for 1 or 2 in every 10 games to be a dud where Bigfoot gets stuck on the terrain, and the run is just kind of over. Until Bigfoot's AI stops getting caught on the environment, I can't recommend this game unless it's on sale. You can play as Bigfoot, and online with a human Bigfoot player, and in fairness, I don't usually play those modes, which I'm sure solves the getting stuck issue. That's why It's a great party game that's worth busting out with the crew every month or so for a few rounds. But remember, you can't play with your friends against an AI Bigfoot reliably, because he might just get stuck in a river or on a cliff. As much as I enjoy it, Bigfoot is not worth twenty dollars in its current state. I want to see this game succeed because I really enjoy the gameplay loop when it works. That's why I bought it, and that's why I bought skins, I want to support the devs. But if you're not hooked by the gameplay loop like I am, I recommend waiting til the next Cyber Monday, and make a drinking game out of it. Cheers.

Date 2024-11-05 Playtime 7h 17m Rec Positive Very fun game, and scary, it provides a super fun and cool hunting experience, and the maps are stunning, they all look beautiful mixed with this game's semi-simple design, and the graphics are really nice with decent performance.  This game has a few bugs you man run into, nothing worth mentioning, but either way you can report bugs straight to the developers through the main menu, very nice to see a feature like that!  This game also allows you to select beta versions, such as 2017,2018,2019,2021, these versions are very different from each other making the price of this game even more worth it!  This game allows you to have very fun too while keeping the horror very "real" feeling, you should absolutely give this game a serious try!
Date 2024-11-05 Playtime 2h 56m Rec Negative Derzeit nicht wirklich sinnvoll spielbar, wir haben ca 2,5h in dem Spiel verbracht und egal was wir zu zweit eingestellt haben, war es einfach nicht möglich den AI Bigfoot zu töten. Beim ersten Mal bin ich direkt in Nacht 1 gestorben, weil er nur auf mich fokussiert war, egal wie viel mein Mate geschossen hat. Beim 2. Versuch bin ich iwann auch gestorben und bei meinem Mate hat er sich dann nach ner Weile einfach nicht mehr blicken lassen.  War reine Geld- und Zeitverschwendung.

Date 2024-11-04 Playtime 18h 55m Rec Negative Good game but... How should i put this? The games musltiplayer is completely screwed up? Yeah thats it. This games multiplayer barely works, anytime you try to enter a lobby you'll just get stuck in a  loading screen. Not to say this game is bad, the actual gameplay is really good (Also skins are locked behind a paywall... Really?) But the actual game is almost intirely based on multiplayer which is not good if your game has problems with multiplayer.
Date 2024-11-04 Playtime 1h 38m Rec Negative This was not fun. Movement felt like I was going through gravy. Gunplay felt really sluggish to me, I didn't particularly enjoy it. Against AI, Bigfoot got stuck in rocks and logs, and we were able to mag dump him to death with no challenge. Lobby names hardly showed up trying to play with my brothers. Voice chat in game doesn't seem to work, had to use discord. I played a match as Bigfoot and all the moves were glitched, i saw no red mist for example.  This game was released in 2017 and in 90 minutes i experienced more glitches than i ever should have. My brothers are telling me I had a horrible bad luck experience but, i feel like this needs much more quality control. I did not enjoy it. 4/10.

Date 2024-11-03 Playtime 10h 13m Rec Positive It's a pretty fun game when the AI bigfoot won't get bugged and stuck into water. They really need to make the matchmaking and the lobby system better. I wanted to join a public lobby with my friends, but could not. I was hoping that we would find someone who would play bigfoot so that we would not have to play against AI.  Every time I tried to join a public lobby, which was not created by my friends, the game just kept on loading. I don't know why the game did not return me to main menu when I could not join, but instead I had to restart the whole game. Maybe the host didn't accept us or the game in that lobby had already started. This problem needs to be sorted out so that only public lobbies which are looking for players that very moment are listed.  The game itself is quite fun and had a good time. We played against AI.

Cruel ist die AI kann sich heilen nicht vollständig aber es haben 2 leute 2 magazine in dieses ding gehauen und 50-80 schaden verursacht dann heilt sich das viech um bis zu 40 bis 60 hp .. wir haben nicht so viel ammo um das auzugleichen selbst nachdem ich jedes haus und jede ecke ausgeraubt hatte mathematisch nicht genug ammo um bigfoot zu töten.   Alles in allem skip das spiel. kauf es nicht im sale! lach mich einfach aus das ich es gekauft hatte. wisse das dieses spiel unfinished und unpoliert ist.

Date 2024-10-30 Playtime 3h 40m Rec Positive Fun Love being bigfoot and ripping friends apart
Date 2024-10-30 Playtime 24h 29m Rec Negative There is very little here resembling gameplay, and each match consists mainly of downtime.  During the day, bigfoot is passive. During the night, he is aggressive, and seeks out the players to kill them. The day (6 AM to 6 PM) lasts six minutes, while the night (6 PM to 6 AM) is ten minutes, nearly twice as long. The gameplay loop consists of scouring the map for 6 minutes to look for guns and ammo, and then 10 minutes of sitting perfectly still doing nothing, hoping that bigfoot targets another player instead. There is virtually no hunting, stalking, or tracking of bigfoot. Instead, you simply wait for him to find you; which he will, because during the night he psychically knows the location of each player, and cycles between attacking them one at a time. He approaches a player, takes roughly 50% of their health, and then runs away for no reason other than the fact that the game would end immediately if he simply continued attacking. After an attack, he makes a beeline across the entire map for another player to repeat the process. Once you've stockpiled enough weapons to actually deal damage to bigfoot, he'll beginning running from fights, allowing you to sit and do nothing for 3+ minutes waiting for him to eventually make another pass. The game ends when you either run out of health kits, or find enough ammo to eat through bigfoot's enormous health pool.  PVP matches may somehow be worse. Without the artificial inhibition of AI bigfoot simply backing away after taking half of your health, players controlling bigfoot can freely stunlock and kill any player they come across without contest. Though there is less downtime, as hunter players can actually explore at night given the current bigfoot doesn't have clairvoyant powers... This is largely still a process of simply waiting to die.   Though the environments are beautiful and enjoyable enough to explore, there's too little to do in the process. The animations are stiff, the human character models look scarier than bigfoot himself, and the sound design (stereo panning specifically) is pretty awful. There may be a good concept here for a game, but it is not a completed concept.

Date 2024-10-26 Playtime 1h 53m Rec Positive This game on the surface of it may seem unpolished and lacking certain substances. But when you dig deeper it is truly unimaginable. This game for all of its flaws is quite unique and charming.     Bigfoot (/ˈbɪɡfʊt/), also commonly referred to as Sasquatch (/ˈsæskwætʃ, ˈsæskwɒtʃ/), is a large, hairy mythical creature said to inhabit forests in North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.[2][3][4] Bigfoot is featured in both American and Canadian folklore, and since the mid-20th century has grown into a cultural icon, permeating popular culture and becoming the subject of its own distinct subculture.[5][6]  Enthusiasts of Bigfoot, such as those within the pseudoscience of cryptozoology, have offered various forms of dubious evidence to prove Bigfoot's existence, including anecdotal claims of sightings as well as alleged photographs, video and audio recordings, hair samples, and casts of large footprints.[7][8][9][10] However, the scientific consensus is that Bigfoot, and alleged evidence, is a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax rather than a living animal.[3][7][10][11][12][13]  Folklorists trace the phenomenon of Bigfoot to a combination of factors and sources, including the European wild man figure, folk tales, and indigenous cultures.[14][15] Examples of similar folk tales of wild, hair-covered humanoids exist throughout the world,[16][17] such as the Skunk ape of the southeastern United States, the Almas, Yeren, and Yeti in Asia, the Australian Yowie,[14][18] and creatures in the mythologies of indigenous people.[19][20] Wishful thinking, a cultural increase in environmental concerns, and overall societal awareness of the subject have been cited as additional factors.[21]  Description.

Date 2024-10-20 Playtime 6h 7m Rec Positive Bigfoot offers an immersive and thrilling experience for those who love the blend of survival, mystery, and horror. The atmosphere is intensely captivating, with vast, dense forests, eerie sounds, and the constant feeling of being watched. The co-op gameplay element adds a fun, strategic layer, especially when hunting for clues and coordinating with friends to track down the elusive creature. The tension builds masterfully, keeping players on their toes as they search for signs of Bigfoot while avoiding dangerous wildlife and managing their limited resources. The visuals, especially the environmental design, really enhance the sense of being deep in the wilderness, and the sound design makes every crack of a twig or distant growl feel unnervingly real.  However, while Bigfoot delivers a strong core experience, a few areas could benefit from some improvement...  To address the issue of the game becoming too predictable after the first successful hunt, you could suggest the following improvements in your feedback:  One thing I've noticed after multiple playthroughs is that once you've successfully killed Bigfoot, it becomes quite easy to replicate the same strategy over and over. While the initial hunt is thrilling and challenging, future encounters lack that same intensity, as the gameplay feels a bit too predictable. To keep players engaged long-term, I’d suggest adding more dynamic elements to Bigfoot’s behavior and abilities, making each hunt more unique.  For instance, Bigfoot could have varying strategies or levels of aggression depending on the environment, weather conditions, or even how the players approach the hunt. Introducing random behaviors, like setting traps, ambushing players in different ways, or retreating and healing in certain areas, would add an extra layer of unpredictability. Additionally, having more variety in Bigfoot’s abilities—such as increased intelligence or adaptability over time—could make each encounter more challenging and force players to rethink their approach.  Adding these dynamic elements could really extend the replayability of Bigfoot, keeping it exciting for both new and veteran players.  Another challenge I’ve encountered is that when playing with multiple people, it’s quite easy to overpower Bigfoot by dishing out large amounts of damage in a short span. Once weakened, he tends to limp or run away, but at that point, it becomes more of a simple chase rather than a tense battle. This can lead to the game feeling unbalanced, as the thrill of the hunt is diminished when Bigfoot becomes too vulnerable.  One way to enhance this aspect could be to make Bigfoot more adaptive during fights, especially when facing multiple players. For example, Bigfoot could use the environment more strategically to evade or ambush players, making it harder to chase him down once he’s injured. He could have moments of heightened strength or temporary boosts, like bursts of speed or the ability to become more aggressive when backed into a corner. This would force players to be more cautious and thoughtful about how they engage him, rather than just unloading damage until he retreats.  Additionally, implementing a system where Bigfoot becomes more dangerous as he takes damage could keep players on their toes. For instance, he could set traps, lure players into dangerous areas, or become more elusive as his health decreases. This would create more intense and strategic encounters, requiring players to coordinate and adapt to his evolving behavior rather than simply overpowering him.  These adjustments could make each multiplayer session more challenging, ensuring that Bigfoot remains a formidable opponent throughout the game.

Date 2024-10-19 Playtime 10h 16m Rec Positive I love this game, it's an amazing blend of horror and strategy. Unfortunately I am dealing with a bug for Bigfoot where he gets stuck in the lake by the Giant Village, the one closest to the RV, but regardless it's still such a fun game to play.

Date 2024-10-16 Playtime 20h 38m Rec Positive It was hilarious when my friend picked Thomas and Bigfoot decided to become a top tier racist. He would only go for that friend because the Thomas skin is black. We would create a line, it would go Me, that friend, then brother. He would only attack that friend. It was so hilarious LOL

Date 2024-10-15 Playtime 8h 32m Rec Negative Spiel an sich ist ok, mit Freunden macht es Spaß zu Spielen, aber die Lobby-Funktion ist grauenhaft. Server-liste lässt sich nicht nach Name sortieren, Freunde können weder im Spiel, noch über Steam eingeladen werden und nach Servername suchen funktioniert auch nicht. Zudem bleiben bereits geschlossene Server weiterhin in der Serverliste gelistet und es kann beigetreten werden. Nach Absturz des Spiels kann leider nicht in das laufende Spiel wieder beigetreten werden. Steuerung des Charakters ist gewöhnungsbedürftig.  Waffen sind zu schwach, 10 Schaden mit einem Scharfschützengewehr, auch bei Kopfschuss... da stimmt die Balance nicht. Schwimmen im Yellowstone Park ist ein schlechter Witz. Grundsätzlich geht schwimmen, aber nach einer gewissen Zeit droppt man einfach auf den Seegrund ohne einen Hinweis und ertrinkt langsam, obwohl maximale Ausdauer vorhanden ist. Mit dem Charakterdesign fang ich erst gar nicht an. Einfach nur schlecht umgesetzt.

Date 2024-10-14 Playtime 15h 34m Rec Positive IT GOOD
Date 2024-10-14 Playtime 8h 58m Rec Positive The game, developed by a Ukrainian studio,  offers a good overall experience with reasonable difficulty and solid playability.  The mechanics are well-executed, especially the gunplay, which feels smooth and satisfying.  However, there are a few aspects that need improvement.  1. Team vs. Player Balance:  The balance between the team and the player feels heavily skewed.  Getting killed on the first day due to a lack of gear is frustrating, as you have no real way to defend yourself.  Not only is it impossible to fight back, but you're also unable to outrun or hide from the enemy.  This makes the early game feel unfair and punishing, which detracts from the enjoyment.  Additionally, there are a few bugs that still need to be addressed.  Occasionally, a teammate would teleport randomly about 100 meters away after being hit by Bigfoot, or in some cases, they would die without any clear reason.  These glitches disrupt the flow of gameplay and need fixing.  2. In-Game Flags and Blocking in Russia:  While I understand the developers' stance due to their circumstances,  the sheer number of Ukrainian flags throughout the game feels excessive.  I wouldn’t mind a few, but they’re everywhere, to the point where it feels like the game is set in Ukraine rather than its actual American locations. Yellowstone, for example, is a national park in the U.S., and yet, there are no U.S. flags to be found anywhere,  which feels out of place considering the setting.  Moreover, blocking the game in Russia feels extreme,  and unfortunately, innocent players are caught in the middle of a situation they have no control over.  It's disheartening that regular people are affected by decisions made far beyond their influence.  Conclusion:  Despite these issues, I still recommend the game.  The devs’ perspective is understandable, but the execution—especially  regarding the flag placements and game availability—feels a bit overdone.   Hopefully, the developers will address these concerns in future updates.  Until then, the game remains enjoyable, but with room for improvement.

I have been contacting support off and on about this issue since January and yet it still will not work, I met all of the requirements to run the game but it still won't load. I was told that they could fix the issue in may and still five months later they still have not made a single small bug fix update to fix the issue. The Support Team has been very kind but still it shouldn't take five months to fix an issue you know how to solve.

Date 2024-10-10 Playtime 19h 2m Rec Positive Багованый продукт жизнидеятельности. Постоянно какие-то проблемы с подключением, текстурами, спонтанными лагами (глюками) (Nvidea GTX 1660TI 6GB RAM).  Сам геймплей +- норм, но баги вымораживают. Один из них был сегодня - трекер GPS текстура осталась в руках и мешала прицеливанию. испортило вообще все проходение

Date 2024-10-08 Playtime 11h 2m Rec Positive Ah, BIGFOOT—the game where you "strategically" sacrifice your teammates to lure out the big guy. When I was playing with Mr. Floppy and Moto, though, I honestly couldn’t tell the difference between Bigfoot and Moto. They’re basically twins—big, hairy, smelly, and not exactly what you’d call pleasant company. I was constantly wondering which one we were supposed to be hunting!  But let’s be real, this game is pure chaos with friends. You’re trying to survive while accusing your buddies of secretly being the monster (even if they’re not). Fun times.  Randy Rating: 4/5 — Great for sacrificing friends, but maybe double-check which hairy beast you’re running from.

Date 2024-10-05 Playtime 12h 42m Rec Positive Bigfoot throws you into a tense survival horror experience, where you’re hunting (or being hunted by) the elusive creature in a dark, dangerous forest. The atmosphere is creepy, the AI is unpredictable, and every encounter with Bigfoot feels chaotic and thrilling.  You’ll need to work with your team (or go solo) to track, trap, and survive. It’s a heart-pounding mix of strategy and action, with other dangers lurking in the woods to keep you on edge.  If you enjoy co-op survival games, Bigfoot is definitely worth a try!

Date 2024-09-29 Playtime 1h 3m Rec Positive Full disclosure on this "recommended" review. I actually refunded this game. I played with my friends for a little over an hour and honestly had a great time trying to figure some stuff out in the beginning, but towards the end our experience kind of slogged. This game has a great fear factor when Bigfoot runs up on you, but toher than that I found it to feel a little shallow and less of an experience than I expected. I was hoping for something with more depth, and I am going to put this review as recommended because I think if someone had more time to invest, there may be some more to this game that I did not have a chance to explore. I definitely think this game is worth giving a try to see if you like it. As someone who has very limited time to play games, I wasnt captivated enough to justify keeping. But if it seems interesting to you, and you have the time to invest and explore everything the game has to offer, then give it a shot

Date 2024-08-28 Playtime 4h 0m Rec Negative They only enjoyable part of this game is the VOIP is usable by both teams and it is indefinitely DISABLED, not sure how fixing VOIP is hard.

Date 2024-08-27 Playtime 0h 28m Rec Positive You basically hunt Bigfoot. With the new update however, YOU can be come Bigfoot, so your friends can hunt YOU and put YOU in a cage. You ni... monkey.
Date 2024-08-27 Playtime 38h 19m Rec Positive Un jeu super et tres immersif mais je recommande de jouer avec un amis sinon on risque de se lasse repidement, sinon super jeu juste quelque bug sur le bigfoot mais sinon je recommande !
Date 2024-08-27 Playtime 3h 12m Rec Negative Game was genuinely one of the most dull experiences I have ever had. Played with a friend and wanted to use in game voice chat. Did not work. Graphics were okay at best but somehow the game which came out all the way back in 2017 and has many years to improve its optimisation but still ran extremely poorly. This game is a scam overpriced piece of trash. Somehow  I actually feel that if it was free i would not want to try it again. I was lucky that my game was refunded due to playing for over 2 hours however my friend was not so lucky so he lost out on £17. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!
Date 2024-08-27 Playtime 18h 11m Rec Positive veldig morsomt og litt skumelt
Date 2024-08-27 Playtime 2h 46m Rec Positive The game is fun, and even though it dates back to 2017, it's surprising to see that the devs are still active in bringing us new features.

Date 2024-08-26 Playtime 75h 49m Rec Positive Fun to play with friends and family alike
Date 2024-08-26 Playtime 12h 26m Rec Negative Ich würde das Spiel am liebsten zurückgeben, wenn ich könnte. Leider gibt es mehrere Probleme:  Schlechte Qualität: Die allgemeine Qualität des Spiels lässt stark zu wünschen übrig. Das Gameplay wirkt unausgereift und es fehlen wichtige Features.  Schlechte Server und Verbindungsprobleme: Der Beitritt zu Servern oder öffentlichen Gruppen ist nahezu unmöglich. Die Verbindungsqualität ist extrem schlecht, was das Spiel fast unspielbar macht. Zum Vergleich: Spiele wie Phasmophobia oder Demonologist bieten deutlich stabilere und verlässlichere Online-Server. In diesem Spiel muss man Freunde in der Nähe haben, die eine Gruppe erstellen, um die Verbindungsprobleme irgendwie auszugleichen.  Insgesamt bin ich sehr enttäuscht und würde das Spiel nicht weiterempfehlen, insbesondere wenn ihr eine stabile Multiplayer-Erfahrung erwartet.

Date 2024-08-25 Playtime 15h 10m Rec Positive Have had nothing but a hilarious, incredible time playing this game with friends. Bit of a learning curve, but once you get it, you get it. 5/5 stars, play this for a great time.
Date 2024-08-25 Playtime 6h 17m Rec Negative This game has lots of large environments with many places to explore.   [h1]Negatives [/h1] During my escapade, I found that Big Foot has way too much health and is extremely difficult to escape from if he spots you. I couldn't even hear him aproaching me sometimes, catching me off guard. There's isn't even a footstep sound. It's just quiet until he jumps you.  I also disliked how there's a lack of a tutorial. Many things I didn't know how to use, like the traps and the cameras.  The maps you can go too are also way too massive. I presume this is why I didn't see big foot for like five nights. (That only happened on the snowy map)  Finally, there is many glitches that make this game annoying to play. I get that it's in early access, but it's been in it for almost a year without an significant update. Apparently there's an update coming in October; I'm more just annoyed they haven't communicated anything about it since about 8 months ago. [h1]My Opinion[/h1] This whole experience was okay. There really isn't much to do except search around the map. Doing that will take you probably forever to find all the photo opportunities. I only ever found one dead body out of three.  In the future if this game becomes better, I will update this review.
Date 2024-08-25 Playtime 3h 59m Rec Negative Love buying a game for me and my friends and it not working.

Date 2024-08-24 Playtime 13h 20m Rec Positive Assez bon jeu. Par contre lorsqu'on est débutant, assez difficile de battre bigfoot vue qu'il fait des dommage et que sa vie remonte assez vite malgré qu'il est au minimum. De plus, chaque fois qu'une game est terminé, nous devons refaire un lobby donc assez lassant. Mais jeux sympa en ami.

Date 2024-08-22 Playtime 17h 43m Rec Negative  [h1]BIGFOOT – A Unique Concept with Executional Hurdles[/h1]  BIGFOOT, developed by Digital Homicide Studios, is an asymmetrical multiplayer survival game that centers around the hunt for the elusive creature of folklore. With its intriguing premise and potential for suspenseful gameplay, the game attempts to deliver a thrilling experience by combining elements of strategy, cooperation, and fear. However, while the concept is promising, the execution reveals several shortcomings that impact its overall appeal.  [h2]What Works Well:[/h2]  [b]- Intriguing Premise and Unique Gameplay:[/b] BIGFOOT’s central concept of hunting a mythical creature in a dense forest environment is both unique and compelling. The asymmetrical gameplay, where players take on the roles of hunters or the elusive Bigfoot, offers an interesting dynamic that adds depth to the multiplayer experience. The tension of tracking a creature that can strike back adds a layer of excitement and strategic thinking.  [b]- Atmospheric Setting and Immersive Environment:[/b] The game’s setting in a dark, dense forest contributes to an atmospheric and immersive experience. The environment is well-designed to create a sense of isolation and danger, with dynamic weather effects and night-time conditions enhancing the feeling of suspense. The attention to environmental detail helps to build a believable and engaging world.  [b]- Cooperative Gameplay Opportunities:[/b] BIGFOOT shines in its cooperative multiplayer mode, allowing players to team up and strategize together to hunt down the creature. This cooperative element encourages teamwork and communication, as players must coordinate their efforts to effectively track and capture Bigfoot. The camaraderie that develops during these sessions can be a highlight of the experience.  [b]- Varied Equipment and Strategies:[/b] The game offers a range of equipment and strategies for both hunters and the creature. Hunters have access to various tools and weapons, such as traps and tranquilizers, which can be used to set up ambushes and outwit Bigfoot. Conversely, Bigfoot has a range of abilities to evade and counteract the hunters’ efforts. This variety allows for multiple playstyles and strategies, keeping the gameplay dynamic.  [h2]Where It Falls Short:[/h2]  [b]- Technical Issues and Performance Problems:[/b] One of the major issues with BIGFOOT is its technical performance. Players have reported a range of problems, including bugs, glitches, and performance issues that can hinder the gameplay experience. These technical problems can disrupt immersion and create frustration, particularly during critical moments of gameplay.  [b]- Limited Content and Replayability:[/b] The game’s content is somewhat limited, which can lead to a sense of repetitiveness after a while. The core gameplay loop, while engaging initially, may start to feel monotonous as players encounter the same scenarios and challenges repeatedly. This lack of variety can diminish the game’s replayability and long-term appeal.  [b]- Imbalance and Gameplay Mechanics Issues:[/b] There are issues with game balance and mechanics that affect the overall enjoyment. The asymmetrical nature of the gameplay can sometimes lead to imbalances, where either the hunters or Bigfoot may feel overpowered or underpowered. Additionally, certain mechanics, such as tracking and interaction with equipment, can feel clunky or unintuitive, impacting the smoothness of gameplay.  [b]- Sparse Tutorials and Guidance:[/b] BIGFOOT does not provide extensive tutorials or guidance for new players, which can result in a steep learning curve. Players may find themselves struggling to understand game mechanics and strategies without sufficient in-game explanations. This lack of guidance can be particularly challenging for those new to the genre or unfamiliar with asymmetrical multiplayer games.  [h2]Conclusion:[/h2]  [i]BIGFOOT[/i] offers a unique and intriguing concept with its asymmetrical multiplayer gameplay centered around the hunt for a mythical creature. The atmospheric setting, cooperative gameplay, and variety of equipment provide a solid foundation for an engaging experience.  However, technical issues, limited content, gameplay imbalances, and sparse tutorials hinder its overall execution. While the game has potential and can offer memorable moments, its current state may not fully satisfy players seeking a polished and balanced experience. For those interested in the concept, BIGFOOT is worth exploring, but be prepared for a game with its share of rough edges and limitations.

Date 2024-08-20 Playtime 32h 30m Rec Positive Good game. My only complaint is not being able to pause the game when I'm playing single player mode. Not too sure why we can't but oh well it's not a huge problem. I just save and exit if I have to go afk. There's obviously bugs but it's an early access game so I don't expect much when it comes to that. Every game is going to have bugs.   7/10
Date 2024-08-20 Playtime 12h 36m Rec Positive Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)  Overview:  “BIGFOOT” takes us deep into the heart of cryptid folklore—a world where the elusive Sasquatch roams dense forests, leaving behind footprints and mystery. Developed by CyberLight, this survival horror game invites players to unravel the enigma of Bigfoot while battling the elements and their own sanity.  Gameplay:  The core gameplay revolves around exploration, tracking, and survival. Armed with cameras, traps, and determination, you venture into the wilderness. The tension escalates as night falls—the rustling leaves, distant howls, and fleeting glimpses keep you on edge. But beware: Bigfoot isn’t the only threat. Starvation, hypothermia, and exhaustion can be equally deadly.  Atmosphere and Immersion:  The game excels in creating an eerie ambiance. The dense forests, fog-shrouded lakes, and abandoned cabins evoke a primal fear. The sound design—cracking branches, echoing footsteps, and Bigfoot’s guttural growls—immerses you in the hunt. However, the repetitive tasks (setting traps, analyzing evidence) can dampen the thrill.  Multiplayer and Teamwork:  BIGFOOT shines brightest when played with friends. Coordinating traps, sharing resources, and frantically radioing for help during a Bigfoot encounter create memorable moments. The asymmetrical multiplayer mode pits players as investigators or the elusive creature, adding layers of strategy and paranoia.  Graphics and Performance:  For an indie game, BIGFOOT’s visuals are surprisingly decent. The forest feels alive, with dynamic weather and day-night cycles. However, occasional glitches and stiff animations break the immersion. The game’s early access status means ongoing updates, but it’s a double-edged sword—bugs persist alongside improvements.  Conclusion:  “BIGFOOT” isn’t flawless, but it taps into our primal fear of the unknown. If you’re intrigued by cryptozoology, enjoy cooperative survival, and don’t mind occasional jankiness, step into the wilderness. Just remember: sometimes the scariest monsters aren’t the ones hiding in shadows—they’re the glitches that defy explanation.

Date 2024-08-18 Playtime 96h 43m Rec Positive Плюсы: Можно заставить в это играть пугливого друга и играть за бигфута. Есть отличная графика ну и неплохая оптимизация. Есть правда задержка перемещения и закрывания дверей когда ты не хост но это не всегда критично. Сам по себе геймплей интересный. Есть определенный лут на картах, который помогает игрокам убивать бигфута, а сам бигфут может это уровнять тем, что у него по мере поедания всего подряд на карте становится больше стамины. Минусы: При игре против ИИ он часто застревает в реках. Основная проблема игры в том, что не работают станы. Игроку за бигфута достаточно использовать ЛЮБУЮ анимацию что бы какой- нибудь капкан или аккумулятор не сработал. Бигфут может раскрывать капканы ударами, рычать или прыгать что бы не действовал стан от взрывчатки и это все создает дисбаланс против команды охотников. Баланс карт и оружия можно крутить сколько угодно и кому- то все же будет не нравится но я думаю что все те, кто провел достаточно много времени в игре оценят исправление багов. Я играю вместе с несколькими друзьями. Некоторые из нас провели в игре как минимум 50 часов и мы бы определенно хотели как- либо помочь с разработкой игры так как потенциал тут есть и нам в целом уже не жалко денег за игру. Мы нашли кучу багов, недоработок в картах да и в целом есть много идей для улучшения игры. Вот одни из этих самых идей: Возможность более подробно настраивать баланс сессии. Ну например добавить не 3, а 5 уровней урона и хп, добавить возможность делать фиксированное и случайное появление лута на карте. Тут я думаю нужно пояснение. При игре вдвоем против игрока за бигфута часто получается так, что охотники проходят половину карты но так и не находят хотя бы 2 аптечки. Тут у нас есть идея решения проблемы - Уточнение секторов появления определенных предметов. То, что происходит сейчас- в одном и том же месте на карте в один раз может появиться 3 аптечки, код от сейфа и патроны на ракетницу, а в другой раз там будут максимум патроны 7.62. Нужно сделать какое- то максимальное и минимальное количество лута в каждой точке на карте. По мимо оружия должно быть хотя бы пару аптечек которые гарантированно появляются в определенных местах. По поводу баланса мы с друзьями сходимся во мнении, что у бигфута в большинстве случаев больше шансов. На это есть много причин но одни из основных- это не работающие станы и способности которые против большинства игроков будут дисбалансными.

Date 2024-08-17 Playtime 0h 45m Rec Negative This Game sounded interesting at first. But starting a game is the only real horror you are gonna experience in this game.  Why you ask? A lot of people have trouble with joining lobbies, including me. But wait you can play with friends it's better than right? Right?! The connection issues are better, not entirely resolved tho .... But even then, if your friend group doesn't have enough players for a 4vs1 match, you will find out how truly terrifying the hit boxes in this game are. At least for our big hairy fellow foot there. For real. All games that I either play with my friends or watched them play in pve game just end in big foot getting stuck in/at nearly anything. Often even during the first night. See that small stone there? Or that bush over there? Did you know a human can walk over/ through them, but not a massive monster?   I would say only buy this game if they either have fixed the issues for sure or you have constantly a playgroup of 5 friends to play with. Unless you want to play for like ~10 minutes only to find Bigfoot stuck at *insert object on the map* killing it and/or restarting the game.

Me and my son have bonded greatly over this game as we are both bigfoot enthusiasts and have been deeply involved within the cryptids community for decades. seriously though, speaking as somebody who has studied bigfoot for a LONG time, i don't like how bigfoot is portrayed as a sort of paranormal demon... i would like if it was more realistic... but still hostile.   if you dont like this game... F**K YOU!!

Date 2024-08-12 Playtime 7h 6m Rec Positive Игра, очень понравилась! Самая идея и первичная реализация на хорошем уровне.  Но есть некоторые моменты...  1) На новых картах ночью периодически подлагивает даже на высокопроизводительном железе... 2) Если играешь с друзьями против ИИ то BIGFOOT в некоторых локациях (как правило где вода, камни, мостики) часто может застрять. И тут два варианта :  -если в нем GPS sensor то его можно найти и забить как кабана :) -если в нем ничего нет то искать его можно очень долго, поскольку крик генерится (поправьте если это не так) всегда возле игроков, даже если тварюка в другой части карты застряла и по этому нет возможности ее найти.  Уважаемые разработчики, пожалуйста пофиксите эти моменты, ведь игра очень крутая получилась!

Date 2024-08-12 Playtime 13h 59m Rec Positive A good atmospheric game about hunting bigfoot.  Pros: +Cool environment +Scary at times +I like some of the animations +Fun looting -  lootable weapons and traps +Unique Bigfoot abilities (it fights strategically based upon where you are) +Has multiplayer CO-OP and PVP  Cons: -Same 2 or 3 maps that don't change -Gameplay loop is BORING - wander around in the day and hope to stumble upon Bigfoot (although he only flees during the day), then wait till night when he hunts you down until he does a knockdown animation + damage on you and then leaves you alone for the rest of the night. Since Bigfoot is a bullet sponge, rinse and repeat this for A FEW HOURS. -Multiplayer....idk if it has an active playerbase but I doubt it does -Updates/content additions happen every long while  Overall, a good fun game for playing the first time, but quickly becomes repetitive and boring due to Bigfoot AI. Probably would be better to play with a teammate.

I've only played this game a handful of times, while I enjoy it, not worth it if the Devs can't listen to the community and put work into make the servers smooth and playable so you can enter games, leave games and not be stuck in a loadin screen of doom.

Date 2024-08-09 Playtime 11h 21m Rec Positive Hello, I would love to express how much I love this game. I need to leave some feedback too, though. Firstly, the Bigfoot's character model needs to be completely naked next time you update the game. I'm talking about fully naked to the skin. I wish to see his other "bigfoot". I would also like the animals in the game, like the bison to repeatedly rape the player every time we get too close. I want to be dominated by the BBB (Big Black Bison). Now, I would love to express how much I love this game. I love when the Bigfoot grabs me with his big hands and slams me down. It really turns me on. I love when my teammate shoots me with his rifle and he hits one of my major arteries. It really turns me on. That's about it. I would like to inform you guys that I've masturbated to the Bigfoot character a few times. JakeyWakey Out.

Date 2024-08-07 Playtime 5h 53m Rec Positive This game gave me hemorrhoids. It has always been unfortunate that they didn't give Bigfoot a massive cock but at least it's semi understandable why, unlike how you can't finger his ass. All I've ever wanted is to go down on some hairy Bigfoot chocolate starfish, but I guess that "Isn't mass appealing" yeah right, who WOULDN'T want to do that. Anyways mid game but kinda fun w/ friends.

Date 2024-08-05 Playtime 7h 27m Rec Positive Meus amigos, eu passei mal de tanto rir, minha barriga está doendo até agora. Eu, meus amigos Mistão mil grau e Mazzi o NEZZE estavamos vendo esta tarde oque iriamos jogar. Os dois deram a sugestão desta obra de arte e lá vamos nos, cartuchamos o game e abrimos. De imediato oque podemos notar é uma má otimização em nossos aparelhos computadorizados, porém tudo se resolveu ao diminuir levemente os gráficos de ultima geração. Assim fomos, de primeira hora não vimos muitas coisas mas derrepente, saindo dos arbustros correndo igual um maluco em nossas direções, estava ele, desde pequeno eu sonhava com esse momento, o PÉ GRANDE. Desde os primordios de GTA SAN ANDREAS eu esperava esse momento, estar cara a cara, frente a frente, olho a olho, binóculos a binóculos com a FERA. Logo descobrimos que a FERA era bastante forte e se alimentava dos animais silvestres. Um de meus amigos, o MISTERIX deu uma dica, VAMOS MATAR TODOS OS ANIMAIS DA FLORESTA ORAS, ELE NÃO VAI RECUPERAR MAIS A VIDA. Resultado, gargalhamos muito e descobrimos que ainda dá para ser o PÉ GRANDE, rimos mais ainda pois a movimentação é meio "tosca" e é isso que deu a graça ao game.  10  /    10  EU RI DEMAIS MANO COMPRA AI KKKKKKKKKKKK

Date 2024-08-04 Playtime 3h 59m Rec Negative This is a fun one off game to play with your friend group and mess around but overall the game is very clunky and not that great. i cant imagine anybody exclusively or consecutively playing this game.
Date 2024-08-04 Playtime 1h 25m Rec Negative Player movement through the environment feels very clunky/robotic. Objects in the game are slow to react to player actions (curtains, light switches, doors, etc.), if at all. Bigfoot can take loads of damage (hunting rifle to the face over and over again - no problem). All of this, along with other elements not being very polished, makes the game lose its immersiveness.  Interesting concept, but poorly executed across too many fronts to be enjoyable. Disappointing as I had high expectations for Bigfoot as a co-op game.

Date 2024-08-01 Playtime 5h 9m Rec Negative Played it after picking it up a couple of years ago and i gotta say do not play this game as if youre trying to play it like DBD (player being a killer/bigfoot) hunting you guys down. Just let Bigfoot be the AI. If a player is bigfoot he/she can find everyone really fast and pretty much outright attack everyone before anyone can loot up at the start of the game. Bigfoot had way too many advantages as a player and not as a AI. I decided to look around at the community hub for this game and i gotta say. It looks like its 100% abandoned at this point so if you decide to get it. Dont buy it at full price. Just wait for a sale or move along to a better game. Note: GP and graphics werent too bad though. The fact that it seems like its abandoned at this point and and Bigfoot as a "PLAYER" needs quite a good nerf makes the game not so good to pick up. 5.5/10

Date 2024-07-29 Playtime 33h 4m Rec Negative this game has a cool idea, but it is such a waste of time its crazy. there is no way to beat the bigfoot, and every time you come into contact with him, he relentlessly eats your ammo and loses barely any health. The actual reason i deleted it, however, is the perma-death situation they put you in. I have spent no more than an hour in any game because when someone dies theres no way to res them. Medkits are too few and far between to mean anything, and they do nothing after bigfoot kills you. He can even go as far as to "knock" you, but once he does this he ignores all other players and ACTUALLY BMs you! I can't believe they stole $30 from me just to spectate my friends lol

Date 2024-07-27 Playtime 17h 55m Rec Positive This game is usually an extremely fun horror experience with both friends and solo, but there is one problem that I have with the game: Bigfoot's A.I. The A.I of bigfoot is generally pretty polished and fun, but he might as well be the Eye of Sauron; since, Bigfoot can find you anywhere, anytime, any way. One time, I was crouching in the corner of a house, all lights were off (including flashlight), and all of the windows had curtains over them. Even the door was closed! Regardless, big Monke Man barged through the door and unleashed a Mortal Kombat X-ray on me, and I was nearly killed. I recommend this game to everyone, but I hope that the devs do one of two things: Add difficulty settings that change the strengths of Bigfoot, or simply make Bigfoot no longer omniscient.

But every time I have played after this point the bigfoot AI breaks and he no longer attacks or seeks out the players in any way, regardless of the map. After which you have to either A: Hope you have already taken a picture of the monster to go down the evidence route which is not very fun when there is no risk of the monster or B: spend the time scouring the map for him several times.

Date 2024-07-15 Playtime 98h 17m Rec Positive Avis positif : En tant que joueur, BIGFOOT offre une expérience de survie et de chasse unique et intense. Le concept du jeu est captivant : traquer une créature légendaire tout en survivant aux dangers de la forêt crée une atmosphère de tension et d'excitation constante.  Le jeu est particulièrement bien réussi en termes d'ambiance. Les environnements sont détaillés et immersifs, avec une forêt dense et sombre qui ajoute au suspense. Les effets sonores, tels que les cris lointains de Bigfoot, les bruits de la faune et les craquements de branches, contribuent à créer une atmosphère effrayante et immersive.  Le gameplay en multijoueur est un atout majeur de BIGFOOT. Jouer avec des amis et coordonner les efforts pour traquer Bigfoot est extrêmement amusant. Chaque joueur peut choisir un rôle spécifique, comme un tireur d'élite ou un spécialiste des pièges, ce qui encourage la coopération et la stratégie en équipe.  La possibilité de jouer en tant que Bigfoot ajoute une dimension unique au jeu. En prenant le rôle de la créature, vous pouvez utiliser divers pouvoirs pour traquer et éliminer les chasseurs, ce qui offre une perspective totalement différente et enrichit la rejouabilité du jeu.  Les développeurs de BIGFOOT ont montré un engagement constant envers l'amélioration du jeu. Des mises à jour régulières ajoutent de nouvelles fonctionnalités, améliorent la jouabilité et corrigent les bugs, ce qui montre qu'ils écoutent les retours des joueurs et travaillent activement pour améliorer l'expérience de jeu.  En résumé, BIGFOOT est un jeu de survie multijoueur immersif et excitant qui excelle par son ambiance, son gameplay coopératif et son concept unique. C'est un excellent choix pour ceux qui aiment les jeux de chasse et de survie avec une touche de légende urbaine.  Avis négatif : En tant que joueur, BIGFOOT présente également quelques inconvénients qui peuvent affecter l'expérience de jeu. L'un des principaux problèmes est le manque de diversité dans les missions et les objectifs. Une fois que vous avez traqué Bigfoot plusieurs fois, le gameplay peut devenir répétitif. Des objectifs supplémentaires ou des missions variées auraient pu ajouter plus de profondeur et de rejouabilité.  Les performances du jeu peuvent être inégales. Certains joueurs ont signalé des problèmes de framerate et des bugs graphiques, surtout dans les environnements plus denses. Ces problèmes techniques peuvent perturber l'immersion et rendre certaines sessions de jeu frustrantes.  Le matchmaking en ligne peut parfois être un problème. Trouver une partie avec des joueurs aléatoires peut prendre du temps, et il n'est pas rare de tomber sur des joueurs qui ne prennent pas le jeu au sérieux, ce qui peut nuire à l'expérience de ceux qui cherchent une partie plus immersive et stratégique.  La courbe d'apprentissage pour jouer efficacement en tant que Bigfoot peut être raide. Les joueurs novices peuvent trouver difficile de comprendre comment utiliser les pouvoirs de Bigfoot efficacement contre des chasseurs expérimentés. Un tutoriel plus détaillé ou un mode de pratique aurait pu aider à surmonter cet obstacle.  Le contenu actuel du jeu peut sembler limité pour certains joueurs. Bien que les développeurs ajoutent régulièrement de nouvelles fonctionnalités, les cartes et les options de personnalisation restent relativement restreintes. Plus de variété dans les environnements de jeu et les options de personnalisation des personnages aurait pu enrichir l'expérience globale.  En conclusion, BIGFOOT est un jeu de survie multijoueur intrigant et atmosphérique, mais qui peut être limité par son manque de diversité dans les missions, des problèmes de performance et de matchmaking, et une courbe d'apprentissage abrupte pour les nouveaux joueurs. Pour ceux qui apprécient les jeux de chasse et de survie avec une ambiance effrayante, c'est une expérience intéressante, mais il pourrait nécessiter des améliorations pour maintenir l'intérêt à long terme.

Date 2024-07-15 Playtime 401h 59m Rec Positive yeah it's pretty good I'd say  actual review: Since it's on sale right now, I'd recommend buying it. There are a few large bugs, but they can be temp-fixed and avoided easily (mainly to do with connecting to lobbies) if you check their Discord or Subreddit. Alternatively, you could wait until the Winter sale, since an update is slated to release around that time. Imo, the best experience is with friends. Start off with pve. Play until you can confidently beat bigfoot. Then try out pvp, either with friends or with a few randoms in a larger public lobby. If you don't really like it, you can go back to pve and set challenges for yourself, like beating bigfoot during night 2, or winning without the m4. Then again, I'm a bit biased towards pve. Another thing is that it's technically 5(ish) games in 1, since you can select different "betas" and play a couple past versions of the game. Mainly v1 and v3 are different, but v4 is very similar to v5 (current version) if you can't play with your friends on v5 due to the lobby bugs.

Date 2024-07-11 Playtime 578h 30m Rec Positive I've had the game since 2020, back then the game was called: Finding Bigfoot. It's a W horror game. But if you play it alone, it's not as fun as playing it with friends!
Date 2024-07-11 Playtime 15h 14m Rec Positive Clean good fun
Date 2024-07-10 Playtime 15h 39m Rec Negative "I came here to hunt Bigfoot, but it feels like Bigfoot is hunting me."  Bigfoot should be an intense, creepy survival experience. Instead, it’s more like a frustrating bug-ridden rage fest. You set up traps, prepare for an epic showdown, and then BAM—Bigfoot teleports out of nowhere, beats you into the ground, and vanishes before you even reload. Rinse and repeat, and suddenly, it feels like you’re being pranked.  And don’t even get me started on the bugs: items disappearing, AI doing whatever it wants, and glitches that make it feel like Bigfoot’s biggest weapon isn’t his strength, but the game’s broken mechanics.  Pros:  Fun concept—if it worked properly.  Bigfoot is terrifying... maybe too terrifying?  You'll develop a new appreciation for not being chased by mythical creatures.   Cons:  Bigfoot’s attack frequency feels like he’s out for revenge.  Bugs and glitches that make surviving nearly impossible.  "Stealth" isn’t an option when Bigfoot can apparently smell you from a mile away.   Final Thoughts: It’s a game about hunting Bigfoot, but it feels like I’m just being trolled by the game itself. 2/10, would recommend only if you enjoy pain and suffering.

Date 2024-07-08 Playtime 61h 46m Rec Positive The game is extremely well done. I remember when it was at the very beginning and not as mature as it is now. I recently got it and we now play with five people. Almost every day too because it's so much fun. Of course, something has to be done to prevent it from becoming monotonous at some point. But we still enjoy playing it every time and it's particularly fun, especially in larger groups without AI Killer. The thrill is a little higher.  Overall, I would say the game is definitely worth the money! I can only recommend giving it a try. Have fun hunting Bigfoot!
Date 2024-07-08 Playtime 74h 1m Rec Positive I have been able to enjoy this masterpiece of a horror survival game for 27 hours now and it has not only been fun but has touched my soul, which has been suffering for years because of this world, on a deep emotional level.

Date 2024-07-08 Playtime 2h 26m Rec Positive Review of Bigfoot on Steam: A Thrilling Masterpiece Rating: 10/10  I recently had the pleasure of diving into the immersive world of Bigfoot on Steam, and I must say, it was an exhilarating experience from start to finish. As someone who enjoys games that blend horror, survival, and adventure, Bigfoot hit all the right notes and exceeded my expectations in every way.  Gameplay and Mechanics  The gameplay in Bigfoot is superbly crafted, offering a perfect balance between survival and horror elements. You take on the role of a hunter searching for the legendary creature in the dense, foreboding forests. The mechanics are intuitive and well-thought-out, making the game accessible for new players while still providing depth for seasoned gamers. The controls are smooth, and the interface is user-friendly, allowing you to focus on the intense action and strategy required to track down Bigfoot.  Atmosphere and Graphics  One of the standout features of Bigfoot is its atmospheric design. The game’s graphics are stunning, with meticulously detailed environments that bring the forest to life. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add an extra layer of realism and challenge. Whether it's the eerie silence of the night, broken only by distant howls, or the rustling of leaves as you navigate through dense underbrush, the game creates a palpable sense of tension and immersion. The lighting effects are particularly impressive, enhancing the spooky, mysterious aura that pervades the game.  Sound Design and Music  The sound design in Bigfoot is another highlight that significantly contributes to the overall experience. The ambient sounds of the forest, from the chirping of crickets to the ominous growls of unseen creatures, are incredibly well done. The music is perfectly suited to the game’s theme, with haunting melodies and crescendos that elevate the suspense. The voice acting and creature sounds are also top-notch, adding to the sense of dread and urgency as you hunt or are hunted by Bigfoot.  Multiplayer Experience  While the single-player mode is engaging and challenging, Bigfoot truly shines in its multiplayer mode. Teaming up with friends to hunt down the elusive creature adds a cooperative element that enhances the thrill. Communication and teamwork are crucial, as each player’s actions can significantly impact the outcome of the hunt. The multiplayer mode is seamless, with minimal lag and easy matchmaking, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience.  Replayability  Bigfoot offers high replay value, thanks to its varied maps, dynamic AI, and different difficulty levels. Each playthrough feels unique, as Bigfoot’s behavior and tactics change, keeping you on your toes. The developers have also been active in releasing updates and new content, ensuring that the game remains fresh and exciting over time. The inclusion of different modes and challenges adds further depth, encouraging players to return and improve their skills.  Final Thoughts  In conclusion, Bigfoot on Steam is a masterpiece that delivers a thrilling and immersive gaming experience. From its stunning graphics and atmospheric sound design to its engaging gameplay and high replayability, every aspect of the game is crafted with care and precision. As a fan of horror and survival games, I found Bigfoot to be a perfect blend of both genres, providing hours of suspenseful and heart-pounding fun. I wholeheartedly give Bigfoot a 10/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for an unforgettable gaming adventure. Whether you're tracking the legendary creature solo or with friends, Bigfoot offers an experience that is as exciting as it is terrifying.

Date 2024-07-06 Playtime 4h 7m Rec Negative Played with a friend and got murdered quickly twice, but enjoyed the concept. 3rd time Bigfoot suddenly disappeared and we couldn't' find him nor was we being attacked... ended up giving up as we couldn't kill him.  Tried a solo play through, gathered everything i could, setup traps, bait, canisters... making noise to call bigfoot but he didn't attack.... fired up nightvision goggles to see him across a lake stuck against a rock... emptied all guns into him from across the lake and won. No incentive to play anymore so won't be touching it again until they add more and fix bigfoots clunky A.I.

Date 2024-07-05 Playtime 5h 19m Rec Negative Save your money, don't even buy it on sale.  This game is fun for 30 minutes and then it's extremely boring.  Even when playing against an AI bigfoot he barely attacks you.  When you get to play bigfoot it's extremely easy to find and kill your friends, making it too one-sided. This game has been out since 2017, is still in early access, and the last update was a skins update.  That should tell you everything you need to know.

Date 2024-07-05 Playtime 4h 49m Rec Negative Great concept and its fun to play. The game environment is very immersive. But the game is so poorly optimised and has numerous bugs. The lobby search bar doesn't work. Weapons disappear out of your hands when you switch items, very annoying when you are trying to switch weapons while shooting at Bigfoot. These are just a small handful of issues which I can recall. There's is definitely a lot more bugs that I wouldn't be aware of.
Date 2024-07-05 Playtime 5h 34m Rec Negative Interesting game concept but just way too buggy and optimised poorly. With some refinement, this game has a lot of potential but as of now it can just be very frustrating for new players trying to have fun

Date 2024-07-04 Playtime 6h 47m Rec Positive No clue how this game has been in Early Access for 8 years now, but It's still really fun. Singleplayer or Multiplayer (I prefer Multiplayer) it's a great experience.   I think it'd be really cool to add a DLC skin for the entire game, where instead of Bigfoot, you go to a popular Alien sighting location and hunt a hulking Alien, and instead of finding missing people clawed up, you'd find them lazer vaporized or something. And along with finding footprints and claw marks for evidence, you'd also find some high tech device or maybe even a wrecked space ship.

Date 2024-07-01 Playtime 4h 58m Rec Negative fun for about one game on each map, unless a bunch of ur friends get it, its boring. the AI is brain dead and repetitive. bigfoot is constantly getting stuck giving me free wins. if you want fun make sure its a player on bigfoot. only worth on sale

Date 2024-07-01 Playtime 5h 53m Rec Negative ive played 3 games overall with the rest spent on a black screen. it crashes all the time. its an absolute joke. disconnects constantly. blacks screens every game. its a mess of a game. updated my drivers. reinstalled. verified files. turned settings to low so it could MAYBE run. Ive spent more time on a menu screen then actually playing the game. nearly 20 quid to stare at a black screen for 6 hours is not really how i want to spend my free time. this is the biggest rip off of any steam game ive played and genuinely feel as if ive been robbed. just disgsuting over all.
Date 2024-07-01 Playtime 193h 57m Rec Positive it is super fun you get to make your game to battle bigfoot with or without your friends or random people you can also make your own name and lobby alone just friends or with random people.

Date 2024-06-28 Playtime 8h 13m Rec Negative the publix servers dont work
Date 2024-06-27 Playtime 263h 50m Rec Negative Ça fait longtemps que j'ai Bigfoot et le jeu a beaucoup évoluer depuis ses débuts (c'est clairement plus la même histoire comparé à ses débuts ou c'était plus un jeu troll). Cependant les devs ont pas lâché l'affaire comparé à plein d'autres jeux indés de ce style. La mise à jour 4.0 fut une véritable révolution. Le jeu était devenu franchement jolie pour un jeu fait par 3 personnes. Ils ont rajouté la possibilité de jouer Bigfoot contre des joueurs et plein d'autre choses (actuellement le jeu possède 4 cartes différentes et franchement sympa) Même si le jeu conservait des défauts (IA bof bof pour le pve et équilibrage pas terrible pour le pvp) mais le jeu restait bon et c'est des problèmes qu'ils peuvent résoudre avec un peu de temps. Mais ils ne l'ont pas fait. Au lieu de ce focaliser sur résoudre les problèmes et rajouter plus de contenu. Ils ont préféré faire passé le jeu sur l'unreal engine 5 ce qui leur à presque 1 ans alors que graphiquement le jeu durant la 4.0 était déjà bien. La sortie de la version unreal engine 5 fut un désastre. le jeu était désormais extrêmement mal optimisé BOURRER de bug. Il n'était même pas spécialement plus jolie (à l'exception de tous ce qui est lié à la lumière) et ils ont voulu sortir le jeu sur Epic Games avec tous ce que ça implique.... depuis cette maj le jeu est littéralement injouable car de nouveaux bugs sont apparus comme par exemple un qui fait bugger les lobby (globalement les lobby dont la partie sont déjà fini ou en cour ne disparaisse pas de la liste et si vous en rejoignez un vous êtes coincer dans le temps de chargement et vous aller devoir alt f4 et il n'y a aucun moyen de savoir quels sont les lobby bugger et ceux qui ne le sont pas). Ce bug rend extrêmement compliqué de trouver une partie (avec en plus le fait que les joueurs ont lâchés le jeu c'est encore pire) depuis un an les développeur sont en silence radio. Ils sont encore entrain de travailler sur le jeu (selon leur dire sur le discord du jeu) mais on ne sait absolument pas ce qu'il fabrique. dans l'état actuel du jeu il ne vaut malheureusement pas le coup (en grand partie car il est presque injouable à cause de certain bug) je changerais mon avis si une update arrive un jour et résous les problèmes du jeu car le jeu était franchement excellent avant cette désastreuse update.

Date 2024-06-24 Playtime 5h 30m Rec Positive funny shenanigans. 10/10
Date 2024-06-24 Playtime 21h 44m Rec Negative So far only played two rounds of the game 1st round was pretty fun until Big Foot, Command grabbed me through the wall and insta-killed me by chain grabbing. Ended up dying on night 4 other than the command grab it was pretty fun. 2nd Round: He screamed, he hollered, and made his presence known by hitting the trees with that thunk sound but 11 nights in and all but a picture of the big foot himself and two tree markings nothing, not even a emptying a full clip into the open air, leaving the lights, radio, and TV on, nothing. Got bored after not seeing the big man himself. Hopefully it's a glitched round and nothing else so Thumbs down until fixed. Might try it again in the future until then it's a No for Me.  EDIT 1: Bigfoot as a playable character is broken due to being able to do damage through solid walls, which in turn can make you kill the survivors effortlessly. Playing as Survivors is difficult due to how sparse items are which makes you want to do the Second Win Condition however the maps are big and there is easily missable clues to locate bodies and Bigfoot being able to TPK your entire team on night 1 is laughable. So far the game is unbalanced mess which kills any enjoyment I have for this game.  I will Say the Game has potential if given time but for now still No for me
Date 2024-06-24 Playtime 7h 32m Rec Negative Do NOT buy this game. It's not worth the money. You can rarely find the asssquatch in this cheeks game. I do not recommend to anyone.

Date 2024-06-24 Playtime 10h 49m Rec Negative The game gets laggy and unstable. The AI Bigfoot gets stuck and it turns into a walking sim trying to find him. When we do eventually find him, he is stuck forever and we kill him for free without any difficulty. We tried much more times only to get the same aftermath. Its fun for a little then it just gets boring trying to find him. Pvp is another story, the Bigfoot is way too overpowered and a lot more laggy. To sum it all up its not fun and laggy.
Date 2024-06-23 Playtime 20h 54m Rec Positive i love getting chased by a big black monkey 
Date 2024-06-23 Playtime 0h 54m Rec Positive d
Date 2024-06-23 Playtime 20h 40m Rec Positive Highly recommend this game most fun when playing multiplayer but still fun in solo. has some glitches with the weapon wheel and hot bar but big foot has some major glitches including getting stuck and one tapping you but between the cheap price and fun u have playing the occasional glitch pays off.
Date 2024-06-23 Playtime 1h 36m Rec Negative My two friends and I played this and man it was boring, Bigfoot knows exacltly where the humans are all the time and can kill a human i 3 hits. We on the other hand,  emptied all our ammo on bigfoot and nothing happend.   Looks great but but gameplay is a turd.

Date 2024-06-21 Playtime 1h 17m Rec Negative Ummm dont ever buy this, it looks very fun when youtubers play it or others but trust me its bad. Sorry yall who likes it. Way too hard when bigfoot attacks. And i think mines glitched too ive tried running around for like 15 minutes, and NO BIGFOOT, other times it just shows up constantly. Bad game i wont recommend it just a little bit!. And no i know i said mines properly glitched, and all im saying would be fake cause its glitched, still ive seen other people such as my dad who tried it too, HE CONSTANTLY GOT ATTACKED LIKE EVERY 2 MINUTTES.

Ive had alot of fun memories in Bigfoot like when bigfoot had a heart attack and died infront of us LOL. This game gives you quite a few scares and is super fun to explore! I cant wait to see where it goes further! Overall this is a super fun game to play with friends for some good laughs or solo for some good scares!

Date 2024-06-17 Playtime 7h 29m Rec Positive Bigfoot is a thrilling and engaging survival horror game that successfully taps into the mystery of its legendary namesake. Its strengths lie in its atmospheric presentation, cooperative gameplay, and the sheer tension of tracking a powerful and cunning predator. While it has some areas that could benefit from further polish and depth, it stands out as a compelling choice for fans of survival horror and adventure games. Whether playing with friends or braving the wilderness alone, Bigfoot offers an exhilarating and nerve-wracking experience that keeps players coming back for more. -me

Date 2024-06-14 Playtime 10h 16m Rec Negative Needs balanced like crazy especially for 20 dollars. Guns do no damage and it's better to just knife than to use the pistol. Bigfoot regenerating health is garbage with the already tank build. When I play with friends Bigfoot always wins, the humans stand 0% chance unless you get stuck in the water or rock collision.   Stonehenge is not in the game yet? Even on high loot we get ammo starved since once again, the gun damage is so little. The achievements don't activate either despite winning multiple times as Bigfoot. Starts off scary and then just becomes a waiting simulator.   All DLC is cashgrab and does nothing to enhance the game sadly. Only the Bigfoot skins are noticeable.  100% wait for a sale to play this rage game with your friends.  Almost all the hints from other players is "cheese the AI" besides the troll "get gud"

Date 2024-06-13 Playtime 103h 26m Rec Positive I was sitting in my bed rizzing up my 11 year old cousin duke dennis in ohio style, when i realized i wanted to hunt bigfoot. I went on my school computer and downloaded this game just to get bent over and get ultimate backshots fom george floyd. I would reccomend its like a addiction...I just cant stop. When i sleep all i hear is me shouting "I cant breathe" as bigfoot (george floyd) gets his revenge on me.

Date 2024-06-12 Playtime 5h 35m Rec Positive gud gam
Date 2024-06-12 Playtime 182h 12m Rec Positive This game is honestly one of my favorite horror games that I have ever played.  Surprisingly re-playable, and features many creative tactics and strategies for both hunters and Bigfoot himself. Can be and usually is very tense whenever Bigfoot shows up, or even the uneasy feeling hunters may get since he can appear and vanish in the blink of an eye, all without any teleportation! Playing as the hunters is intense and sometimes even stressful, in a good way. You are forced to scavenge from the national parks you visit for any kind of supplies you can find, from ammunition, weapons, gadgets, and makeshift explosives to powerful tools such as military-grade firearms and manually detonated dynamite sticks. The hunters' main strength comes from their ability to ambush Bigfoot when he attacks, as well as working in a team of up to four players to coordinate efforts to hunt the Sasquatch down. An experienced team of hunters is capable of 100% locking down Bigfoot for a LONG time, potentially killing him in a single night if they have the resources to do so. Although this is quite powerful, maybe even borderline needing a nerf, it is up to Bigfoot to attempt to force them to hunt him down or outsmart their ambushing tactics when he is player-controlled. Hunters can win by hunting down Bigfoot the old fashioned way, or taking a more passive approach by photographing evidence such as footprints, claw marks around the environment, victims of his attacks, and a picture of Bigfoot himself. Bigfoot has a manner of ways to interact with hunters, from mauling them and slashing at them, a tree-knocking ability to scare or throw off his own position, a rage mode which decreases his stamina consumption, and special charging and choke slam attacks, as well as the previously mentioned mauling which locks hunters in an animation for precarious amounts of damage to be dealt. He can also set traps, which make the same tree knocking sound, allowing for Bigfoot to make hunters uncertain as to whether he is simply drawing their attention or booby-trapping the area. Additionally, the AI Bigfoot is quite fearsome and can be pretty scary and clever at times, having synced up attacks on me and my friends to line up with areas he has already rigged with traps, snagging us during the chaos using his snares and making said attacks much more intense than they would be if the AI was dumber. Despite this, the AI could use some improvements, such as being less aggressive and more evasive some nights to add another level of unpredictability, or being more cautious when at low health. However, for the most part, The AI is notable more intelligent than average as far as I can tell. Meanwhile, playing as Bigfoot can provide a fresh experience from playing as a hunter. You can choose to attack immediately and pressure hunters while both teams are still weak, or you can travel around the map and stay evasive, eating food to expand your stamina bar and becoming stronger. Bigfoot can also uproot various signs and pick up objects like shovels, guitars, and spears to beat and spear hunters with. Additionally, he used to be able to jump up onto buildings for an additional level of stealth and ambush potential, although this feature has been removed, and it is missed. However, Bigfoot is still very fun to play as, even if he is stun-locked a bit too easily. You can charge into battle and brutishly beat down the hunters before fleeing, or you can attempt to pick them off by waiting for them to separate or attacking them at range with thrown objects and special attacks. Unfortunately, in a PVP context, the game feels unbalanced in some areas. As mentioned earlier in this review, Bigfoot is easily stun-locked, to the point that it may need a nerf. It probably does need a nerf, in reality. Bigfoot also has a slam attack which takes more energy but makes him knock down players specifically when a player is playing as him. This attack is easily spam-able and, due to the small amount of energy it takes, it can stunlock a lone hunter and does not feel very fair from either the attacking nor the receiving end. There is also a major exploit not many people know about where Bigfoot, when player controlled, is able to crouch and phase through doors without destroying them. That one needs to be fixed as soon as possible.  Overall, the game is VERY fun in my opinion and view even if slightly flawed. As of writing, I have sank slightly over 140 hours into the game, and would do so again ten times over if only I was able to consistently find matches. Highly recommend the game to anyone who is a fan of asymmetrical PVP, co-op, or just horror in general, even if they only play it a few times.  8/10
Date 2024-06-11 Playtime 122h 52m Rec Positive best game ever some jumpscares but the ice map village was hard to find but when u play that map for like 8 times u know the way to it up the road near the ski lift but sometimes bigfoot will keep killing u even when u heal he won't sometimes leave u alone but all in all good game  5 out of 5.

Date 2024-06-07 Playtime 29h 58m Rec Negative I'm not even kidding you have to spend literal hours on this game just to get flipped over and pegged repeatedly by some fat piece of horse trash covered in a layer of dirty brown (or white if your on the winter park map) fur. You literally only see him twice a game and by the second time you and your friends have all been killed by him. You can find totems to revive them, but only once. Trying to find totems is like trying to find a grain of salt in a desert, and it adds an extra hour to the already sixteen hour long games. That's the worst part, the games take 20 hours to complete, the AI for Bigfoot could not be more stupid, and when you die you might as well leave because its a better way to spend your time then searching for ONE TOTEM in the vast maps that span for eons to no eval, its just trees, trees, bear, tree. If you want to have fun, DO NOT PLAY THIS WITH YOUR FRIENDS.
Date 2024-06-07 Playtime 39h 31m Rec Negative This is the worst game I've ever played bigfoot is impossible to kill even on the easiest difficulty. I die OFF SPAWN NIGHT 0 then I have to wait for an HOUR just for my friends to scour every inch of this fat laggy broken terrible map for them to find 4 totems and the moment they do this hairy ass fat ass monkey has the f*cking audacity to kill me INSTANTLY for 10 SECONDS AFTER COMING BACK. EVERY OTHER TIME I PLAY THIS TERRIBLE GAME HE'S AS ELUSIVE AS MY FATHER EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NEVER MADE MORE SOUND IN MY LIFE. THIS IS THE STUPIDEST GAME NOTHING WORKS THE AI IS TERRIBLE, THE TEXTURES ARE TERRIBLE, THE MECHANICS ARE TERRIBLE, EVERY SINGLE THING ABOUT THE GAME IS THE WORST EVER. IF I SPENT ONE GAMES WORTH OF TIME (2 HOURS MINIMUM) ON ANY CODING WEBSITE I COULD MAKE A GAME INFINITELY BETTER THAN THIS PIECE OF SH*T. THE DEVS HAVEN'T UPDATED IT IN YEARS AND WHEN THEY FINALLY THEY JUST MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE AND THE WORST GAME EVER -1000000/10 HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU ENJOY LIVING, HAVING FUN, GENERALLY ENJOYING PLAYING GAMES, OR JUST WANNA PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS. EVERY TIME I LOAD UP THIS GOD DAMN GAME I THINK ITS GONNA BE BETTER AND THE MOMENT I JOIN A GAME IT'S NOT AND I WOULD RATHER SWALLOW A DIRTY RAG THAT'S BEEN USED TO CLEAN UP VOMIT THAN CONTINUE PLAYING THIS GOD FORSAKEN GAME.

I have been trying to play with some friends for a few months, but every time, something doesn't work.  Here are some examples:  1. It has issues connecting to their server on some pc's (even on the same LAN network as other pc's). 2. Sometimes you fall out of the map when loading in. 3. Bigfoot get stuck on the map a lot. -Sometimes that makes it easy to win, other times you can't win! 4. Sometimes you get stuck under Bigfoot and you just get beaten to death and can't escape. 5. And all my achievements get reset after I launch the game a few times.  Overall, can't recommend this game...

Date 2024-05-19 Playtime 18h 45m Rec Negative The game is very much buggy, I don't understand how the developers can let this happen and not do anything about it, Bigfoot is just wandering around the map for an hour and I absolutely can't find him, or randomly dropping to 10HP which means I die, out of nowhere. and other more bugs like that. :/  i personally dont recommend buying it, for atleast now. last PATCH has been 7 months ago. devs wake up please.  i can say i was expecting better game than this glitchy walking simulator when bigfoot is playing hide & seek with you.

Date 2024-05-17 Playtime 4h 17m Rec Positive Fun but I will say it does not have much replay ability mainly due to the fact you can just sit on a bridge and trap bigfoot in one spot pretty much the whole game or zipline up and down on him the whole time it gets boring after 15ish minute of doing the same thing bigfoot has almost no challenge which gives little replay ability so I do hope they add a harder mode or make his ai more difficult but it was fun for the first couple hours

This game was a good buy if you wanna play with friends and have a good time.

Date 2024-05-04 Playtime 28h 28m Rec Negative The graphics are okay and the fps is always so low they need to fix it also when i shoot the BIGFOOT he kills me instantly. But when i'm on the ground you cant heel or do anything like there is no point in the game at all. Then here goes the lag man. 10/10 game when you get stuck in the water for doing nothing at all. And then when you're drowning in the water you cant jump at all even if the water level is so dang low. Also you need to put the graphics on super low so you get higher FPS when playing. And also they barely give you any ammo and heels to survive in the game. But after all if you try to get an achievement in the game it wont even count it because it sucks. then in the whole game they don't give you enough time in the day like there is no day light at all bro. Honestly wouldn't even pay money for this game is the quality is horrible and the setting is bad, no ammo, almost no heals, and BIGFOOT does the most damage where you cant even heel from fully.

Date 2024-05-01 Playtime 5h 27m Rec Negative NON 
Date 2024-05-01 Playtime 5h 45m Rec Positive Bigfoot is a fun game for what it is. The gameplay itself is simple but not too simple. There's enough going on that you can at least somewhat master certain mechanics. The vibe that the game sets for itself never falters. Bigfoot is always a very real and present threat. As are other animals in game. The day-night cycle does a lot for this as well. Making nightfall feel very imposing, especially if you've made a lot of progress. Fighting Bigfoot is always a fun time. It doesn't take a million years to whittle its health away, nor does it just disappear when you attack it. Jumping in with friends is always a fun experience. I would say that this is a game best experienced with others.   As far as bugs go, there are plenty. Only one though is particularly bad. This is a bug on maps with lakes or other large bodies of deep water. Bigfoot will run after being found or fought off. If it does this near a lake then its AI will recognize the bottom of the lake as a walk-able space. It'll then get stuck after realizing that it shouldn't be where it is. Other bugs are pretty small. Though I haven't play tested enough to really find every single one. Just know that the lake maps could soft lock you and to expect other bugs here and there. Otherwise, it's a perfectly fine game.

Date 2024-04-29 Playtime 6h 13m Rec Negative The game is fun at first but gets kind of boring after you know how to kill Bigfoot efficiently. There should be an option to actually capture him. I played with my cousin on three maps but we found it too repetitively to try another map. We did put max loot because there is barely any loot to be found. We tried max HP and damage output and was able to beat Bigfoot in an hour as well.   Hopefully, when it's out of EA, it'll be more diverse in gameplay.

Date 2024-04-27 Playtime 205h 24m Rec Positive Disclaimer, this does slander the multiplayer of the current version, AI is for the most part fine.   The game is great! Awesome action and great thrill and blast to play with friends. However the mechanics in 5.1.1 version make multiplayer unplayable. From weapons and items taking time to load, to health kits gradually healing allowing Bigfoot to stun lock players on the ground, multiplayer needs reworked. Back in 4.0 versions of the game, weapons had very little load in time, placing items was smooth, and no perma stun by health kits nonsense. Many issues need to be hammered out in the 5.1.1 update to fix multiplayer.   If you want to play this game with one of your friends as Bigfoot, uninstall, go into betas, and install the 2021 version of the game. It will be better experience. AI is fine in the current version, but the 'blood lust' mechanic of Bigfoot is too aggressive and will kill all players who get downed.

Date 2024-04-23 Playtime 61h 12m Rec Positive it is verry fun graphics are insane but challangeing
Date 2024-04-23 Playtime 17h 46m Rec Positive A game made by a bunch of DJ's who just wanted a reason to publish their music (not actually but the music on the speakers SLAPS). Great game for Co-op, its nice to be able to change bigfoot's difficulty for the players who are better at playing him. the AI bigfoot isn't hard with 4 people but is fairly challenging for just 2.

Date 2024-04-21 Playtime 18h 35m Rec Positive El juego tiene una inmersión brutal, sientes que estás en el bosque i sientes la tensión en la noche con el miedo de que en cualquier momento Bigfoot aparezca. Tiene diferentes mapas y lo mejor de todo es que también puedes jugar con Bigfoot y espantar a tus amigos. El juego no es perfecto (algunos bugs) pero se sigue actualizando y hay un botón de feedback para reportar cualquier irregularidad. Lo recomiendo 100% y más sabiendo que es una compañia pequeña Ucraniana que ha tenido que emigrar para poder continuar con el desarrollo del videojuego.

Date 2024-04-20 Playtime 3h 1m Rec Positive The game was fun to play with my step nephew, we only saw Big Foot 1 time though and it was through CCTV we played for hours and never saw him again in that game, the next game we saw him and I ended up dying he did show up more freq so I'm assuming the AI broke or something In the first game but it was very fun even if we didn't see him HE KEPT GETTING HIT BY TREE TRAPS BIG FOOT PLACED It was very funny

Date 2024-04-17 Playtime 11h 46m Rec Positive Je vous conseil ce jeu car il est très réaliste, c'est un jeu plus tôt horreur qui est très sympa a jouer a plusieurs. j'y est joué avec un pote on a adoré juste le jeu est très compliquer a finir a deux c'est pour sa que je vous conseil d'être trois ou quatre pour le finir. il y a plein de différente maps trop cool et très vaste, ma préférer et la hivernal car j'ai l'impression qu'il y a plus de loot. Les partit dure longent comme j'aime. Bigfoot gagne des pv en mangent des animaux pour regagner de la vie cela permet de rendre le jeu plus complique. Comme je l'ai dit tout a l'heur je prend la maps hivernal car je trouve plus de loot justement dans ce jeu il y a pas beaucoup de loot donc c'est encore plus compliquer de gagner et j'adore sa.

Date 2024-04-14 Playtime 0h 19m Rec Negative bed
Date 2024-04-14 Playtime 23h 11m Rec Positive Found a glitch in the game where Bigfoot will get stuck somewhere. He got stuck in a pond and we had to find him. But it took well over an hour before we realized there was something wrong and hunted him down. Knowing this happens now, I think this is an ongoing issue with the game and has happened before. Otherwise really great game to play with friends.
Date 2024-04-14 Playtime 10h 9m Rec Positive The atmosphere combined with the sound effects is done very well to the point I get creeped out most of the night. Bigfoot feels very threatening and difficult to kill as it should be. However my big problem with the game is the vs mode as it's extremely unfair and boring to play. If you're Bigfoot it is too easy to kill all players. This is why the best way to play the game is co-op with an AI bigfoot.

It's really fun and it can make you come up with strategy's to kill the Bigfoot, i haven't really played it with other people but from what i have seen with YouTuber's like Markiplier it makes you and whom ever your playing with to try to work together.

Date 2024-04-07 Playtime 5h 38m Rec Negative This game is just so buggy it isn't any fun. The premise is stupidly funny but bugs ruin the experience. I just spent an hour playing the game and bigfoot simply never showed up. Felt like a real bigfoot documentary.  Also, the game is just completely unbalanced. If you play as bigfoot you basically WILL kill the humans because you're stupid OP. Bigfoot can jump so high. If Bigfoot is AI then you just stand by a zipline and slowly kill it. This is ridiculous. I strongly do not recommend this turd

Date 2024-04-02 Playtime 3h 43m Rec Negative This game is a cool concept. Just played for a couple hours with my cousin, graphics are great and everything.  However, we spent several nights trying to find bigfoot and could not find him to save our lives. Eventually we found him stuck which was really disappointing, so we killed him there. Also the ending was a bit disappointing as well. You just drive home in the RV, that's it. I was thinking like a newspaper clipping talking about the discovery of bigfoot, but nothing. I suppose the game is still in Early Access but, as for now that's my thoughts on the game. With the stuck glitch I don't plan on playing again as for now.

Date 2024-04-01 Playtime 30h 42m Rec Positive Absolutely love this game, had this since beta and love how they have changed the whole aspect of the game! im in love of how you and your friends can go out and have an adventure whether it be hunting animals for more meat or having a look at the games fantastic scenery to turning around and seeing a big hairy rabid beast charging towards you full speed leaving you in shock as your lovely experience with nature took more than a slight turn as you see your friend getting thrown into the air and slammed like a rag doll as the hairy michelin beast growls and snarls leaving you to just watch your friend get mauled. if David Attenborough was wondering through the games mysterious land im sure he would make a spectacular episode.

Date 2024-03-29 Playtime 0h 59m Rec Negative Reviews make it seem nice, but in the hour I owned the game I never got to play.   There are no official servers or matchmaking for the game.  The player lobbies are all private and the open ones never get more than two players and won't launch, IF you can even connect to the lobby at all. It took a good 10 minutes just to get the game to display correctly as it had a fit with trying to go full screen.  If you get it free or less than $10 give a shot if you're feeling lucky, I'd stay away and just play predator hunting grounds.

Date 2024-03-29 Playtime 7h 59m Rec Positive very exciting/thrilling game that from my experience has few bugs
Date 2024-03-29 Playtime 4h 36m Rec Negative This game was released in 2017 and is in the most pathetic state I've ever seen a game in that's been out for 7 years, it hasn't been updated in over 4 months, and in it's reviews (Outside of the copies that weren't marked as being free and are just there to boost the review score) most people state that it's borderline unplayable abandon ware that they cannot even load into.  Saying this game is held together with duct tape and hopes and dreams is an understatement. 60% of the time you can't find a game, 60% of the time when you can, it freezes upon loading, then if you by some miracle happen to load into a game, don't, expect to see Bigfoot, because he will just get stuck on some random geometry and you'll be wandering for the next 2 hours trying to find him clinging to some rock 50 feet in the air.  I'd also like to comment down here that the devs of this game according to the reviews are extremely abusive, and down right disrespectful to anyone that speaks up against their game, it's actually pathetic. There's multiple reviews and posts about the devs personally messaging people who point out the game is in a problem state, just to abuse them or try blackmail them.  (And everytime this review is removed, it will be re-posted, since apparently the devs do that too)  (Oh and if you end up finishing a match, and it takes you more than the 2 hours of the refund period, good luck, because apparently, there's nothing wrong with the game)

Date 2024-03-26 Playtime 120h 1m Rec Negative I rareley comment games, but here I have to. Basicly the Idea of the game is great and made me and some friends to buy it. But soon we faced the truth:  - The game was never completed, bugs, glitches and such things all around in the game. - Basic things (!!) like 'droping items' are not possible (!!) - if your inventory is full... well, good luck then. - Half of the Gamers are not able to start the game because of some unknown and never fixed bug (check the forum, you wont belive it) - and two of my friends were part of them (we all have high-end gaming PCs)  ... and the worst: KI - Bigfoot gets STUCK in the game SO OFTEN (in 80% of games played) that the last fun of the game is taken away - since you never know if he is just not hunting because of tactical reasons, or he is not hunting because he got stuck somewhere on the map. And. If he got stuck, it will take 2hrs (real life time)  for 3 ppl to find him (just saying).  And now, you tell me - will you pay 20 Bucks for this "great" game? Or even just 1 $ ?? Take a minute to think about it.

Date 2024-03-23 Playtime 2h 8m Rec Negative DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! This game`s worse than Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection. So many bugs, unkillable Bigfoot (if a real player plays as him), weapons on the map are practically non-existent. All I can say is: Don't buy this game, it's an alpha version of a game that could be good, but now it s*cks.

Date 2024-03-21 Playtime 40h 17m Rec Positive I like bigfoot
Date 2024-03-21 Playtime 17h 28m Rec Negative Normally I do longer winded reviews, but this games just flat out unfinished. Unless it's on sale I would not purchase this game for full price. My score currently is a 3/10. Now, here's the list of bugs, glitches, and overall game problems that occurred between me and 3 other friends.  An X=how many times this bug/glitch occurred.  Fallen through the map X-3 (Normally in caves) Bigfoot got stuck on an object and couldn't move X-7 (Often stuck forever unless able to grab player) Bigfoot fell through the map X-1 (Seen when we found him stuck between a bolder and the lake and simply went through the rock in front of him and out of the map)  Guns not shooting X-2 (Maybe it thinks we don't have ammo but we have over 40 rounds and the gun is loaded?) Not able to pick up items X-17(Happens most frequently with random melee weapons and once a rifle out of a safe)  Game crashes X-0 (Did great on this end so far) No music from radio X-2 (I've shot a radio before and it takes no damage so maybe they just don't work on certain maps) Unable to reload X-4 (Between me and 2 friends, normally with the regular rifle)  Map load errors X-1 (A house was obviously there because all the furniture spawned but the house itself didn't, big glitch)  Unable to kill deer X-3 (Some deer take a couple rounds and fall, others have taken 30 rounds and not moved or reacted) Visual errors X-1 (One player loaded in with their head missing, hysterical)  Unable to die X-1 (My characters body was broken on the floor and I had 0 health but no death message was played, I couldn't get up, and my team couldn't revive me. Resulted in a full restart) House doors broken X-4 (Looks closed and can't be opened, but can be walked through....weird...) Broken traps X-1 (My friend was able to pick up a broken bear trap and reuse it, maybe a graphical error idk)  Broken achievements (Some achievements statuses don't move on any map or mode, may be personal issue)  Sent flying into sky after colliding with sign pole thrown by Bigfoot X-1 (Rag doll/collision issue most likely, died from the fall)  Game over not playing X-1 (We all were dead but the game didn't end) Issues with ambiance not playing like animal sounds or gun shots X-3 (Sometimes audio breaks when starting game)   For the final bug it may be my favorite we found in the entire game which is everyone suddenly falling through the floor in a cave and dying, led to horrendous laughter during end game cut scene  Now does this mean the game can get better, of course! But for now it's just too broken to consistently play matches. Will return if game continues to update

Date 2024-03-21 Playtime 23h 11m Rec Positive THe best gun video game ever
Date 2024-03-21 Playtime 9h 8m Rec Positive ihan jees 
Date 2024-03-21 Playtime 9h 34m Rec Positive This game is great and can be a blast with friends! There are a lot of places to explore and the sense of dread you get from Bigfoot stalking you is intense. The visuals are right where they need to be, I don't feel that a boost in graphical fidelity would bolster the game that much compared to similar quick-play horror games. The music does its job by keeping a constant sense of urgency and alarms you when Bigfoot is near.   I played a while ago (before update 5.0) and then recently came back to the game. It appears the progression has been removed from the game for some time now. It does make it hard to come back to this game without a sense of purpose. There are only so many times that you can rinse and repeat. I would love to see the updates to this game start again or at least some notes as to what is being actively worked on.  I am not writing this game off yet, I hold out hope that the developers can find the time to make some meaningful changes to the game. For now, I would give this experience a 6/10. I hope to revisit and change this score.

Date 2024-03-17 Playtime 11h 11m Rec Negative Currently, the game is a buggy mess that is nearly unplayable. Bigfoot gets stuck constantly which requires you to find where he's stuck or start a new game. Achievements don't unlock either which ruins the replayability for me. I definitely don't recommend this game in it's current state.

Date 2024-03-12 Playtime 9h 7m Rec Positive Not a bad game, been playing it off and on with a group over the years fun times can be had.  game still needs work, had a session where we made no much noise/activity to attract the monkey he just afk'ed.  He does get stuck and he does take his sweet time sometimes. Overall can be fun if you work through some of the AI issues. Also big frame issues if I don't look down.

Date 2024-03-08 Playtime 15h 6m Rec Positive This game has come a long way. I've had this game for a couple of years and is great to play solo or with friends. Is a great balance between a mystery thriller, survival and horror game in a way if following the story of each map. I wont go into detail about as to not spoil the game. But if you enjoy hunting something that hunts you back it is the game for you. Yes I recommend this game to anyone. i hope we continue to get updates and and new features.

Date 2024-03-07 Playtime 2h 22m Rec Positive thank you mr clear for buying me this game but we only played once and never played it again. scary game tho
Date 2024-03-07 Playtime 93h 39m Rec Positive There are some spots on different maps where bigfoot gets stuck after some time and then you can kill him too easy. Thats one of the aspects that you should fix so the players can have a better experience of your game. And also you should make the ai of bigfoot better so the game would be more difficult and exciting, because when you play it for like 25 hours then you already know the different strats and so i think it is to easy. So please ad something that makes it more intresting for better players. And also PLEASE bring back the old level system so all the players have a way to go and grind a bit for some cosmetics. For example Emots, different skins (not only for bigfoot also for the other playable caracters) and wapeon skins. That would make your game way way better. But all in all a very solid game i recommend it to you.
Date 2024-03-07 Playtime 39h 38m Rec Positive The game is great. It's fun, it's scary at times and it looks fantastic. It works amazingly well with friends. There are only a few bugs here and there, mainly on the newer maps, but that's all. It would be great to get new maps more often, perhaps even randomly generated maps.
Date 2024-03-07 Playtime 24h 6m Rec Negative    I bought this game for me and my cousin Von to play we both paid $20 for this game played it for like 2 weeks then it wont let us play co op we tried everything i do not recommend this game for nobody that wants to play with someone and have fun you gotta play it by your self after a week or two and it wont let me get a refund after i left multiple request.

Date 2024-03-07 Playtime 20h 44m Rec Negative This game WAS good. The recent updates have totally butchered this game's functionality and general experience. The UI looks the same except for the inventory, which looks much less polished. The game struggles to load weapons and tools sometimes, if at all, and the framerate randomly just plummets for no reason (everyone I've played with has also had this issue.) Not to mention Bigfoot himself being broken, either with his pathfinding leading him into a random lake, or with his attack patterns being so much more sporadic and unbalanced. Loading into a map sucks as well, as now we sit through a black screen trying to connect, get a split second of whatever story the map has, and then a laggy and broken cutscene of a camper van trying to drive. I hate to say that I don't recommend this game but it's progressed backwards.

Date 2024-03-06 Playtime 5h 5m Rec Positive yes
Date 2024-03-05 Playtime 12h 17m Rec Positive Fun game, good amount of challenge. Online community is not really there, 90% of the lobbies are closed private lobbies and the few open ones are hard to get into due to region settings to be the same to join a game. Worth 20 dollars for sure. Worth more if you got 3-5 friends to play with. its ok to duo but occasionally on some playthrus after spending 30-40 minutes in the game bigfoot will get stuck on something and kinda ruin the ending making you feel like you didn't earn it.

Date 2024-03-03 Playtime 1h 30m Rec Negative Dieses Spiel hat eine gute Grund Idee,wehr will nicht einmal bigfoot treffen und töten. Aber dieses spiel macht so gut wie alles falsch! Zum beispiel bietet dieses Game einen Ingame voice chat an dieser funktioniert so schlecht das es durch einfaches schreien in irl besser funktioniert als in diesem game in irl hört es wenigstens einer. Aber es wird abseits auch Garnichts erklärt oder wie man sich verhält gegen bigfoot wenn man ihm trifft hat man gar keine Chance. Die Grafik ist dafür recht in Ordnung aber wie kann es sein das dieses Game schon 7 Jahren in Eientwicklung ist und immer noch solche grundlegenden Sachen fehlen. Und sein wir uns mal ehrlich BIgfoot sieht wie aus dem KIng Kong Spiel geklaut aus nur mit leichter Überarbeitung.  Müsst ihr wissen mfg an die Entwickler die das Game vielleicht vor GTA 7 rausringen.

Date 2024-03-02 Playtime 35h 3m Rec Negative Okay so you you have fog and a few extra features with this Ross Park update. You also have everything else now looking like a pixelated nightmare. This game used to look and sound amazing! But now I cannot even hear Bigfoot's footsteps. I cannot even hear smashing sounds when he attacks the doors. Ah yes. And you removed windows in the doors, which makes it a whole lot harder to shoot through. This used to be a good game. What on earth did you do to it?

Date 2024-03-01 Playtime 52h 53m Rec Positive Very fun game! It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do. I have hours of fun replaying maps and knocking out objectives. There are still times Bigfoot gets stuck on a rock in a river but that is not terribly common. For the price it is an amazing time. I look forward to any DLC released.  Very excited for the new update!

Date 2024-02-27 Playtime 8h 26m Rec Positive    Me and my starry eyed little brother finally living our dreams of being Sasquatch investigators. BFRO gave us our own RV and equipment too. We drive out and hit the woods. Setup some cameras, fly the drone about, go for a hike. At night fall we decide it’s time to get serious we grab the rifle grab the Glock just in case and head out. Come across an abandoned set of cabins curiosity gets the better of me and I let myself In to see if there’s any goodies. I mean nobodies watching right? Suddenly I hear foot steps…   “I think there’s a squatch in these woods…”       there he is right outside lurking just out of the light. We’re stunned, amazed, elated. Then gone. Silence. We look out the door  the windows, nothing.   “Well fuck” I say then suddenly a hand bursts through the window behind me we scream in terror the squatch is trying to get me! I fumble for the camera but can’t get it out in time in an instant the Bigfoot has disappeared into the shadows I think he’s gone for good this time but before I know it he’s smashing down the door.   “Clever boy”   I try to snap a picture but he’s already upon us. He grabs me and lifts me above his head.   “Shooooot him, shooooooot him!” I scream and the Glock rings out but it’s too late he’s smashing me violently against the floorboards, finally he throws my broken body across the room. in desperation I reach for a flare gun on a shelf and fire it at him. He goes up in a blaze and runs in terror.       It’s personal now, the squatch drew first blood, the time for photos and footprint castings is over…      Now for my real review the game is super fun and well worth the money the only real issue is the PVE the squatch is far too aggressive and not nearly elusive enough. He actively hunts you at night and it just turns into a slaughter. in my opinion it should be a lot harder to find him and his attacks should be much more sporadic and somewhat more rare. Every PVE match just turns into kill him before he kills you I would like to see more variety in the AI I want to have to really look for him with all my resources some games and then have to fight more on others or as days elapse. It’s just too hard to get the evidence and explore without killing him too soon or being attacked too often.

I contacted the devs who didn't really help all that much and just gave me a few fixes I already tried. still really wanna play it but im scared the same issue will occur and I wont be able to get my money back next time.

Date 2024-02-25 Playtime 8h 5m Rec Negative Il gioco in sè, è carino, la storia sembra essere molto interessante. La grafica è stupenda. Però ci sono dei problemi comuni che mi hanno portato a rilasciare una recensione negativa: Droppano gli fps a caso. Non so il perchè, ma droppano a caso. Sopratutto quando c'è la presenza dell'entità del bigfoot. (ho un computer molto performante, e non succede solo a me). Deduco sia ottimizzato proprio con i piedi. Il problema più importante è che non si capisce bene cosa devi fare nella storia. Cioè, ci sono degli obbiettivi ben specifici come trovare i corpi morti ma non riesco a trovarli. Questo gioco dura troppo.. 2 ore di gioco solo per loottare e l'unico obiettivo completato è stato uno. No, non fa per me.

Date 2024-02-17 Playtime 5h 12m Rec Positive Foot fetishism, also known as foot partialism or podophilia, is a pronounced sexual interest in feet. It is the most common form of sexual fetishism for otherwise non-sexual objects or body parts.   Foot fetishism has been defined as a pronounced sexual interest in feet. For a foot fetishist, points of attraction may include the shape and size of feet, feet soles, toes, jewelry (e.g., toe rings, anklets, etc.), treatments (such as massaging, washing partner's feet or painting partner's toenails), state of dress (e.g., barefoot, flip flops, boat shoes, ballet flats, sandals, high heels, clogs, hoisery, socked feet, etc.), foot odor or sensory interaction (e.g., rubbing the foot, smelling, tickling, licking, rubbing genitals on foot, etc.).  Extensions of this fetish include shoes, socks, olfactophilia (odor fetishism), and tickling. Sigmund Freud also considered foot binding as a form of fetishism, although this view was disputed.  Odor fetishism (pertaining to the smell of feet) seems to play a major role in foot fetishism, and is closely related to it: in a 1994 study, 45% of those with a foot fetish were found to be aroused by smelly socks or feet, making it one of the most widespread forms of olfactophilia.  In extreme cases, an individual with a pronounced sexual interest in feet could possibly be diagnosed with fetishism disorder (characterized by the eroticization of non-living objects and body parts) if they are in adherence with the following symptoms:      - Experiencing recurrent sexually arousing fantasies, urges, or behaviors involving the use of non-living objects over a period of at least six months.     - These fantasies, urges or behaviors cause significant distress in a social, occupational or personal environment.     - The fetish objects are not limited to articles of clothing or devices used for genital stimulation.  To estimate the relative frequency of fetishes, in 2006 researchers at the University of Bologna examined 381 Internet discussions of fetish groups, in which at least 5,000 people had been participating. Researchers estimated the prevalence of different fetishes based on the following elements:      - (a) the number of discussion groups devoted to a particular fetish;     - (b) the number of individuals participating in the groups;     - (c) the number of messages exchanged.  It was concluded that the most common fetishes were for body parts or for objects usually associated with body parts (33% and 30%, respectively). Among those people preferring body parts, feet and toes were preferred by the greatest number, with 47% of those sampled preferring them. Among those people preferring objects related to body parts, 32% were in groups related to footwear (shoes, boots, etc.).  Foot fetishism is the most common form of sexual fetish related to the body.  In August 2006, AOL released a database of the search terms submitted by their subscribers. In ranking only those phrases that included the word "fetish", it was found that the most common search was for feet.  Foot fetishism may be more common in men than in women. Researchers using a polling agency to conduct a survey of the general Belgian population in 2017 found that 76 of the 459 male respondents (17%) and 23 of the 565 female respondents (4%) answered "Agree" or "Strongly agree" to a fetish interest in feet.   Similar to other forms of sexual fetishism, no consensus has yet been established about the specific causes of foot fetishism. While many works on the topic exist, their conclusions are often regarded as highly speculative. In a general sense, sexual fetishism can be caused by a number of factors, no singular cause for any type of fetishism has been conclusively established.  The cortical homunculus (also known as Penfield's Homunculus), a map of the human brain illustrating respective locations for where different parts of the body are processed, shows a possible link between the feet and toes to the genitalia. There exists controversy regarding this neural crosslink, as some medical professionals have been known to question the simplicity of the map in comparison to reality.  Foot fetishism may be caused by the feet and the genitals occupying adjacent areas of the somatosensory cortex, possibly entailing some neural crosstalk between the two. Neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran proposed that an accidental link between these regions could explain the prevalence of foot fetishism.  Desmond Morris considered foot fetishism the result of mal-imprinting at an early age, the tactile pressure of a foot/shoe being important in this. Freud's reading of foot fetishism also involved early imprinting, but he considered the smell of feet significant in this, as well as the foot as a penis-symbol/surrogate (castration complex, especially when encountered while voyeuristically exploring the female body from below). Otto Fenichel similarly saw castration fear as significant in foot fetishism, citing a future fetishist who as an adolescent said to himself "You must remember this throughout life – that girls, too, have legs", to protect himself from the fear. Where fear of the (castrated) female body is too great, desire is felt not for shoes on female feet but for women's shoes alone, without women.  Georges Bataille saw the lure of the feet as linked to their anatomical baseness (abjection).   Some researchers have hypothesized that foot fetishism increases as a response to epidemics of sexually transmitted infections. In one study, conducted by A James Giannini at Ohio State University, an increased interest in feet as sexual objects was observed during the great gonorrhea epidemic of twelfth-century Europe, and the syphilis epidemics of the 16th and 19th centuries in Europe. In the same study, the frequency of foot-fetish depictions in pornographic literature was measured over a 30-year interval. An exponential increase was noted during the period of the current AIDS epidemic. In these cases, sexual footplay was viewed as a safe sex alternative. However, the researchers noted that these epidemics overlapped periods of relative female emancipation.  Some of the earliest recorded instances of foot fetishism occur in the erotic poems To a Barefoot Woman and To a Barefoot Boy attributed to the Ancient Greek writer Philostratus. The Hindu god Brahma was aroused by the sight of Parvati's feet in the eighth-century text Skanda Purana. Another reference to the fetish is made by Bertold of Regensburg in 1220. F. Scott Fitzgerald was described by a mistress as a foot fetishist, and himself referred to a "Freudian shame about his feet".  Actor Idris Elba has mentioned his foot fetish in multiple interviews since 2013, for example in 2016 telling UK Esquire "I've got a foot fetish. Women's feet". Other celebrities who have mentioned having some variation of foot fetish include Brooke Burke, Enrique Iglesias, Tommy Lee, Ludacris, Ricky Martin and Todd Phillips.

Date 2024-02-16 Playtime 11h 31m Rec Negative This game fell all the way off a cliff. It isn't very fun either you have to wait forever to fight bigfoot for like 10 seconds then he shirts his pants and runs away and eats like a fatass gaining all his health back.
Date 2024-02-16 Playtime 2h 30m Rec Negative Do not purchase this game, despite being out for many years now it runs poorly. At first me and my friends were able to play the game semi okay. We had a crash right off the bat but on the second attempt we got into the game just fine and played for about an hour. But then the game crashed again, making us lose all of our progress. After that we could not even play the game. My one friend got stuck on a black screen for 5 minutes before he had to restart the game yet again. Afterwards we all lobbied up for a team vs player match where people fight a person playing as bigfoot, and yet again the game froze for a solid two minutes before starting a match, only to immediately end it. After it ended the game crashed yet again, with my friend then having his computer freeze in a reboot process for HALF AN HOUR! And yet again even after that, we squaded up for a team vs player match and it did the SAME THING! This game is poorly optimized, do not play it if you value your money.

Date 2024-02-13 Playtime 2h 49m Rec Negative honestly, I think it's a bit hyped up. With friends it's okay, but after a few nights with no bigfoot to be seen, it gets tedious trying to get it's absolute HUNK of a health bar down to 0. Plus, voice chat doesn't actually work (or at least it didn't work for me, it might be a skill issue). Besides, the game is juuust popular enough that there is literally NO PUBLIC LOBBIES. Another thing as well, the movement across the map is very slow, with a lot of dead space in between lootable places. Another ANOTHER thing as well is that Bigfoot isn't really scaled to the player, even though it has a lot of health it's also super fast, does a lot of damage, etc. A pain in the ass is the "Bigfoot attack where it picks up the player," which is a pain not only because Bigfoot can attack you while you're stunned, but also because it has a HUGE range, which means if Bigfoot finds the players, it's not possible to get it down with a knife because the Bigfoot can just pick you up and you're donezo beans.

Date 2024-02-09 Playtime 27h 42m Rec Positive This game is amazing, been playing since beta and the early stages of it coming out. its super fun to play with friends and i recommend it to anyone who's into a survival horror kind of style. coming back every couple of months to check out the new updates and maps is so exciting, however my only issue with this game is its balancing system, you will get runs with the difficulty set to high loot drop, and still not get enough ammo or any loot to kill Bigfoot- with two players. ((the game is meant for 4 or more if you want some one to play Bigfoot))  i cant imagine trying to play this game at the moment with 4 people and having to share ammo with all of them.  i understand that there is different runs, and perhaps it is luck based, but for this kind of game it just makes it very unfun when you go to one of the biggest settlements on the map and you get one flare gun and if you're lucky a couple rounds of ammo for it as well as ammo-((for a gun you may not even have.)) setting up traps is super fun, and watching the cameras ect, but running out of ammo when youre not even half way to killing him and then running all across the map to find a couple of rounds just for him to jump you and kill you is so unsatisfying, especially with the added wolves and bears that you may also need to use ammo on, unless you use try and use the melee weapons.

Date 2024-02-06 Playtime 1h 1m Rec Negative Honnêtement, le jeu serait gratuit, pourquoi pas, mais il est vide, mal fait, buggé et pour la modique somme de 20€, c'est vraiment une fraude, faut le dire. J'ai fais pas mal de jeux indé mais là pour 20€ je n'avais jamais vu ça.  Bref, soit évitez de le prendre, soit attendez de grosses maj intéressantes

Date 2024-02-05 Playtime 7h 30m Rec Positive A good time fur sure!
Date 2024-02-05 Playtime 39h 23m Rec Positive Me encanta el juego, pero el día dura muy poco y con lo rápido que llega la noche parece mas un speedrun. No se disfruta la tensión como se debe, no da tiempo de apreciar muchos detalles por que apenas inspeccionas algo el maldito ya te esta aplastando contra el suelo.  *Buen juego para amantes de criaturas como esta y los criptidos *El tiempo es una desventaja total que lo hace un speedrun forzoso
Date 2024-02-05 Playtime 19h 57m Rec Positive Kill big monkey, big monkey fight back, kill us. Repeat. It's a good game, glad to see it wasn't just a cashgrab like some predicted back when, updates still coming and a fairly solid basic mechanics system. I'd still recommend playing with friends, its more of a party game than solo in my opinion but solid throughout. Don't come expecting some triple-a style game, its very much indie with a healthy sum of jank but that adds to its character. All in all, 7 big feet out of 10.

Date 2024-02-01 Playtime 232h 42m Rec Positive I am having a blast playing the game. Despite some of the glitches, I find it very enjoyable. The only things I would change would be 2 photos cameras and let the players stay and explore the parks instead of an immediate exit after killing Bigfoot.

Date 2024-01-31 Playtime 6h 57m Rec Positive Game has nice spooky elements to it, as in Bigfoot kicks your a** most of the time. Great experience and a blast with friends.
Date 2024-01-31 Playtime 21h 19m Rec Positive Really good and realistic game, you basically hunt for a hairy big monkey called bigfoot and honestly, its pretty scary the first time playing. Played since the game was still in development and had pretty goofy models and old graphics, now if you compare old version and new you will not even believe that this is the same game, incredible! Devs are also really cool and dont just drop the game or make it dlc based just for cash.

Date 2024-01-30 Playtime 21h 55m Rec Negative Fun game with friends on my first time playing, using a controller. Second time I boot up the game I can't control anything with either controller or mouse and keyboard. Tried a number of things to fix but then when I loaded back in after a reboot I couldn't access my items apart from the flare gun.......I give up
Date 2024-01-30 Playtime 7h 26m Rec Positive Small hand.
Date 2024-01-30 Playtime 10h 56m Rec Negative This game has a crippling bug where online lobbies don't work. Unless you have friends that you can organise playing on you own, then don't bother with this game. Even the official discord is dead. RIP, such potential in a game killed by one silly bug. Shame on the devs!
Date 2024-01-30 Playtime 24h 3m Rec Positive I love the game and its clear that a lot of effort was put into it. I definitely recommend this to people who are playing with friends, coop mode was really funny

Date 2024-01-24 Playtime 17h 55m Rec Positive Bigfoot is one of the best games to play with your friends. There are too many hilarious situations - great team based survival game. I knew the studio has been working hard to produce more content and become a little more polished. This game has so much potential, either way we always come back to play every few months.
Date 2024-01-24 Playtime 5h 47m Rec Positive Mmm... Toes...

Date 2024-01-22 Playtime 14h 56m Rec Positive He Sucked My Cock, Kinda liked it tho
Date 2024-01-22 Playtime 89h 48m Rec Positive It's a good game, but why should I kill the Bigfoot? There are no level up's for me, no skills to upgrade, no money for better weapons, gadgets or something else.  It's just an idea, there are so many Bigfoots, for example Duskman, Stonished Giant, Midnight Whistler, Cherokee Devil, you should use this to make this game more demanding.
Date 2024-01-22 Playtime 2h 19m Rec Positive Likey
Date 2024-01-22 Playtime 5h 55m Rec Negative don't get this game if you don't like repetitive and boring stuff / if you are not retarded.

Date 2024-01-21 Playtime 10h 9m Rec Positive you can hunt bigfoot in this game
Date 2024-01-21 Playtime 5h 43m Rec Negative DO NOT BUY. Game performance is a complete shit show since the new port to unreal engine 4.  I'm hitting 40fps with every set to high running at 1080p, my pc has a ryzen 5600x with a rx6800. Not to mention joining friends lobbies is impossible since they removed game invites because of a single bug that broke it.
Date 2024-01-21 Playtime 43h 24m Rec Positive Better with friends but can be a relaxing game to play while listening to a podcast or a  utube video.
Date 2024-01-21 Playtime 170h 46m Rec Positive Its very fun
Date 2024-01-21 Playtime 18h 19m Rec Positive great game, but i have had times where sir squatch never showed up and that can ruin a night.
Date 2024-01-21 Playtime 4h 7m Rec Negative Fix bigfoot, the gameplay of him is atrocious, you cant even do anything unless you stand still for like 20-30 mins and get ur stamina up, but why start out with 0 stamina, worst 20$ i spent on this game
Date 2024-01-21 Playtime 8h 36m Rec Positive i have not played for along time at the point of me writing this but the game does seem pretty fun the thing i do not really reccomend is the the mode where you can be bigfoot reason if you are bigfoot your energy  to attack goes up so slowly and goes down insanely fast when you attack but it is a fun gamemode 
Date 2024-01-21 Playtime 92h 34m Rec Positive I DID really like the game and i still kinda do BUT for some reason I can't join public lobbies which sucks because i love meeting and playing with new people... Lmk if u know how to fix it plz:) 7/10

Date 2024-01-20 Playtime 2h 59m Rec Positive my game works now you just have to turn the graphics down
Date 2024-01-19 Playtime 26h 45m Rec Negative Real fun for the first bit, but can get repetetive and is very glitchy. Overall I don't think it is worth the money.

Date 2024-01-01 Playtime 24h 35m Rec Positive Got this game to play a new co-op game with the crew. I see great things for this game in the future. My wish list items include character customization (beyond DLC weapons) and maybe special events with other cryptids (like werewolves, unicorns, etc). As the game is now, it offers hours of spooky strategy play, as well as many opportunities for hilarious interactions with your friends.

Date 2024-01-01 Playtime 0h 39m Rec Negative Unfortunately, I found Bigfoot to be a lackluster game with repetitive gameplay, unpolished graphics, and lack of depth in its mechanics. The game felt more like a chore than an enjoyable experience, and the overall execution fell short of expectations. Overall, I would not recommend this game to others looking for a satisfying gaming experience.  
Date 2024-01-01 Playtime 32h 55m Rec Positive Good game, but the servers aren't as good as the game itself... It seems that it shows servers that are currently in game along with servers that are waiting for players to join, fix this please!

Date 2023-12-30 Playtime 1h 6m Rec Positive My pfp is when is saw him for the first time.
Date 2023-12-30 Playtime 8h 24m Rec Negative Could be a fun game but... Bigfoot doesn't show up. He shows up for the first part of the match and then no longer shows up. Waste of money please fix this.
Date 2023-12-30 Playtime 126h 14m Rec Positive very fun game but it feels like something that would get annoying after winning a few times
Date 2023-12-30 Playtime 58h 22m Rec Positive Fun game for friends and makes for lots of funny moments when played in all the wrong ways. If you think your pc cant handle it just change the resolution distance in settings and it runs smooth as butter. Great game.
Date 2023-12-30 Playtime 8h 31m Rec Negative Walked around for almost 2 hours, bigfoot came once in the first 10 minutes and never came back, explored the whole map waiting for him to come, a big waste of time and money, would not recommend buying this. maybe fun the first or second time, if he even shows up that is.
Date 2023-12-30 Playtime 20h 33m Rec Negative we walked around for over an hour and didn't find him, except for once when he attacked us 3 minutes into the game.

Date 2023-12-28 Playtime 14h 19m Rec Negative Funny Game but boring after some time. Please add more Stuff like:  - Food/Water (Collectible from Camps, Cooking etc) for Player Health - Thermal Camera  - Tripwire/Lasers or Motion Sensors as Additional Trigger (No Image) - Improve spawning of Bigfoot (Sometimes its too close) - Laser for Guns - Better Flashlights (e.g. one with UV Light to be able to see Bigfoots Traces)  Improve the Loot on the Maps   Add Side Quests like: Repair the Radio Tower (Find multiple Items on the Map to repair it) Fixed Radio Tower = Bigger Range for Sensors/Cams  etc etc

Date 2023-12-27 Playtime 33h 46m Rec Negative What a total piece of garbage.  Bigfoot just gets stuck on the map and without any reliable way of finding him; you just run around like a moron and can't find him. We spent around 2 and a half hours looking for him just for him to finally pop up behind us and kill us. Also, the explosives didn't trigger a stun animation, so he was just sprinting straight through the car battery and any other explosives and getting free hits on us. **** this trash game and the developers for putting out a patch that is this broken.
Date 2023-12-27 Playtime 2h 13m Rec Positive This game was actually pretty fun, but I can only recommend this game to people that have some buds to play with and are willing to spend 16$. which leads me to the price, right now the price is a little high because it has two maps and it is the same mode. You WILL get bored after a few matches. (Unless you can play the same thing over and over.) Maybe the developers could make a variety in Bigfoot But I have no idea how, that is the reason games like these don't have to many people playing

Played with a friend several times before we were able to win against AI Bigfoot - but we had to lower Bigfoot's stats. Was much harder with all his stats maxed out but was great fun waiting in suspense for him to show up and toss us like rag dolls.

Date 2023-12-24 Playtime 2h 49m Rec Negative In my very first game, Bigfoot had a bug where he disappeared and never came back. Spent 2+ hours looking for him for nothing. This game has too many bugs and the developers are slacking. This game came out almost 7 years ago and this is the state it's in. I don't suggest getting the game.

Date 2023-12-22 Playtime 31h 6m Rec Positive yes
Date 2023-12-22 Playtime 5h 3m Rec Negative Our first game left Bigfoot stuck in the map somewhere, because he didn't attack us for nearly an hour while we explored the entirety of the map. Couldn't find him to kill him, so not really sure what's up with that.  I've also tried to obtain a few of the achievements without success. I see posts throughout the last couple of years about them "not working right now".   The game runs extremely poor on my sufficient-enough PC, and weapon swapping is a nightmare with the tools populating in your hands after multiple seconds have passed. Against this sponge of a Bigfoot, it's pretty much inexcusable.  This must be abandoned by now and yet, the sale price is $16. Yikes! There's a lot to like potentially in this game, but it doesn't work as it should at all.

Date 2023-12-21 Playtime 7h 37m Rec Negative What was a fun concept is unfortunately (Hopefully only in it's current state) overshadowed by Early access bugs. 2/4 Times Bigfoot was big sleep as he did not spawn in the map leaving the game becoming hunting Simulator 2007.

Date 2023-12-21 Playtime 10h 25m Rec Positive Honestly a fun game to try out. Highly recommend to play with 2 or 3 players (max is 4). Singleplayer is a fun try if you dare to challenge bigfoot solo.  Pros: - Simple understanding of game mechanics - Able to customize the amount of items you receive in a single / multiple run(s) - Connection to the servers aren't so bad - Loads of lobbies to choose from - 4 different characters to pick with different perks on each of them - The game is still being improved along the way  Cons: - Quite a few maps - Motion blur might cause some headaches - The sounds might be a bit too loud when you start off - Game sensitivity might be hard to fine tune

Date 2023-12-21 Playtime 10h 18m Rec Positive really nice and well made Game. One of its Kind! Big inspiration for Cryptid Hunting Games. The Game feels just right, and made with love to Details. Yes there are Bugs but dont forget that they are just 2 Devs and yea every implementation causes new Bugs so it takes maybe still some Time to be a full release . But we all want that the Game gets new additions so lets be patient. But anyway in its current State its a lot of Fun specially in Coop !
Date 2023-12-21 Playtime 4h 41m Rec Positive this game is a great game if your looking for a fun game to play with your friends with all the maps to explore you will find a lot of play time,  each map is big and there will be a lot of places on the map to explore solid game worth the price if your looking to play it with friends

I think it deserves my attention enough to write a review. This is a game that I have not lost touch with completely, in fact, I still very much do 100% play it, and I would 100% suggest you play it, especially if it's your first time, and I would 100% suggest you invite a darn friend that you can tag along with! This has become a traditional game for me and my dad, since before he even enjoyed a regular-basis gaming. Their Discord community is tolerable and friendly, and I'm happy to be a part of it every day.

On a note it said to find out which region  your friend is in but regions aren't displayed on public games so theres no way of knowing. Since that one game I've been stuck in an infinite loading screen when trying to join public games. The game is very fun, but buy at your own risk as you may not be able to play with others and might be stuck playing by yourself..

Date 2023-12-17 Playtime 2h 11m Rec Positive I see him dash around the trees, and all of a sudden for no reason, without even being able to witness his silky, furry, warm body, I get a boner, I dont know why, but something about his beautifully, majestic body, makes mine just seem so insignificant as if Bigfoot himself, is the peak of what a physical entity can obtain. Everyday I wake up and I just think about his majestic hairy face, as if he was God and I was a mere follower, he is the ultimate being and I could never hope to even look as good as him, not in my dreams or even in Heaven should Bigfoot allow me in. It's growing into an addiction, every second of the day I find myself dreaming of his hot, steaming, musky body and I just can't stop myself, I just want him to shove his hairy meatstick inside me, forcefully ripping up my insides as I beg for mercy, but he will deliver none, instead he will fill me up, with his white, sticky, juicy semen, and overflow my asshole with so much, that it'll be leaking from my nose to my eyes, hell it might even burst through my skin. I just want to at the very least, feel the presence of his skin touching mine, that alone will grant me enough satisfaction, that I'll produce enough of Bigfoots creamy drink that I produce, I could feed an entire African village with my ### alone. I'm not ashamed of this, and I NEVER will be. I want Bigfoot to fuck me, and I don't think that will ever change, devs if you're hearing this, please for the love of god, add in a Bigfoot sex mechanic.

Date 2023-12-14 Playtime 27h 25m Rec Positive My friends and I play this a lot when we're all free to play together. Jumping into this fun game with friends to hunt down Bigfoot is one of the best experiences in gaming. Not only can you eliminate him to win but you can go around and collect evidence and then leave if anything goes south during your fun expeditions around four fun huge maps. My friends and I love to set up strategic traps in many different areas to help defeat Bigfoot and to help know when he's in the area we are bunker downed in. The game play is great and fun, funny moments while being attacked, running from, or just looking around for Bigfoot himself

But that's personal tough it is extremely stressful trying to escape Bigfoot with no med kits. Overall i would recommend it is not the perfect game but i think you will have fun.

Date 2023-12-06 Playtime 58h 23m Rec Positive First of, I would have neighter voted yes or no. I would vote something in between. It is a great game to say the least. I wasn't able to play the current newest version 5.1.1, because the game crashes whenever I try and load into any map in that version. So my review is pretty much based on the betas. Each Beta has something unique. However I do have to point out a few things: 1. Bigfoots ai is kinda weird in Beta 2019, he doesn't even go for the traps due to a bug, even if I cover them up and put meat on them. Also after some time bigfoot just doesn't hunt for me anymore. At the start of glacier bay in beta 2019 he attacked me but after some time he just didn't hunt for me at all. Eventually I gave up at day 19 despite me having explored everything and had everything to kill him, but he just didn't go for me or the traps and I never say him on any cameras. From my experience this also applies to ross lake park in that beta. 2. The saving, since saving a game was implemented there were always issues with it. In beta 2019 for example you end up in ross lake park despite saving in glacier bay, you fall to your death then. Also saving, quiting and rejoining a game just messes up the game and bigfoot in some sort of way. In beta 2018 bigfoot just dissapears if you save, quit and then rejoin. In beta 2021 the saving works pretty well, bigfoot doesn't dissapear, his health doesn't reset like in other betas. But your time spent in a match resets, basically if you were on night 3 saved, quit and rejoined, you would be back at night 1. This isn't a big issue, but bigfoot from what I experienced doesn't attack or hunt for you at night 1, unless you run directly into him. 3. The bugs with the most recent version (5.1.1) I know I have already explained this at the start of my review. In short I can't play the update, it crashes everytime I try to load into a map. The devs should really fix this as from what I have heard I am not the only one having this exact issue in Update 5.1.1. Lastly again I have to say something about the AI, in beta 2021. Heres what I do due to the AI: As soon as I load into the map, I grab all ressources for the trailer, then it is already night 1. Because bigfoot didn't attack me at all on night 1, unless I run into him which has only happened once in my 4 games I played. I just go and gather ressources from various locations on the map. By the time I have gathered a decent among of traps, ammunition, some explosives and maybe a better gun, it is night 2. From night 2 and every other night bigfoot hunts for you relentlessly. Thats why I go to a village or any house on any map that is currently the near me. Then I set up 1-3 cameras, hide in a house with the lights off and all windows covered, place a trap at the front door of the house I am hiding in, usually also 1 explosive if I have one. Then I just equip one of these tracking spears (if I have one) and wait until bigfoot finds me. He always find me no matter where I am or how well I am hiding. Thats the issue with the AI. When he finds me I just stay calm until he tries to get into the house, but because every house only has one entrance and I placed a trap there he eventually steps into it. When he does I just trow the tracking spear at him while he is stuck in the trap and then I just fight him by shooting him and the explosives I placed and placing down traps. I usually revive myself with a medkit and then bigfoot runs of with the tracking spear. I then do this over and over again, because Bigfoot goes for me 2-3 times per night. And when it is day and he doesn't attack, I just loot everything again until it is night and I do the same thing at a different house or place. Basically I do this until he is dead. This has worked everytime so far, despite me being terrible at shooting and aiming. I hope this review isn't to long for you people to read. But until the next update, which hopefully fixes the crash issue in 5.1.1. I will leave this review as it is.

Date 2023-11-26 Playtime 9h 36m Rec Positive If you've ever laid awake at night pondering life's greatest mysteries, like whether Bigfoot is real or just a really fuzzy recluse avoiding social media, then buckle up, because "BigFoot" is the game for you! Picture this: you, a fearless Bigfoot hunter armed with nothing but determination, a flashlight, and possibly a questionable fashion sense (camo is a must, obviously).  In this spine-tingling extravaganza, you embark on a quest to debunk the age-old myth of Bigfoot. Forget Sasquatch conspiracy theories; it's time to prove to yourself and your skeptical buddies that this elusive creature isn't just a figment of your imagination. Armed with a pixelated map, a healthy dose of skepticism, and the camaraderie of up to three equally foolhardy friends, you're set for a wild ride.  The game offers a heart-pounding, blood-pressure-spiking experience that will make you question your life choices—because who needs a peaceful camping trip anyway? With stunning graphics that will have you mistaking pixelated trees for the real deal and audio so immersive you'll swear Bigfoot is breathing down your neck (spoiler: he probably is), this game is a sensory overload of epic proportions.  "BigFoot" is not your average walk in the woods; it's a multiplayer, co-op, survival extravaganza. Gather your brave companions and dive headfirst into the wilderness, armed with determination and an irrational fear of the unknown. Will you be the hunter, stalking the elusive creature, or will you take a walk on the wild side and become Bigfoot yourself, terrifying your friends into regretting their life choices?  The verdict? A solid 10 out of 10! This game is a must-buy for anyone who enjoys a good adrenaline rush, questionable fashion choices, and proving that Bigfoot is more than just a hairy bedtime story. So grab your camping gear, muster up your courage, and remember: in the forest of "BigFoot," no one can hear you scream—except for Bigfoot, of course. Happy hunting!

Date 2023-11-25 Playtime 23h 47m Rec Negative They keep on updating graphics without updating the game. Bigfoot's AI is trash and has been since the beginning, maybe even getting worse over time. They prefer to put this game on UE5 instead of actually improving the game.   Friends and I spent an hour and a half on the new map without anything happening because Bigfoot was stuck in the river. Good stuff, really makes us want to play again.   Sadly they just don't want to improve this game, they prefer to let it be unoptimized as long as it ''looks'' good.

Date 2023-11-21 Playtime 5h 45m Rec Positive Definitely a different game for sure, never played something quite like this! The round lasts pretty long, depending if you've got a bot or a friend as Big Foot makes it all the more fun. I mean screaming into each other's ear because you accidentally stepped in a trap and Big Foot is outside the window? It's chaotic and I'm here for that! Give it a try if you want a long chase for Big Foot and tons of funny clips for later

Date 2023-11-21 Playtime 5h 37m Rec Negative DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!! Honestly I tried to give it a solid chance. Played it on two sit downs went live on stream with friends. We all agreed it wasn't worth the $20 and uninstalled.  People coming into chat tell us how amazing it was before hand but said since this new update its Ruined. Steam sadly won't let us refund after the hours put in. The game itself is glitch filled and just a snore fest. When Bigfoot is aggressive its Ok for the 2-3 minutes it happens. Then its a snooze fest. 6 days without a single attack from him with us covering all of Ross Lake. Did Yellowstone next after we had 2 whole games on Ross Lake with no action. He did attack on night one before we had gear to deal with him which was an improvement from the snore fest. Night 2 no action and then finally night 3 he killed of our squad of 4. Then he went quiet again for 4 nights in a row. Honestly I heard how great this game was before the update but as a first timer to it I can't say if it was or wasn't. All I can say for now is Don't waste your money on this game.

Auf jeder Karte das selbe Prinzip (Looten,Rennen,Töten), passiert einfach nicht viel und teilweise muss man 5-10 Minuten darauf warten das Bigfoot sich wieder zeigt.  Finde 20 Euro sind völlig ungerechtfertigt für dieses Spiel.

Date 2023-11-05 Playtime 0h 15m Rec Negative Couldn't join a single lobby, eternal load screens
Date 2023-11-05 Playtime 18h 20m Rec Negative Great for sp, but multi sucks ass. Lobbies are hard to join, you cant invite through steam, and Bigfoot gets stun-locked by wolves and bears. I have been attacking a player, ran off when my energy is spent, then have a wolf or a bear chase me the stun-lock me. Then, since I do not have enough energy to attack, I am repeatedly stunned while my hp is drained from me.   Things I STRONGLY RECOMMEND:  1. Fix your servers 2. Make game invites through steam possible 3: Make hostile animals passive to Bigfoot when controlled my a player.
Date 2023-11-05 Playtime 15h 39m Rec Positive MONKEY!
Date 2023-11-05 Playtime 1h 36m Rec Negative I've played one game of this. Then since an update over the last month I would say, any online lobbies that i join seem to bug out and effectively show me the loading screen forever, despite it sounding like I've loaded into the game world.  I wouldn't recommend for this reason, because it's impossible to play it in random lobbies, which I think takes some of the fun away.

Date 2023-11-04 Playtime 0h 50m Rec Positive It was too scary for me alone :/
Date 2023-11-04 Playtime 20h 43m Rec Positive Overall, this game is fairly enjoyable. I have owned it for a long while now and as such, I have experienced many different versions throughout the years. That said-  This version (5) is significantly better looking and more polished. It runs better the majority of the time, the maps and world are pretty decent, etc. I will continue to play this game for the foreseeable future, but it certainly has some areas it needs to improve -  For starters, it really needs to be better about explaining certain game play aspects. I've played for a while and still struggle to understand the "totems" and how they're supposed to be used.  Second, there is some inconsistencies with items you pick up. Sometimes items will be a literal 3D model that you hover over and can pick up, where other times an inventory overlay will pop up when "opening" a fridge, cooler, dresser, or similar "chest." While I appreciate this may be a simpler way to handle the random item generation, it makes for a slightly odd experience.  Third, this version needs to allow single player pausing. I setting up a solo game is technically done by hosting a solo lobby, but this is frustrating when trying to step away from your computer for a moment. In general, a solo run will minimally be 45 min - 1 hour of game play, in that period of time it would be nice to be able to pause to grab a drink or use the bathroom. Currently, it seems you have to save and exit then reload.  Fourth, Bigfoot seems a bit bipolar at times. There will be moments when he runs away after a little damage, and other moments where he seems to stop at nothing when it comes to putting you in the Earth. Similarly, it would be cool if he stalked the player a bit more, for the scare factor, perhaps watching them now and again from a distance, or toying with them in some way (maybe handling the mountable cameras, or shutting off power to structures the player is in, etc). to show a bit more intelligence on his end.  Finally, the day cycle is stupid fast now. I know a lot of the horror comes from being in the dark of the forest being hunted, but it really is frustrating for the day to be so quick and for the player not to be able to use that time to scavenge for items/prepare for the next night.

Date 2023-10-29 Playtime 18h 23m Rec Positive This is a really fun game, the only thing that i think could be improved is bigfoot sometimes glitches into the ground but its not a common thing, and performance, the game is a bit laggy and i have a pretty good laptop. This game is still in beta though i understand things are still getting fixed. You should buy this game its great.

Date 2023-10-29 Playtime 172h 51m Rec Positive Bigfoot ist ein überaus Potentialreiches Spiel welches auch nur einen Bruchteil an Finazieller Kapazität verlangt als andere Spiele auf Steam. Jedoch fehl es meiner Meinung nach an Skins.
Date 2023-10-29 Playtime 5h 20m Rec Negative I'm so tire of this game, it honestly feels like a chore to play. Everything is so hard to find and weapons are scarce. I spent half my games just searching for stuff in the cabins, literally bullets everywhere but no weapon. Traps, cameras, drones, they're all lame if you don't have a cohesive team which I don't IN RANDOMS. I wish there was mode that was a bit more arcade-like that doesn't require very tight team work.

Date 2023-10-26 Playtime 9h 8m Rec Positive "Tom is a policeman who always had courage and strength, but this power didn't save his loved ones from death, because Bigfoot turned out to be stronger. After resignation, he decides to join the Bigfoot Research Association (BRA) team and prevent further deaths. Tom has always shown courage and strength as a policeman, but it wasn't enough against the legendary Bigfoot. After losing his loved ones from the beast, Tom resigned from the force and turned to the BRA. He believes that with them, he can find Bigfoot and put an end to the killings."  This is a actual quote from the game of sasquatch and as you can see it is a very compelling narrative and art driven characters. All of the graphics is very good and so is the tree animations. I love to play this game with my friends. Super good and high-quality polshided next-gen gaming experinece and it doesn't crash or work. 10 out of TEN for this one with a capitol T and a capitol 1. Please play this game because it will change your life and it will probably help you know that Bigfoot is the sasquatch and he is a real person with feelings AND emotions just like us. You can carry your friends in it and even bring them back from the dead if that happens. Please let me know if you play this in the past or if you are playing it now because you should be. Thank you devs for this good game and this gripping modern masterpiece of the nervousness genre, and thank you an especially extra much for the new update. The new update was definitely the right move for this game. Lots of Good GRAPHics and good things were added, such as new tree animations and a cool song that plays on the radio and also making it impossible to invite friends on Steam directly into your new lobby. And like everything else, it works great and just fine and maybe probably your good best friend from childhood won't clip through a table in the first 5 minutes and get stuck there and make you have to restart the match and then wait forever in a loading screen that is broken and does nothing and is truly a loving gift from these great devs. Also, there is a gamer named Will who is a character who you can play as so that makes it very immersive and makes you feel like saying "WOW! I'M IN THIS GAME FOR REAL!" It will break my heart if Bigfoot doesn't win Game of the Year, and the Oscar and at least 3 or 4 Steam awards.

Date 2023-10-23 Playtime 21h 10m Rec Negative I love this game. This game was a staple that my friends and I would go back to repeatedly, but that is no longer the case.  After the most recent update (5.0.2), we can't have fun. Bigfoot hides for the entire night. We've been glitched on the zip lines and stuck there until the game ends. The menu has broken to the point we have to go to the pause menu to close every other menu (Give Items, Looting, Tool Wheel, everything) Purchased skins are not visible. The zip line sound loops on repeat at random points throughout the map. Randomly the Give Items popup will show when the closest hunter is on the other side of the map. The lobby will timeout after about two or three nights.  I understand that this game is still in Early Access and it just had a major update to migrate to Unreal 5, but if we are playing this game for hours and we can't finish a single mission, then more testing should have happened before the update. As it stands I have no confidence that we can enjoy this game until some more bug fixes come out. Until then, I can't recommend for someone to but this.

Date 2023-10-22 Playtime 2h 14m Rec Negative Too many bugs and glitches :< I like the concept. But it'd be more interesting to see this as a story like green hell or the forest. Where you keep looking for clues and stuff. Then in the end, you get to hunt the big foot. Just me though
Date 2023-10-22 Playtime 20h 23m Rec Negative I really loved this game when I first bought it, but recently strange things are happening with the bigfoot ai. Instead of hunting you at night like he used to, he attacks once, and then runs off and never attacks again. You instead turn from the, "Hunted," to the, "Hunter," and you are forced to run around the map trying to find Bigfoot because he will not come after you. It's become very frustrating as this was one of my favorite games to just pull up and play with my friends occasionally, but now it just feels stale and boring.  Can't give this a positive review until bigfoots ai is fixed.
Date 2023-10-22 Playtime 24h 44m Rec Negative Diese Spiel ist an sich gut, wenn man es mal spielen könnte, entweder buggt man selber irgendwo oder ein Freund und man kann nichts dagegen machen.

Date 2023-10-22 Playtime 0h 41m Rec Negative bought it, and every lobby joined got me into a eternal loading screen.  was 3 servers that didnt... first one froze me at the message in the game saying press any key to continue, nothing worked except pressing enter and using the chat.  Like with the eternal loading screens you get into i'd have to alt+F4 to get out. Second server i just got kicked randommly after 7 seconds in the lobby the last server, was with 1 dude, he let me have the big foot. I testet the big foot for 5 minutes, found the dude in a camper, i looked at him, he took a shot at me, i texted in the chat "ill let you loot and have a hunt free night if you want the first night since im learning the game"  Then he left the game leaving me to main menu again.   I attempted to join lobbies for 10-15 more times every one ending in eternal loading screen and alt+F4 each time so i got mad, 41 mintues of owning the game was about trying to get to play the game, and im NOT about to pay 22 USD for a game that is bricked before you can try it.  I could create a lobby, but nobody would join, and i could play solo against AI bigfoot, but then again... 22 dollars to do only that... If i got it for free or the cost for the "game" was 5 USD i would buy it to try the solo vs AI big foot, but what i wanted from this game was to actually be big foot, which you cant in single player. If you got friends with the game, and they join your lobby you might have some fun tho, because that seems to work, at least according to the videos i see on youtube.  I rarely get this disappointed about a game but lets be honest, i didnt even get to try it out, and i was not about to waste 2 hours trying to join a lobby and then not be eligible for a refund.  Sad to say that this was not a very positive review, i really wanted this game to be awesome but sadly it's garbage.. It's almost 7 years old and it feels abandoned when the lobby system is not functioning properly

Date 2023-10-22 Playtime 4h 15m Rec Positive So the game and idea is pretty fun. BUT there iare SOOOOO many bugs in the game that need to be fixed. if the bugs were cleaned up it would be a lot of fun
Date 2023-10-21 Playtime 41h 3m Rec Positive New release bug report: 1. (NEW) "Report a problem" click on the main menu -> URL isn't loading. Hence I'm reporting it here. 2. (NEW) Saving single player games is broken (it worked fine in previous versions). I can't save and resume my games. 3. (NEW) The rope elevator that lets a player travel upwards and downwards can make the player stuck in place if the player looks at it at a wrong angle. 4. (OLD and still persists) Ukrainian devs that didn't add the locale of their origin? Come on!  It's a good game to play single and with friends after all.
Date 2023-10-21 Playtime 8h 1m Rec Negative One of the least polished games I've ever played. Me and my friend have been giving Bigfoot a chance with about every update that came out. We love the game's concept but it is executed with such lack of finess, understanding and quality that it is incredibly hard to defend it.  The gameplay cruelly lacks substance and even with countless attempts to make it better over the years, it remains as primitive and buggy as it was 5 years ago.  I really wish I liked this game or just something about it but it simply reminds me of frustration, bugs, a lack of care and support from the devs, crowned by the most asinine dlcs I've seen in a while.  The only good mechanic I've seen added to the game was vaulting as it seemed to have been implemented with thought and reflection prior.  You NEED to make the gunplay feel better, the interactions with bigfoot feel more relevant and please completely rework bigfoot. Not only is he not scary, the lead up to seeing him is botched everytime and it doesn't even feel like a hunt. You basically wait untill he charges you again which can take a very long time, leading to you eventually killing you or you killing him.    Btw, 40 fps on low settings with a gtx 1080 on a 5 year old game is not normal.  Don't buy this.

Date 2023-10-21 Playtime 7h 29m Rec Negative Ruined by updating to Unreal 5.
Date 2023-10-21 Playtime 1h 28m Rec Negative Unfortunately we had to refund this game. Playing in a group of three, there were constant bugs and crashes that made the game borderline unplayable. We would randomly get booted or get stuck on ziplines. Even worse, the crashes sometimes made us restart the entire game, not just reload in game. We had fun with the amount we were able to play without issues, so maybe if they fix the game we would revisit.
Date 2023-10-21 Playtime 8h 31m Rec Negative I initially purchased this game a year ago and played a few hours with my friends. It was a great time and I vividly remember it running well with minimal bugs, if any. A year later and the game is riddled with so many game-breaking bugs it is unplayable. Yet, no noticeable features have been added. I have never seen a game regress to such an unplayable state over a years span without the addition of more features and content. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME UNLESS YOU WANT A HEADACHE. Genuinely upset how the devs have ruined the game as if these patches and updates don't even get a proper play test. BIGFOOT? More like BUGFOOT. Wish I could get my money back.

Date 2023-10-21 Playtime 27h 13m Rec Negative The new version is way too buggy, there's glitches with my arms when bigfoot attacks me, I got glitched on the computer on my first game back in. And I aimed at bigfoot just now and my game froze. This makes it near impossible to record a video. You guys barely beta tested the update after putting it back in the game. This is disappointing and you devs need to fix these bugs left unfixed.

Date 2023-10-20 Playtime 13h 4m Rec Negative BIGFART.   This game is 7 years old. During this time, its visual quality has improved significantly, but technically the game is still a mess, poor optimization, random glitches and freezes that force you to reboot your system, having to restart the game almost every time you want to create a new lobby and invite a friend. The first map is the most well developed, the rest seem empty and made without inspiration. Also you can easily find in the map places where Bigfoot will get stuck, and you can easily defeat him.  Lots of potential, but after 7 years it's a big fart which is not worth $20.

Date 2023-10-20 Playtime 24h 24m Rec Negative Now I only played one match solo against ai and my experience was not really that good. The ai was stuck in a corner of the map after 2 nights and I had to free the guy by making the ai aggressive, only to make it flee towards the big cave in the east, trapping it and killing it because it would not attack me or run past me. So I can't really recommend this game as of now in this state imo because of this experience. When the game got ported it was much more buggy and more unplayable, but after the patches the game "playable" again. It still does not run smooth as I wanted but that is just nitpicking I guess.

Date 2023-10-19 Playtime 25h 43m Rec Positive *cracks fingers after an intense game of finding feet successfully*  Yes, the game runs now. It is the equivalent of taking a jaunt through the forest while getting randomly smack-cammed by a giant fuzzy person of horticulture. I love me some cryptid shootin. How dare you call the gas cans and car battery's I spent an hour searching for on the map "improvised".

Date 2023-10-19 Playtime 25h 33m Rec Negative So I love this game. It's fun and interesting, and we still get some good jump scares. However, we have not been able to finish one game in the total 20 that we've played. Not one game. It's so buggy that we can't even alt F4, we have to use task manager. First, the cameras can actually lock you into them where you cannot exit them, and the only way out is to leave the game. Apparently, so can zip lines. The servers are always down, so right in the middle of matches, we just get kicked from it. And then, it freezes and crashes the rest of the time. Computer specs are not the issue here as we all have specs that are well passed the recommended. It seems to always be night 4. That's always when bigfoot is catching hands, so it's extremely frustrating to play an hour per run, just to have it crash. I'm sure the devs are trying to fix it, but ultimately for myself and my friends, and many others, it's just not playable. Correction: since the new update, it freezes on night one now. RIP this game.

Date 2023-10-17 Playtime 5h 55m Rec Negative Currently there are a lot of bugs, for example freezes the game a lot. We played four rounds and couldn't finish either game. Two because we died and two because the game froze. When it worked it was great fun, though. I got a refund, but would love to get it again when the bugs are fixed.

Date 2023-10-16 Playtime 15h 44m Rec Positive Macht vor allem mit Freunden enorm bock. Man kann entweder gegen einen KI Bigfoot oder gegen einen von einem Spieler gesteuerten Bigfoot Spielen. und das hebt das ganze auf ein höheres Level von Spaß und Horror.  Ich würde es aber nicht als Horror-Game sondern mehr als Fun-Game bezeichnen.
Date 2023-10-16 Playtime 2h 4m Rec Negative An sich ein echt gutes Game! Die Idee dahinter ist spitze und es macht auch sehr viel Spaß mit Freunden zu zocken. Doch leider versauen viele unnötige Bugs das Spielprinzip. So ist die Schnee Map komplett verbuggt. Kälteschaden lässt sich nicht durch ein Feuer wiederherstellen, manchmal aber schon.  Das Game ist jetzt schon über 2 Jahre am Start. Diese kleinen Fehler bekommt der Entwickler nach so langer Zeit nicht in den Griff. Also is n witziges Spiel, aber des drecks Game stürzt auch einfach andauernd ab wenn man Online spielt. Bin mir nicht sicher ob sich 20€ lohnen dafür. Vielleicht wird das mit den nächsten Updates gefixt, dann könnte es ziemlich witzig sein.
Date 2023-10-16 Playtime 19h 55m Rec Negative The new update appears so buggy.  First of all, starting a co-op game I used the monitors in the RV which then glitched out, lost all control of character but did not freeze the game and "Name" was displayed where the usual "Use" message was. (This was said to be fixed at the time of this review, however, clearly the issue is still present.)  Started a new game, got so far into it, used the drone for a minute and then the entire game froze while my friend was still in the game. Eventually used task manager to kill the process.   Performance also appears to have taken a glitchy hit with the update, with nearly 20 hours in game, I've never had an issue until now playing on "Ultra" settings. I'm not too bothered by it but I reduced the graphics as low as possible and FPS is going between 20 on the low end and 200 on the high end, really inconsistent.  It was a good game and I'm sure it will be again but this update is gonna need some serious fixing to revert the game back to an enjoyable playable state.  After the issues stated above, both myself and my friend decided to call it a day and not continue any longer, although my friend who I was playing with at the time did not suffer a crash, he too reported inconsistent frame rates and poor performance. Both systems are more than adequate to run the game and have done so many times before the last update without issue, both on solo and co-operative play.
Date 2023-10-16 Playtime 75h 6m Rec Positive its a good survival and tactics game it really bring the fear to you as you wonder through the dark, deep night looking for a monster. I highly recommend this game to anyone whos into horrors and first person POVs it also has loads of upcoming updates. I enjoy this game and i hope you do aswell.
Date 2023-10-16 Playtime 1h 54m Rec Negative Had some decent fun with this back in 2018, wanted to dive back in and see what was new. Now when I look at a monitor I become stuck, unable to do anything but ALT+F4 the game. Shame.

Date 2023-10-15 Playtime 14h 0m Rec Negative At first when i played the game (christmas 2022), everything was fine. I loved the game with all my heart. I havent played now for like three months, and decided to hop on again. Turns out one of the newer updates ruined the game. The ziplines are unusable for some reason, the game feels very weird, since the developers tried to make it more realistic. Really wish for it to turn back to how it was.

Date 2023-10-14 Playtime 21h 42m Rec Positive Good game if playing with 4 people or less against AI bigfoot. With a person playing bigfoot all they need to do is rush you and you die even if it is a 4v1.
Date 2023-10-14 Playtime 30h 23m Rec Negative Game was great until the last update. Constantly crashes, can't finish a game. Save do not work. It's such a joke that the feedback form to report issues doesn't even work. 50/50 chance inviting someone to play will crash the game. Bigfoot now runs away as soon as you start shooting him.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THEY FIX WHAT THEY'VE JUST RUINED.
Date 2023-10-13 Playtime 19h 46m Rec Negative I've encountered so many bugs during the recent update. I keep randomly getting kicked out of the game and forced into my taskbar every few minutes, preventing me from taking any action, and sometimes the controls are just blatantly unresponsive.

Date 2023-10-10 Playtime 25h 35m Rec Negative I love how the game looks, but it's seriously not okay that my PC crashes after only 10 minutes of playing it overheating . Even when I lower the resolution to 1920x1080 (and my PC can easily handle 2k ultra settings), it still crashes with a black screen and no signal on medium settings. I think there's a major optimization issue. The graphics are beautiful, but it's not acceptable for a game to completely crash a PC like this.  And it's definitely not a problem with my PC. I've tested a lot of other games with high stress and temperatures, and it never crashes. Please fix this issue with your game.
Date 2023-10-10 Playtime 44h 18m Rec Positive Great game, but since the update to Unreal Engine 5 I've been experiencing game crashes and freezes to where the game is sadly unplayable. I haven't been able to finish a game without one of these glitches preventing me from playing. I hope the devs figure this out soon because I love this game and it's really fun with friends.

Date 2023-10-10 Playtime 9h 2m Rec Negative There needs to be more in-depth match customization. The AI bigfoot is way too easy and the player controlled bigfoot is unbeatable 9 times out of 10. Even at max the loot barely spawns and the vast majority of containers around the map are going to be empty. You're lucky to find 4 medkits across the whole map aswell, which means each player can take a major amount of damage ONCE per game. Also its been the same 3 maps for as long as i can remember. Please add more.

Date 2023-10-04 Playtime 6h 47m Rec Positive Ein tolles Spiel mit einem angemessenen Grusel-Faktor. Ich empfehle es jedem mal mit Freunden zu spielen, da es deutlich mehr Spaß macht mit oder gegen Freunde zu spielen. Das Spiel an sich läuft flüssig und ich hatte keine großen mit Bugs oder Glitches.  Leider finde ich, dass das Spiel nach einigen Durchläufen fade wird, da man sich an den Anblick von Bigfoot gewöhnt. Ich hoffe daher, dass es in Zukunft noch Updates geben wird, dass man zB Werwölfe oder Wendiowak auf verschiedenen Karten jagen kann.   Trotzdem: Sehr zu empfehlen.

Date 2023-10-03 Playtime 1h 21m Rec Negative Just a piece of shit, my character feels like a fucking brick with arms. This game is hop out of a window simulator and shoot a big fat fucking ape that has infinite health. Never in my life have I been bored out of my mind playing a horror game like this one, Big foot looks like a roblox port or a skin-walker out of render distance. Ive played better steam big foot sex simulators with more content than this piece of shit.
Date 2023-10-03 Playtime 16h 5m Rec Positive Overall I wish there was a bit more polish on certain mechanics and such. But thats mostly personal gripes.   The game itself is great and good fun. Love the sound designs and the feeling you get just running through the maps hunting for bigfoot. All in all good game. I enjoy it.

Date 2023-09-29 Playtime 21h 33m Rec Positive Dieses Spiel ist sehr unterhältlicht, ab und zu auch sehr anspruchsvoll und eine gute Grafik Top
Date 2023-09-29 Playtime 25h 33m Rec Positive u ARE GETTING hit from your behind
Date 2023-09-29 Playtime 173h 35m Rec Positive Great game for co-op as long as you understand the core mechanics with traps and flare gun. You can either play against a BOT by yourself/with your friends or you can play against a real player in a team of 4. You can also play as Bigfoot if you want to. The game is very re-playable because all loot is kinda randomized and even though the game has only 3 maps for now, gameplay  pretty much depends on players' strategies and play styles. The only issue with this game is that it has a very small community and it might take from 1 to 30 minutes before enough people join your lobby, and there are usually very small amount of other lobbies to join too. But I think that these Ukrainian developers did a pretty good job and this game just needs some small adjustments and hype to become a great game.  Things I'd really like to see in this game: 1. Instead of lobby system, I'd like a "search for a game" button where you can choose what mode you want to play and after you hit that button you would appear in a queue where the game finds players for you to play with. 2. Add some motivation/reason to play. Like a reward for reaching a new lvl or even a battle pass would be fine too. Just don't do what Overwatch 2 does.  2.1. Therefore, I'd like to see some more customization for guns and player skins. 3. I saw the developers trying to add a huge update, but then they removed it and I'd really like to see that update finished and good. 4. Add some more spawn locations, so the truck doesn't always stops at the same plays and actually works like bigfoot spawns. It should be random so it would change the game play of each match. 5. Make some more advanced options for a lobby leader so they would be able to choose what guns and things they want in their game, how many bigfoots and other things like that, that will create some chaotic and fun moments.
Date 2023-09-29 Playtime 1h 4m Rec Negative Its really not that much fun the game is pretty one sided towards big foot me and my friend tried it and died everytime
Date 2023-09-29 Playtime 30h 34m Rec Negative Shills to epic a studio known for robbing people of their access to a game they already bought and should legally have access too the game, and the dev cries and whines asking why so much hate for the decision with epic, Heres a little history lesson.  Epic has been widely known that their platform security has got to be the absolute worst anyone has ever seen, the epic app is widely known to have so many open ended back doors to your computers Kernel operations.  Epic has be threatened by Valve Inc. on multiple occasions for a class action lawsuit for directly hacking and stealing steam user data illegally.  Further more users on steam that already purchased games such as Rocket League, Fall Guys ect. can no longer use the product they lawfully purchased under the consumer rights act, clearly stating you can not illegally restrict someone who has lawfully paid for access to a product or service unless usage agreements have been violated.  Simple playing the game is not a violation, and here we are being forced to join another third party platform that was NEVER a prerequisite beforehand, and was promised by the game studio that it would NEVER be the case (Looking directly at you Rocket League) and forcing us to download an app that is known for getting your computer hacked because of the thousands of holes and exploits in its security layout.  Then the dev wonder why people are mobbing up on them?  Gee i don't know maybe because you are teaming up with known thieves who steal your data without your knowledge on a regular basis and sell it directly to China / Tencent which creates a matter of national security?  Total not that no totally not.   (Spoiler Alert, Epic has been sued for that exact reason MULTIPLE TIMES)  So no i don't recommend this game, and definitely would not advise trusting these devs, as they made their intentions very clear that they were so fast and willing to alienate everyone that supported their arses on steam and remove their lawfully purchased access, then back peddle when the negative attention becomes too much.  If your going to jump into a dumpster fire so willingly, please, stay there, you're already tainted beyond saving.  Only thing you can do to remotely change my perspective even a little bit is tell steam to offer anyone who purchased your game, a full unrestricted guaranteed refund no matter what.

Date 2023-09-27 Playtime 5h 0m Rec Positive BIGFOOT is a survival horror game developed and published by Pixeltorque Games. It was released on Steam in Early Access in 2017, and is still in development as of 2023.  In BIGFOOT, players take on the role of a hunter who is tasked with tracking down and killing Bigfoot. Players can explore a large open world map, set in the Pacific Northwest, in search of Bigfoot. Along the way, players will need to gather resources, craft weapons and tools, and avoid dangerous wildlife.  Once players have found Bigfoot, they must track it and hunt it down. Bigfoot is a powerful and intelligent creature, and players will need to use all of their skills to survive.  Pros:  Atmospheric and suspenseful gameplay Large and open world map to explore Variety of weapons and tools to craft Challenging boss battles  Cons:  Early Access game, so there are still some bugs and glitches AI can be a bit unpredictable at times Game can be repetitive after a while  Overall:  BIGFOOT is a decent survival horror game with a lot of potential. The game has atmospheric and suspenseful gameplay, a large and open world map to explore, and challenging boss battles. However, the game is still in Early Access, so there are still some bugs and glitches. Additionally, the AI can be a bit unpredictable at times, and the game can get repetitive after a while.  Rating: 6.5/10
Date 2023-09-27 Playtime 28h 58m Rec Positive Оптимизируйте!!!! Молю разрабов занести либо фикс, либо полноценную обнову, лишь бы игралось как раньше... До последнего обновления играл с удовольствием, на ультрах и бац! Лаги, лаги, лаги и МЫЛЬНЫЕ ТЕКСТУРЫ, ну что-же это такое???  Ладно, отойдя от технических "особенностей", хотелось бы перейти к геймплейным: с этого взгляда - игра шикарна и не имеет никаких минусов! Геймплей на высшем уровне: надоело играть самому?  - Решено! Зови друга и играй с ним Наскучило и с ним? - Всё схвачено, создавай сквад и играйте с бигфутом игроком. Так, игра действительно разнообразна и не даёт даже на 30 часах заскучать, разнообразие карт, тактик и даже режим уж точно разнообразит охоту на Сасквочера)
Date 2023-09-27 Playtime 62h 9m Rec Positive I would give this game an 11/10, it is such an amazing game, if you like hunting/survival/mythical creature/horror games this is the one for you, because it perfectly combines all of those topics together, and it is a really fun and re-playable game.

I also will never know who I just played with because it crashed and the "recently played with" steam feature doesn't work for this game. i can no longer recommend buying this game in its current state. please polish updates more before releasing. game is downright unplayable

Date 2023-09-25 Playtime 14h 40m Rec Negative horrible, maps are repetitive as hell, good atmosphere but most structures are the same, big foot is kinda easy to kill just run around into water or go up and down zip lines or just use explosives and traps, there are little ways to kill big foot and no sense of defense once big foot comes you just have to shoot at him and run away and traps barely work. the game is so boring we and my friend at first found it amazing but soon found it boring, it gets so repetitive little ways to kill, little ways to defend, bad attack patterns, nearly every building is copy and pasted,  there is not excitement to the game, the big foot should have attack variations and way more, game has been in this state since 2017 embarrassing.

Date 2023-09-16 Playtime 1h 17m Rec Negative I don't understand where to start...  Game is badness max! I play with 4 friends because I actually have. unlike you sad loser. We play I was new so quite unbore. Setting cool. we explore, find place. still unbore. Then comes footman! Scare! I shoot but HP times almost infinititty. Then Footman run? Why run? We cannot kill but footman turn into scared chicken bokbok? The sense is not found.   Then we wait more and footman finally come again but repeatedness of previous boss fight. Game now bore. We thought ok to make unbore, we split into 2 of 2 grouping. Only using the official voice communications of the bore game! However this function stupid and unwork. When people way, you cannot hear. That normal. But then when later find again, I hear communicate of them while way in once? It like game record commune, then play at once when available. Feature is stupid and make game super bore more.   Eventual find footman again because scream. Friend on zipline. Weeeeeee! Footman chase friend by walk while back and forth and ignorance of me and the rest in way. Just focus on friend and go back forth on ground like unsmart loser. Artificial intelligence? more like artificial STUPID! Game not work good and super bore. Positive review are STUPID and badtaste of gaming. I am only person of sense in earth planet.

I believe that if you're searching for something new to play with friends, it might be a decent choice for a single session. A single game can last for hours if you don't know what you're doing. I played it twice and never found myself wanting to play it again. However, please note that this is solely my personal opinion.

Date 2023-09-08 Playtime 16h 9m Rec Positive it is a fun game but i feel like sometimes when Bigfoot attacks he just kills 3 of us and some time he does so little damage and then runs away. so its very confusing sometimes. but over all a fun game

Date 2023-09-06 Playtime 28h 19m Rec Positive The game is quite exciting, every morning you sit and wait for Bigfoot himself to come to you, The rest of the time you go and collect loot. According to the graphics, I can say that it's not bad, but much better than the Rake game. There will not be enough cartridges, even if you search the entire forest. Went with a friend because it's more fun that way. Overall, the ending is good in both cases. Game score 9/10
Date 2023-09-06 Playtime 56h 0m Rec Positive this game makes me cum but it needs more maps and more guns and all that other stuff cuz its getting dry
Date 2023-09-06 Playtime 16h 22m Rec Positive Il est tenace le salopard.
Date 2023-09-05 Playtime 18h 14m Rec Positive I think it's a great game and the only thing that really bothers me is in multiplayer seeing the characters faces looking so uncanny with their mouths always open and their eyes wide and crazy looking also their hair sometimes looks white and other times looks black especially on Rick  But I haven't noticed any bugs or glitches in 7 hours of playing besides minor visual glitches like the rag-doll physics when bigfoot knocks your friend down   Everything seems fair and balanced but the wolves take too many shots to kill while animals like the bison die in one shot from the right gun  the only other complaint that I have is that the animals aren't very realistic or accurate like the deer plaques you can find in some cabins are titled reindeer when it looks more like some sort of elk and also the and that the wolves are never in packs  Other than that great game

Date 2023-09-02 Playtime 27h 34m Rec Negative This game suck today. I remember I used to think this game is good and fun to play. Game isn't scary when Bigfoot comes right after you spawn and kills you immediately. When you start again Bigfoot comes on day time. That isn't very scary and It want kill you what isn't very realistic. And Bigfoot doesn't run away even you use every item on it. This game were better when Bigfoot was shy and didn't show very often and you needed to really try if you wanted to get it. And Bigfoot showed only night time. Then cameras was useful, nowadays they are useless. The graphics are better.. but they aren't. Its because in the old days graphics were realistic and now they are cartoon like which isn't Bigfoot like thing. And the maps... they are empty and boring I don't like to run miles in ugly maps. And there very common bug when scoping on some ground places what look like the ground is bouncing.
Date 2023-09-02 Playtime 2h 25m Rec Negative this game is trash. OP bigfoot!
Date 2023-09-02 Playtime 3h 55m Rec Positive This would be really fun if my friends could afford to buy it, very challenging and scary if u play it solo, looking forward for next updates.

Date 2023-08-29 Playtime 9h 5m Rec Positive It's the best bigfoot hunting game that I have ever played, it has great graphics, a couple maps, and you can even play with your friends. one of my favorite features though is that in a type of game mode you get to be bigfoot, anyways that's all I'm writing I think it's worth it!

Date 2023-08-28 Playtime 3h 29m Rec Negative Покупать это дерьмо не рекомендую никому. Разработчик русофоб без мозгов, который не достоин даже копейки за свой высер. Вот сообщение разраба игры https://i.imgur.com/difssbD.png, чтобы покупать его дерьмо, надо быть либо тупым, либо таким же, как он.   Что по игре - игра мёртвая, онлайна в ней нет. Что и не удивительно с таким отношением. Игру знаю давно, в неё раньше то играли несколько человек, сейчас своими действиями вовсе онлайна нет, не тратьте своё время и деньги

Date 2023-08-23 Playtime 6h 26m Rec Positive 1. Some Twitch streamer spammed me with over 30 game invites, I did not join.  2. I almost killed Bigfoot but my health was low so I ran into a lake thinking he couldn't swim. I think I was right but then he threw a sign at me and I died.  3. Good game to play with the boys.  4. A lightning strike made me shit myself.  5. I would only buy on a sale. Even at the sale price of $17 though I do not think it is worth that much right now. It is still a fun game.
Date 2023-08-23 Playtime 36h 2m Rec Positive I can't recommend this game enough! It's so much fun with a gang of fellow idiots. You all have to try and take down bigfoot while looting and surviving the parks. Or you can be Bigfoot and take down your friends! Either way it's a blast!

Date 2023-08-20 Playtime 6h 22m Rec Positive Wish i could play this game without myself or someone else always crashing/losing connection, seems to be a huge issue in this game and it really sucks having to start over again repeatedly since there is no option to drop in middle of a game or anything similar to that, also trying to find random people that wont quit at the start of the game because they didnt get a weapon at the RV is the worst, i wont even take a weapon myself so others have a chance to grab them but there is always that 1 person that just snatches everything and wont share.  Guess i will keep trying to find a decent lobby because the game is actually enjoyable... when you get a chance to actually play it.

Date 2023-08-17 Playtime 18h 37m Rec Positive Fun game with friends. Wish more features were implemented. Also feel that the game should have bigfoot be more reclusive instead of him seeking you out. I think it would be fun to set traps and such to document/kill him. Fun game nonetheless

Date 2023-08-17 Playtime 24h 27m Rec Positive Brilliant game, everything I hoped for and more. sound design, graphics and gameplay are all  10/10 and it has tons of replayability. my only negative is that sometimes bigfoot gets stuck and it kinda spoils the fun but it's rare that that happens and the game is way to good to ignore. 10/10 would recommend.

Date 2023-08-14 Playtime 9h 51m Rec Positive Cool Idea, but its apearent, that the Devs are not very skilled. Its very shallow and as it tries to be a game, where bigfoot can also be controlled by the player, the AI of Bigfoot in the AI Mode is pretty fucking bad. Also just loop around ziplines for instant win, as AI is to stupid to destroy. (PLS FIX)

Date 2023-08-13 Playtime 32h 31m Rec Positive I watched some footage of "BIGFOOT" before buying the game, I was convinced and thought I'd give it a shot. At the purchase page I realised the footage I watched was old, so, I watched the new trailer and couldn't believe my eyes.  The stunning graphics, the beautiful landscapes, multiple maps and Bigfoot himself. I instantly fell in love and bought it, since than, updates have been coming out left and right majorly improving the game to keep it from going stale. I would recommend purchasing "BIGFOOT" as it is a great experience and I'm sure you would enjoy.

Date 2023-08-12 Playtime 31h 33m Rec Positive GOOD GAME. ILY BIGFOOT 
Date 2023-08-12 Playtime 8h 19m Rec Positive This game awakens something in me, and no other games do that. I'm good at FPS games, but there's something so damn terrifying when you're playing with your friends, having a good time and then you hear rapid heavy footsteps and a roar. You all turn to it and you all start opening fire, screaming bloody murder. Bigfoot grabs your best friend and slams his skull into the ground. You keep firing but he had the M4A1. Bigfoot then goes for your friend who had the sniper and throws her a good 10 feet away. You keep firing and it's health is barely going down at all. Bigfoot then turns to you and you let out a high-pitched scream and start yelling about how you don't consent as it grabs you and throws you into the ground, stomping on you. Your friend with the M4 recovers and magdumps its face and then it runs away. You're all really damaged and you look at it's health bar to see it's at about 75% HP, but the grey bar goes up to 85% and after about a minute of you recovering, he starts to heal back up to 85%.

Date 2023-08-11 Playtime 30h 26m Rec Positive This game is very fun. I've played this game for about 20 hours now, and I gotta say, the idea is great. The execution is also great, even if it needs some fixes, I dont mind. I have heavy respects for the developers of this game and do enjoy the product they've created. I remember playing the oldest version of this game, way back when you killed bigfoot and dragged him back to your truck, and I remember the fear I would feel when I heard bigfoot's roar. The newer roar doesnt scare me as much, but that may just be because of old childhood fears. Playing single player does get boring over time, I will admit, but playing with your friends is always fun in this game, even when your buddy charges your entire team as bigfoot half a minute into the game. All and all, great game. I will play this game more, absolutley

Overall a really fun game though!

Something about this wonderful experience left me thinking that BigFoot was something to be loved by people all around the world.

After all the experience I've had with this experience, I am comfortable saying that this experience is something to appreciate.  10/10

Date 2023-08-03 Playtime 19h 7m Rec Positive Erg leuk spel en vooral als je het multiplayer speelt. Prijs is lichtelijk aan de hoge kant maar valt wel mee. Het is een eng spel door bigfoot en af en toe het donkere thema. Je objective is als soort speurders mensen en bigfoot opsporen wat heel duidelijk is. Wel heb je het spel snel uitgespeeld doordat potjes niet lang duren en er weinig mappen zijn. Alleen is het spel wel weer wat minder al zeg ik het zelf. Ik zou het niet hoog op mijn lijstje zetten maar als ik me zou vervelen en heb wat geld over is het zeker waard om even te gaan halen.

Date 2023-08-02 Playtime 0h 47m Rec Positive I like the game and it seems fun but Bigfoot attacks you too early and he attacks you in every night i would be better if you had to find him and that he comes out when you are near him. I also think you should find him before he finds you, or that a the jump scares like lighting or falling rocks only appear when you are near him  and he inst that aggressive. For the ending i would like that you could lock him in like in the first part of Bigfoot. The good things are that the graphic is really nice and the idea of the game is also solid.

Date 2023-08-02 Playtime 1h 34m Rec Positive So about this game... ITS AMAZING! From the awesome grafics to fun gameplay with friends and low requirements this is the game YOU NEED! There is such a good side story about the survivors and so many side objectives you always have something to do like finding  lost corpses to opening saves with new weapons. The game was in developement since 2017 and always watched videos about it and it was amazing in every stage and it always got better with new game versions and Bigfoot designs I absulutely loved to watch it on youtube. In general such a nice concept!
Date 2023-08-02 Playtime 2h 19m Rec Positive I like the Idee and the Concept its fun but i wish that things like bodys clues and codes for Safe spwan random on the map and Not always on the same places and that the tresor codes are random and an Not always the same a promblem also is that the nights are repetetive and its always he attacks you shoot at him and he runs away when he attacks it should base on where you are at the moment so near his cave the chance that he attacks is higher then by the trailor and he shouldnt attack every night also i would like that at the end of the round you get coins so you can buy better start Equipment like more monution ore batteries somthing like that

Date 2023-08-01 Playtime 15h 31m Rec Positive Great co-op game, wish it was easier to play solo (maybe make bigfoot not try to full kill you immediately). Changes need to be made to the methods of killing a Bigfoot, maybe some type of (more difficult) live capture option as well (think like having to construct/flush bigfoot into a trap like Mountain Monsters). My friend and I sped run the game by blowing bigfoot up with fuel cans and traps. Once you play it that way once its hard to go another route (feels too arcade-y). A realistic option for hunting would be nice as well as more frequent map updates (also bring back V2's arctic map). Overall awesome game, been influenced by bigfoot since I was a kid and look forward to seeing more content. Maybe even an overhaul with BIGFOOT 2 :)

Date 2023-07-29 Playtime 30h 27m Rec Positive Okay. Its fun, but can get a little boring in single player. IT's a blast with friends and doesn't get old! Especially when one friend plays the role of "Bigfoot" I don't really have much to complain about here on an overall spectrum.   I love playing bigfoot and tormenting my friends..ALOT, as a human you really have to plan out your traps against a live player compared to the AI. Really keeps you on your toes. Bigfoot on the other hand is pretty nice! I just wish the jump could be more with your running momentum. instread of pressing jump and you just jump up with slight directional steering. I will continue to play and support this game.  
Date 2023-07-29 Playtime 1h 43m Rec Negative Boring a repetitive gameplay. Bigfoot just goes back to you after few minutes, you give him some damage, he gives you some, runs away and this repeats. He can see you through walls, you cant hide because after he sees you he is practically locked on you.

Date 2023-07-28 Playtime 121h 36m Rec Positive I would definitely recommend this game, although it could benefit from additional gameplay to prevent it from becoming repetitive. However, I believe an update is on the horizon, which should freshen up the experience.

Date 2023-07-27 Playtime 5h 54m Rec Positive Woodpig69 believes this is the greatest game to ever exist. Bigfoot just like Bigmike is a pyschological thriller where the bigfoot tries to kill you, just like when Bigmike tries to kill the mcdonalds bathroom!

Date 2023-07-27 Playtime 17h 3m Rec Positive I think this is a very fun game. Especially if you can convince a few friends to play it with you. I must beg that the devs put the update back though. The new update looked fantastic and everything and I don't know why people were complaining about it. I wish there was a way we could have chosen to roll back or not to the old version, I preferred the new version much better personally. I recommend this game, I do not recommend the old version over the newer one.

Date 2023-07-26 Playtime 12h 23m Rec Negative Not a bad game, but unfortunately these devs have proven to be epic games shills and are asking for account integration and also arguing with players in replies, don't believe me? Go see for yourself! They are saying using Unreal Engine means they are going to integrate epic accounts because of how much they love it? WORST way to get people to buy your game is to alienate people who already bought your game.

Date 2023-07-26 Playtime 17h 44m Rec Positive Ich muss sagen es ist ein super Spiel. Es ist allerdings sehr schade das auf der Karte Ross Lake Bigfoot noch einige Fehler hat und dort beispielsweise in der Wand eines Hauses oder einer Höhle stecken bleibt. Man kann ihn von dort aus zwar mit Glück mit einer Leuchtpistole befreien aber dies funktioniert nicht immer. Dies ist sehr schade aber ansonsten ist es ein wirklich sehr starkes Spiel und von mir eigentlich eine ganz klare Empfehlung.

Date 2023-07-26 Playtime 39h 56m Rec Positive The games fun to play with friends however with out using the zip lines the combat mechanics can be frustrating. I would also like to add more features such as new monsters, weapons, strategies, or maps to switch game play up since it can get bland after playing for a while.  I would also like to see more of a survival aspect focused on surviving a certain amount of time rather them simply fighting Bigfoot head on.
Date 2023-07-26 Playtime 25h 41m Rec Positive You must be really dedicated to get feet pics of Bigfoot, its worth it.

Date 2023-07-26 Playtime 7h 5m Rec Positive fun with friends
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 17h 44m Rec Positive Bigfoot was a fun game at the start. Me and a few friends bought this game and played it quite a bit. Left it as development and stopped and Bigfoot got boring to try and beat in a group of 2 (almost impossible) The maps are too big and no loot. No guns. No ammo half the time. (I know its a survival game, but walking around pointlessly before finding anything gets tedious half the time)  Now the update.  This game looks awful in UE5.  Everything looks super old, the textures look out of place now. The character models look odd, and animations are broken. Bigfoot constantly getting stuck in things, and running around in circles. He seems to know exactly where we are on the map at all times and gets very boring trying to hide from him at night.   The characters get stuck in things and clip through everything when getting thrown around by Bigfoot now. The gun animations look off and the game just seems like a very poorly copied and paste into UE5.  I don't have an issue with using Epic games and account, however I can understand why people want nothing to do with them and there are far more on Steam than anywhere else in the PC gaming community.  Moving to Epic Games store was a bad idea. You should have asked the community first and brought attention to what you was doing. While I appreciate the hell in your country and things are very difficult for you all and I wish you nothing but freedom and good health, you still need to tell your fan base what you are planning and get feedback. IF you had said about the EPIC games merger you would have found out about it before hand and saved countless hours putting this engine into UE5.   While I am all for UE5 because it looks amazing, you need to majorly invest in texture re-design and character models to fit the upgraded aesthetic. OR upgrade your own engine to support UE5 features such as better lighting and sound.   I appreciate you have to cooperate with companies above your station and try to bring in new players and audiences however, I think just maybe making a console version of the game crossplay in the future would be a better way to go than to force STEAM users to use an EPIC games account.  I do agree people are over-reacting to the whole EPIC thing, because almost every company on this planet as data on us trying to think otherwise is foolhardy. However the bad blood between EPIC and STEAM is very real and this should never have been considered.  I am glad you have re-rolled the game, but unfortunately I have no interest in playing this game now until the game is brought up to speed if you intend to update the game to make it more modern there are so many better ways to do this.   I thank you for all you have done and I did enjoy this game for a while, it is sad to see that this game will now be forever stained by the BIGFOOT of EPIC games.  Leaving a thumbs up for the developers as no hard feelings. Looking forward to the future of BIG BIGFOOT. :)  
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 18h 29m Rec Positive Why the revert i understand people hate epic but was it really necessary to roll back just fix some bugs and it would of been a very good update.

Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 2h 27m Rec Negative Turn The Fucking Epic Games Login Off
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 0h 53m Rec Negative Graphics bad, laggy, gameplay boring:  For a game running unreal engine 5 it looks... bad. It looks more like it was built on an old version of unity. I had on ultra settings and it looked like it was from 2010. Not to mention the fps tanked completely so I had to set it to high; still lagged and looked even worse. Water particles are just pngs cascading down really cartoonishly. Can't see anything through the incredibly grainy fog, and turning off the fog just allowed me to see more scuffed trees. The physics is incredibly jank too (you can go both ways on zip-lines??). Gun scopes don't zoom in, just overlays a crosshair on your screen. Actual gameplay is kinda boring, too. Played with two friends and most of it is just aimlessly walking around with the occasional encounter. Quite a disappointment, the old bigfoot gameplay looked better before all these updates.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 41h 41m Rec Negative This game is for you, if you like..:  ...Doing the same thing over & over, just on different maps. ...Figuring out the mechanics of the game & learning how to beat BigFoot in under 10min. ...Like installing EpicGames launcher. ...Unnecessary graphic updates, that not only are full of bugs and glitches, but also need a better PC to run them properly.  ...Developers that don't see the necessity in communicating their future plans or don't even bother with a road-map. ...A game with 0 progression/Grind  ...A game with a level indicator, that has no other use than letting you know... you're level 5 now... great!  This Game has been in Development since 2018, it had a rough start and a bumpy trip to where it is now. The Dev's plan to bring BigFoot out for consoles, but don't want to implement CONTENT (perks, simple crafting, skill tree's, different Bigfoot types, different guns and ammo, different team comps... and so much more that could be added) before they do that. The fact that the Dev's want to bring out this unfinished... game... to consoles (instead of making the game viable for the Community Workshop), makes me believe they want to make Money one more time and leave the sinking ship!  At the end of the day, BigFoot is DEAD, all hail BigFoot.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 4h 45m Rec Negative Adding mandatory Epic account linking post-launch is a scumbag move.

Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 1h 56m Rec Negative The game is just not fun.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 26h 37m Rec Negative nhu cc
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 4h 22m Rec Negative Had some fun with this when the game was initially released, put it aside to wait for more updates and refined gameplay. Now I found out that I will no longer be able to play this game purchased on Steam without having an Epic Games Store account. I am not even able to simply play vs AI. This whole shift doesn't make sense and I now have a non-functioning game. Guess there is no need to return afterall.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 5h 30m Rec Negative This game now requires you to have a shitty Epic Games account just to play the game. There is NO WAY to bypass it, so you'll need to make a Epic Games account or never play the game. Honestly you should choose the second option, until they remove it which is never gonna happen.  The game was really fun before they made it a requirement just to even play the game.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 125h 34m Rec Positive its a really good game
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 11h 44m Rec Negative Game now REQUIRES an EGS account to play since the 5.0 update with NO PRIOR WARNING for existing customers or new customers alike. They updated to UE5 without warning which means the system requirements for the game have also changed drastically since launch, with no reflection of such changes on the store page. It still says "Game is being developed on UE4" on the store page as of the writing of this review. My OS can no longer run the game, despite the Steam Store Page saying otherwise.  The ONLY saving grace is that they provide beta branches to older versions of the game that I can use to access a version I can play. However I will not change my review until the devs learn what they did was extremely unacceptable.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 21h 42m Rec Positive Edit - 7/26/23 - The developer took feedback into consideration and has pulled the requirement for an Epic Games Store account. While I'm a bit taken-back at some of their original response to a bit of criticism (especially in the now-deleted Steam announcement on 7/24), it's only fair I flip the thumb in response to their reversal of this decision.  It's a fun game, and due to this change I'll certainly play again. Infinite fun with friends.  ---------- Original Review:  Great game, but now requires an Epic Games Store (EGS) account to play.  Won't play again until it's removed.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 10h 26m Rec Negative forced you to connect an epic games account, they rolled it back, and its taking 3+ months to implement a new system. Hopefully it's up soon, but there hasn't been new content for a while.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 5h 46m Rec Negative Used to be moderately fun, however after years of basically no content being added or real fixes applied, the devs sold out and now rEqUiRe An EpIc GaMeS aCcOuNt to "unite the playerbase", "reach more customers" and "broaden horizons". IE: They get more kickback from Epic than on steam where your game has to actually be enjoyable and moderately supported to be successful.  Epic hasn't been worth a fuck for over a decade. Take your EA Jr.-ass shit the fuck on somewhere else.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 1h 16m Rec Negative I haven't played this game much. Bought it on sale last year and was waiting for more content or maybe full release before I got into it. Now that you are required to get an Epic Games Store account I must warn my fellow gamers against this game. Epic Games is an extremely predatory company and the last thing you want is them to get their claws on your Steam account. Look the game was just OK to begin with. Nothing special. The experience provided was nothing that you cant get from a thousand other developers on Steam that don't require you to sell your soul to Satan (China) to play their game. This should be a hard pass for everyone. I love supporting small developers and I find no joy in writing this review.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 14h 23m Rec Positive [strike]Like a sick animal often finds a hole to crawl into before dying, struggling devs often crawl into bed with EGS before going fully under. Time to do a 360 and walk away from this one. Sad.[/strike]  [b]Edit[/b]: Unexpectedly, I'm rescinding my original negative review. I think we are so used to developers just doing things regardless (and often in spite) of community feedback when it comes to undesirable/unwanted changes that I was actually a bit shocked to see them walk back the EGS requirement update.  These devs have my respect for listening to the majority feedback from the community. I'm willing to wait any amount of time for the other, desirable content that came with the update if it means I get to fully enjoy it without having to tie in to EGS for a Steam game. Many people don't want anything to do with EGS due to their business practices - myself included.  I want to thank CyberLight for their transparency, willingness to listen & respond, humility to learn from mistakes and the very real effort it takes to make this game great and fun for everyone. Take all the time you need on this, guys!
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 4h 25m Rec Negative it now need Epic game account... on a steam game..., also the game kinda boring, bigfoot always run aways if you do too much damage, you just chase him, and then he hide for the day and the day are long and booring, nothing to do after having run arround the entire map and got everything, you just wait for big foot to come to you and then he run aways if you do too much damage, wich make the game way too long, good concept but need more depth, it feel empty,  i dont feel like I am hunting bigfoot or that he is hunting me.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 26h 25m Rec Negative New EGS account linking has completely broken it for me meaning i cant play at all, amazing update
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 26h 0m Rec Positive Great survival game, slightly lacks a ton of replayability but with friends its a great little game.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 131h 42m Rec Positive Best Game I have ever bought.  Its fun and has a game play loop that will keep the player in engaged in the hunt for the Bigfoot.  It may seem this game has not much of a skill ceiling but you would be wrong as there are mechanics that will make you rethink your defenses or your attack.  The game was beautiful before but with the recent update it has became a artwork of creative genius through the use of unreal engine 5  and other lighting enhancers.  If you are bored and want something new to play I would highly urge you to try Bigfoot out as it has been a blast to play.   Thank you comrade for reading this review.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 6h 15m Rec Positive This game is a blast.  It looks amazing and I enjoy playing it with my friends.  The developers take time and listen to their player base, and to me that means a whole hell ova lot.  The work that this tiny team is able to get done is absolutely amazing and they deserve a ton of respect for what they do.
Date 2023-07-24 Playtime 26h 19m Rec Negative This game requires you to have an Epic Games account.   Up until recently, this game has been a very fun experience that I can share with friends. Unfortunately, an update was implemented that added the need to have an Epic Games account.  I understand why this is, as there are only two independent developers working on this. They are doing what is best for them and their game.  Many in the community feel cheated with this new requirement, asking for an option or some sort of toggle to forgo the requirement of an Epic Games account. At this time, the developers have stated this will not be an option.   It's a nice fun game otherwise, but a forced Epic Games account isn't the way for me.  It's only fair that new buyers are aware of this.

Date 2023-07-24 Playtime 9h 56m Rec Positive Not sure about all the Fuss with some players and EGS but this is a sensitive topic for some. For the record, I personally don't have a problem with it and didn't think twice about linking my Steam account . I look forward the crosplay options and see the bennifit for exposure to the game. The UR 5.0 update really gives the visuals some polish but the AI seems broken now and could use some improvement. Transitions into nightfall are definately spooky with earie lighting and mysterious sounds all around. On the first night I imediately set out for the woods to explore with nothing but my flashlight. There were a variaty of forest creatures about one of which was a bird (either Pheasent or Turkey) and it gave me a heck of a jump scare as I stumbled into and startled it, creating a flurry of wing flaps and sqwaks as it took off into the night. I ventured on and then encountered a  large Moose which I thought would destroy me but it had very little reaction. It just continued to stroll through the woods sounding a bit like a sick cow. I followed it for  a bit but got bored as it had no apparent reaction to me. I was on the Yellowstone map and found some nice unoccupied cabins to loot. I stocked up on some wepons and amo and then cranked up the radio in one of the lodges. Sure enough this atracted a Bigfoot and he started to angrily attack the cabin. I figured I would keep my distance while he was occupied and snipe him and blasted a few times with my rifle but with no reaction. He kept beating on the side of that lodge. I got closer and closer but still no reaction. I set traps and even lit fireworks up his a$$ but he just kept pounding on the side of the cabin. I got him down to about 1 HP  and he just stood there. I could see scars on his chest , a frightening mouth full of sharp teeth but apparently I was invisable as he didn't go for me at all. I had pumped him full of lead , was completely out of amo so I dealt the final death blow with my hunting knife. As I recall the AI Squatch was quite agressive in the previous version.  Regardless, Im sure the Dev's will adress this with some future patching. The real fun will always be PVP but it would be nice to some competent options for player vs AI. Still, the game is a lot of fun and I really hope to see it progress and highly reccomend it!   P.S. I did encounter a Bear on two occasions which was quite agressive.

Date 2023-07-24 Playtime 3h 54m Rec Negative This Steam game requires you to create and link an Epic gaming account, in order to play. The game was already really bad to begin with, this just makes it even worse. This title is now a hard 'DO NOT BUY'.
Date 2023-07-24 Playtime 39h 29m Rec Positive While the latest move left me on the fence line their swift response in setting it so you don't need an actual epic games account but just have the game run off a proxy one actually puts me back to positive. This small development team is hard at work trying to bring in new functions and meet player demands. I would advise purchasing it as it is fun for a round or two a day. It may have some bugs at the moment but they are working on fixing those and as the game says it is still in Early access where such bugs are common and mistakes can easily come and go from the development team. It especially impresses me as they don't just let that be an excuse to sit their with massive game issues though but instead work hard to fix them as quick as they can while communicating with the playerbase.
Date 2023-07-24 Playtime 11h 39m Rec Negative Now requires Epic Online Services to play. Unacceptable.
Date 2023-07-24 Playtime 19h 33m Rec Positive The devs put their fans before their own.  Revently there was an update which made an epic account mandatory, After a lot of negative feedback came in, the devs made the chad move of reverting the update.  For the gameplay, it is very fun, single as multiplayer. Impressive for a team of two.

Date 2023-07-24 Playtime 25h 48m Rec Negative Latest update ruined game performance. Bigfoot does not attack at night at all and when he does he runs away after taking 1 bullet. However, if he does choose to fight he has almost no cooldown now between swings. Lastly, and most certainly not least, the game forces you to connect to Epic games.

Date 2023-07-24 Playtime 110h 17m Rec Positive just a great game!
Date 2023-07-24 Playtime 13h 56m Rec Positive good game
Date 2023-07-24 Playtime 8h 40m Rec Positive I am revising my review in light of the rollback to 4.4. The developers are looking into something other than Epic's online services for the Steam version. I very much appreciate that. My issue was with Epic's forced account registration and linking specifically. I only buy games on Steam, GoG, and itch explicitly to avoid that company.  Now that I'm here, let's talk about Bigfoot. It's an interesting asymmetric game that combines aspects of exploration with a sort of give and take battle against the titular cryptid. You drive on to the map (ideally with some friends) with some basic gear and start hunting bigfoot. The game plays over six days, and from sunrise to sundown you need to explore, search for equipment left by his previous victims, and decide where you will make your stand. Once the sun goes down, bigfoot goes on the hunt. Interestingly, the hunters are about as dangerous to 'foot as he is to them, his main advantage being his enormous HP pool. If you have found some good weapons and traps and set up a good defensive position you should be able to repel him. If not, he can overwhelm you quickly. Once he's taken some hits he'll withdraw to rest and recover. You can try to give chase, but he might renew his attack and catch you in a bad position. The game plays out in these alternating phases as bigfoot's HP - as well as the hunter's ammunition and supplies - dwindle. The pace of the game is refreshing, it doesn't try to be breakneck action, it's not trying to be Dead by Daylight, and it has some genuinely tense moments when it's 11pm and bigfoot still hasn't attacked. You know he's going to. Do you dare try to set another trap? Could you make it to a better position? What if he's right around the corner right now?  In its current state the game has a few bugs, sometimes bigfoot just sort of...wanders off and forgets that you were fighting. It's easy enough to house rule that you just let him go when that happens. You can kill him trivially in that state and it spoils the challenge. Occasionally you can get stuck on objects, but generally you can wiggle free. There's a solid foundation here, and I look forward to what future developments will bring.

Date 2023-07-23 Playtime 12h 28m Rec Positive Yes. Do the harambe special
Date 2023-07-23 Playtime 6h 34m Rec Positive The folks at The Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization seem convinced the legendary creature exists, and if you check out their website there’s all sorts of interesting info.  And, one of the most interesting features is the sightings section where you can filter sightings accounts down to state and even county. Washington state has the most reported sightings with 708, and California is second with 461 followed by Florida with 338.  Pennsylvania is somewhere in the middle of the pack with 138 reported sightings.  Cumberland and Dauphin County each have no reports of Bigfoot sightings while Cambria and Allegheny are tied for the lead with nine reported sightings. Lancaster had one sighting all the way back in 2011.  Again, whether you believe in Bigfoot or not, folks are reporting that they are seeing things out and about.  Which brings us to recent Bigfoot activity in the Keystone State. And, well, 2022 wasn’t overly active in that department. In fact, the BFRO had just one reported sighting in Pennsylvania, and it was fairly recent.  In a report that it has deemed “very credible,” it says that two witnesses reported seeing a sasquatch walking along Ghost Town Trail in Cambria County. The report says the sighting took place between Ebensburg and Nanty-Glo.   Bigfoot Bigfoot also wasn't baking cookies in the report below, but it would have been pretty cool if he or she had been. John Dressler  The report is below:  “On October, 5, 2022 while my boyfriend and I were biking on the Ghost Town Trails near Ebensburg, PA we saw a bigfoot coming about 150 yards in front of us. He was walking along the trail toward us,” the reporting party wrote. “We couldn’t see his face. When he saw us he turned and quickly walked into the woods. We were shocked at what we saw. As we went by, we looked into the woods and didn’t see anything. We didn’t stop then but continued on until we finally stopped to talk about what we saw,  “It was really shocking,” they continued. “There were no sounds or smells. Didn’t get a look at his face but as he was walking you could see how big his stride was. There was a huge space between his legs. On the way back we stopped and looked around for prints and marks but didn’t see anything. The leaves were really heavy there and blowing all over.”  They close with, “We thought this was a once in a life time thing and thought it was so cool. Yes, Bigfoot does exist.”  And, just in case you think the BFRO just took a submitted report, the site reported that it did a follow up and spoke with the witnesses (it even names them on the site) and found their testimony to be “very credible.”

Date 2023-07-19 Playtime 105h 46m Rec Positive The game is very fun to play. However, Ai for Bigfoot needs quite a few upgrades. When Bigfoot is inside a house, its AI has difficulty reading the area and how to attack. This means that it stands still for some time, which causes it to lose a lot of HP.

Date 2023-07-14 Playtime 9h 19m Rec Positive     Explore uma floresta perigosa cheia de segredos            Finding Bigfoot é um game de terror e aventura com foco na exploração, tudo se passa após um grupo de turistas desaparecerem em um floresta, a polícia não investigou muito e reportou o desaparecimento como um acidente qualquer, é aí que o game começa. Um grupo de pesquisadores composto por três pessoas acredita que o desaparecimento está relacionado ao grande "mito" Pé Grande e então resolvem partir para o local em busca da verdade.            Ao começar o game, o jogador pode escolher entre três personagens, o objetivo é explorar a floresta para encontrar respostas, capturar o Pé Grande e provar que não é apenas uma lenda. Para isso, contamos com armadilhas, câmeras, uma arma e alguns acessórios para facilitar a busca e captura. O mapa é grande mas não é tão vivo, durante a jogatina foi possível notar apenas a presença de um cervo na floresta, além do Pé Grande.            Os gráficos do são belíssimos, o ciclo do dia é sutil e realístico, há belos efeitos de iluminação e a vegetação reage bem ao vento. A trilha sonora é bastante ausente, não há muito o que dizer sobre ela, a sonorização é simples e não chama atenção. A jogabilidade é simples e fluída, responde muito bem aos comandos, as vezes o jogador irá se deparar com algumas partes do solo "bugadas" onde é possível entrar e ver todo o mapa.            Por se tratar de um game em desenvolvimento, ainda há muitos bugs e pouco conteúdo, o jogo está em constante mudança e muita coisa nova será implementada, por enquanto ele cumpre bem o que promete, há um clima de terror e com certeza consegue deixar o jogador assustado em alguns momentos, talvez o preço esteja um pouco alto se comparado a outros games do gênero com mais conteúdo e um estágio de desenvolvimento mais avançado. Otimização não é um problema como na maioria dos jogos em acesso antecipado, Finding Bigfoot está muito bem otimizado.  Prós: Belos gráficos Boa jogabilidade Ótima ambientação Muito bem otimizado Modo Coop Cartas colecionáveis  Contras: Pouco conteúdo (ainda em desenvolvimento) Bugs de colisão (ainda em desenvolvimento)

Date 2023-07-11 Playtime 2h 24m Rec Positive good game, helps to have a full group of players though. you can have an open lobby and let random players join but unlike something like dbd this game does not automatically generate or rotate lobbies of people and it is not advisable if you are going to stream it.  good graphics and functions, the maps can be a little big and confusing for new players though so take your  time learning your surroundings. overall recommend.

Date 2023-07-09 Playtime 2h 56m Rec Negative Bigfoot ist viel zu stark, die Waffen sind viel zu schwach. Zudem ist man nirgends vor dem Vieh sicher, da es dem Spieler durch Wände hindurch Schaden zufügt. Dadurch ist ein Überleben der zweiten Nacht so gut wie unmöglich.

Date 2023-07-08 Playtime 6h 56m Rec Negative good concept but it's a bit basic and gets repetitive over time. also, it has an easy way to kill him, for example, just get into the water and shoot him... (i don't think devs took it into consideration)

Date 2023-06-27 Playtime 8h 33m Rec Positive Muy bueno
Date 2023-06-27 Playtime 7h 30m Rec Negative This game used to be fun when it first came out but now with the updates made it extremely difficult to beat big foot AI even on level 1 health and damage. I had fun playing with my wife and sister in law back then but now we don't find the loot we used to or even have a chance to beat the AI strategically placing traps/fuel/fireworks down. Game is unplayable now.
Date 2023-06-27 Playtime 20h 30m Rec Positive I don't even need to play for that long to confirm that this game is really fun. I was scared on my first run of the game, to the point where I just quit. Then I binge watched Markiplier's Finding Bigfoot series, which boosted my confidence enough to play with a friend, watching me play.
Date 2023-06-27 Playtime 8h 33m Rec Negative The game is good at what it is. It doesn't lie in the description or with the pictures, however I found that it's simply boring. It doesn't attract players and it doesn't seem like it keeps them.  The map is large, and there are weapons that you can use to shoot bigfoot. I guess my problem with it is that the maps are just huge, and the people you play with are what decides if the game is any good.  The game doesn't have enough structure for me and my gaming tastes.
Date 2023-06-27 Playtime 4h 32m Rec Positive its good
Date 2023-06-27 Playtime 11h 30m Rec Negative Bigfoot is a game about the well bigfoot! exciting right? well WRONG This represents bigfoot in a streotypical that is very harmful especially when the public already dislikes bigfoot, it shows bigfoot killing people (and WORSE animals!!!!) However bigfoot in real life is a sweet kind hearted individual  who simply has foot deformities.

Date 2023-06-26 Playtime 3h 27m Rec Negative Bad game, Might aswell get phas tbh
Date 2023-06-12 Playtime 26h 43m Rec Positive i think this is an amazing game,  there is 3 amazing maps with there own designs and buildings, Bigfoot has 3 game modes right now Players vs Players which is where someone controls  Bigfoot and the other players have to kill Bigfoot, the second game mode is players vs Ai which is an bot vs 4 players, and the last  game mode is player vs Ai which it is a 1v1 game mode where 1 player goes against a bot.  Another really nice thing is if you like achievement hunting this game is great for you with over 20 achievements. A really nice  thing about this game is that for every map Bigfoot has a different design almost as if there 3 different          big foots, not to mention there working on a new map which i know a lot of players are excited for.  there are 3 current maps Yellowstone park, Winter park, and Redwood park. Not to mention  the betas from 2017 - 2019 you could of play of the 3 maps included in here Glacier bay, Ross lake also gonna be the newer map, and Jasper national park. There isn't a release date for Ross lake yet but it will probably be the last and final map if they don't add it the old ones. Ross lake is a older map but i believe it's being reworked and its gonna be better then the last version.

Date 2023-06-12 Playtime 58h 1m Rec Positive This is a really good game, it has good graphics, has a good "story" (If you can call it that) and make it easy for you to understand what your object is but it gets boring real fast.. After just some rounds, you stop liking the game and it loses the entertainment and excitement. The game is enjoyable when you have friends to play with. The game loses the fun and excitement just after some rounds on each map. It doesn't take that long to explore each map and know where everything is located.

Pois os Detalhes que me deram Vontade para Jogar esse Jogo é que no Jogo da Aranha do ROBLOX tem o Primeiro Jornal no Sótão Dizendo...  Um Homem que Vive na Cabana Enlouqueceu. Ele está Fazendo Alegações Terríveis de que Viu um Inseto Gigante como uma Criatura na Floresta em que Reside. esses Tipos de Alegações se Alinham com os Avistamentos do Pé Grande. em Todos os meus Anos de Cobertura de Notícias, esse é um dos mais Loucos. Talvez ele tenha Passado um Tempão demais Assistindo à Filmes de Ficção Científica! Nesta Era Tecnológica Avançada em que Vivemos, eu Poderia Dizer: "Fatos ou Não Aconteceu!"  daí a Gente Pode Ver que Aquela Pessoa que tá Enterrada naquele Túmulo na Cabana que ela já Acabou Morrendo, esse Jornal é no Passado. Diz que ela Encontrou uma Criatura Parecida com uma Aranha Gigante. e o Pessoal não Tava Acreditando nele, até Falou que Parecia com Pé Grande, aquela Histórinha do Pé Grande que todo Mundo Sabem que é Mentira. então ele tava Duvidando desse Cara. ele Acabou Morrendo e a Gente Sabe Toda à Verdade que no ROBLOX essa Aranha Existe.  em Seguida tem o Segundo Jornal na Direita Dizendo...  Uma Atualização Terrivelmente Trágica da História que Abordamos Recentemente o Lenhador Chamado Nick Channey, 72 Anos, que Alegou ter Visto "Aranhas Gigantes" Matou sua Própria Esposa. Ele Claramente é Verdadeiramente Louco. Ele Fez um Telefonema de Emergência para as Autoridades Afirmando que sua Casa estava "Sendo Atacada por Monstros". as Autoridades Chegaram ao Local Após a Ligação e Encontraram a Esposa de Nick, Lauren, 67 Anos, Morta no Local. o Relatório da Polícia Afirma que Nick é o Principal Suspeito do Assassinato de Lauren Channey. Nick está Atualmente em Prisão Domiciliar Enquanto Aguarda a sua Decisão.  então só Corrigindo tudo Isso aqui então no Jogo da Aranha do ROBLOX o Lenhador ainda está Vivo e quem ta Naquele Túmulo que ta na Casa é a Esposa dele Lauren Channey e então pelo que Pode Ver quando a Gente Passa por essa Cabana no Jogo da Aranha do ROBLOX o Lenhador ele ainda Continua Vivo e onde que ele foi Parar, porque a Gente Entrou na Casa e a Gente não Encontrou Ninguém. será que nós Veremos ele nos próximos Capítulos? e já Faz 3 Anos que Ainda não Saíram Novos Capítulos no Jogo da Aranha do ROBLOX e eu Ando Esperando demais desde 2021. então a Lauren Channey Acabou sendo Morta Pela Aranha Gigante e como que vai Terminar essa História.  mas também para terminar tem uma Menssagem Escrita no Meio dos dois Jornais no Sótão que é "They're Wrong!!" que Seria "Eles estão Errados!!" é Isso mesmo então Eles estão Errados. foi o Próprio Lenhador que ainda ta Vivo que Escreveu Isso.  e então Vocês Podem Ver aí que Realmente toda essa Hístória do Jogo da Aranha do ROBLOX Parece Macabra e Muito Sinistra e a Gente não Sabe como que vai Acabar Isso.  e então tudo Isso foi oque me deu Vontade para Jogar esse Jogo do Pé Grande, Principalmente o Primeiro Jornal da história do Jogo da Aranha do ROBLOX Falando de Pé Grande.  EM FIM, ESPERO QUE TENHAM GOSTADO DE TODO ESSE ASSUNTO.

Date 2023-06-07 Playtime 18h 39m Rec Positive El juego esta bien.  Los graficos bastante bien, la optimizacion regular. Las armas son muy MUY lamentables, las animaciones nada realistas y se sienten muy flojas. Los mapas son muy buenos.  El sonido esta bien.  Me gusta la idea del juego de ser perseguido por pie grande, aunque me gustaría mas mecanicas, como lootear recursos para fabricar armas, cocinar para curarte cazando animales, etc.  Por el precio es meh, yo que ustedes lo agarro en oferta.

Date 2023-06-05 Playtime 23h 12m Rec Positive Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives, that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here, have, thus far, so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

Date 2023-06-03 Playtime 31h 11m Rec Positive Very fun game (if you have a couple friends). Play as Bigfoot or one of the Bigfoot enthusiasts. Rounds often last a long time (I've had some rounds last an hour or more). Play on one of three maps with varying size and features, and loot the buildings as the survivors, looking around for better weapons and managing ammo. As Bigfoot, hunt the survivors and kill them, eat trash or kill animals and eat them in order to regain health. Use your abilities (a roar that locates the general area of the survivors, a dash that knocks survivors down, a grab that slams the survivors on the ground, and a rage mode in which you deal more damage and take less damage) in order to kill them. The survivors can collect 4 totems scattered around the map they can bring a survivor back to life by finding their corpse and carrying it to an altar. There is a day and night cycle, where bigfoot takes less damage during the night. Survivors win when they kill Bigfoot, Bigfoot wins when he kills all the survivors.

Date 2023-06-03 Playtime 71h 29m Rec Negative This game has serious issues.    Steam can't keep getting away with licencing stupid games like this. It's online co-op doesn't work. it's like playing Russian roulette with 5/6 bullets and pulling the trigger 6 times. And if you want to play with random people everyone kicks you out with no provocation, there's a private mode for a reason. Honestly buying this game will lower IQ, I wish I never bought this dumb game it really needs to be burned. Playing with people is like asking a prison inmate to be your personal butler, it just doesn't work.

Date 2023-05-27 Playtime 2h 46m Rec Negative This was highly disappointing, it wasn't scary at all, BigFoot comes at you front on, there's no lurking to build up the tension, there's piss poor 'tree knocking' every now and then. But that's it, I don't recommend this game as a good horror game, Rake got me more on edge than this one. It for me just didn't get me scared at all, not one bit, not the kind of scared I wanted, I got jumped scared sure, but that was it, didn't feel like I was being stalked by BigFoot, when I heard the knocking of the tree, there he was a few minutes later charging at myself and who I was playing with. And he'd continue to attack, not run after getting hit once or even five times, which for me, took out some of the 'mystery' of the beast.  I guess I was looking at this to be like 'Rake', where the creature was allusive and just not always up in your face.   Just on a horror stand point, I don't recommend this game, well unless you find horror gaming just being jumped scared.
Date 2023-05-27 Playtime 3h 54m Rec Positive Ive been following this game since its creation watching Markiplier, VanossGaming and H2O Delirious play it and i Loved the gameplay. Fast Forward a few years and its not the nostalgic one i grew up with... but it is still a hell of a lot of fun none the less!! The Controls were a little hard at fist but it is still a blast to play!! Highly recommend for anyone who likes survival horrors and FPS games!!

Date 2023-05-22 Playtime 22h 29m Rec Positive Bigfoot, huh? The legendary creature that's been lurking in the shadows, playing hide and seek with the world. Well, let me tell you something, Bigfoot. You may think you're elusive, but you can't hide from Duke Nukem.  I've dealt with aliens, monsters, and all sorts of freaks, but you, Bigfoot, you're in a league of your own. I've heard tales of your massive size and legendary strength, but let me make one thing clear: I'm Duke Nukem, and I'm not intimidated by anything, not even a furry myth.  So, Bigfoot, if you're out there, watching, listening, know this: I'm coming for you. You can run, you can hide, but eventually, you'll feel the wrath of my mighty boot. And when that day comes, the world will know that even Bigfoot couldn't withstand the force that is Duke Nukem.

Date 2023-05-22 Playtime 5h 24m Rec Negative Absolutely not worth the price. One of the most overpriced games I've seen on steam. Maybe 2-6 hours of real play-ability before the game loop gets stale. Player-controlled bigfoot is disgustingly unbalanced. (I kill the entire team in like 10 minutes and take <1% damage). My friends are frustrated, I'm frustrated. Nobody is having fun. Yes, I'm aware you can play this game for hours and learn all the little quirks, but god it doesn't feel worth it.   AI-controlled bigfoot is an exploitable mess that is like a shambling bullet sponge that doesn't understand basic tracking. Touch water? He backs off -- rinse and repeat the entire night. Cameras are useless, drone is useless. Boring. Cheap. Mess.   PLEASE spend your money elsewhere. I expect the hostile dev team to come after me for this review, but so be it.   Also, there's like 2-3 player lobbies at any given time with blatant slurs as lobby names there like ALL day. Lazy, asset flip, overpriced, tired..... garbage.

Date 2023-05-21 Playtime 14h 32m Rec Positive I love the game. You feel anxiety and stress while you're being hunted.  A few nit picks though:  AI Health seems a bit high. Was playing 2p and he seemed nigh unkillable unless you had a trap SURROUNDED by explosives and even then, he took a lot to drop.  I wish you could pause this. Some games take a while, so woe to whomever has to pee. Or if private, being able to save and return would be awesome.  The revive system is useful, but tedious. Find idols take a while to find. If you're in a 2p game and one of you dies, good luck to the survivor trying to either run around during the day (which seems a bit shorter than nights) or trying to run around at night and face off with Bigfoot.  All in all, I really enjoyed this game. Gave me some Alien Isolation vibes. I'd recommend it. You def want a full lobby though.

Date 2023-05-20 Playtime 3h 13m Rec Positive Welcome to our trek into the uncharted territories of the game BIGFOOT, a multiplayer survival horror game developed by CyberLight. With its unique twist on the survival genre, BIGFOOT offers a heart-pounding experience that pits players against the legendary creature in a dense and atmospheric forest environment.  Gameplay: The core gameplay of BIGFOOT is based around a group of players working together to hunt down the elusive creature, using an array of equipment such as traps, cameras, and weapons. As you traverse the vast forest, you must manage your resources, set traps, and use your wits to outsmart BIGFOOT. If you're feeling brave, you can even take on the role of BIGFOOT himself in a player vs. player mode, adding an extra layer of depth and replayability.  Audio and Music: BIGFOOT excels in the audio department. The eerie forest sounds, the chilling roars of BIGFOOT, and the ambient noise truly immerse the player into the wilderness. Music is used sparingly, primarily for dramatic effect, keeping players on edge and intensifying the moments of confrontation.  Story: While BIGFOOT does not offer a traditional narrative, the game's lore is built around the concept of tracking down the mythical creature. There's an inherent sense of mystery and intrigue that propels players forward, despite the lack of a structured storyline.  Difficulty: The game's difficulty can be quite challenging, especially when playing as the hunters. Cooperation and strategy are vital to overcome the cunning AI of BIGFOOT. As the creature, the game offers a thrilling, albeit different, challenge of evasion and attack.  Price: BIGFOOT is priced reasonably, considering its replayability and unique premise. The game offers enough content to justify its cost and has the potential to provide hours of exciting gameplay.  Critique: Although BIGFOOT offers a unique premise and an intense multiplayer experience, it does have some shortcomings. The game could benefit from more varied environments and gameplay elements to prevent it from becoming repetitive over time. Additionally, the AI could use some fine-tuning to increase the challenge presented by BIGFOOT.  Conclusion: In all, BIGFOOT is a thrilling and atmospheric game that provides a fresh take on the survival horror genre. Its co-op gameplay and the option to play as the legendary creature itself offer a unique experience for players. While it does have its flaws, the excitement and suspense it generates make it worth a try for any fan of horror and survival games. Venture into the woods if you dare, but be prepared - BIGFOOT is waiting!
Date 2023-05-20 Playtime 15h 35m Rec Positive uhhhh, it's a lot of yelling between friends and a lot more of shitting your pants. It's much more fun without the npc bigfoot, since you can play without it rocking your shit. pretty good.  7/10

Date 2023-05-19 Playtime 21h 54m Rec Positive It's coming for me, I can hear it's roars in the distance. My friends are dead, and my bullets are growing fewer with every encounter. Even the daytime is not safe, but then at east I have a chance to see it coming. Despite its sheer size we rarely saw it coming until it was upon us, and that's assuming it even approached. Cunning as it was, it would throw signs at us like deadly spears and plant tripwire traps in the most inopportune places. We've shot it a dozen times, and even while it leaves a trail of blood when it finally retreats I'm growing less and less confident that it won't kill me long before its wounds even inconvenience it. I can run, but never for too long, and by now I've realized that it can track me better than I can track it. There is no door it can't break down, no window it can't reach into and tear me apart from, no certainty I can make it to morning. If I do, maybe I can find the last of the evidence I need to get the hell out of this wilderness of death.

Date 2023-05-16 Playtime 47h 47m Rec Positive amazing game one the best I have played the co op is the funnest with friends.
Date 2023-05-16 Playtime 25h 22m Rec Positive BIGFOOT is dumb as hell and most of the time you play it you have no idea what you're doing. Every now and then something stupid happens and depending on whether or not you've been playing for more than 20 minutes it will either be the funniest thing you've every seen or so annoying it make you wan to blow your brains out. The game has changed 100 times and its probably objectively better now but the old finding Bigfoot guide that was in the original version that read like it was fresh out of google translate was the best feature the game has ever had so removing it was a massive downgrade for me. Also the stamina bar addition was basically BIGFOOT's 9/11. Also if you are capable of losing as Bigfoot in PvP you need to be sectioned. Strong 6/10 (7 if they bring the book back)
Date 2023-05-15 Playtime 2h 54m Rec Positive HOW DO I ADD A PARTER

Date 2023-05-09 Playtime 5h 14m Rec Negative game is repetitive. no exploring, mostly the same, buy shit like people playground. if the price was like 12$ i would forgive it but 25$ plus tax is just to much for it. dont buy if u want a good game. wait or get something else.
Date 2023-05-09 Playtime 40h 50m Rec Positive It's pretty good though it can get pretty repetitive after a few games.
Date 2023-05-09 Playtime 12h 20m Rec Positive The gameplay was fun, but they could have made bigfoot sexier. 6/10

Date 2023-05-08 Playtime 9h 45m Rec Positive I would highly recommend I cam in my pants more times then I could count at the sight of such a big muscular man dominating me. (was lots of fun till I memorized the maps)
Date 2023-05-08 Playtime 5h 6m Rec Positive bello come gioco open world cercare di uccidere il bigfoot dove può essere pure un amico il bigfoot e certe volte ti viene quella ansia quando ti senti dietro il bigfoot molto bello ancora più divertente con degli amici

Date 2023-05-07 Playtime 45h 2m Rec Positive Man i love feet
Date 2023-05-07 Playtime 1710h 27m Rec Positive "I've been playing BIGFOOT for a while now, and let me tell you, this game is scarier than my mother-in-law's cooking. Every time I hear that big, hairy beast stomping around in the woods, I feel like I'm about to lose control of my bladder. And that's saying something, because I'm a grown man. But the real terror comes from trying to navigate the terrible driving mechanics. It's like trying to steer a fridge down a hill with no brakes. So if you're looking for a game that will make you jump out of your seat and pee yourself, then BIGFOOT is the game for you."

Date 2023-05-06 Playtime 27h 4m Rec Positive First of all love the game. Me and a few of my friends play it and its fun to hunt them down and kill them. Event hunting the AI is fun. Especially when your in a house with your friends and waiting then he comes into the house full force and kills them, its so fun 10/10!
Date 2023-05-06 Playtime 98h 0m Rec Positive Hairy monki
Date 2023-05-05 Playtime 17h 22m Rec Positive very fun yet scary
Date 2023-05-05 Playtime 11h 15m Rec Negative At first glance this game has a lot of potential. Sorth of a mix between Phasmofobia and Dead by Daylight with a little bit of The Forest thrown in. But after playing against the AI for a while some of the problems with the gameplay begin to appear. The biggest of them being that there is no convenient way to fight off bigfoot. Bullets do next to nothing, you can't hide or look yourself in and you can't run away. So the only thing you really can do is use the ziplines to get away and jump back on when he gets close. Also the main objectives, finding the evidence can be really tedious at times. Finding scratches on trees can take ages cause there are so many trees and the maps are pretty big. If there was a less tedious way of finding the evidence, or just more of it, and a more convenient way to either hide from, or scare away bigfoot I think I would give this game a positive rating. But at it's current state I am mostly riding ziplines back and forth during the night and staring at trees during the day.

Date 2023-05-03 Playtime 14h 5m Rec Negative I get this is still an early access game but for how long it has been out this game is incredibly difficult. Guns only do so much damage on even the lowest health setting for the bigfoot. I ended up lucking out in my lobby and got glitched into a corner that let me fire off about 50 shots into his head to finish things off. Fun with friends, and definitely scary, but I don't think I'd spend $20 on this again. A little buggy but in a funny way. Overall, a fun experience but more due to the people I was with.
Date 2023-05-03 Playtime 2h 57m Rec Positive scary oh no;~;

Date 2023-05-01 Playtime 25h 23m Rec Positive While it's got it's quirks, it's definitely a fun game to play WITH friends. I don't like playing with random people online as you can't properly communicate with other very well. As for Steam Deck users, it runs really well, and is very playable after you map all of your inputs. The game isn't controllable right after download. Overall a solid B!

Also nicht kaufen, wenn ihr allein spielen wollt. Trotzdem Daumen hoch. Weils kontinuierlich weiter entwickelt wurde und wird und es perse eben ein gutes Game ist. Würde mich freuen, wenn es für nicht Hardlinder wie mich auch im Singleplayer zu schaffen wäre. Dann würde ich es auch grinden. Es gibt nämlich ein Level-System. Was es bewirkt weiß ich bis dato noch nicht. Trotz Konsumierens von Lets-Plays by Fooster und Co.

Date 2023-04-30 Playtime 17h 15m Rec Positive I really hope no one with a foot fetish plays this game, you'll be extremely disappointed when you find out you don't see his BIG FOOT. Jokes aside, It's a great game, nice game play, nicely designed maps and good horror elements and can be very entertaining with friends. I strongly recommend if you and your friends like survival horror games. Even solo this game can be fun.

If you play this game, you will love basically everything about it. The maps are huge with many locations within each one. The time and energy put into this game is very noticeable.   Please Developers don't give up on this game unless you plan to make another Bigfoot. If you make another game like this one, I would be very pleased. For a few guys to make a game like this it is very impressive. Goodluck on your future and I hope your families are safe.

Date 2023-03-04 Playtime 107h 28m Rec Positive (Review subject to change)  Update 6/15/23: Horrible bug where Bigfoot cannot be stunned and doesn't take damage from explosives. My friend got teleported outside the map when I saved after they left. Some game breaking stuff.  I hate playing with randos so I strictly got this to play with friends and solo, went in 100% blind and we've had fun getting to learn on our own; we like challenge so maxed bigfoot with low item pool makes for a tense game. While collecting evidence is one way to beat the game, in the future I hope for more evidence/gadgets to make that route more appealing VS hunting bigfoot himself. The visuals are fine and its not a horribly buggy game, one bad bug we've had is bigfoot will sometimes get stuck in a walking loop and can be cheesed (he goes back to normal if allowed to escape). My biggest issue is if killed you're BORED senseless, at least let me respawn as harmless animal to roam or help friends until I'm revived? better than being stuck watching my corpse be carried for 15 minutes. I see potential for this game its fun solo and with friends so far.

Date 2023-02-28 Playtime 13h 19m Rec Positive I have had a lot of fun with this game and obviously that might just be me, but its a really fun game to play especially if your bored or want to be paranoid constantly. The encounters with bigfoot are very funny and worrying at the same time especially when your out of supplies and wandering thorugh the woods at night trying to find supplies to heal and if he does come, to make your final stand. one thing though, its probably just my pc being trash but I have a gtx 1660 super, 48GB of ram and an intel i5, but my PC seems to be dying while playing this. But again thats probably just my PC...

Date 2023-02-28 Playtime 16h 32m Rec Positive its a fire game
Date 2023-02-27 Playtime 17h 32m Rec Positive A silly game to play a round on as either Bigfoot or a Hunter. There are two ways to win as a Hunter. One of them requires killing Bigfoot, but the other win condition forces Bigfoot to stop the Hunters from gathering evidence and leaving. Playing as Bigfoot feels balanced as Bigfoot is stronger at night while lacking any tracking capabilities or buffs during the day, but can still be menacing if they find someone alone during the day. Hunters have a wide variety of counters to stun Bigfoot and juke the attacks. The game looks decent and it runs well, so overall it is a solid experience.
Date 2023-02-27 Playtime 5h 34m Rec Positive lol micro transactions in  "early access"
Date 2023-02-27 Playtime 17h 54m Rec Positive The legends of Bigfoot go back beyond recorded history and cover the world. In North America – and particularly the Northwest – you can hear tales of seven-foot-tall hairy men stalking the woods, occasionally scaring campers, lumberjacks, hikers and the like.  Bigfoot is known by many titles with many different cultures although the name Bigfoot is generally attributed to the mountainous Western region of North America. The common name Sasquatch comes from the Salish Sasquits, while the Algonquin of the north-central region of the continent refer to a Witiko or Wendigo. Other nations tell of a large creature much like a man but imbued with special powers and characteristics. The Ojibway of the Northern Plains believed the Rugaru appeared in times of danger and other nations agreed that the hairy apparition was a messenger of warning, telling man to change his ways.  -Washington National Guard (1855)
Date 2023-02-27 Playtime 17h 25m Rec Positive Bigfoot Adventure is an absolute masterpiece! From the breathtaking landscapes to the heart-pounding encounters, this game truly immerses you in the thrill of the hunt. The attention to detail is astonishing, with every leaf rustle and distant howl adding to the suspense. The sense of exploration is unparalleled, as you traverse dense forests and murky swamps in search of the legendary Bigfoot. The gameplay mechanics are smooth and intuitive, allowing for seamless navigation and intense action sequences. But what truly sets this game apart is its ability to capture the essence of adventure, leaving you on the edge of your seat with every twist and turn. Prepare to embark on the journey of a lifetime and discover the truth behind the myth of Bigfoot. Interesting, fun gameplay for a multiplayer game, but bigfoot needs nerf because it's so overpowered that it's hard to beat. When playing singleplayer it is very impossible to win, some bugs please fix it. ∞  Recomended to play 4/5

Date 2023-02-27 Playtime 6h 47m Rec Positive "Who could that be, knocking at my door" HOLY SHIT IT'S MFING BIGFOOT- On a serious note, I absolutely adore this game, because while it may be a bit janky in a lot of aspects, it stills provides an extremely fun experience with your friends that can lead to moments where you are scared out of your fucking mind. it's a lot at first to learn, but gradually getting the hang of using all the mechanics to help find Bigfoot is very fun, and the open world looting aspects gives the game a lot more depth!

Date 2023-02-26 Playtime 15h 18m Rec Positive Only fun if you're playing with others. Single-player on the easiest mode is really difficult for me, and although it is fun at times, it's simply too unpolished and unbalanced for my time, unless I'm playing with friends. In my opinion, the game is overpriced for what it is. However, if you're able to get a group together, definitely play this.

Zudem ist dieser Gorilla artige affe fast unsterblich und enorm stark.  es macht einfach keinen spaß über 1 stunde in einer runde zu verbringen um den affe mit über 500 schuss erstmal die hälfte an leben weg zu reißen.  keine empfehlung  Liebe grüße Eure königliche heiligkeit Dorian

Date 2023-02-25 Playtime 24h 43m Rec Positive Not played it too much yet, Love the feeling you get in game it feels like a forest and all the noises are distracting. Not fond of how quick he can find you, and you cannot hide from him at all. I was having a great game on solo, but had to answer my door when i got back i was dead, i did not realise it did not pause which is stupid.  I needs balancing for when ream mates are dead, as they have nothing to do, maybe give them a drone or camera access, or a remote controlled drone. Could do with a few new weapons and maybe give Bigfoot an item he can Shield him self like a car door Giving this a positive review for how i feel once I`ve played, as it leaves a smile on my face

Date 2023-02-24 Playtime 28h 9m Rec Negative An sich ist Bigfoot für zwischendurch ja ganz nett, aber dafür dass es seit 2017 released wurde, passiert einfach nichts. Bis heute immer noch im Early Access, Updates so gut wie keine. Habt ihr euch eigentlich schlafen gelegt?  Frage mich bei so viel positiven Bewertungen auch, ob wir alle das selbe Game spielen ?   Es gibt aktuell nur 3 Maps. Entweder ist einer aus dem Team Bigfoot oder man spielt als Team oder Einzelspieler gegen den KI. Die Stärke, Schaden und Loothäufigkeit ist hierbei einstellbar.  Pro Map sind die Orte  von Camps etc. und Fundorte der Leichen immer gleich. An Grafik und Sound ist nichts zu bemängeln. Wir sind einmal als Spieler im Stein stecken geblieben, der Biggi hängt am Hang bei Yellowstone  oder Redwood fest, so dass man ohne Angriff einfach draufballern kann. Plumpst der Spieler runter und ist geknockt, so darf man warten bis dieser ausgeblutet ist...   Zudem ist das Ende einer Runde die größte Katastrophe. Hat man Biggi erledigt, wird einfach eine Rückfahrt vom Wohnmobil aus dem Park eingeblendet. Richtig Episch halt. Und dann ? ... Ein bisschen mehr Aktion, mehr Maps, mehr Abwechslung ins Game bringen .. Ist aktuell unglaublich langweilig und auch nur mal für "zwischendrin" gut.  Das Game ist den Zwanni meines Erachtens nicht wert. Leider Daumen runter.

Date 2023-02-23 Playtime 30h 21m Rec Positive This game is definitely unpolished and could use some improvement, but the game is there, and it's solid. I love playing with my friends and just messing around sometimes, and its survival horror style is awesome. The first time you play, you'll probably shit your pants, but the more you play the more you learn and it gets more competitive and it feels more like you're hunting bigfoot than vice versa. I highly recommend as long as the devs stay in development of the game. (it can be really addictive sometimes)

Date 2023-02-19 Playtime 12h 54m Rec Negative Крайне не рекомендую покупать эту игру по одной очень простой причине: неадекватное поведение разработчиков. Серьезно. У игры огромный был бы потенциал если бы не поведение тех, кто её создал.  [u]Плюсы самой игры[/u]: графика, какое-никакое развитие и улучшение локаций с геймплеем. Это действительно самый лучший аналог игры "Рейк".  [u]Минусы[/u] 1. Поведение разработчиков: - Они [b]в обсуждениях своей игры поливают грязью русских людей даже если те купили их игру[/b]. Вот вам яркий пример: Я в одном из обсуждений [b]этой игры[/b] написала, что не считаю правильным поведение разработчиков. Я [b]не считаю правильным то, что они пропагандируют русофобию и оскорбительно относятся даже к тем, кто купил их игру[/b]. Я [u]не высказала ни своё политическое мнение, ни какие-то грубости в адрес кого-либо[/u]. Однако на меня буквально налетел один человек который, ого, имеет статус разработчика. Он начал мне [b]грубить[/b], приплетать зачем-то политику. Несмотря на то, что я высказывала свое мнение адекватно и просто [b]осуждала оскорбления разработчиков в сторону русскоязычных людей[/b] - этот разраб просто меня [b]необоснованно забанил[/b] в обсуждениях. Там даже причины не было, человеку просто [u]не понравилось то, что я (внезапно) не поддерживаю оскорбления в чей-то счет[/u]. Благо администрация Стима приняла меры в отношении этого разработчика. [spoiler](В моей группе в ВК есть скриншоты с этой перепиской, если что).[/spoiler] - Искренне жаль, что я когда-то давно купила эту игру. С удовольствием вернула бы деньги за неё. Скрыла из своей библиотеки. - Ещё один минус это то, что Бигфут (как персонаж) очень дисбалансный. Его невозможно завалить соло без кампании людей.  - Баги, как например то, что монстр проваливается сквозь текстуры. Или то, что сам игрок может налететь на камень и провалиться в "Затекстурье". - Не советую покупать эту игру ибо [u]разработчикам все равно, покупали вы эту игру или нет, им важно - русский вы или нет[/u]. Они притягивают политику туда, куда не стоит. И ведут себя неадекватно по отношению к тем, кто купил их игру. [b]По их мнению вас, если вы из РФ или Беларуси, следует унижать и оскорблять[/b]. А за попытки осудить неадекватное поведение вы получите бан.

Date 2023-02-13 Playtime 26h 37m Rec Positive I personally fell in love with this game. While the mechanics tend to be scuffed in multiplayer matches (especially when playing as Bigfoot, my favorite way to play), single-player can be a great time. It's a great game, 7/10. It has the potential to be 10/10 if the developers ever fix the bugs.

Date 2023-01-18 Playtime 1h 16m Rec Negative Purchased this game and refunded. The only thing you need to know is Bigfoot takes about 4000 rounds of ammo to kill. He effectively would have more holes than swiss cheese and he doesn't care. That's the difficulty of the game. It's not mechanics, it's not hard, it's just he is not effected by firearms unless you just put enough lead in him to quadruple what he weighs. "Fun."

Date 2023-01-18 Playtime 10h 0m Rec Positive I REALLY need to make some friends so I can play this game the way it's meant to be. Solo made me poop my pants, my son (who is 4 years old) thought I overreacted.   The graphics are not demanding at all, runs on my steam deck very well for an indie title. but the environment is well designed, really is what makes the visual aspect fun and creepy.  The sound design is 10 for 10. Literally knocked it out of the park with the sound, so turn off the lights and pump up the sound, I have a 5.1 PC sound system and it its fantastic, I'd imagine headphones would be nearly overwhelming.  I haven't played as the Bigfoot, but I'd imagine it is fun if not just as complicated as being a hunter.  Doesn't hold your hand, which is refreshing. I think that doing something unique with a tutorial would help new players. Maybe the developers could make a "Bigfoot Hunter Certification Course", and poke fun at the community while teaching people how do the basics.   Needs an official Steam Deck Controller Layout. Controls are a little basic and sometimes annoying. Not enough public lobbies.   There needs to be a Steam 4 pack deal so it would be easier getting friends to join in!  Easily an 8/10 game. Way worth the price.

Date 2023-01-18 Playtime 0h 35m Rec Negative You don't hunt bigfoot, bigfoot hunts you. The premise is cool but there are many balancing issues. Bigfoot is a bullet sponge that you can shoot in the head 100 times and not kill

Date 2023-01-17 Playtime 62h 52m Rec Positive Revision: Me and my buddy have been playing this game for a few months now and enjoying ourselves. We turn bigfoot's damage and health down so he doesn't destroy us. I think the default settings for bigfoot make him extremely difficult and almost impossible to beat if you don't have 4 players. The game looks great but has FAR too many random noises. Bigfoots traps are extremely unrealistic in their placement and the roar you hear from bigfoot does not audio locate from his position. (Ex: You can see him run off in front of you and then get a roar from behind you) I revised my review to reflect my recent gaming experience where I lowered bigfoot's stats and was actually able to have fun.  Original Review: Have played this game on and off over the years and it's always the same. Load in, grab your stuff, get ready for bigfoot who will eventually find you and then get DESTROYED by bigfoot. There is very little chance you can actually beat bigfoot. I have only seen bigfoot killed once and the players exploited a bug which got bigfoot stuck. This game needs some serious balancing. Not worth $20 in it's current form... This is a $5 game.
Date 2023-01-17 Playtime 23h 8m Rec Positive The Game is pretty good for early Access. Is this the final stage or will there be more to enhance the final game products to make it even better  ( my fingers are crossed this game has potential) who know cause again its early access. There are 3 game modes Team V Player, Team V AI and Player V AI (1v1). You can Kill Bigfoot as it hunts you or you can Collect Evidence: If you don't want to fight Bigfoot or you want a larger challenge, This would entail getting photos of the bodies of the missing tourists, Bigfoot footprints, tree scratches, and of Bigfoot itself. It seems like you get 1 night of peace to set up and search but by the second night it will hunt you day or night. Attacking can be short or long not sure what the factors are that determine the attack duration.  Anyways Being that I live in Washington this game is pretty funny to me cause bigfoot has a very big folklore stories and even superstitions   At the end of the day if you like to hunt or be hunted, you like to explore and find evidence this is the game for you

Date 2023-01-15 Playtime 150h 4m Rec Negative 06/25/24:  Originally, I recommended this game.  Not any more.  This game needs to be removed from Steam for purchase.  With the 3 updates (5.0.1, 5.0.2, 5.0.3) in October 2023 and then 5.1.0 in November 2023, the game became unplayable and no fun.  Bigfoot gets stuck all the time in various places around the map and you can't save your game.  Loading the previous version is messed up also as you can no longer save a game which before the latest version, you could.  It's no fun having to start a new game every time you want to play.  Instead of getting better with updates, the game has gotten worst and unplayable.  Don't waste your time or money on this game until the developers make more progress, which at this point, is unlikely.  If only the developers would do a roll back to before those updates and make games save-able and so that bigfoot wouldn't get stuck, at least it would be playable.  Can't blame the war any more as coding can be done from most anywhere in the world.  01/15/23: I ignored the negative reviews for this game because of the price...  I am glad I did.  It's hard to find a good game that is affordable these days.  I have played about 8 hours so far;  Seven hours by my self and one hour co-op.  I have found very little technical info on how to set up the game, but through trial and error, I am figuring it out.  After 8 hrs of playing, I have only encountered one issue...  I got stuck in a co-op lobby I created when friends were taking too long to join...  it got boring just sitting there waiting for them.  In fact, there is no exit from any lobby, which is problematic if you accidentally enter the wrong lobby, you are stuck there with no exit and have to close the game entirely and restart...  don't like that.  I am running this game on a mid end system; 11th gen i7, GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, 64GB and only wifi internet.  I experienced very little lag for my own characters, but could see my friends lagging at times with their high speed connections.  I usually play games like HL2 & Ep1 & 2 & mods (265 hrs in 2022), Doom 4 (100+ hrs in 2022), GW2 (100+ hrs in 2022), so I am gauging my opinion of Bigfoot against those games.  Game play visuals for Bigfoot are pretty darn good.  Yes, Bigfoot looks like a big ape, but since I have never seen a real bigfoot, that's fine by me.  I don't usually play co-op in any game that is not MMO, but after watching some YouTube videos of this game in co-op, I gave it a try.  It's hellafun!!  After playing a few hours, I went and read some of the negative reviews.  Maybe many of the negative reviews are old or by folks that didn't play games much but I haven't had similar issues some mentioned.   I have encountered glitches and issues in games long out of beta or development and this game is great and very fun.   I really hope the developers ignore the negative reviews and continue their efforts and development of this game.  WISH LIST: exit button for the co-op lobby, more jumps scares, ability to swim better, interaction between Bigfoot and other forest animals...  I saw Bigfoot run through a bear...  it would have been cool if Bigfoot at least knocked the bear aside, rather than run thru or past the bear.  Ability to calm Bigfoot down for a short time, like food offerings or giving him a flower, something goofy, especially if you run out of ammo. Places to hide where Bigfoot couldn't get to you; if they exist, I haven't found them yet,  easier access to inventory items, ability to sit or lay down, more loot and ammo placement, forest edibles for increased health, maybe an NPC or two running for their life, more or easier instructions on setting up co-ops; like step 1, step 2, step 3 for connecting or setting up a game/lobby, instructions on how to set up voice chat and make it work better along with such other technical aspects of getting into game play individually or with co-op.  If I think of more, I'll try and update or maybe find someone to tell.  Basically, if you are just looking for a good fun game and can avoid being so critical, you may enjoy this game.

Date 2023-01-15 Playtime 14h 34m Rec Positive fajna gra najlepiej grać ze znajomymi śmieszniej i fajniej jest a samemu może sie znudzić troche i i szkoda że polowanie na bigfoota zamienia sie troche na bunkrowanie przed nim na noc powinno być tak że bardziej go tropimy i staramy sie go zabić o każdej porze dnia i nocy a tak w dzień prawie ciężko go znaleźć i dzień trwa bardzo krótko trzeba szybko znaleźć broń i amunicje i apteczki i znaleźć schronienie lub pozycje do bronienia sie bo on tylko przybiegnie raz walnie nas i ucieka i tak 2 razy w nocy robi. a jak ktoś gra samemu i chce go szybko zabić nie tracąc ani 1 hp to polecam użyć tyrolek najlepiej na mapie yellowston na górze mapy pierwsza tyrolka za wieżą myśliwską nad strumykiem z jednej pozycji na drugą się przemieszczamy ciągle jak bigfoot podejdzie dosyć blisko ale nie tak ze podejdzie i stara się zniszczyć tyrolke tylko zawróci sie i będzie szedł w druga strone gdzie już jedziemy i cały czas zmieniamy pozycje tyrolką i w niego strzelamy nawet w 2 dniu go zabijemy tym sposobem jak dobry spawn broni i amunicji będzie i zdobędziemy strzelbe i butle z gazem lub akumulator które kładziemy na dole i jak będzie obok to strzelamy w to i mu zabiera sporo hp warto metr od tyrolki pułapke na niedźwiedzie położyć żeby w razie czego jakby zbyt blisko podszedł tyrolki nie zniszczył i kolejną dobrą lokalizacją na załatwianie go na tyrolce jest wioska nad wodą niedaleko tej tyrolki i przemieszczamy sie między wioską a domkiem na wyspie i strzelamy do bigfoota który biega i spala kalorie bo długo biegnie przez ten pomost i jeszcze więcej hp możemy mu zabierać bo więcej strzelamy do niego i ładowanie magazynka jest zbugowane bo jak zaczynamy przeładowywać i odrazu wskoczymy na tyrolke to jak zejdziemy z niej po drugiej stronie to już przeładowany magazynek jest i oszczędzamy czas na przeładowanie i możemy odrazu strzelać w niego i według mnie powinni naprawić to przeładowanie i poprawić IQ bigfoota by jego głównym celem było zniszczenie tyrolki jak jej użyjemy walcząc z nim bo ta tyrolka jest zbyt OP :P

Date 2023-01-15 Playtime 0h 20m Rec Negative Needs to be more single player friendly. ITS SO HARD singleplayer. And instead of controlling different parts of the game add difficulty system (normal, hard, nightmare etc.)

Date 2023-01-15 Playtime 7h 43m Rec Positive The Game is Very fun to play with friends but BigFoot is to overpowered and needs a nerf for newer players, however the game is still fun to play and you can turn down bigfoots settings but he is still difficult to beat. Anyways this is a really good game! 
Date 2023-01-15 Playtime 11h 35m Rec Positive ive only played a few hours and i love it sigma game tbh  
Date 2023-01-15 Playtime 38h 38m Rec Positive The Ai is better than some of the most sweaty players, so I recommend playing team vs. player. When there's action, there's ACTION. It's sometimes slow, but it's very fun, and I would recommend playing at night, or in an apartment, because there are jump scares, and intense moments with bigfoot. Another thing I like about the game is how many strategies you can plan out. Overall, it's a great game to play with friends, and I definitely recommend it.

Date 2023-01-13 Playtime 35h 49m Rec Positive Spoko gierka polecam
Date 2023-01-13 Playtime 33h 5m Rec Negative ENG BELOW NIegdyś świetna gra i to dosłownie miesiąc temu. A TERAZ!? Gra to jakieś gówno DOSŁOWNIE NIE DA SIĘ GRAĆ niby aktualizacja wielka ma naprawić mnóstwo błędówa DODAŁA ICH TYLE ŻE JESZCZE RAZ POWTÓRZE "NIE DA SIĘ GRAĆ" np: otwierając ekwipunek znika ci kursor i nieda się wybrać żadnego itema dosłownie nic a żeby wyjść z ekwa trzeba kliknąć escape i kontynuuj co kończy się wystrzałem z broni to samo tyczy się przeszukiwania plecaków szafek itp. i to samo z mapą,  klikając tab żeby sprawdzić kamery ekran się blokuje i trzeba jeszcze raz kliknąć tab żeby dopiero przeglądać kamery, drona nie da się naładować i nim latać, optymalizacja chujowa a zmiana graficzna w stosunku do poprzednich wersji ledwo widoczna, bigfoot spierdala po oberwaniu jednym strzałem a przez błęby z ekwipunkiem nie można go śledzić GPS sensorem i ostatnie co mogę sobie przypomnieć to fakt że ustawiając częstość pojawiania się itemów na maksa nie znajdujesz prawie nic.  Once upon a time a great game and that was literally a month ago. AND NOW!? The game is some shit, YOU LITERALLY CAN'T PLAY, supposedly the big update is supposed to fix a lot of bugs, IT ADDED SO MANY OF THEM THAT IT WILL REPEAT "I CAN'T PLAY" AGAIN e.g.: when opening the inventory, the cursor disappears and you can't select any item, literally nothing, and to leave the inventory you have to click escape and continue, which ends with a gun shot, the same applies to searching backpacks, lockers, etc. and the same with the map,  clicking tab to check the cameras, the screen freezes and you have to click tab again to view the cameras, you can't charge the drone and fly it, the optimization is shitty and the graphical change compared to the previous versions is barely visible, Bigfoot fucks up after being hit with one shot and there are clouds with the inventory, you can't track it with the GPS sensor and the last thing I can remember is the fact that when you set the item spawn rate to the maximum, you find almost nothing.

Date 2023-01-09 Playtime 8h 6m Rec Positive I was kinda worried when I got this game but it's pretty darn good with friends. It's not too scary but it has that on edge factor that makes up for it especially when a friend is Bigfoot. Overall I would recommend this game and support the developers since they come from Kyiv Ukraine and were forced out. Even with all that they still pushed out the Yellowstone map update.

Date 2023-01-07 Playtime 20h 24m Rec Positive Amazing game, totally love. A few bugs with the AI, such as the bot running out of stamina and walking in a straight direction giving an easy win, but besides that, playing with friends is amazing yet still terrifying at the same time. Another game I'd say you should only play with friends, or else it's a bit boring. 9/10 with friends, 5/10 without.

Date 2023-01-06 Playtime 28h 42m Rec Positive Ich denke BIGFOOT hat viel Potential. Es ist hin und wieder ein bisschen verstörend wenn man eine Leiche findet so wie in the Forest. Obwohl man eigentlich immer das gleiche macht ist es sehr witzig und man bekommt das Gefühl als wäre man in diesem spiel drin, es sollen ja noch weitere Maps veröffentlicht werden was einem das gefühlt gibt das die Entwickler sich wirklich Mühe geben und ihnen das Spiel nicht egal ist. Die Grafik ist eigentlich auch echt gut und passend zum Spiel. Alleine ist das Spiel vielleicht ein bisschen zu schwierig an manchen stellen ( als Anfänger) aber mit Freunden kann ich es echt empfehlen.

Date 2023-01-03 Playtime 6h 30m Rec Negative This game basically just gives you a good time for about 5 minutes but then Bigfoot who has seemingly endless health and is extremely overpowered even on the lowest settings for Bigfoot and it still absolutely destroys so even with 3 total people its completely unbearable to play because the revive system is thrown out the window like at least let someone pick you up and it gives you maybe 20 health but instead you have to find tombs which wouldn't be so bad except there are several bugs in which I can see a tomb but others can't which means I can't pick up the tomb and that becomes a problem and also you can't climb ladders which makes zero sense to have them at that point and also med kits are pretty hard to find especially when you want to prep for the giant gorilla that can kill you instantly and now the pvp aspect is fine but also at that point your friends basically lose anytime if you are Bigfoot unless you walk into the lake in which you can't swim as Bigfoot which makes absolutely no sense and the value of the game for the product is absolutely mind boggling and is dumb because the value is pointless
Date 2023-01-03 Playtime 3h 15m Rec Negative Bigfoot is invincible pretty much even in the lowest health settings. Loot also is very scarce even on the highest loot settings. Big foot likes to run away until around 10 minutes of waiting and doesn’t ever leave so you can’t regain health easy unless you already have all the health packs. Fun game for one time and that’s it.

Date 2023-01-03 Playtime 3h 5m Rec Negative Zero replay value, confusing controls with no explanation of what they do, and impossible to win with several friends while playing on the easiest difficulty. The game doesn't feel like the game it's advertised as. You're supposed to hunt Bigfoot, but you actually end up walking around setting up equipment for 20 minutes only to have Bigfoot abruptly show up and start attacking. On the easiest difficulty, he has about 600 health. The most powerful gun in the game does about five or six damage per shot, the pistol does three damage, and you only spawn with a couple of bullets. The loot spread across the map is scarce, even when the "loot amount" setting is set to the highest option. The ammo you find will likely be for weapons you don't have and don't seem to be in the game. It just isn't fun and is a waste of nearly $20. I'd rather spend that money on a game that is what it's advertised as that is actually enjoyable to play.

Date 2023-01-02 Playtime 12h 32m Rec Positive El juego es bastante bueno e interesante. Muy entretenido para jugarlo con amigos e incluso solo. Es completo en cuanto a herramientas que se pueden usar. Y las armas y su forma de hallarlas es interesante. Trae 3 mapas hasta ahora que son de tamaño adecuado. El juego se puede volver muy tactico si es que te lo propones y matar al bigfoot es todo un desafio a la hora de encontrartelo.
Date 2023-01-02 Playtime 10h 25m Rec Positive This game is really fun. The one opinion I have on changing the game would be , being able to craft medical supplies or crafting traps in a way. There is this big open park but not much to actually do in between waiting for BigFoot. Something is really lacking and/or missing. Being able to drive by rebuilding cars would also be cool.

Date 2023-01-02 Playtime 7h 53m Rec Negative The devs added DLC/microtransactions to this game despite it still being in early access. That alone should be enough to decide to skip this one.  Not polished enough to make it something to come back to often. Several issues, but here are some of the ones that end up to every match.  [list]     [*]Bigfoot can hit through walls. Not talking about his giant reach into buildings, but through solid objects.     [*]You can't jump in inch deep water even though you're still standing, making it hard to get around shin high rocks.     [*]Water unequips your weapons and you have to re-equip them when you come out. Should automatically bring out the exact item you had before.     [*]Current meta is to just cheese Bigfoot by staying near water or going back and forth on ziplines.     [*]Despite flares being a way to ward bigfoot off, there is a bug where AI bigfoot never actually disengages even when shot with one. [/list]  Atmosphere of the game is great. But the easy to cheese meta, infrequent updates, and probably worst of all, selling DLC in an early access game, make this a near-worthless venture.

Although it is a game that you play maybe 2-3 times  a year with some buddys have a few beers and have some laughs. The searching for clues alongside with the story while being fearful of bigfoot is such a cool concept. your immersed into the feel of being watched in the woods at night and the feeling of being caught in the rain in the woods. Overall i would say its 10/10 for the game it is! ~ thanks alphy for buying the game for me and having a kick ass night together !

Date 2023-01-01 Playtime 7h 59m Rec Positive I would very much like to know what those feet do.
Date 2023-01-01 Playtime 18h 22m Rec Positive I think this is a great game to play with friends for a couple of hours and come back to it. I don't think it's a very good game to play consecutively since it does get really repetitive. Playing it once in a while truly is a great experience and I really like the laughs we have the screams we have and the beautifully designed map and weapons. But what I think that could use some work is the AI, I don't think Bigfoot should run from you during the day but I don't think it should be as aggressive as it is during the night time. I also think it would be cooler if Bigfoot was weaker during daytime and stronger during nighttime (health, speed and strength wise) I also think Bigfoot should only heal during the nighttime. It would also cool if there were more small features in the game, such as catching Bigfoot sleeping and maybe a Bigfoot stalking feature where you only see it's eyes in the dark and then it runs at you. Also I think it's a bit stupid when it's PvP because the player can constantly attack you and you can just die instantly, guns don't do much and Bigfoot has an insane amount of health and healing which is another reason why it would be cooler if he was weaker in the morning. Other than that this game is really fun and can't wait to see what new things they add.

Date 2022-12-28 Playtime 133h 25m Rec Positive Its a good game.  Looks like multiplayer (cooperative or hunter vs Bigfoot) would be more fun than solo play.  The day/night cycles are way too short.  It would be nice if this were controllable within the game menus.   Bigfoot's health points are about 10 times what it should be in my opinion, but I guess the game is still in development.

Date 2022-12-28 Playtime 3h 2m Rec Negative Big foot doesn't "Hunt." He just auto tracks you down, even if you're across the map and crouched in the corner of a building. There are zero opportunities to stay alive when you have no health packs.  Looting is super uncommon. Even with "max loot," I'm checking 10 drawers just to find 1 ammo box for a gun that I'm already maxed out on, while also continuing to sit on no medical packs, 1 trap, and zero explosives.   Bigfoot's damage is wayyy too OP, Even on Bigfoot's "least damage" setting, he will still take you from 100 to 10 health in 1 fight. Then, if he "bugs out" (I think it's a bug, because I hope this isn't an actual mechanic) He will instantly attack you again before you can defend yourself. And often times just ignores the flare gun that is designed to scare him away.   Bigfoot's health. I have always had an issue with how much health he has, even when you set him to the "least health" setting, because his health ratio, to your damage, to your health ratio is incredibly unbalanced.   I recommend playing Skinwalker for a similar, but better experience.

Date 2022-12-28 Playtime 9h 1m Rec Positive This is a lot of fun. once you find a strategy to kill bigfoot, the game is a lot more fun. The only downfall is that you can never hide from bigfoot  (if he is an AI), he will always find you. it would be nice if you could hide from the AI Bigfoot. Also, when AI bigfoot does his roar, it sounds like he is right next to you even if he is across the map. It's really misleading. everything else is awesome though!!

Date 2022-12-27 Playtime 0h 55m Rec Negative Literally the most boring thing i've played in a while. Absolute rip off for the pricing and the game is janky with absolute 0 atmosphere. Markiplier made this look fun, and that's because all the boringness was edited out, which by playing it myself, is alot. Don't buy this.

Date 2022-12-27 Playtime 22h 43m Rec Positive Monkey Good.
Date 2022-12-27 Playtime 23h 46m Rec Positive This game is one of my favorite games I have ever played and it gets even better when you have friends. BUT, the game is still buggy and not fully made so some of the combat isn't the best (your shots not hitting or not going where you are aiming) and the AI of Bigfoot is weird and buggy.  There are times where Bigfoot will come to you and fight you until one of you die and other times where he will run away after one gunshot, also there has been a few times where he had been 100% oblivious of me and had just let me melee him to death without any reaction.  So overall I would buy it but don't expect a perfect experience especially if you are playing the AI.

Date 2022-12-26 Playtime 16h 55m Rec Positive yes
Date 2022-12-26 Playtime 12h 21m Rec Positive its really fun to figure out the game mechanics by yourself.  the only bugs i saw was sometimes bigfoot just stands there when you attack him. this might just be in multiplayer because he cant decide who to attack. also in multiplayer someone will close the blinds but it will still look open to everyone else. not too many bugs though it might just be because i have a crappy gaming pc. other than that it's a really fun game and the graphics are good

Date 2022-12-26 Playtime 37h 45m Rec Positive Ein ganz nettes Game! Tolle Grafik, eine nette Waffenauswahl und eine gruselige Atmosphäre - genau so, wie ich es mir vorgestellt hatte. Leider macht das Spiel fast nur mit Freunden Spaß. Deswegen sollte man sich vor dem Kauf überlegen, mit wem man es spielen möchte. Ohne Freunde macht es recht wenig Spaß und es dauert auch viel länger, um eine Runde zu beenden. Im Spiel trifft man öfters auf recht große Bugs, die wirklich nicht selten vorkommen. Manche Bugs beeinflussen das Spiel stärker, andere weniger. Was das Thema Bugs betrifft, könnte das Spiel besser sein. Ich hoffe, dass in Zukunft die meisten Bugs behoben werden. Was aber recht positiv auffällt, sind die Maps. Ja, es braucht extrem lange, bis eine Map rauskommt, aber wenn eine rauskommt, ist sie wirklich gut gemacht.  Als kleiner Spoiler: Ihr werdet euch im Spiel recht oft erschrecken - auf jeden Fall, wenn ihr genauso extrem Angst vor Horror-Games habt wie ich. Mehr kann ich leider auch zum Game nicht sagen, es hat mich nicht so überzeugt, dass ich noch mehr über das Spiel erzählen kann. Meiner Meinung nach sind um die 20 Euro viel zu viel Geld für so ein Spiel. Trotzdem kann ich es weiter empfehlen.

It was a challenge to beat big foot and we were playing on the easier settings. So, it is a harder game, but I still found it to be a lot of fun.

Date 2022-12-21 Playtime 100h 48m Rec Positive This is a really good game. Great graphics, great gameplay,and great AI. In the 4.0 update, it made people be able to play as Bigfoot, which i think is the best addition to this game. In my opinion, its mostly finished. They just need to really add the Ross Lake map and maybe a few more improvements and its perfect. This is also a great game to play with friends! Overall, this game (in my opinion) is a great Survival Horror game (not really) to play with friends. Have fun out there!
Date 2022-12-20 Playtime 24h 56m Rec Positive This game is fun when it actually works. This is one of the most unstable games I have ever played. My friends and I have all had our computers broken trying to play this wonky mass of hell.

Date 2022-12-19 Playtime 1h 19m Rec Positive Big Foot to gra akcji, w której gracze wcielają się w rolę potężnego potwora zwanego Big Footem i walczą z innymi dzikimi zwierzętami oraz łowcami nagród. Gracze mogą ulepszać swojego Big Foota, zdobywać nowe umiejętności i walczyć z różnymi przeciwnikami w różnych trybach rozgrywki.  Jednym z największych atutów Big Foota jest jego prosta, ale zabawna mechanika walki. Gracze mogą używać różnych ataków i uników, by pokonać swoich przeciwników, a także ulepszać swojego Big Foota, by stać się jeszcze potężniejszym. Gra oferuje również duży wybór broni i umiejętności, dzięki czemu każdy gracz może znaleźć coś dla siebie.  Ogólnie rzecz biorąc, Big Foot to prosta, ale zabawna gra akcji, która zapewni graczom wiele godzin zabawy. Jeśli lubisz gry z potworami i szukasz czegoś lekkiego i zabawnego, to Big Foot jest wart rozważenia.

Date 2022-12-18 Playtime 1h 36m Rec Negative This game is overpriced and underdeveloped. It plays like it was written ~2010. The graphics are nice, but the key bindings and inventory system are terrible. I could not figure out how to bind the rifle to "1" and the pistol to "2". I couldn't find a way to shoot the pistol at all. It was in my inventory....and no combination of keystrokes, mouse clicks, and begging the Steam deities could get it in my hands. There's no way to share any inventory items in multiplayer. This game has a lot of potential, and I hope the devs put some more focus on improving it. I would NOT recommend this game to anyone until it's finished.

Date 2022-12-12 Playtime 262h 27m Rec Positive The  game is fast paced.  To win at the game all of your attention is required.  Basically your job is to go around and investigate the area for evidence of what happened to some campers.  But if Bigfoot comes around you get rid of him.  You have some good equipment to help you on your way.  There are also forest animals here and there too.  If you use all of your equipment properly you may be able to make it out of there with collected evidence and if not you have to destroy Bigfoot.  Usually there are some nice views of the park that are breath taking.  As you hike around you pass over bridges, lakes, log bridges, thick forests, visit campsites, visit massive lodges, and more.  Thank you.

Date 2022-12-12 Playtime 8h 28m Rec Positive It's fun with friends, but it is NOT in any world worth $20. I suppose you don't expect to get your money's worth in an early access title, but it's especially true in this case. It does run mostly bug free though, surprisingly. I'd say it's not bad, but it's like a $5 game, as long as you understand that then you can make an informed decision.

Date 2022-12-11 Playtime 4h 56m Rec Positive I realised I have 1100+ games in my Steam library and I was going to die before I played them all.  So thought I'd spend a bit of time on each one, a new one every night, and leave a short initial review.  I only wanted a single player experience - I'm not competitive. But, no controller, no play, no excuse.  Shame! Looks great. I'm a bit gutted to be honest. 😒  NOT RECOMMENDED.  ********************************************************************************************  EDIT. I wanted to play this, I wanted to since I saw it, I just never had time.  So I gave in and set up the controls in Steam, Big picture mode, enable controller, downloaded a community pad configuration, and I was off!  So now, being honest, it was worth jumping through the hoops. It's a great game for someone like me who wants some immersion. I just want to explore, rummage, collect and chill. I don't mind getting caught by the Bigfoot, I like to see him! Graphics great, sound great, atmosphere great, Bigfoot great. Just a shame it doesn't have the correct button prompts for the controller, having a default controller configuration would make the searching of the draws and the navigation of the menus just a little more intuitive. But I have changed my mind - it is now a definite...  RECOMMENDED! But it needs official controller support adding...

Date 2022-12-10 Playtime 32h 1m Rec Negative Fun, however since the last update it's become a buggy, unoptimized mess. I'm constantly getting disconnected from games.  PRO TIP: Bigfoot never cums first night. Use that time to gather precious resources and ammo. Ya, and good luck finding any of that on the yellowstone map.  UPDATE: Game officially no longer loads multiplayer. Removed from my library.

Date 2022-12-10 Playtime 3h 51m Rec Negative Now here's the deal. This game isn't too bad. It's just that Bigfoot's AI is terribly bad. And it's strange because they said they made his AI better in one of the more recent updates. Me and my friends recently played two matches in a row and had the same thing happen. Bigfoot charges us for the first night and never leaves until two of us are dead. After he left we found him doing this really slow shuffle in the woods and unable to attack us. We then proceed to stab him to death because he isn't smart enough to run away. It's both stupidly difficult because he won't leave until two people are dead and incredibly easy because he lets the remaining people stab him if found. No idea how this happened but it certainly ruins the experience.

Date 2022-12-08 Playtime 180h 44m Rec Positive Best with friends but getting into the rare public match without cheaters can be fun once you get really good at human or big foot vs mode. Although if new to game its best to play with friends first for the vs mode and learn all the locker code locations and best holdout or looting spots. As you can either get instantly rushed and seal clubbed to death as human on first night if you don't know what your doing. Same goes for big foot if he shows mercy and let's the pro players loot. He can get chain stunned by explosives and not move for almost 2 minutes if the humans blow the next explosive or drone shock right as you get control again. So with pro foot and hunters it can go either way depending how fast the big foot can destroy extra gas cans and rush the humans before they can get more explosives and medkits. Level 16 and still climbing, can do really well as foot or hunter. Just know you will need to screenshot and write down toxic players to report and block as their is plenty of trolls that do stupid things to ruin the pvp or even pve combat. Taking a screenshot is the only way to find and report them, since the steam recent players is not active in this game. Always "pause" the game and take screenshot at start of match in case you need to report and block recent players.

Date 2022-12-07 Playtime 14h 31m Rec Positive It gets goofy at times, but it's genuinely terrifying at some moments. The Bigfoot pathfinding AI is funky, but it works most of the time. Playing as Bigfoot is incredibly boring and tedious, needing energy to to ANYTHING, including punching something, and hunting animals to get more energy (don't do it it's not profitable). I give it 6/10 garbage piles eaten by Bigfoot.

Date 2022-12-04 Playtime 25h 40m Rec Negative I've played both with a friend and alone and it's fun, we have a great time. However, there's not much too the game. Bigfoot attacks, you take damage, he leaves, you heal, and that's the cycle. It's more or less scripted. You can't dodge, so if/when Bigfoot charges you you WILL take damage. I'm not sure if the melee weapons do anything, at least it doesn't feel like it. Traps in the trees are invisible and can kill you. When you die, if your playing with a friend, the friend can continue and you'll just have to watch. You're friend can revive you, but that's... a process. The maps aren't interesting to explore. As of right now, I can't recommend the game, and certainly not with the price. There's potential, and I'd love for the game to achieve it. The developers should look at other games in the same genre that are well liked and figure out why and take inspiration.

Date 2022-12-02 Playtime 4h 38m Rec Negative Very much a one and done game. Once you have played it once and defeated Big Foot, the game loses its appeal very quickly. There isn't enough variety in the game so it just feels like the same run through every time.  It is a well done game.  I watched over the years how far the development has come and it is amazing how they grew and built this game from what it started as. But I have played just four hours and don't have any want to play more.

Date 2022-11-30 Playtime 1h 57m Rec Negative Easiest refund of my life.  One map, one monster. AI is terrible and will do the same thing every time - it waits about ten minutes and then charges at you until you're all dead. Don't try defending yourself, because unless you all have the best weapons you won't win, and even then it has 1 million HP and the fight isn't remotely fun.

Date 2022-11-27 Playtime 5h 13m Rec Positive I am a 51 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.  Thank you Bigfoot

Date 2022-11-26 Playtime 28h 57m Rec Positive It's Really Good In Singleplayer - Multiplayer but the downside is that it only have 3 maps (Yellowstone, Redwood, Winter park) And also the AI can be broken sometimes for example when i was in Redwood with my friend then bigfoot was just standing still on an staircase and didn't move. But The game is tho really good but it needs more updates and also more maps because it gets kinda boring after a while playing the same map over and over again.  8/10

Date 2022-11-12 Playtime 206h 43m Rec Positive great game over all, i love this game so much, just the vibe it gives when its night and you dont no when bigfoot will come, and the fact that my computer (not A gaming pc) can handle it.
Date 2022-11-12 Playtime 10h 32m Rec Positive Love It !, Was Playing It With my Boyfriend And It's Amazingly Funny And Entertaining, We Were Laughing Our Head's Off For No Residual Reason At All, This Was An Absolute Blast To Play, Would Recommend, The Game Was Scary but It Got Better And Better And We Finally Defeated Him, Absolutely Terrifying And Fun/Funny At The Same Time ! I feel Like IT Was Made By the Creator Of Phasmophobia But It's Not, I Think That There Should Be Multiple Objective's Like,  Kill 1 Bear,   Find The Code,   Find 2 Totem's,   Search 10 Boxes/Bag's, And So On, And The Leveling Up Is Way Way To Strict, It Should Be A Bit More Easier, Especially If You Complete The Objective's And Kill Him, But None The Less This Game Is Amazing, 10/10

Date 2022-11-09 Playtime 711h 11m Rec Negative Після оновлення 9 жовтня 2023 року гру неможливо запустити, і розробники із цим анічогісінько робити не збираються. Одним єдиним оновленням унеможливили запуск, зато гроші за гру ж мають-це чистої води ГРАБІЖ. CyberLight - грабіжники і просто покидьки. Все написане нижче вже не має ніякого значення. Загалом гра хороша. Прикольно полювати на Бігфута, хороша атмосфера, пейзажі, оформлення локацій, масштаб карт норм. Але є мінуси. Найбільшим, ГІГАНТСЬКИМ,  мінусом є так зване "ком'юніті". Тут повно нубів, які абсолютно не знають як грати, де і що знаходиться на карті і т.д і .т.п. вони будуть постійно за вами ганятись намагаючись вкрасти кращу зброю, аптечки і т.д. Вони всеодно здохнуть при першій же зустрічі з єтті. Ви йдете за AVM і вони за вами, обов'язково намагатимуться його вкрасти. Ви за М4? - І нуби за вами. Ну короче зрозуміло, так? Ця гра має рівень гравців, але який в ньому сенс? Чому я, на данний момент маючи 32 рівень повинен грати з нубами з 1 рівнем, які нічорта в цій грі не вміють, окрім того як бігти за тобою і красти, красти КРАСТИ?  Необхідно зробити щось подібне до того, аби нуби з 1 рівнем не могли приєднатися до лоббі гравців з 10-20-30 і вище рівнем. Хороші гравці хай грають з хорошими, а нуби з нубами. Карт всього 3 і це дуже мало. Гра вже багато років в ранньому доступі і в реліз виходити, схоже, і не збирається. Рекомендую цю гру лише тим у кого є хороші тіммейти, грати з випадковими гравцями -це ЖАХ.
Date 2022-11-09 Playtime 21h 47m Rec Positive For $25 definitely worth it for hours of fun by yourself and with friends! A few great maps with a lot of resources at your disposal to fight bigfoot (traps, cameras, flares, weapons, etc). Gameplay is pretty fun, especially exploring/combat and graphics are pretty good for an early access game. One negative may be that performance isn't perfectly optimized but not a demanding game nonetheless.

Date 2022-11-07 Playtime 3h 50m Rec Negative I honestly cannot truthfully say this game is worth its price. I was lucky and got the game through a gift and after a mere 3.8 hours of playtime I can honestly say this game is... subpar. Dont get me wrong, there were times I had fun. Ive mostly been playing with my dad and it was a grand ol time for the most part... until Bigfoot attacked us.  Bam, ran out of ammo. Bam, barely no damage dealt. Bam, almost all of our health gone. And to top it all off the dude just DOES NOT GIVE UP. I mean like really just latches onto you like a fat kid on cake. I have never seen such an aggressive AI in a game like this before, and this is coming from someone who played The Rake. By the time its over your on 20 health with two bullets and a pocket full of shattered dreams.  Now your thinking: Why not just get more loot? Yeah, we would if there WAS ANY. The loot in this game is so incredibly sparse at times that you just do not have enough ammo or health packs to fight bigfoot. And inevitably you WILL encounter him again. And, most likely, you will die a horrible gut wrenching death because you were still at 20 health on NIGHT TWO.  I love the idea of this game as I loved The Rake, but this game feels so severely unbalanced. Me and my Father DID eventually kill Bigfoot... after lowering ALL of the difficulty settings to their LOWEST SETTING. Even then, we just barely made it.  TL;DR: Game too hard, needs severe balancing.

Date 2022-11-06 Playtime 1h 43m Rec Negative Every part of the game is completely lame and unbalanced and the A.I. Bigfoot is not scary at all. Very weird seeing all the positive reviews since i came into the game feeling positive about it and being ready ignore some indie developer mistakes but the pace of the game is very alienating and unenjoyable. Also the dynamic of difficulty progression through the days is immideatly ruined by the Bigfoot running at you 2 minutes in to the start of the game. Just a shitty DBD clone.

Lots of fun, especially with friends and still very challenging.  Two things I would like to see would be an ability to slowly heal over time versus ONLY using med kits, and being able to search vehicles you come across for more loot potential.  Great job guys and stay safe.. our hearts and prayers are with you!

Date 2022-11-04 Playtime 7h 7m Rec Negative I recommend downloading first 2017 version of this game as it is the best, scary and mysterious. This new game is some sad PvP PUBG wannabe BS with trash ai who spams you at the very first night. This Ai knows where you are no matter what you do and attacks are scripted which shows how underdeveloped it is but they said that he knows more because Ai is smarter XDD bruh moment. Devs ruined this game honestly they have 5iq. Why would you try to make a PvP game out of horror game?

I am happy to announce I am filled with exuberance and jubilation because of the simple yet gorgeous game-play this game has to offer. The massive hairy man found within the woods has taught me some valuable life lessons. One, he taught me patience. Once the menacing roar fills the night sky I know I have to be content and calm. It is only a matter of time before I get to look into the stunning eyes of this stunning creature. As sad as it may be I also learned that in the end all evil must perish. There is no room in this planet for such negativity that the beast man brings. Any who, great game. Would recommend.

I followed the development of this game for a couple of years before i finally bought it, and I'm glad i did. The 3 maps at the time of writing are huge and great fun for different reasons.   Sure there are some bugs, it's in development, but overall the thrill of the chase and being chased is great. Some of the game mechanics are excellent once you learn different ways of using them - the cameras, traps, gps trackers and the drone are endless fun in the different methods you can use to monitor and snare this beast of a formidable opponent!   It's also brilliant having a friend in there who is the Sasquatch and has to live off VC to come and stalk you! The AI is fun, but a little predictable and pretty relentlessly brutal, but with a friend it's truly brilliant.

Date 2022-11-01 Playtime 1h 53m Rec Negative Wir sind in das Coop Abenteuer gestartet, in der Erwartung, eine Spooky und Mystery Erfahrung zu erleben, doch leider war der "Spooky/Mystery"-Faktor nach der ersten Nacht verflogen. Man wurde direkt angegriffen, ohne überhaupt die Steuerung verstanden zu haben. Es entpuppte sich leider am Ende als ein Hit-& Run - Shooter ohne notwendige Tiefe. Wir sind einfach mit dem falschen Gedanken in dieses Spiel gestartet und wurden deswegen enttäuscht. Für Leute, die einen kurzweiligen Shooter suchen ist es sicherlich eine Empfehlung - Für Taktiker und Mystery Fans eher nicht. Das, was das Spiel bietet, ist leider keine 19,99 Euro wert - da bietet ein Spiel wie Devour ähnliches/mehr für deutlichen kleineren Preis.

Date 2022-10-31 Playtime 31h 22m Rec Positive Its one of the games where you get the bois together and fuck around It could use more polish but it is a studio of 4 guys in Ukraine so its gonna take longer to make updates and such.  I would love to see a marking and ping system in the game as in Mark a location and ping specific loot in an area like in lets say apex legends.  More customisation would also be good like choosing what guns specifically to bring in the rv instead of always having a sniper and pistol.  Map expansion would be cool and i can't wait for the new map.  It does feel a bit boring solo but,  If you have the money to spare and your friends also have the money, Its time to get camping and sell some bigfoot feet pics on onlyfans  Oh yeah playing a public lobby is a bad idea because 99 percent of the time its gonna be some annoying people  If you search long enough you will find a good public lobby and have some fun but the V chat system is a bit sketchy with it sounding very low quality so if your gonna play with friends use discord or something  Overall if you learn up about the game your gonna have a fun time as it does seem like a Daunting task at first but when you learn the map and how to use Flares, Bear traps and Explosives Bigfoot is a good game to play :)  Also watch Scottish game reviews review on the game

Date 2022-10-28 Playtime 38h 52m Rec Positive Ist schon eine Herausforderung, auch auf Leicht für einen Einzelnen. ^^ Es macht Spaß, noch mehr Spaß würde es machen, wenn Mitspieler nicht so egoistisch loten/ hamstern würden, oder Fallen die man aufgestellt hat nicht einfach abbauen und klauen würden. 99 % der Mitspieler haben das Prinzip des Zusammen / Gemeinsam spielen nicht begriffen. Ich finde jeder Spieler sollte daher das selbe loten können, was auch Andere loten. Das bedeutet. Wenn da ein Gewehr liegt, sollte jeder das Gewehr aufheben können und das gilt auch für alle anderen Items, dann gibt auch keinen Egoismus mehr. So hat jeder Spieler das Selbe im Inventar.

Date 2022-10-27 Playtime 9h 45m Rec Positive Really fun game, some glitches here and there but that's to be expected with early access. Playing as bigfoot himself is SUPER insightful and its really interesting to try different tactics across the different maps.

Date 2022-10-27 Playtime 1h 43m Rec Negative Game is not fun or engaging in any way. Players start with limited supplies and wander aimlessly looking for guns and ammo. The AI bigfoot waits until night then roars and charges you. Bigfoot has over a thousand health, and guns deal about 4 damage. So Bigfoot is just a boring giant bullet sponge.  "We have gone to great lengths to create the believable behaviour of Bigfoot" Is a joke. Bigfoot runs at you, smacks you around, soaks bullets, then runs away.  Surprised this game is 20$. There isn't any gameplay besides shooting a monkey with a disproportionately large health bar.   It feels like there was a plan for more interesting gameplay, involving Bigfoot or players stalking each other, using cameras, traps, but none of it matters when Bigfoot just charges straight at you.

Date 2022-10-25 Playtime 0h 13m Rec Negative GIGANTIC FEET NOT BIG FEET DONT BUY ITS A SCAM
Date 2022-10-25 Playtime 17h 5m Rec Positive ok so i like the whole Ai action, its also really fun being the bigfoot, the only issue i have is as the big foot, I couldn't place traps. I  tried rebinding "T" the key that it says is for traps, and worked but onced i changed it back to "T" it went back to not working. It works fine for the hunter not so much for the bigfoot.
Date 2022-10-25 Playtime 38h 21m Rec Positive Fig Beets/10  The game lacks any depth, I haven't played the PvP mode, but the cryptozooligist Cabelas Hunt P v Foot mode is lots of dumb fun with Mr Foot either being a bullet sponge bufflo or depending on the settings you decide to play with, a undying monstrosity that comes every night to tea bag you and your friends then run away or maul you after forcing you to waste your resources.  Ambiant and Silly in the same breath, this game is worth its price tag. It's not a deep game, but neither is Mario Party.    Very fun with friends, particularly challenging alone, but never boring, it's a fun entry point to the concept of an Asymmetrical cooperative experience.

Date 2022-10-23 Playtime 13h 10m Rec Positive Awesome fun vs AI or friends
Date 2022-10-23 Playtime 0h 29m Rec Positive If you want the full effect of Bigfoot confrontation, aim for nighttime in-game as well as in real life. Also, have the sound up. That is pretty much sums it up! Oh, I almost forgot!   Would be nice for the devs to give a nice nod to Washington Irving's ''Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' by having the in-game enemy be the Headless Horseman instead of Bigfoot. That would be the cherry on top! Just somethin' to think about, devs. Keep up the good work!

Date 2022-10-22 Playtime 23h 1m Rec Positive I play this game frequently with friends and it is fantastic. I wish the frame rates were a little higher but it overall is very fun. I enjoy the gathering aspect for items and that you can play against either AI or other players.
Date 2022-10-22 Playtime 6h 51m Rec Positive Harder than you might think.... Why does Bigfoot have a street sign? Why did the wolves kill me more often than ol 'squatch? What DID happen to all those NPCs?   This is one of those games that are low demand for your computer yet a blast to play with a group of friends. Team up to take down Bigfoot on his home turf in the wilderness. What could possibly go wrong? Spoiler: everything.   It's satisfying to finally win after 4+ rounds. Or maybe we were just terrible at this game... Either way, time well spent for my gang.

Date 2022-10-22 Playtime 5h 59m Rec Negative Game is nothing like you might hope it is. It offers so many ways to actually track Bigfoot like cameras you can place, drones you can fly, traps, bait, tracking bullets, you name it. None of that stuff matters. You spend a good portion of your time setting up cameras and collecting resources to finally hunt him down... only for Bigfoot to pounce out of the bushes like a dumb animal, smack you a couple times and just run off. He does it every ten minutes or so until you find some way to trick his AI into the geometry of the level and pelt him with bullets for ages because he's a bullet sponge for no reason. All that setup? Useless. Huge waste of time. Massive waste of potential. The developers have done nothing to fix the game itself. They add models and maps and guns but it does absolutely nothing to fix the core gameplay. It's played exactly the same as when I bought it years ago.

Date 2022-10-20 Playtime 1h 5m Rec Positive I don’t want to be that guy that has to say this but please let the vr community have this. We would gladly take this game and run with it. A vr port of this game would have so much replay ability it would be nuts. I would commit to spreading the word for a vr release to anyone who would listen. Pavlov vr has a custom map with Bigfoot but it’s nothing to what amazing adventures friends could have in vr if this game was officially given a vr port! You would have an instant following!!!!!!!!!!! If this ever happens, let me know asap!!! AAAAAASSSSSSSSSAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPP.
Date 2022-10-19 Playtime 1h 17m Rec Negative Просто жах, не знаю, що люди знайшли цікавого у цій купі лайна
Date 2022-10-19 Playtime 54h 53m Rec Positive Das Spiel ist mit den richtigen Leuten absolut witzig. Als "Zwischendurch-Spiel" absolut empfehlenswert!  Die Grafik ist total in Ordnung, das Gameplay zu Anfang leicht gewöhnungsbedürftig in der Performance.  Ich persönlich finde das Spiel auch auf den einfachsten Stufen (Health 1, Damage 1, Loot 3) recht anspruchsvoll. Gerade das macht das Spiel aber so interessant. Man spielt eben mehrfach auf den Maps, bis man dieses und jenes geschafft hat, es wirkt etwas "langlebiger".  Also: sucht euch noch 3 Leute und los geht's! :)
Date 2022-10-19 Playtime 672h 7m Rec Negative With my 672 hours of playing i've seen real bad stuff about the developers and their behaviours if its beign toxic to the community making the gmae only for money don't care for waht the community wants and overall just does the game boring.   the number of bugs and glitches is INSANE and they never fix them plux the fact the bugs have been reported and still yet the developers not fix them and overall their behaviout ot the community is legit depressing from how bad it is if you ask me is it worth 20$(i bought it when it was cheaper)?. HELL NAH you will play 3 games if you really have nothing to do and then you ahve nothign else to do in the game and the developers inactivity and careless for their game is just sadge overall you might paly 1 or two games but thats it it will get retarding real fast   also their discord server is full of dictation and if oyu say something that the devs wont like they will just ban you plus ignore all memebers and never give a good word to the community instead of their fake "thank you" at every update  OVERALL not recommended( and you better lsitne to be which i've beaten all version of this game and ofc my hours on this game is also insane so if it comes from me you know that i know what i talk about)

The ambiance was incredible and made for lots of great jumpscares from just birds in the bushes! Monky like to smack me with sign lots. Can no longer play the game due to some sort of performance issues that are causing my version of the game to be unplayable with constant frame drops and instability. I 100% recommend buying and playing the game for yourself though because even though my game aint working for me I believe the game is stupid fun and worth playing!!

Date 2022-10-16 Playtime 3h 30m Rec Negative I was so excited for this game, but when we actually played it, I really despise this game. The bigfoot is way too tanky and it is very hard to enjoy this game in general. He has too much health and takes too little damage. We even tested a few theories during customs to test the length of time between the bigfoot attack cooldown and how much damage the investigators could do to him. It is not worth it. He can run away swiftly and recover just to come right back and finish everyone off. There arent enough healing supplies either so that makes it hard as well. Dont buy or play it. Not worth it.

I do feel theres some balancing issues. they let you toggle how strong and how much health bigfoot has, but lowest bigfoot stats he coudl still be OP, and sometimes he could be a total pushover. hard to know unless you play tho.

Date 2022-09-30 Playtime 9h 21m Rec Positive I like the game but I feel like there should be different balancing. If both the players and bigfoot had higher damage there would be 2-3 encounters instead of constant hit and run battles. I think if bigfoot was a little faster, and had better jump mechanics it would make him much scarier and worth the $20 investment. But right now it feels like there is little that keeps me coming back, except its a good time to have 4 friends with the bigfoot laughing all the way.   There is something good here, it just needs to find the right path. More weapons and crafting would be interesting but I think it needs to find the right footing with the beast.

Date 2022-09-27 Playtime 14h 42m Rec Positive Playing this solo is a really fun survival challenge. It has also come along way in development. It is more fun with friends, however once you get to know the maps, the more fun it becomes. So, I hope they keep adding maps and variety. Hope there will be more progression. It can get pretty interesting.. You should definitely go in blind, don't watch game play, just experience it.

Seriously, do not play this shit.
Date 2022-09-25 Playtime 23h 42m Rec Positive The best way I can put this is if you have friends to play this with then it will be more funny but if you are playing by yourself this will be more of a spooky game.  P.S. don't max out Bigfoot's heath.

Date 2022-09-24 Playtime 16h 22m Rec Positive Tip: do not play alone, ESPECIALLY NOT REDWOOD FOREST when its late irl and in the game. storytime :D (not really smile though) anyway: decided to explore a bit of the map, after waiting in the cabin throughout the entire first night, I go outside and explore I found a watchtower quite quickly and as I was  about to start looting said tower I heard a LOUD strange noise and get an anxiety boost, whilst looking around I see nothing only to then hear another loud sound, this time I recognised the sound to be a deer or a moose so I shrug it off and continue to loot... whilst I am about to leave the area night falls again so I put a camera at the bottom of the tower and go back up to hide and look at said camera. Not much time had passed when I heard a strangely aggressive rustling sound and I pan to the right a bit with the camera just to see a giant ape with claws running from a bush, I follow said ape and he disappears for a second only to then hear something running up the wooden stairs towards me, I save the game and exit. only to then write this   this game will give you trauma, and similar to Grounded I probably will develop a love hate relationship with it the more I play. As of first impressions however it is worth the buy, full price.

Here's a paragraph in English for you, OK? See my attitude? The attitude of a deceived consumer。)  These good reviews confuse me. What's the use of customer service? ? I can only understand Chinese, what's the problem? What can the customer solve? How is this handled? ? ?  1. However, the game does not have simplified Chinese, and the simplified Chinese settings of the game are invalid. The comments and reflections of the game are obvious, and the official did not reply to the invalidation of the simplified Chinese settings. This is cheating, cheating, cheating for some players.  2. I am a consumer, and I am not here to experience the official arrogance. Although it is beyond the scope of refund, I will not give up. Please ask customer service to verify the problem of the game, and then come and see if there is any problem with what I said. I have made it very clear that I know that the scope of the refund policy has exceeded the scope of the refund policy. Can't the customer service understand it? ? ? Did the customer service pay attention to the problem I responded? ? ? ? ? ? . I wonder if the customer service is AI, or is it a big living person with brains? ? ? ? ?  3. Please don’t use the refund policy to prevaricate, please don’t use the refund policy to prevaricate, please don’t use the refund policy to prevaricate, say it three times, the customer service will show me the attitude, it’s not you who bought the game for me Yes, understand? ? ?  4. Please check the customer service for the problem that the game cannot be set to simplified Chinese, and then come and see if there is any problem with what I said.

No offense to the animator, but these are as basic as they get. It just really takes you out of the game, but even then this is still a pretty good game.

Date 2022-09-21 Playtime 6h 21m Rec Positive Bigfoot is a cooperative survival horror game that puts you and up to 3 other hapless idiots in the shoes of "professional" Bigfoot hunters playing a most dangerous game in some truly breathtaking renderings of iconic US national parks. Your primary objective, of course, is to find the elusive Bigfoot and kill him dead. So what are you waiting for? Get your hiney in the RV, 'cause we're hunting us a Bigfoot!  My first comment about this game is just WOW! The devs put a lot of thought and painstaking effort into rendering such beautiful and detailed environments that are truly a joy to explore. Yeah, we're really here to nab us a 'squatch, but who's to say we can't squeeze a lil glamping in on the hush hush? The devs certainly won't 'pooh pooh' at that. On the contrary, exploration is rewarded big time. Sprinkled throughout the maps are outposts and cabins that contain additional supplies,. as well as safe combinations that, when used on the corresponding safes, give you incredibly useful rewards like dynamite and better long-range weapons.   There are also gravity-defying ziplines set up throughout that facilitate getting around the sprawling map with ease. So if you think I'm simply making a quick get-away from Bigfoot by taking that zipline, leaving you alone with a brutal assailant who's gotten funny ideas in his head about getting your esophagus better acquainted with your colon, well ... haha ... what's that? Can't hear you over the roar of the wind rushing past. But in all seriousness, exploring environments has been a standard in survival horror pretty much since the beginning, but it's been a while since I've played a game where the devs made every effort to make sure they didn't overlook a single opportunity to reward your exploratory impulses.   Now let's talk about the meat and trademarked Idaho potatoes of this experience: hunting Bigfoot. As you might expect, this is no easy task for several reasons. First of all, there's a reason Bigfoot is a cryptid. That fella just don't want to be found. And, over many, many years, he's gotten pretty adept at staying hidden. You could go several nights not even seeing hide nor hair of this man-ape through no fault of your own. But you'll certainly see footprints, mutilated animal carcasses, and -- not sure we really needed to commit to this level of detail -- fecal matter-desecrated outhouses. Hunting Bigfoot is also a challenge because that fella can take a hit! Hell, he can take hits, bullets, and several immolations. Even on the lowest difficulty setting, Bigfoot has a generous amount of health. And that's why your most effective weapon against him is not that high-powered sniper rifle you finally found in one of the safes, it's your brains.   You have so many tools at your disposal apart from the shooty-shooty and stabby-stabby varieties. You have GPS trackers, drones, cameras, traps, and bait to list several. And it's going to take all of those and more to successfully hunt down this mf'er who hits like a mac truck! And if you thought Bigfoot's brawn was the only arrow in his quiver, you might be as dumb as I am. It didn't occur to me until much too late that, while I was hunting Bigfoot, he was hunting me, sizing me up, devising ways to toy with me and fry my nerves to the point where every natural sound in the forest, ever twig snapping underfoot, had me jumping clear out of my spooped-in pair of pants.   Bigfoot has several modes of play for any variety of survival horror enthusiast. You can play by yourself, going mono a biggo against the cryptid. You can also play online co-op with up to 3 other players against an AI-controlled Bigfoot. And finally, to make your chaotic evil friends feel included, you can play 4 players versus a player-controlled Bigfoot.   It's honestly one of the most unique, well-executed co-op horror experiences I've ever had. You absolutely need to try this game!

Date 2022-09-20 Playtime 27h 33m Rec Positive So my recommendation is a yes/no. The game has beautiful graphics and a ton of hidden potential. Big foot is just way too damn difficult to defeat. I wish there was a way to hide from him in the night/maybe a place to take shelter, that way you can complete the objectives in the journal. Most of the time you don't even get to explore the entire map because big foot already probably killed you- even on his health and damage set to one. Might i recommend a way to heal up other than the med kits, like cooking meat over a fire or a grill?   Again a safe place to hide from big foot would be ideal, that way players can have means of breathing and finding more loot the next morning to try and take him down. I would love to spend more time exploring the maps. Bigfoot is also so fast that its difficult to get away from him unless you're close enough to a zipline and can take it to evade him.   Of course this game has its bugs. Like me getting stuck in a wall and not being able to get out while my partner is dying on the floor in need of heals lol  I see a ton of potential. I know the game probably isnt meant to be easy but like its rare if i ever do get the chance to kill him...other than that its an ok game. I dont mind it. Just needs a little tweaking :)

Date 2022-09-15 Playtime 29h 52m Rec Positive its awsome
Date 2022-09-15 Playtime 10h 2m Rec Positive Big feet
Date 2022-09-15 Playtime 26h 5m Rec Positive TL;DR Extremely interesting concept, but lacks polish. There are systems in the game that don't make a lot of sense, and it doesn't feel particularly well balanced. The game pits you and 1 to 3 buddies against Bigfoot who can either be another player or controlled by AI. Your goal is to either find evidence of Bigfoot and escape or to kill Bigfoot. Inversely, Bigfoot's goal is to kill all human players.   As players you scavenge around the map for resources and guns so you can stage an effective defense against Bigfoot, or you can try and hunt him down using the resources you have found if you want. We found the former to be the best approach against an AI Bigfoot because tracking it down during daylight hours can be an exercise in futility. We also found that gathering all evidence to escape can be inefficient and frustrating.  We haven't tried playing this with a human player as Bigfoot yet, but I don't feel like it would be very well balanced given that Bigfoot is at a fairly huge advantage most of the time. This is evident from the fact that even an AI Bigfoot can completely trample a player in a couple of attacks and there's no real hope of escaping or defending without taking huge amounts of damage. The heal kits are essentially a band aid used to cover for this, and your only real hope is that Bigfoot will eventually leave you alone before you run out of health, or that another player survives and can revive you with the totems. Traps are better used during combat as a way to hold Bigfoot in place so you can shoot at it. There's also no real point to adding meat to a trap and hoping to get Bigfoot from afar. As a result of this, hunting serves no real purpose other than, I guess, preventing Bigfoot from restoring its health...   The sound and graphics in the game is amazing! Seeing the stars, the moon or an aurora really is a sight to behold. The environmental sounds can lead to the occasional jump scare too. We've had several scares from a group of crows flying up as we moved past or bear growling nearby and one time we even got startled by a super loud bang from lightning striking and setting alight a tree nearby. In stark contrast to this, and most regrettably, the player character models fall off straight into the abyss of the uncanny valley. You get used to it pretty quickly, but as far as humanoid models go... they're definitely not the best. The run animation makes it look like they have a stick up their butt and it caused me to burst out laughing on numerous occasions especially early on.  Overall I enjoyed the game and can recommend it if you just want to kill some time on voice chat. Sadly, I must say, there's not much here once you peel open the layers... which is a shame really as it certainly has potential.

I've been playing solo and managing  to kill him and its still really fun A.I. bigfoot is very predictable still fun though. Would definitely recommend if you're into horror survival or investigative games the tools are really cool and honestly id say they did it better than similar games like dead by daylight,friday the 13th, and in silence. almost feels like a cross between phasmaphobia and friday the 13th and is very satisfying to survive and finally kill bigfoot no crazy rituals just traps bullets and bombs, dont sleep on the GPS tags either they're a life saver.

Date 2022-09-11 Playtime 117h 48m Rec Negative The game is great so far. It definitely needs some changes though. We need some kind of crafting menu for making ammo and health packs, because the amount we get may not always be sufficient. Also, if I'm inside near a wall and Bigfoot knocks me down, when I get up, I find myself stuck in the wall with no way out. Forcing me to quit, which just ruins the fun. Please fix this bug.  Edit as of May 28th, 2024. The game is fundamentally broken. They moved over to a engine, which is fine. But they released it in such a broken state. Bigfoot constantly gets stuck and it runs very poorly. I did recommend this game, but I have to change it so others don't waste their money. And for those that do own it already. You can access the 2021 version in the betas which is at least playable even though it's missing new content. I love this game, and I want to see it improve but this new update was not ready.

Date 2022-09-10 Playtime 58h 47m Rec Positive I love this game. It is perfect for my friend group. It is perfect for folks that don't have all day to game, and like the social interaction of getting together at a planned time for structured bonding.  We all love that you can play versus each other or the AI. Our only complaint is how quickly the DAY cycle passes. It is so brief and hardly leaves any time to gather the very spread out loot/ resources. We love all of the Maps and skin updates you've released. Been playing for awhile, love watching games we enjoy grow and develop around us. Very Happy overall, I cannot wait to see what is in store for this game moving forward.

Date 2022-09-10 Playtime 13h 59m Rec Negative this update is by the worst thing you done to this game. the flare and signal are pointless. The bigfoot takes 5 mins to return after he hits you when you can only do like 50 dmg to him then comes back hits you again then runs away for the rest of the night. Absolutely the worst thing to come out of this game. Now its just a chore to fight him and doesn't make the game fun. At least make the flare gun make him run for 30 secs then come back and the signal can at least stay the same.   Oh and another thing i forgot to mention the totem random spawning is broken for players joining the host they see every location the totem spawns at but they cannot pick it up.

Date 2022-09-09 Playtime 45h 48m Rec Positive This game is quite scary, but overall very enjoyable. One thing I will say, disregarding a few bugs here and there, there should be a way to track Bigfoot's body but only during multiplayer games, with a player as Bigfoot. Reason being, if whoever's playing bigfoot leaves, then the entire round goes to waste. I just had a round where we spent over an hour hunting bigfoot, and then the bigfoot player left. The reason there should be a way to track bigfoots body is so the hunters can still get the xp and satisfaction of killing bigfoot after essentially wasting over an hour of their time. Alternatively, the game could just end and the hunters win if whoever's playing bigfoot leaves. However, the first option might be more redeeming and satisfactory. Other than that, great game!

Date 2022-09-07 Playtime 2h 40m Rec Negative While it's fun to play with your friends for a bit, there is no challenge other than to kill Big Daddy Bigfoot.  I wish the game was more like The Forest or Green Hell, where the devs would add a whole survival aspect to it, where you can loot, craft, hunt, feed yourself, build a camp and survive in the forest with other animals attacking you too. Maybe give Bigfoot a whole family too or give him a backstory that you can discover the more you advance through the game. A bigger map would be lovely too with more places to loot and discover. Maybe they were going more for a game like Dead By Daylight but even then, the game is lacking a lot.  I have to give it to them though, the game looks nice. But I can't recommend it at this stage for this price.  TLDR: Dull game with only one real challenge (kill Bigfoot), asking 20 bucks for it feels like a scam.

Date 2022-09-06 Playtime 13h 38m Rec Positive I have to say I do recommend this game if you have a group of four or five friends as of right now. Hell, you and one other friend can still be pretty fun with this game.. but I do have to also add the game is still lacking in certain aspects. It is fun to run around and shoot at a big ape that's running like he needs to dunk his ass in the water nearby or even get caught in the middle of the night and have to fight the big guy until he runs away.   The game is still in early access so there is a lot that is probably going to be added or changed, the weapons are great and you can find what you want to use easily if you can find the codes for lockers or you can run around with the base gun and still win.. but I think there should be more items that help a bit of night time survivability for the hunters who want to stay out in the field. Scent covers/scent baits to make bigfoot lose where you are, or even a ghillie suit that makes it harder for it to spot you would be great but that is just a idea that came to mind while I was watching the big ape run around outside of a building I was in trying to find me.   I also want to say, it would be great to see a bigfoot vs AI mode get added. I know programming a new AI for hunters would be a challenge but it would give a new way to play solo if you wanted to practice bigfoot gameplay.   There's a lot of ways this game can grow and I can't wait to see what it becomes when it's at it's 1.0 state. (even though it says it's around 4.4, it feels like a 0.4.4 sometimes)
Date 2022-09-06 Playtime 18h 30m Rec Positive A+ Rated Game from those from Velociti Entertainment. Super fun to play with Friends. Can be somewhat fun to play around by yourself. All in all its a really good game.
Date 2022-09-06 Playtime 2h 20m Rec Positive Eh. Its not bad. You CAN enjoy it, and everyone is different, but if youre expecting actual investigation mechanics or anything close to hunting, this probably isnt it. Its more of a warfare than hunting, and as for investigation... snap a few photos of some scratches on the trees or footprints in the dirt, and thats that. Lol. Bigfoot is killable, but he is also probably some distant ancestor of Flash - way too damn fast for the body size and weight. You can hide in the houses successfully if the lights are off and the curtains are closed, giving you some stealth options, but he can detect you pretty much anywhere on the map at any time at night, making him semi-omniscient. God forbid youre even a step outside a house during the night. Hell just spawn outta your a**.  Other than that, not bad. Just not my thing. Maybe yours.

Date 2022-09-05 Playtime 5h 45m Rec Negative Nah
Date 2022-09-05 Playtime 2h 55m Rec Negative Bigfoot can apparently reach through walls and grab you no matter where you're standing, which make staying in a cabin/the camper to wait out the night meaningless. Many times I've been in a cabin, and out of nowhere I'm getting killed. I know he's still outside because I can hear the grass rustling, and the door isn't broken. I'm not near a window. I'm just standing by a wall, I hear some rustling, then all of a sudden I'm getting pummeled.  I'm not interested in playing this game anymore. It isn't fair that he can apparently clip through solid objects and vanish into thin air anytime he wants. I've followed him with my drone, just to watch him poof out of existence.  This might be playable with four people ([i]maybe[/i]), but it would still be an uphill grind with the bugs the way they are.  I'm sorry.  I'd really like to support the devs, especially since they're a Ukrainian company, but I honestly can't come up with a reason to spend the money on this.  Maybe after it gets fully realized and *ALL* the bugs ironed out I might play it again and recommend it, but as it is now?  I'm sorry, but I can't.  Asked for a refund.

Date 2022-09-04 Playtime 7h 42m Rec Positive The co-op vs AI was a little on the easy side. It'd be cool to be able to customise the difficulty a bit more. The multiplayer is really fun though. It's a lot harder to hunt Bigfoot when he knows to dodge shots and sneak up on people.
Date 2022-09-04 Playtime 13h 52m Rec Positive i like that it has big feet
Date 2022-09-04 Playtime 8h 45m Rec Positive It good
Date 2022-09-04 Playtime 35h 23m Rec Positive Das Spiel ist echt genial. Ich finde man brauch schon ein paar Runden um richtig reinzukommen, aber dann macht es schon echt Spaß!
Date 2022-09-04 Playtime 14h 15m Rec Positive I am a 41 year-old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a Dad to a 16-year-old son. My son got this game, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had over 10 hours on this game. This was rough for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him.   I loaded into the game, made my character--and world--and started playing, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it, as it was the best time I've spent with my Son since my hamster, Big Ounce, had died. This game has since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories

Date 2022-09-02 Playtime 11h 11m Rec Positive Quite a challenge of a game but not in a bad way, much better with friends and as long as this game gets updated somewhat regularly I think it will turn out to be much better. Bit of a shame too with the levelling system since its only use is to show players how many times they've beaten BigFoot

Date 2022-08-30 Playtime 33h 53m Rec Positive Game is good as long as there is more and more maps being added, fun to explore and get achievements.

Date 2022-08-28 Playtime 0h 52m Rec Negative Has lots of potential, but the Bigfoot AI really lets the game down.  Instead of hunting an illusive Bigfoot using the cameras, traps, drones. etc.   Bigfoot hunts you far too aggressively, making most of your kit completely redundant.

Date 2022-08-27 Playtime 0h 39m Rec Negative Eher nicht zu empfehlen. Wird nach 1-2 Runden absolut langweilig und die KI ist auch komplett fürn Eimer. Dazu haben sie mit dem letzten Update das Balancing komplett verkackt, wodurch der Bigfoot noch stärker wurde.  Investiert das Geld lieber in irgendwas, was im Sale ist und den Kauf wert ist.

Date 2022-08-26 Playtime 2h 18m Rec Negative Its fun for about 10 minutes. Big foot runs screaming from the woods and kills you frequently, and the spookiness aspect that it initially had is long gone. Now I see micro-transactions have been added.   If the developer finishes the game, vastly improves core game play, and moves the paid dlc to in game earned items, then I will change to a positive. As it is now? No.

Date 2022-08-26 Playtime 5h 19m Rec Positive [h1]Bigfoot  und der Yeti, gibt es sie wirklich?[/h1]  Diese Frage stellen sich nicht nur die Menschen in der Realität sondern auch die Spieler in diesem Game. In einer Mischung aus einem Jagt Simulator, einem Survival Game und einem Detektiv Abenteuer versuchen wir neben der Jagt auf unseren Haarigen Widersacher auch den Mord mehrerer Jugendlicher aufzuklären. Hierfür stehen uns einige Items zu Verfügung die wir auf der Karte Looten müssen. Neben Waffen und Bärenfallen, stehen uns noch andere Hilfsmittel Wie Kameras und Drohnen zu Verfügung bzw. einige Sachen um improvisierte Gegenstände Tödlichen Fallen zu anzufertigen.  [b]Die Charakter Auswahl,[/b] [list]bietet uns die Möglichkeit zwischen 4 Charaktere die alle unterschiedliche stärken besitzen auszuwählen. Auch wenn sie ihre Stäre eher im Team gut einsetzen können kann man auch im Singelplay unseren Gegner gut beschäftigen. Ob man ihn ernsthaft auch allein besiegen kann weiß ich nicht wirklich, ich konnte es nach einigen Spielen nicht. Auch kann man unseren Freund auch selbst Spielen. in einer fünfer Gruppe ist dieses Spiel meiner meinung nach besser als Dead by Daylight.[/list]  [b]Das Gameplay,[/b] [list]erinnert zu beginn eher an ein Survival Game. Wir starten bei unserem Camper und Rüsten uns aus um dann auf Erkundung zu gehen. Unser Ziel ganz klar Bigfoot. Wir wuseln also durch den Wald, dessen Geräuschkulisse wirklich schon stimmig ist, und finden neben Zeltplätze, Jagdhütten und Hochsitzen, auch den ein oder anderen beweis für Bigfoot. Unterweg finden stoßen wir dann auch einige Überreste vom jungen Leuten die den Spaß im Wald nicht so ganz genießen konnten.[/list]  [b]Loot, Loot und nochmal Loot.[/b] [list]Für eins bis zwei Jägern ist die Menge an Waffen, Medizin und anderen Hilfsmittel für die Jagt recht gut. Mit einer vollen Gruppe wird es dann doch etwas eng. Es sollen Munition und Medizin nach Spornen, dieses kann ich aber nicht wirklich bestätigen. [/list]  [b]Nicht nur Bigfoot möchte gejagt werden.[/b] [list]Wir können auch wenn es unsere Zeit zulässt auf auf Tier jagt gehen. Auch wenn man einige der Tiere einmal für Errungenschaften braucht ist das jagen aber mehr als überflüssig. Man verschwendet Munition die man für Bigfoot benötig und Zeit in der wir sicher Looten gehen können.[/list]  [b]Mein Fazit;[/b] Jetzt nach einigen Verbesserungen ein durchaus schönes und Anspruchsvolles Spiel gerade in einer Gruppe. Für die Singelplayer ist es doch immer noch recht schwer, aber im vergleich zu vor dem Patch endlich schaffbar. Wenn es im Sale ist eine klare Kaufempfehlung trotz EA Status. Wir haben euch ein mal ein kleines LP gemacht mit einer 2 Mann Truppe macht euch doch einfach mal selbst ein Bild. https://youtu.be/Wuiy3xaokjg

Date 2022-08-23 Playtime 33h 32m Rec Positive Honest review, it’s actually pretty good. For an “Early Access Game” it functions really well! Don’t get me wrong, there’s certainly bugs, but what did you expect from a game that upfront tells you it’s not finished? The developers listen to their players and update frequently, which is already better than a lot of developing teams out there.  The game provides a solid difficulty. Even if you follow a guide the game still gives you a challenge even on Bigfoot’s default settings. Once you play it a bit you figure it out though (all those people saying Bigfoot is too hard to beat just haven’t played the game enough and haven’t figured out the mechanics. Once you figure it out, it’s actually pretty straightforward.)  The only thing I would change is randomize where the safes show up. That way players don’t know right from the get go where the good loot is.  Overall, the developers definitely have some small tweaks to do, but even if they released the game in its current state I’d say they made something they should be proud of. It’s a fun game! 👍

Date 2022-08-22 Playtime 1h 42m Rec Positive great game not enough players
Date 2022-08-22 Playtime 33h 58m Rec Positive  An overall amazing game. It can seem difficult at first, but after honing your skills for a few rounds, defeating Bigfoot becomes achievable, yet still impressive.
Date 2022-08-22 Playtime 25h 21m Rec Positive This game has changed my whole life. I've never been so turned on by a big smelly creature like this. I really have changed personality over the scent of this big ass monkey. I have never wanted to fuck a creature this bad in my whole fucking life. Damn man, everytime he screams I hope he would scream at me like that. Like damn this monkey is so fucking hot I wish he stuck his big feet 20 inches up my ass. MMMMM this monkey is so fucking hot, every day when it's steaming hot my cum evaporates to the pictures of this fucking monkey. Damn man I would go as far as to say, that this game has deserved a larger rating scale. Like maybe we should normalize giving every good game a 10/1000 and this one a 900/1000 (minus 100 because of no gay hard anal sex with the monkey or the option to fuck the monkey as the female character in general). Please make more games with such hot characters.
Date 2022-08-22 Playtime 13h 10m Rec Positive this game is great with a few friends, whether you're hunting the bigfoot together or one of you is playing as the bigfoot. It's both terrifying and hilarious

Date 2022-08-22 Playtime 23h 48m Rec Negative this game was amazing 2 years ago when i first got it. i played it a lot with my friends. i just bought it for a friend of mine and started to play again and there was a very big update that made the game much worse. its better to have to hunt bigfoot and be terrified the entire time, not have a war with him in daylight. i played one game today and its kinda bullshit. at the very least change it up so that there is a game mode that has the old version of the game. i liked that way better. amazing job with what you have done but i much prefer the older version
Date 2022-08-22 Playtime 16h 42m Rec Positive Good game to play with friends, scary but not terrifying to the point of getting off. Replay value is not as good though, after about 2-3 rounds it begins to be monotonous. 7.5/10

Date 2022-08-20 Playtime 5h 4m Rec Positive This game is pretty neat, You are able to run around attempting to find Bigfoot all the while he is still hunting you.

Implementation rather bad :( +A Few maps to choose from  -There are only a few weapons to choose  -AI: even on hardest Difficulty to predictable and easy to kill if you hunt him down after he attacks you -A round can go from like an hour up to serval hours when he always avoids you even on night -Theres not really a way to track him down only a few cams which can be destroyed by him, a Drone wich has limited battery and his "Roar" which he uses to track "YOU" down

Date 2022-08-20 Playtime 3h 23m Rec Negative Without more options for game settings and sliders for those settings, its just not worth it. Bigfoot always wins since he can kill all the hunters at once during a fight and can catch anyone who tries to run since he is faster. He also has an ability which literally shows him where the hunters are. And in terms of slowing big foot down the hunters only have two options both of which last too short of a time. Plus the voicechat has delay so if bigfoot is far away then comes closer even if you arent talking then, he hears previous things you said which allows him to follow audio anyways.  tl;dr big foot is too powerful making it impossible for the hunters to win causing the game to be unbalanced and not worth it in its current state if you want a game to play often.
Date 2022-08-20 Playtime 13h 55m Rec Positive when is sex update? big monkey man have big monkey rod? what about balls? I need to see. I think it would be necessary. best update, full penetration. funny with cameras.
Date 2022-08-20 Playtime 6h 6m Rec Negative I don't think the game should be 20$ considering it's still early access, and there's not much to the game so after you play it once there's nothing else to do and not really fun. Only three maps that are the same everytime, a predictable AI, and not enough variety of weapons/items to use in game.

Date 2022-08-19 Playtime 4h 33m Rec Negative A mediocre title if there was ever one, Bigfoot is far to strong in the game, when in pvp. And when facing the ai it becomes trivial because the ai is as dumb as rocks. Can be fun when played with a group of friends, but not for long periods of time. 4/10 maybe buy it on sale if you have money to waste and time to kill

Date 2022-08-18 Playtime 14h 46m Rec Positive Great game! We just completed our first hunt and it was very fun, but I can see this game getting very boring fast if the devs don't put out a constant stream of new maps and change the loot locations on maps every time.  Only issue I have with the game is that the nights are WAYYY too long and the Day is WAYYYY too short.
Date 2022-08-18 Playtime 8h 2m Rec Positive Good times, ran around and watched Samsquanch disembowel my wife and I became Rambo in the woods lol. That shotty had a body!  Genuinely a neat idea of gameplay. Someone or an AI can be a bigfoot, and a group of bigfoot believers are tasked with going to get proof of it, but also kill it.   Up to 5 ppl can play together (one of them has to be playing as bigfoot).   IT IS TOUGH. In the best of ways.

Date 2022-08-17 Playtime 13h 49m Rec Positive This game is very fun to play around with and to mess around with. Bigfoot has such a fun AI to play with and is absolutely terrifying on what he could do. The graphics are great, and so is the gameplay. You can get notifications when placing down cameras to see where Bigfoot is at all times, use traps to trap him (which makes him shriek and get his health down), and fly around a cool drone that I lost so many times. Overall 6/10. It is great but there seems to be something off, friends, if you have friends, which I hope you do, the game will be a big upgrade. Personally, the history with my friends playing this game was hilarious and fun. Although I recommend playing singleplayer first, then start playing with your friends. With friends 8/10. He can come out in the daytime but he is weaker and less annoying. I don't know if things can regenerate, so if you are playing for a long time you are screwed. This is pretty much my review. Thanks for listening in!
Date 2022-08-17 Playtime 3h 18m Rec Negative  Terrible game. I thought this would be really fun but for the price its just not worth it and I would refund if I could.  It glitches out constantly and Bigfoot comes out during the day, not just at night. There is not a good player base either so good luck finding people to play with. Its just boring

Date 2022-08-16 Playtime 9h 35m Rec Positive Well 1st of all the realism in the gameplay is like 60/40 60 being the unrealistic side. 2nd is the render distance and texture graphics, i feel they could be better but it's not like this game is next gen or something so yeah. 3rd bigfoot has a ridiculous amount of HP and his attack pattern and times are predictable and lame. the characters are good though, I like how they all have their own bio. also I don't like how easy bigfoot can just break in, it's no different when your in the trailer because he just hit you through the windows constantly and there's now way to avoid his attacks. also when u gut an animal in the game it's unrealistic and they don't ragdoll, they just freeze in mid air after you gut them for meat. Also I don't like how bigfoot can hold a weapon either, other than these problems with the game it's alright.

Date 2022-08-15 Playtime 5h 41m Rec Positive I've done a deep dive into the bigfoot/sasquatch world and from what I've seen the lack of solid footage comes from a couple of things, of course assuming that these sightings/stories are true for the time being.  They're extremely stealthy despite thier size and can apparently crouch on all fours and get very flat/low to the ground. Once they're standing/sitting/crouching in dense bushland it's incredibly difficult to distinguish a large brownish black mass from all the foilage amongst it.  They're very aware of people and always keep thier distance.  They're smart enough to avoid trail cameras, Gorillas and chimps have been proven to do this.  People are very terrified when they encounter them and don't want to stick around to get footage nor want to every come across another one ever again usually. They already keep thier distance but if they happen to come somewhat close to one they have to deal with the initial world shattering shock that a fake creature is real and then they realise how huge and strong they are, that they look angry because you're there and they run for thier lives. There's a reason that the Aboriginals of Australia deemed the "Yowie" which is basically the aussie bigfoot a demon spirit and were/are terrified of it. They're capable of doing terrible things to people and they're very big, very fast and very strong.

It is a great game to play with friends, kinda scary to play by yourself. You get hunted by a sasquatch when u are trying to kill it. you have many weapons you can choose from and many other tools you can use to kill that damnable monster. It has great sound and graphics(except for player character models). It is a great game that you should get.

Date 2022-08-11 Playtime 9h 34m Rec Negative this is quite possibly the most unfun, uninteresting, boring, and agonizing games i have ever played. The game is called bigfoot but whenever i play i see bigfoot once every hour and a half. The game is fun for the first hour laughing about how awful the game is, but then it becomes the most boring game ever its not even fun bad its just agonizing slow and boring its almost like looking for bigfoot in real life.

Date 2022-08-10 Playtime 8h 38m Rec Positive Its a fun game , but:  1. maps are WAY too big, especially in 4v1 pvp mode, you can play indefinetly and cant find each other. 2. bigfoot smell is useless, needs a rework. if you are in range of 25m whatever bigfoot needs sort of wallhack, otherwise its too hard. 3. fire against bigfoot is WAY too strong, you cant see ANYTHING for like 20secs. And players have like 10 shots flaregun, this is really not much fun. 4. healing as bigfoot takes too long time especially with hunt animals, they run faster than bigfoot. you cant hunt them easily. trash heals very small amount, should be doubled at least.

Date 2022-08-10 Playtime 18h 43m Rec Positive Bigfoot macht echt Spaß, es hat coole Funktionen, funktioniert gut und sieht schick aus. Es gibt 3 Spielmodi, in denen man entweder alleine oder zusammen mit Freunden gegen Bigfoot als KI oder anderen Spieler spielen kann. Dazu gibt es insgesamt drei ziemlich große Maps und noch einige Waffen, welche aber an ihrer Anzahl hoffentlich weiter wachsen. Allgemein wünsche ich mir mehr Interaktionsmöglichkeiten mit der Spielwelt. Man kann natürlich looten, einige Geräte aktivieren, die dann Geräusche verursachen, um Bigfoot anzulocken, Lichter an- und aus schalten sowie Vorhänge vor Fenster ziehen, aber viel mehr ist leider nicht möglich. Ich sehe in diesem Spiel aber noch sehr viel Potential, welches sicherlich noch mit der Zeit genutzt wird. Mein Fazit: Cooles Spiel, fairer Preis. Ich kann es definitiv empfehlen.

Even if you get through finding all looting areas, players who leave grief items away and jump into lake. If i paid 5 dollars for this game it would of been okay, but The Forest is 1000 times better then this trash.

For anyone who is in the same boat of intrigue about this game, it's still in very-early-access and needs time to develop since the developers originated in Ukraine and had to move due to the 2022 Russian-Ukraine conflicts. Here's the simplified answer to some thoughts... Playing single player is a horror game, 2 or more is a fun and goofy experience, and 5 players is total chaos when there is a player that plays Bigfoot. Yes, you can actually play Bigfoot! (If you have enough players) If you're buying this game, buy at least 3 copies because friends are necessary for this game. One final comment, the devs are awesome!

Date 2022-08-08 Playtime 6h 14m Rec Negative Killing the Bigfoot is boring. Walking around for hours trying to find clues is boring. The game is unfortunately boring.
Date 2022-08-08 Playtime 0h 35m Rec Negative Definitely not worth the $16. If it were free, maybe I would recommend the game, but the gameplay seemed as if it were in a beta stage. Lack of instructions, and the controls are not that intuitive though they could be changed by the player. Bigfoot is also a confirmed racist.

Date 2022-08-07 Playtime 3h 26m Rec Negative The positive reviews are really just because this game is streamer bait and a meme. This is probably the worst game I've ever sunk a few hours into on Steam. It is:  1) Blatantly unfinished from multiple perspectives, and not appropriate for any kind of public release. 2) Completely disrespectful of the player's time (have fun wandering the map for claw marks on one of a thousand trees).  3) Can not be described as balanced in any way, not only in the sense that it has major balance issues, but in that I don't think the dev did any serious work to balance it, at all. It feels like no real thought was put into it.  The Bigfoot is not only pretty much invincible and not something you can do anything about in either solo, co-op, or PvP (the lattermost making the issue even worse), but the game doesn't even seem to try to hide this fact: the creature has over 1,000 HP, yet your weapons do 1-4 points of damage on average per shot (slightly more with a shotgun). Despite this, ammo is fairly rare considering how much he requires to take down.  He uses constant grab attacks and is faster than you, so there is nothing you can do if he charges you. If another human is controlling him, the situation is hopeless unless the players just hide, but Bigfoot has powers to find players fairly easily and then quickly overwhelm them.  You might say 'but the point is to avoid him and find the clues.' Yea, well, as I mentioned, have fun with the 'needle in a haystack' gameplay that is, like everything else, pretty clearly an afterthought. What's more, if that's the intention, why give the players as much weaponry and ammo as they do? You're clearly meant to be able to kill Bigfoot as an option, but this isn't feasible, and if there is a consistent way to do it, the game clearly doesn't want you to know about it or have ready access to it.  It sucks. It just does. This is the first game I've purchased on Steam in a long time that I regret even the modest expense I made with it. The only value I got out of it was via the friends I played it with, and that's all to do with them, and nothing to do with this joke. I can't be kind about it because the design decisions made here scream laziness and cynicism.
Date 2022-08-07 Playtime 8h 14m Rec Positive THIS IS FUN WE'RE HAVING FUN
Date 2022-08-07 Playtime 2h 11m Rec Negative This game should be titled, "Wait for Bigfoot to come and kill you." Even at the lowest health bar, Bigfoot eats bullets like they are M&M's. The drone basically doesn't have a range for its camera, and the game's performance is wildly inconsistent.  There is a good idea here, and I think I see what the developers are going for, but the execution just didn't do it for me.
Date 2022-08-07 Playtime 10h 5m Rec Positive His schlong is as long as a week
Date 2022-08-07 Playtime 34h 12m Rec Positive Overall decent game with some flaws. Bigfoot takes too much time in between attacks sometimes and you can end up waiting around for like 30 mins waiting for him to attack. There is also only one real way of beating the game, have him step in a trap and spam explosives. If bigfoot was more aggressive and if you could make items like first aid kits, this game would be a lot better. fun game with friends, the 3 maps are all cool too. 7/10 would recommend
Date 2022-08-07 Playtime 10h 46m Rec Positive gone squatchin?
Date 2022-08-07 Playtime 5h 49m Rec Positive 10/10 is boring by your self but its so good with your friend we had a party playing this game i recommend for people who has friends only over all 10/10
Date 2022-08-07 Playtime 5h 44m Rec Negative This game was something to play every now and then but after the new yellowstone update bigfoot acts like a bitch ass pussy. He finally attacked on night 4 after we started killing ourselves with boom.

Date 2022-08-07 Playtime 15h 4m Rec Positive Looking at bigfoot ass makes me hard i love this game.
Date 2022-08-07 Playtime 50h 31m Rec Positive This Game is incredible the thrill and thought/hunting Bigfoot is really fun the Game creators have put in good work and made this game one of my favorites, i heavily recommend to get this game they did so many good updates and i cannot wait to see what they put out in the future for this game. (Great Game)
Date 2022-08-07 Playtime 0h 37m Rec Negative Killed half the animals in Yellowstone waiting for bigfoot to show.  When he showed up,he took 5% of my healthbar and then ran away like a bitch in a hail of gunfire.  I chased him halfway across the forest putting bullet after bullet into his furry ass only to realize that he regenerates health and was pretty much impossible to kill solo.    Cool concept, and nice atmosphere... but once you realize that bigfoot is a pussy bullet sponge programmed to run away when he takes damage,  it all falls apart.  I also had no idea what the point of meat was? My character never seemed to get hungry, but I managed to stockpile like 40 meats from all the cute little woodland creatures I mercilessly butchered.
Date 2022-08-07 Playtime 5h 48m Rec Positive I played as bigfoot and jumpscared my friend as many times as I possibly could, very fun

Date 2022-08-06 Playtime 1h 0m Rec Negative 빅풋게임 잘 플레이...(?)해보았는데요! 솔직히 저로써는 게임은 재미있어 보여서 구매를 해보앗찌만;;; 전혀 재미가 있지가 않고.... 더럽게 재미있다는거보단...친구들이랑 해도 무방은 하겠지만 친구 가없는사람들이랑 하면 말도 안통해서 하기가 힘들구요. 아이템파밍도 이상하고;;;총도이상하네요  아까 사냥용수렵총으로 흰색곰 머리 쐈는데 안뒈져서 실망이 커 환불하러 갑니다.영상도 찍어 놨습니다.플레이 영상 나중에 올리도록 하겟습니다.^^  https://youtu.be/a63hVtTjGps
Date 2022-08-06 Playtime 85h 43m Rec Positive Bigfoot is a pretty good game, pdates dont happen regularly, but do come with lots of content at release, making it all worth it, you get to hunt or be Bigfoot, there is currently 3 maps (might be 4 when reading this), which makes it worth to play many times on different maps and different characters and you pretty much need friends to play multiplayer, since all other servers are PvP, which really isn't fun. Would Recommend

Date 2022-08-06 Playtime 7h 30m Rec Positive Amazing
Date 2022-08-06 Playtime 5h 58m Rec Negative There's really nothing to do in the game as far as missions and quests goes. Collecting evidence doesn't really do anything and there's no real story to the game. Once you beat or play as Bigfoot one time the novelty wears off and it's boring.   Definitely a fun game to play with friends once or twice.
Date 2022-08-06 Playtime 35h 48m Rec Positive This is one of the best games on steam, and possibly the best horror game I've played.  The devs are consistent with updating and progressing the game, unlike other greenlit games; the only 'down-side' is that it's a bit repetitive... I think that'll change with future updates.

Date 2022-08-05 Playtime 10h 30m Rec Positive Nur in diesem Spiel wirst du zum allerechten Profi-Bigfoot-Jäger oder mutierst selbst zu Bigfoot. Es gibt wohl fast nichts witzigeres als dieses Spiel im Coop mit Freunden. Durch die verschiedenen Schwierigkeitsstufen kann man sich langsam ans feste Bigfootfell herantasten und die Schwierigkeit höherstellen/Bigfoot verstärken wenn man eine neue Challenge sucht. Jedoch hätte man durchaus mehr als nur 3 Stufen und mehr Faktoren als nur Health und Damage von Bigfoot und Lootrate einführen können, zum Beispiel das er neue Attack-Muster oder Fähigkeiten hat, desto schwieriger es wird. Die Openworld ist recht übersichtlich und nicht zu groß, das macht das langsame Gehtempo aber wieder wett. Es gibt relativ viel zu entdecken und alles zu erkunden und zu finden dauert sicher ein bisschen. Auch die Hinweise mit den Geschichten zu den einzelnen toten Touristen sind gut. Es ist schade dass es nur 3 Maps gibt (Stand 05.08.2022), dadurch kennt man nach wenigen Spielen alle Standorte schon. Auch die Spielmechanik mit den Tresoren und den zugehörigen Codes ist cool, leider sind die Codes meist ein bisschen zu weit vom Tresor entfernt. Auch die speziellen Waffen die in den Tresoren sind bieten eine gute Abwechslung zur Sniper, Shrotflinte oder Pistole bei der Bigfoot-Jagd. Die Respawn-Fähigkeit mit Totems ist ebenfalls ein Punkt der mir sehr gefällt. Ich würde mir ein paar mehr Items im Spiel wünschen, so zum Beispiel verschieden große Medikits. Außerdem wären ein paar mehr spielbare Charaktere auch cool, welche dann auch einzigartige Fähigkeiten haben anstatt nur Buffs auf bestimmte Eigenschaften. Es wäre auch gut wenn man dem Levelsystem in Zukunft eine Funktion gibt. Alles in allem ist BIGFOOT ein guter Zeitvertreib für ein paar Stunden mit guten Freunden. Ich gebe diesem Spiel 4 von 5 gefangenen Bigfoots !

Date 2022-08-03 Playtime 8h 39m Rec Negative The game was a nice breath of fresh air at first, but then you come to the conclusion that guns, ammo, and med-kits and hard to find.  Bigfoot has way to much health, he eats bullets and hits like a truck. The maps are all similar and have no variety. Do not buy unless you have lots of time to keep dying over and over.
Date 2022-08-03 Playtime 8h 19m Rec Negative This game was way too hard even on easy mode. And its not even scary after the first 20 minutes. There's not enough guns and ammo and heals even with loot all the way up. And big foot hits way to hard. And the revival process is too hard. And steam wont even refund. Don't buy unless you want to be big foot.

Date 2022-08-03 Playtime 14h 46m Rec Negative My issue: The game is very repetitive and boring after playing the maps more than once. Bigfoot even after the nerf has a lot of health even on easy. Bigfoot is to unpredictable and strong and it seems he will kill you even if you fill his chest with lead and flairs.   Good: The quest to find all civilians and take pictures of them is good but a little hard due to the sheer amount of evidence you have to collect. The game looks AMAZING and the map is pretty good.  Fix: Random structure generation could make the game fresh. More starting ammo and better traps on easy and medium to make easy mean easy. Bigfoot being smarter as the game goes on but also actually running away when you flair him.  Overall I don't think the game is bad its just unfinished and is better with friends. 5/10

Date 2022-08-03 Playtime 24h 31m Rec Positive I like it, would recommend it could be a bit slow at times and could get really annoying when the Bigfoot just only runs in multiplayer but other than that i would recommend

Date 2022-08-03 Playtime 13h 14m Rec Negative Might play this again with my friends, but not with the community bc big issue tho with people modding and robbing..... They run 10x faster than everyone, drop out of map after robbing everything, kinda wish team was AI :/, think thats bad watch cheaters also camp a spot and leave the game if you refuse to push their defenses they hide behind the whole game. Dont play unless you have reliable friends you want to play with

It's quite scary while playing alone and with friends. There isn't a lot to do in this game, but with Bigfoot's AI, each match is quite different. It has great atmosphere, and a really good gameplay loop. It's been around ever since 2017, but the developers make new versions of the game, making it feel always up-to-date.  [h3] Reviews [/h3] Positive - 83% ------------------- Negative – 17% The negative reviews state how the game has lots of bugs, and feels unfinished.

Date 2022-07-26 Playtime 297h 34m Rec Positive First playing this game is quite an experience.  The ambience and background music create a sense of awe and mystery at first but later suspense as you realize....Something is watching you.  The terrain utterly beautiful and the Bigfoot AI, while occasionally wonky, is bonechilling.  The use of strategy and prioritization really get your gears turning as you attempt to prove its existence with it dead or alive.  As of the game's current state, I would give it 4.5/5 stars, and once the game is fully released with more content and less bugs, it will surely be a 5/5 game.
Date 2022-07-26 Playtime 42h 49m Rec Positive Not the best game in the world, but is insanely fun to play with a group of people.
Date 2022-07-26 Playtime 17h 43m Rec Positive While my group and I have yet to properly take out Bigfoot, we have enjoyed the experience. We get a little better every time we play. There's also the option for a player to be in the role of Bigfoot. That seems to be the most played open lobby type.  Basically, you need to find resources and weapons, find missing people, collect evidence, and defeat Bigfoot. Bigfoot tends to recover and feed during the day, and hunt players at night. It won't go down easily, and the AI Bigfoot used to always find you, even when you hide. That seems to have been changed now.  The developers are Ukrainian, and they managed to escape to Europe, where they continue development. Considering supporting them if you wish.

Date 2022-07-25 Playtime 42h 5m Rec Positive According to all known laws of aviation,     there is no way a bee should be able to fly.     Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.     The bee, of course, flies anyway     because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.     Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.     Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.     Barry! Breakfast is ready!     Ooming!     Hang on a second.     Hello?     - Barry? - Adam?     - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.     Looking sharp.     Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.     Sorry. I'm excited.     Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.     A perfect report card, all B's.     Very proud.     Ma! I got a thing going here.     - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!     - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!     Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!     - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.     - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.     Never thought I'd make it.     Three days grade school, three days high school.     Those were awkward.     Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.     You did come back different.     - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.     - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.     - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.     Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.     Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.     I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.     I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.     That's why we don't need vacations.     Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.     - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!     - Bee-men. - Amen!     Hallelujah!     Students, faculty, distinguished bees,     please welcome Dean Buzzwell.     Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...     ...9:15.     That concludes our ceremonies.     And begins your career at Honex Industries!     Will we pick ourjob today?     I heard it's just orientation.     Heads up! Here we go.     Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.     - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.     Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco     and a part of the Hexagon Group.     This is it!     Wow.     Wow.     We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life     to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.     Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.     Our top-secret formula     is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured     into this soothing sweet syrup     with its distinctive golden glow you know as...     Honey!     - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!     - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.     - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive     to improve every aspect of bee existence.     These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.     - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.     Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.     - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey     that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.     Oan anyone work on the Krelman?     Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know     that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.     But choose carefully     because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.     The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.     What's the difference?     You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off     in 27 million years.     So you'll just work us to death?     We'll sure try.     Wow! That blew my mind!     "What's the difference?" How can you say that?     One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.     I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.     But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?     Why would you question anything? We're bees.     We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.     You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?     Like what? Give me one example.     I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.     Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.     Wait a second. Oheck it out.     - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.     I've never seen them this close.     They know what it's like outside the hive.     Yeah, but some don't come back.     - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!     You guys did great!     You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!     - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.     Their day's not planned.     Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.     You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.     Right.     Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.     It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.     Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.     Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?     Distant. Distant.     Look at these two.     - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.     It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.     Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!     He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!     - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.     What were you doing during this?     Trying to alert the authorities.     I can autograph that.     A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?     Yeah. Gusty.     We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.     - Six miles, huh? - Barry!     A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.     - Maybe I am. - You are not!     We're going 0900 at J-Gate.     What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?     I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.     Hey, Honex!     Dad, you surprised me.     You decide what you're interested in?     - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.     Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?     Son, let me tell you about stirring.     You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.     You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.     You know, Dad, the more I think about it,     maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.     You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?     That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.     Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!     - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.     You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!     - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!     Wait till you see the sticks I have.     I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!     Let's open some honey and celebrate!     Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.     Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!     I'm so proud.     - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.     Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.     Yeah, right.     Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...     - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!     One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.     - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!     Wow!     Oouple of newbies?     Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!     Make your choice.     - You want to go first? - No, you go.     Oh, my. What's available?     Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.     - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.     I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.     Wax monkey's always open.     The Krelman opened up again.     What happened?     A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.     Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.     Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!     Oh, this is so hard!     Heating, cooling

Date 2022-07-21 Playtime 11h 2m Rec Positive My rating: 6/10 The game is good and all, it looks great if you have a decent PC and the gameplay is totally fine. However after beating Bigfoot for the second time the game got way too repetetive and boring. Bigfoot comes every night so to win you basically have to look for a zipline every night, ride up and down, deal some damage and wait until the sun rises. So I recommend to buy this game only when it's on sale as it can get boring pretty quickly.

Date 2022-07-18 Playtime 10h 29m Rec Negative Edit: How to ruin a game in one swift move: force an Epic launcher on your players.  This game is no longer worth your time or effort as the Devs have shown just how much they care for their player-base.  The below is my original review, which was positive. This is now irrelevant. Avoid this train-wreck. Sadly, it's too late for a refund...  I have actually yet to play this as anything other than a solo experience, but I think co-op would improve the game by multiples. That being said, I have no real complaints about playing solo (but it isn't an easy way to play, that's for sure). Stealth, combat, multiple 'toys' such as cameras, drones, traps, explosives, weapons and more: it's all here as well as a honkin' big Cryptid trying to separate your limbs from your body.  Also, they've put out a new map and updates (Yellowstone is rather great), all while being displaced from their country due to an ego-driven war by that douche-rocket Putin. That is dedication to a game!  Squatchin' fun for one and all!
Date 2022-07-18 Playtime 5h 36m Rec Positive You guys are badass, buy this game!
Date 2022-07-18 Playtime 31h 46m Rec Positive Overall this game is great and quite fun. I can see this game going places and having a very bright future. At first, when I bought to play with my friend purely out of curiosity we didn't play the game that much. However, now with Bigfoot being updated with new mechanics we enjoy playing it now. There are a few aspects I don't like, for example, Bigfoot, if played by a human, can see the survivors chat. This can easily compromise our plans such as we're we plan walking to. I do need to say there is a lot more of "I just screwed up moments" than being scared moments. If you're looking for a horror experience this game would be good for about the first 5 hours of gameplay. If you plan on buying this purely for the horror experience, I suggest looking at other games such as Dead By Daylight, or purchase Outlast Trials, when it comes out. If I could rate the game out of 10 I'll give it an 8.  Stay alive and keep up the great work, CyberLight.

Date 2022-07-06 Playtime 1h 57m Rec Positive This game saved my life.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my "labor". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you

Date 2022-07-06 Playtime 3h 37m Rec Negative The fact that most of the reviewers have less than 10 hours of game time should be more telling than the positive joke reviews. Bigfoot is "a" game, but it's nowhere near as filled-out as a five-year-old game should be. You pick it up, you play a few hours with friends, then you put it down and never go back. There really isn't enough ammo in the game to kill Bigfoot on all but the easiest difficulty, and finding all of your tree scratches to win the game the investigation way will have you searching for a needle in a haystack potentially for hours. Combat is finding a zipline and making Bigfoot chase you back and forth while your team peppers him with gunfire while he's running. Any other method will slowly turn your team into mincemeat because he's faster than you, and takes more than a thousand rounds to kill.  In short, it's like the game Evolve with a whole lot less content, and that game did not do well.

Date 2022-07-04 Playtime 0h 57m Rec Negative It's really slow and bigfoot is a giant bullet sponge. You run around the map for over an hour until he destroys you. It might be fun for some, but as it stands I don't think this is that fun.

Date 2022-07-03 Playtime 3h 6m Rec Negative [h1] Какой кошмар [/h1]  Биг Фут приезжает спустя 5 минут к вашей пати и начинает вас танчить. Пати из 3ех человек стреляет в него 10 минут из всего доступного оружия (в это время он мутузит вас по всей карте) и не сносит даже 15%.  От него нельзя спрятаться - негде.  Нельзя убежать - он быстрее игрока в 10 раз.  Все камеры, дрон, ловушки, камеры ночного виденья которые можно найти в начале игры в трейлере бесполезны, так как его не нужно выслеживать, он найдет вас сам, он точно знает где.   Если б суть игры была в том чтоб найти бункер и запустить оттуда байрактар в него, тогда было бы весело.

Date 2022-06-28 Playtime 15h 9m Rec Positive Personal rating: 9/10  Should you buy? ☒ Right this moment ☐ On sale ☐ Don't bother The Graphics: ☒ Breathtaking ☐ Beautiful ☐ Good ☐ Bad ☐ MS Paint The Gameplay: ☐ You will never get bored ☒ Fun for a very long time ☐ Fun for a while ☐ Fun at first ☐ Boring ☐ Refund this right now Bug rating: ☐ Perfectly polished ☒ Very few bugs ☐ Some Bugs ☐ A lot of bugs ☐ Unplayable Replayable? ☒ Yes ☐ No Multiplayer? ☒ Yes ☐ No The actual review: This game is very fun to play with friends or alone. Bigfoot adapts to the traps you set, sets their own trap for you and slowly gets more intelligent as the game goes on. The suspense is amazing as you walk around through the forest at night, jumping at every leaf rustle and noise you hear. There is no scarier feeling than seeing Bigfoot charge out of the bushes, ready to slam you to the ground. I'd recommend this game to anyone who is on the fence about it.
Date 2022-06-28 Playtime 22h 19m Rec Positive Le jeu est vraiment bien, le seul problème c'est que cela deviens un peu répétitif au bout d'un moment. Avec des amis c'est une expérience de fou

Date 2022-06-27 Playtime 22h 50m Rec Negative This is a great game in my opinion, but for it's price I think there's too many bugs that they need to fix, somehow I also can't get some achievements either. So I think you should purchase other games until they fix these issues.  Some achievements also don't work or aren't accessible. For example, the ones who requires to go on the yellowstone park map or the ross lake park map.

Malheureusement il crash après environ 10 min de jeu pour ma part, je n'ai pu faire qu'une seule game entière... et ce n'était même pas sur mon pc. J'ai demandé de l'aide aux dev et ils m'ont donné des solutions que j'avais déjà trouvé et tenté, en vain... J'ai redemandé leur aide plusieurs fois mais jamais eu de réponse. Mon jeu rest donc injouable à ce jour... rip.

Date 2022-06-17 Playtime 7h 7m Rec Positive It's a fun game to begin with but it just takes too long to kill Bigfoot. There's no pacifist way to escape (after getting the story evidence and unlocking all areas), once you're out of loot; that's it. There needs to be more damaging ways to kill Bigfoot as a shotgun only does like 10 damage at most. I think once they've gone over this and updated it; the game will be better and worth the money.

Date 2022-06-15 Playtime 15h 55m Rec Positive Got scared so bad, i gave birth to my child;  Prior to playing this game, i had been pregnant for quite some time, but playing this game shot her right out of me. Instantly she looked at my face, with a grin, and a bit of blood on her teeth. My baby girl is now 18, boy do the years fly by. She has a boyfriend, hes such a good guy, and i trust him more than anything. In fact, just yesterday he bought the whole family burgers to show his gratitude! Today she will be moving away to live with him, which truthfully leaves a jarring mix of frustration, love, and being proud for her. In the end, i truly do remember that the REAL, REAL start, of all of these memories, was the simple game, of Finding, Bigfoot.

Date 2022-05-24 Playtime 1h 23m Rec Negative For me I found this game to be dull. Bigfoot appears to be on a cycle of move to the other end of the map for a few minutes then home in on you no mater where you are, run away again for a few mins, come back etc. He runs like the flash too.  He bugged once and got stuck in one place. I found if you unload every single rifle round on the map into him, it would barely get bigfoot below a quarter of its health.  Others like this. But not for me. There's no need to hunt him. Just stay in one place and he'll come to you every time
Date 2022-05-24 Playtime 3h 29m Rec Negative ?
Date 2022-05-24 Playtime 28h 52m Rec Positive Playing alone it's like a horror playing with friends its just fun... unless you explicitly tell your friends where you placed traps and they still walk into them for no reason. Or then you use all your heals die to bigfoot and while hunting for the last totem they die to a bear.

Date 2022-05-21 Playtime 6h 16m Rec Negative MMMH ya de l'idée, ya un concept sympa et un gameplay plutot riche en terme de touches / actions mais pas du tout bien exploité! j'aurais aimé que le bigfoot n'ai pas a géré son endurance pour frapper en nuit! (relou d'etre a cours de "power" = energie) j'aurais aimé que le bigfoot puisse twoo shooté les joueurs (quite a se faire réanimer par la simple touche "e") une réanimation simple... (trop galère de se faire réanimer entre joueurs) j'aurais aimé faire plus de dégat au big foot en journée j'aurais aimé pouvoir me cacher dans les buissons ou dans des placards j'aurais aimé baricader des portes de maisons j'aurais aimé un peu de survie (manger, boire mais a petite dose) cuisiner la viande... j'aurais aimé pouvoir faire une roulade ou une glissade en sprint j'aurais aimé pouvoir me reposser dans des grottes en journée en temps que bigfoot   au final je m'ennuie dessus, la map est presque vide en terme objet et lieu c'est dommage car très sympa le concept! Trop peu de serveur aussi, ne pas acheter au dessus de 10€ sauf si vous avez 5 amis riches

Le multijoueur s'est bien développé avec la possibilité d'être dans la peau du méchant Bigfoot ! Une très belle ascension.

Date 2022-05-19 Playtime 174h 2m Rec Positive Italiano: Pur non essendo personalmente aggiornato con i videogiochi degli ultimi anni, non saprei fare un paragone con altri titoli in circolazione, ma di sicuro questo survival horror ha catturato la mia attenzione, sia con la sua semplicità che con la cura dei dettagli, nonché la possibilità di variare il gioco nonostante i luoghi di caccia siano limitati, ma dotati di un forte realismo ed interazione con l'ambiente circostante, senza contare le zone nascoste e i traguardi secondari. La caratterizzazione sia dei cacciatori che del Bigfoot sono degni di un film horror degli anni d'oro, e l'atmosfera, quasi totalmente priva di musica, aumenta il senso di ansia e di terrore che caratterizza il gioco. La mia unica speranza è che gli sviluppatori possano risolvere gli innumerevoli glitch e bug che si trovano sparsi per la foresta che possono rovinare un'intera sessione di gioco, o facilitare notevolmente l'uccisione del Bigfoot, nonché la possibilità di scegliere e bloccare il numero di giocatori in caso di multiplayer nelle lobby pubbliche. Detto questo capisco assolutamente che la situazione che stanno vivendo gli sviluppatori di CyberLight li porti a ritardare e ad aggiornare il loro lavoro, in quanto il loro paese, l'Ucraina, sappiamo tutti sta vivendo un periodo buio.  English: Although I am not updated with the video games of recent years, I would not know how to make a comparison with other titles in circulation, but for sure this survival horror has captured my attention, both with its simplicity and with the attention to detail, as well as the possibility to vary the game although the hunting places are limited, but with a strong realism and interaction with the surrounding environment, without counting the hidden areas and secondary goals. The characterization of both hunters and Bigfoot are worthy of a horror film from the golden years, and the atmosphere, almost totally devoid of music, increases the sense of anxiety and terror that characterizes the game. My only hope is that the developers will be able to fix the countless glitches and bugs that lie around the forest that can ruin an entire game session, or greatly facilitate the killing of Bigfoot, as well as the ability to choose and block the number of players in case of multiplayer in public lobbies. Having said that, I absolutely understand that the situation that the CyberLight developers are experiencing leads them to delay and update their work, as their country, Ukraine, we all know is going through a dark period.

Sometimes the zipline won't even let you on. If you want to fix the game start with fixing the fucking zipline bro I can't stand it.

Date 2022-05-18 Playtime 92h 23m Rec Positive i would really recommend this game to people that are bored and dont really got anything to do. But as you may think this is not the only reason to get this game, it is very fun with friends or alone and many things are very well coded like the ai or the animals wich is suprising since some games dont actually have a "good" ai.
Date 2022-05-18 Playtime 38h 38m Rec Positive The game is so fun! specially when you play with friends or random people. But the thing that bothers me is the awful sound of the mic, its even hard to tell what somebody is saying

Date 2022-05-18 Playtime 10h 31m Rec Positive Good game, but there is no reason singleplayer should be impossible, as even on the lowest settings, bigfoot is still too strong, and just regenerates most of the damage you dealt that night. Otherwise, mutliplayer is really fun, maybe add a "quick match" and skins from playing the game would be really cool, so OG players can collect skins, kind of like how Fortnite and Dead by Daylight has OG skins that can no longer be obtained.

However the devs are from Ukraine so unfortunately they will not be able to update until this war ends.  overall it's worth it if you have friends to play with or against.

Date 2022-05-16 Playtime 30h 25m Rec Positive When I was just a 6 year old boy, my family, consisting of one mother, one father, 41 brothers and 23 sisters, and I went on a camping trip. After a week of being secluded from society, we were ready to pack up and leave. I went to go pee behind a bush, when suddenly a big heary creature with appropriately sized feet slaughtered my entire family in the span of 56 minutes. When I came back to our camping site (I pee a lot), all i saw was 66 dead bodies, lots of blood and of course, Bigfoot. He saw me staring at him from behind an oak tree. He stood up, leaving my mother's body behind. When he came up to me, I panicked. I didn't know what to do. But suddenly, I caught a sniff of his luscious fur. It smelled like lavender. I was confused, why would Bigfoot wear perfume? Did he intend to let me sniff him? I asked him, and to my suprise, he answered me. "Because I wanted you to smell me" I was shocked. Could he have read my mind? No, he couldn't have.. right? -Hey kid, he said while looking over his shoulder with drool coming out of his mouth. "Wanna come with me?" -S-s-sure, I responded.  45 years later...  I had confessed my love to Bigfoot shortly after we first met, and we became boyfriend and beast. 27 years after that, we got married. I took his last name. We had a child and named him William.  7 years later I came home from hunting when I saw Bigfoot in our bed with a woman. We started fighting. We got divorced shortly after due to the cheating and many arguements. I took custody of William thankfully, I don't want him around that woman.  11 years later after careful planning and many many hours of scouting the area, I finally triangulated where Bigfoot was. I started packing for the hunting trip. William wanted to come along, I told him no. After many more attempts I finally agreed and let him come along. Now, I'm in the house van's passenger seat typing this while William is driving. I hope our hunt goes well. Goodbye for now.  //Rick Lildick

Date 2022-05-16 Playtime 18h 22m Rec Negative For a game that came out January 31 2017, this game is just not fucking worth it. It has two maps, one gamemode and no deviation in gameplay. Is it fun? With friends it is fun, but alone its a nightmare. Just not worth it. If the price drops a bit and they get more content then sure it could be worth, but for 5 years we only have this little content?

They’re from Ukraine and continue working on further development, improvements, maintenance, and new content despite their home being ravaged by war and having to relocate with their equipment. I respect the dedication plus the game is worth the money. If you don’t have anyone to play with you’ll find people also there’s a discord server for lfg.

Date 2022-05-15 Playtime 12h 17m Rec Positive Most of the negative reviews are coming from people who play it 1v1 vs the bot. It`s like judging Left 4 Dead or Back 4 Blood based on how the bots on your team plays. Playing with friends this game is awesome. Traps set by big foot are not invisible, you just need to not panic or be overwhelmed by the environment to spot them. The only con I have to say about the game is the lack of know what time it is. Would be cool if hunters would have a digital wrist watch that would beep when night is soon to fall, like in DYING LIGHT... or have a chime play similar to MINE CRAFT.  Instead, night begins to fall and before you know it you are stuck in the middle of the woods with a relentless big foot, ready to rip you apart!  However, that con does not make the game any less enjoyable for me... just harder lol   P.S. The names other people use when creating a lobby is hilarious!!

Date 2022-05-08 Playtime 31h 29m Rec Positive Bought this game Since it was earlier in development and it's really fun to come back to especially with friends. Price may seem a little steep at first but with an ever growing amount of content in the game itself, and developers that genuinely care about the players and constantly listen to feedback through various social media platforms, it becomes quite obvious to me that the price shown is definitely right.   Is it perfect, No. But the sheer changes from earl betas of the game is so drastic that it really shows how much care is going into this game by developers.  All things considered: 8.5 / 10

Date 2022-05-06 Playtime 64h 7m Rec Negative era o jogo perfeito de caça... mas agora os DEVS conseguiram estragar o game, n tem mais caça (a caça raiz eu quero dizer) a porcaria do jogo n é mais tenso, tem armas douradas em DLCS, o pé grande virou o hulk, tem como dar rolamentos taticos etc. O jogo virou um filme da marvel voce caça um MONSTRO (praticamente n é mais um pé grande) que pega uma PLACA e bate em voce, tem como dar rolamentos taticos e etc. Então meio que o game ficou um lixo ao decorrer do tempo

Date 2022-05-03 Playtime 4h 6m Rec Positive Funny game to play with friends, killing monkey is pretty fun and we laughed lots. Once you've killed Bigfoot there's not much to do unless you want to grind out loads of totally stupid achievements. Due to such a small amount of content I wouldn't pay anymore than £6 for this game.  Be warned... monkey smash. Hard.

Date 2022-05-01 Playtime 93h 4m Rec Positive Kesinlikle herkesin alması gereken bir ekip oyunu, aşırı sarıyor hele he bir arkadaş grubunuz varsa aşırı saracak sağlam bir oyun. Anladığım kadarıyla biz birkaç araştırmacıyız ve 4 kişinin arandığı mekana gidi ponları bulmaya çalışıyoruz fakat orda bigfoot ile karşılaşıp onu öldürmeye çalışıyoruz. Yan görevlerin bir anlamı yok, bigfootu öldürünce oyun direk bitiyor, eski beta sürümlerinde bu olay daha farklıydı bence eski beta sürümündeki bazı olaylar daha iyiydi fakat şimdiki sürüm çok daha akıcı diyebilirim. Oyunu geliştiren ekip ukraynalı olduğu için baya bir süre belkide hiç güncelleme gelmiyicek bence. Aslında daha fazla güncelleme gelse tadından yenmez bu oyun
Date 2022-05-01 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive BIGFOOT is a fun versus game that has fun and engaging game play. Anytime I was wondering and heard BIGFOOT I would be thrilled and would be fully immersed in the game. Playing as the survivors is fun but playing as BIGFOOT is the real high of the game. Playing BIGFOOT reminds me of being tank in L4D. BIGFOOT has many abilities and someone without proper knowledge of how to make strategic plays as BIGFOOT will have trouble. BIGFOOT stands out above other multiplayer horror games. The developers have been putting their heart and soul into this game so recommend it to others. Overall Rating: 7/10

Date 2022-04-28 Playtime 15h 2m Rec Negative Bigfoot found me at the top of a huge watchtower with lights off and curtains closed. Unless I'm unaware of a scent mechanic, I don't see the point in doing different setups to find bigfoot, when in the end he finds you anyway.

Its buggy and generic. i wanted it to be better than what it was. especially for the 20 dollar price tag and paid skins. if it was half the price i might be like, eh, its fun enough to kill some time in it. but for 20 bucks nope
Date 2022-04-24 Playtime 11h 4m Rec Negative multiplayer in this game has potential however loot for survivors is extremely scarce while big foot is overpowered. even with the lowest health possible for bigfoot and the highest loot drops the game is still unfair on survivors.

Date 2022-04-24 Playtime 42h 39m Rec Negative Bigfoot's strongest attacks are defeated by a tree. The howl never works and bigfoot has the stamina of a 97 year old grandma unless they eat the population of the entire forest plus 5 more steamed hams, a child shouldn't be able to beat bigfoot by no-clipping inside of a cliff-side, also the damage crosshair from when you get hurt showing WHERE THE BULLET CAME FROM showed that it came from the opposite direction alongside the ability to perfectly camoflauge yourself from bigfoot and be immune to most attacks of bigfoot. all by being INSIDE OF A BUSH... and these are all bugs I found in ONE GAME.

Date 2022-04-20 Playtime 19h 13m Rec Negative Game where a big MONKE is chasing you through the forest. Fun to play with friends but will probably never be updated again.  Edit: Played for 50 minutes thinking I was doing great then it just crashed out of nowhere. No save games were found either. Thanks for wasting my time.
Date 2022-04-20 Playtime 20h 17m Rec Positive I can't count the amount times, that me and my friends have screamed because of this game. The maps are amazing and scary to walk around in. And the graphics are nice. I like the bear traps and its mechanics. Rifles are nice too.  I also love the way I can customize the amount of ammo and loot on a map.

Date 2022-04-20 Playtime 14h 10m Rec Positive Bigfoot is super unbalanced and you can't beat him alone and you lose tension after you spot him, the old model looks so much scarier but instead it is a generic monke model, in conclusion the old version is better but its not all bad

Date 2022-04-19 Playtime 12h 44m Rec Positive Bigfoot- Polowanie na legendę  Ocena: 7/10  Bigfoot to gra, która wprowadza graczy w tajemniczy świat legend i mitów, oferując emocjonujące doświadczenie polowania na mityczne stworzenie. Choć może wydawać się niszowa, Bigfoot zaskakuje swoją prostotą i pewnym urokiem, który przyciąga do siebie graczy zainteresowanych tematyką kryptozoologii i thrillera. Głównym celem gry jest odnalezienie legendarnego Bigfoota w rozległych lasach, które stanowią otoczenie dla tej przygody. Gra oferuje możliwość eksploracji i odkrywania obszarów w poszukiwaniu śladów oraz wskazówek prowadzących do tajemniczego stworzenia. Ta aspekt rozgrywki może być zarówno ekscytujący, jak i wywołujący uczucie niepokoju, szczególnie kiedy nocą gracz musi zmierzyć się z nieznanym. Mechanika gry jest dość prosta i polega głównie na przeszukiwaniu terenu, zbieraniu wskazówek oraz przygotowaniu się do potencjalnego starcia z Bigfootem. Gra oferuje możliwość korzystania z różnych narzędzi, od pułapek po kamery nadzoru, co dodaje trochę głębi do rozgrywki. Jednakże, po kilku godzinach, monotonia może zacząć się nasilać, gdyż zadania sprowadzają się głównie do powtarzalnych czynności. Grafika w grze jest solidna, chociaż nie powala na kolana. Środowiska są dobrze zrealizowane, a atmosfera lasów przesycona jest tajemnicą i niepokojem. Model postaci Bigfoota jest imponujący i wywołuje wrażenie niebezpieczeństwa, co dodaje nieco napięcia do rozgrywki. Niestety, Bigfoot cierpi na pewne niedoskonałości. Szczególnie odczuwalne są pewne problemy z optymalizacją i sztuczna inteligencja Bigfoota, która czasami może sprawiać wrażenie niedopracowanej. Ponadto, brak różnorodności zadań oraz ograniczona interakcja z otoczeniem mogą sprawić, że gra staje się szybko monotonna. Podsumowując, Bigfoot to przyjemna gra dla fanów kryptozoologii i survival horroru. Choć ma swoje wady, wciąż oferuje emocjonujące doświadczenie polowania na legendę, które może zainteresować tych, którzy lubią chwile grozy i napięcia w wirtualnym świecie.

Date 2022-04-18 Playtime 4h 54m Rec Negative Bigfoot is a fun and scary game and has good grafic but after a while it starts to get a little bit boring. I don't know how many maps it has but they are very big and it takes a lot of time just for running around. It is also a very patient game, not my type. Bigfoot is scary but not as i expected, for almost 20 dollars it's not worth the money. Maybe try the game for 2 hours then hand it back if you not like it, 12-14 dollars would fit it better.

Date 2022-04-16 Playtime 1h 39m Rec Negative It is fun for the first few hours of gameplay. Its a cool concept, and is done to decent effect. As it is though, there's no replayability. Every game is the same, and after the initial shock wears off, its just a nightly battle against a bullet sponge. You can't hide from him; he'll find you regardless of where you hide. You can't kill him with clever plans or ambushes; he just runs straight at you and you empty your weapon at him until he decides to walk away. Then you repeat it again the next night.

Date 2022-04-14 Playtime 341h 31m Rec Positive Ich habe dieses Spiel von einem Freund geschenkt bekommen. Glaube ich zumindest. :)  In dem Spiel "BIGFOOT" geht es darum, die mystischen Sagen, um eine Gestallt im dunklen Wald, zu untersuchen und der Welt zu zeigen das es kein Mythos ist. Man startet sein Abenteuer mit einem ausgewählten Character in einem Campingwagen, indem einiges an Equipment liegt. Das Spiel hat einen Multiplayer, aber dazu gleich mehr. Die Grafik ist ganz in Ordnung. Ebenso harmoniert die Soundkulisse mit der Umgebung. Die Maps sind groß genug, um ein wenig Zeit zu investieren alles zu erkunden. Steuerung ist sehr einfach und übersichtlich. Die verschiedenen Fallen und Gadgets, wie auch die Waffen sind meiner Meinung nach ausreichend vorhanden. Das Lootsystem gibt dem Spiel den restlichen Hype zu grinden! Im Multiplayer hat man sogar die Möglichkeit aus der Sicht von "Bigfoot" zu spielen. Es gibt 3 Arten von Spielern im Online Modus! Personen welche nur rein trollen (wenige), Personen welche das Spiel versuchen mit anderen wirklich durchzuspielen (meiste) und es gibt die jenigen, die sich alles im bereits erwähnten Campingwagen schnappen und ohne dich das Game speedrunnen (einige - Warum zum Teufel, spielt man dann Multiplayer!?). Wie dem auch sei, der Multiplayer macht jedenfalls mehr Spaß als der Singelplayer. Generell empfehle ich euch das Spiel gemeinsam mit Freunden zu zocken.  Ich persönlich finde das Spiel richtig gut gelungen. Leider ist es jedoch seid 2017 in "Early Access" und ich weis nicht wirklich ob sich das noch irgendwann ändern wird. Dennoch, wie bereits gesagt, empfehle ich das Game mit Freunden zu spielen. In dem Spiel habe ich schon einiges miterlebt. Top Spiel!  👑 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43242924/]Weitere Spielbewertungen[/url] 👑

One thing to note though is the more people playing the easier it will be to kill bigfoot so I recommend you have someone play as bigfoot for more of a challenge

Date 2022-04-10 Playtime 35h 52m Rec Positive BIGFOOT is one of my favorite online, multiplayer horror games on Steam. I love the community and game play around this game. The developers from Ukraine try their very best to give what they can, and I really respect that. I love the game play first off as a survivor, looting, searching, and trying to kill Big Foot. The game play is very smooth, and the graphics are phenomenal, along with the maps, which are really intricate and thought-out. This game is very underrated, I'd say, and I wish more would enjoy this beauty of a horror game. At first, it was hard to win, but over time, I've gotten so good at it that I can speed-run it. If you love horror games and cryptids, this is for you! 2025 Edit: The game is even better now as they added a new point system fixing the old one that you could barely level up. And now there are rewards such as player perks when you level up, as well as they added new items and added more realistic Big foot mechanics, really neat update!
Date 2022-04-10 Playtime 34h 19m Rec Positive I've played this game since before they rebuilt it from scratch years ago. It's a whole lot of fun when you play with friends and can manage very genuine jump-scares, and I'm not normally one to startle easily. It's challenging and engaging, definitely requires strategy. One downside to be aware of, however, is that matches (at least against the AI) take hours. If you play with friends who have even slightly conflicting schedules, you may not be able to finish many games.

Date 2022-04-07 Playtime 25h 4m Rec Positive The game itself is fun, though there are multiple issues with player-controlled Bigfoot: Firstly, in the game mode Team vs Player (where the Bigfoot is controlled by a player), Bigfoot can track the players using the howl ability. However, the players have no way of tracking Bigfoot (with the exception of thrown trackers, but they last a very limited time and have limited uses). Because of this, the Bigfoot can always run away from the players and needlessly prolong the game. In fact, Bigfoot can use this very strategy to permanently keep away from the players, effectively making the game endless. There must either be a timer that, once expired, grants the hunter team victory, or an option for the hunters to permanently track Bigfoot.  Secondly, in the mode Team vs Player, Bigfoot is much too powerful. Unless both Bigfoot's Health and Damage are set to I, the lowest setting, it's borderline impossible for the hunter team to achieve a win. Even when both are set to I, while the Loot Amount setting is set to III, it may be difficult to find enough weapons and ammunition to kill Bigfoot, especially on the winter map. I, for example, had no problem whatsoever in killing full teams of 4 hunters with the weakest possible Bigfoot whenever the hunters had maximum possible loot. I don't even remember a time when the hunters were able to take away as little as 25% of my health. In conclusion, the game is heavily unbalanced in Bigfoot's favor in the game mode Team vs Player. Bigfoot's attributes in this mode, especially his health, should be reduced by default.  Finally, there are few actual players, such that most of the time it's very difficult to find a full lobby, even in the peak hours of activity. Outside these peak hours, there are often no multiplayer lobbies available whatsoever, open or private. This however is likely outside the developers' control.

Date 2022-04-05 Playtime 39h 16m Rec Positive Game overall is fun, with that creepy factor of not knowing where bigfoot is going to come from or what animal is going to attack you. However the map is buggy and tends to glitch alot, but overall good game with good potential.

Date 2022-04-05 Playtime 29h 59m Rec Positive veri fun u just kill monke man
Date 2022-04-05 Playtime 49h 16m Rec Positive As a game and as an idea, I thoroughly approve. It's bare-bones right now and there are glitches/strange AI behavior sometimes, but that's to be expected at this stage of development. There's something thrilling about waiting in the dark for Bigfoot to attack you with a street sign, thinking that every cracking tree branch is the Big Fur-ball himself and wondering if you can get to a zip line in time (without accidentally jumping off mid-journey). I look forward to seeing where this game goes next.

Date 2022-04-04 Playtime 13h 25m Rec Positive Ein gutes und gelungenes Spiel wenn man auf Abenteuer und Spaß mit seinen Freunden steht.  Wenn Du alleine Spielen willst und oder du keine Freunde hast weil Du ein Kek bist ist es dennoch spaßig in random runden zu joinen oder einfach alleine von dem Großen Fuß getötet zu werden.  Groß Groß Freude spielen haben Spaß und sinnig sein Waffen sammeln und viel Experimentiererei . Du kannst kinder essen deine freunde finden Dich und Essen Bananen mit dem Monke in der Wüste  Bigfoot controls not working in my case but for others it's a fantastic experience   停止谷歌搜索我的朋友

Date 2022-04-01 Playtime 25h 49m Rec Positive Es ist ein gelungenes Spielprinzip, es macht Spaß und es ist schön gestaltet und bockt  mit freunden Abends sehr doll, aber was mich dennoch stört, ist das Loot sammeln, also das in dem Anfangsvan nur 1 Gewehr und 1 Pistole ist, was für mich keinen Sinn macht, da diese Leute auf eine Jag gehen um einen 3 meter großen Bigfoot zu fangen, und dann nehmen sie nur 1 Gewehr mit? das ist für mich etwas unrealistisch und dieses Loot System passt meiner Meinung nach nicht in ein Hunt explore Game...Aber im großen und ganzen ein Tolles Spiel aber halt mit der Umsetzung paar Macken

Date 2022-03-28 Playtime 7h 2m Rec Positive Bigfoot jest debiutanckim projektem niezależnego ukraińskiego studia CyberLight, założonego w 2016 roku. Produkcja, która trafiła na platformę PC, jest grą akcji utrzymaną w konwencji survival horroru. Jak sugeruje tytuł, fabuła Bigfoot koncentruje się na Wielkiej Stopie – legendarnej, humanoidalnej istocie, która podobno żyje w okolicach Gór Skalistych w Ameryki Północnej. W 2016 roku grupa turystów zaginęła na terenie jednego z pobliskich parków narodowych. Pomimo że policja przekonuje, iż był to jedynie wypadek, główny bohater i jego towarzysze postanawiają udać się na miejsce, by przyjrzeć się sprawie z bliska. Śmiałkowie wierzą bowiem, że za tymi owianymi tajemnicą wydarzeniami stoi sam Sasquatch (jak Wielką Stopę nazywają rdzenni Amerykanie). W wydanym na platformę PC Bigfoot akcja prezentowana jest z perspektywy pierwszej osoby (FPP). Do naszej dyspozycji oddano rozległy otwarty świat, w którym na odwiedzenie czekają jeziora, bagna i przyprawiające o dreszcze jaskinie. Rozgrywka kręci się wokół polowania na tytułowego przeciwnika – naszą bazą wypadową jest przyczepa kempingowa, a w trakcie łowów robimy użytek ze strzelby, wszelkiego rodzaju pułapek oraz gadżetów pokroju kamer, czujników ruchu i noktowizora (niezastąpionego, kiedy protagonista znajdzie się w dziczy po zapadnięciu zmroku). Mocną stroną gry jest sztuczna inteligencja, która czuwa nad poczynaniami Sasquatcha – autorzy dołożyli wszelkich starań, by oponent zachowywał się niczym żywa istota. Warto przy tym pamiętać, że ów przeciwnik dysponuje magicznymi mocami, zatem bezpośrednia konfrontacja z nim zazwyczaj nie kończy się dla nas najlepiej. W Bigfoot można grać zarówno w pojedynkę, jak i w trybie współpracy opracowanym z myślą o maksymalnie trzech graczach. Bigfoot na platformie PC działa w oparciu o technologię Unreal Engine 4, co zaowocowało oprawą graficzną na przyzwoitym poziomie. Podobnie jak ma to miejsce w przypadku wielu innych gier korzystających z tego silnika, wrażenie robi przede wszystkim realistyczne oświetlenie; podobać się może również gęsta, bogata w detale roślinność. Tryb gry: single / multiplayer   Tryb multiplayer: Internet   Liczba graczy: 1-4  Oczekiwania czytelników: 8.4 / 10 na podstawie 27 głosów czytelników.

Date 2022-03-17 Playtime 9h 23m Rec Negative I remember pirating this game a long time ago. I recently saw it again on steam and decided to buy it for updates and online play with other players. Nothing has changed. The loot is boring. The looting mechanics feel clunky. Bigfoot has too much HP and its AI continually attacks you when it is night time. The game is not scary. The maps are too empty.  I think a good suggestion would be to remove the mini map from the bottom left of the HUD. My eyes are glued onto it the whole time and it removes the purpose of pressing the 'M' button for the map. At the very least, it could be some sort of radar or smaller map that shows a portion of the area you are at, and have the map rotate as you move around.  There should be some sort of other objective or goal besides hunting bigfoot. I had around 4 hours put into this game when I experienced everything in both of the maps currently available. I put in an extra 5 hours to see if the other players are worth playing for, but they just disconnect halfway through a game.  The best way I can describe this game, is that you are walking around on a flat world in Minecraft with a stone sword with view bobbing toggled off. Fog is surrounding your vision and there is this zombie that attacks you at night (and only at night) and you can only deal 0.1 damage to it before it runs away and comes back to attack you again. You can only regenerate health by finding a new village you haven't discovered already by looting chests with 2 items in them at most.  Roleplaying with the cameras was a fun thing I used to do on the old copy of this game I had, but in this new game I bought, there is no point to the cameras. The traps are best used when bigfoot is about to attack you. Just place one under him and it does more damage than any other weapon.  Definitely not worth $20.00. I am ashamed of myself that I even bought this game. Maybe the future updates will be worth playing.

Date 2022-03-16 Playtime 12h 57m Rec Positive Amazing game to play with friends. The only thing i would recommend is making it easier to see hunter as  bigfoot. Hunters can easily turn off their flashlight and hiden in the forest. As bigfoot there is no possible way to find the hunters. If the hunters had a red outline while using rage it would be better in my opinion. Als the stamina of bigfoot drains very fast. Would love to see more maps. Overall amazing game!

Edit: its 2023 and Ive played this game quite a bit. I supported the devs during their crisis with the russians invading by buying skins and having my friends do the same. At this point the developers have no real goal or end game in sight. I use to think it was great how they would update the game every so often.Basically rebuilding from scratch. They need to just take the L and make a new bigfoot game. Bigfoot 2.0. With the recent epic event requiring you to have an epic account is just dumb. Yes, they took it back but only after complaints.   TLDR: developer has no fucking clue what they are doing. Dont buy this game you have never heard of.

Date 2022-03-09 Playtime 14h 46m Rec Positive Alors a tous les joueurs qui disent qu'il n'a  pas de mode solo bien sur que si on peut tous a fait jouer en solo contre le bigfoot IA et le jeux et vraiment bien et fait flipper
Date 2022-03-09 Playtime 6h 39m Rec Positive BigFoot is a confused mess of a game but there is fun to be had and it has potential.  As it exists right now, it is a first person shooter survival horror almost rogue-like game with a pvp mode tacked on. I say rogue-like because a game of BigFoot tends to be fairly short (3 hours tops) and you are expected to play it multiple times. If you go in blind you will likely get stomped, so you basically play a bit, learn, die and repeat until you can the hang of things. There is quite a bit to discover about the maps so even successful runs may teach you something about the map. There is no meta progression though.  The core gameplay is about you running around a forest map, looking for weapons and tools to fight bigfoot when he inevitably comes for you at night. Bigfoot is absurdly fast, so fighting him takes planning and knowledge. I think this works best as a solo experience. There is a bit of story telling with notes you can find, you start of with no landmarks on your map so exploration is a big factor, there is even a few jump scares built into the game, and the atmosphere is great. Seriously, during rain right before night is a great experience.  But the game also tries to shoehorn in pvp and this is where the problems start. Bigfoot just works and acts differently when played by a player. The AI BigFoot heavily pulls his punches and as a result PvP is almost impossible to win against an even halfway decent bigfoot player since the game is balanced for PvE. I have played as Bigfoot, and even though I did not understand most of my moveset I won. The PvP just does not seem to function and worst of all, the mechanics accomodating the possibility of PvP make the solo experience worse.  Also, as mentioned, games can take quite some time, mostly when you don't know what you are doing, and 3 hours is a long time to commit to a multiplayer for fun round of something. Sure, eventually you can start ending games in less than hour but then the game has also lost a lot of its appeal. Does the game want to be about exploration and discovery? Then don't base your game on short matches. Does the game want to do be a fun multiplayer romp, that you play a few rounds of? Then make games shorter, reveal the map and balance the game for that. Right now the game feels too long for multiplayer (again, initially) but is then too short for singleplayer.  As of right now it is difficult to tell what the game wants to be. I had the most fun with solo play, figuring out how to beat the AI and getting into the atmosphere but I really wish there was a campaign, meta progression or something to promote that. It feels held back by making it multiplayer friendly, and the PvP is utterly broken.  Bottomline, I had fun with solo play and got a couple of hours multiplayer, but I seriously hope they either drop the PvP or make the game modes more distinct.
Date 2022-03-08 Playtime 26h 28m Rec Negative Unfortunately I have to advise against the game, not because it is boring (it is also a lot of fun with friends), not because it is badly done, but for one thing only, The game was released in about 2017 and they only managed 2 MAJOR UPDATES? , ONLY 2!?, I understand that you are an indie studio, but now that Putin has his balls turned when you can update the game? it takes you 2 years to make one, now that there is war ?! when will we have another update? Who knows. For me, you have had many opportunities to make the game much more interesting, but you lost it, a bit sad :(

Date 2022-03-06 Playtime 60h 32m Rec Positive Only 7.8 hours into Bigfoot, and I gotta say it's impressive. The environment has an eerie stillness to it, and that's before you even see the 9-foot tall shag rug with intent to kill. One of the most amazing in game experiences has to be the sound quality. That, and I've never had lightning strike a tree in game and make me jump out of my seat. Running solo on a created lobby has given a toe to toe fight with Bigfoot longevity to say the least, and I have yet to experience it in multiplayer. The amazing thing is, the ability to decide the level of difficulty between loot, damage, and Bigfoot Health, making things as scarce or plentiful, painful, and drawn out as you may like. Even though there are currently two (2) levels, it's still worth taking the time to play, and I look forward to seeing CyberLight pull through the current hardships to provide us with the more of the "Holy crap! Did that just happen?" moments that I've had the pleasure to experience thus far.

Date 2022-03-06 Playtime 21h 49m Rec Positive I've been keeping up with this game since it first became available on Steam, and the amount this game has improved shows just how dedicated this group of devs truly are. Even in the early days, the game showed so much promise. Where the game is now is worthy of comparison to some of the best survival horror games on the market. A great horror game by a great team.  As of writing this though, the game is currently on hold, as the dev team are based in Ukraine and are dealing with the Russian invasion. I wish all the best to the developers and their families and that they are all able to find safety and happiness in these dark times.
Date 2022-03-06 Playtime 1h 22m Rec Negative i reaööy do think you should be able to hide from Bigfoot himself, i think this would make the game so much scarier in a sense that he is close and u sit tucked in somewhere in a house with all the lights off, right now, its not even scary after seeing him like 5 times and he just bombrushes your exact location and kills you

The employees are now refugees, soldiers or hiding in the subway systems watching humanity rip itself apart. Even if it never gets get to a finished state, I am happy to give 20 dollars to help the devs and to be apart of the Bigfoot community. Living out a fantasy of rednecks hunting Bigfoot!

Date 2022-03-04 Playtime 2h 1m Rec Positive Very similar to Rake from a few years back, just much more polished. Can't wait to play the rest of the maps when the full game comes out.  As a side-note, I think this game is priced far too high. Especially for an early access title. I've tried convincing multiple friends to play with me but the price is too steep for them. My opinion is that it should be lowered to the $10-15 range but hey I'm just an idiot so whatever.  Edit: It's unfortunate to hear that the war in Ukraine has halted development. I hope everyone is safe and can return to making the game soon. Good luck.

Date 2022-03-03 Playtime 3h 50m Rec Negative As it stands, the goal of the game is just not worth the purchase. The premise is that you play as a team that wants to prove that bigfoot is real, but from the beginning you already know he is. In other games such as phasmophobia, you aren't proving that ghosts are real, you are figuring out what kind of ghost it is and doing extra objectives to gain money. I didn't go into this expecting it to be phasmophobia, but there just aren't many motivating factors in the game and overall the Bigfoot AI is underwhelming. He attacks you every night like clockwork and you can hear him coming from a mile away. I really want this game to be fun, but it lacks any thrill or sense of danger/adventure. It's mostly a walking sim with an AI at attacks you at a specific time. Knowing when he will attack you also just means that you need to be back at the RV by that time so you don't die. It's an easy way to survive the night and also ruins the main threat of the game.

Nice gameplay loop, you travel around looking for clues and stock up on gear to hunt the titular cryptid or more accurately to fend off the cryptid hunting you. Fun overall, but not a game you'll play for hours at a time.   *PS. Use in game proximity voice chat to get more into the mood and elevate the experience!  I have to praise the developers for completely overhauling their game, and for that alone I recommend it.  (Though you might wanna wait for a sale)

Date 2022-02-26 Playtime 4h 18m Rec Negative This game provided 2.5 hours of blurry darkness, with a repeated bigfoot attack every night like clockwork which goes the exact same every time- AI bigfoot attacks, knocks you over 8 times, you shoot nerf dart 7.62 or 9mm rounds into him, he runs off. Each time my character select shows me with an AR-15 and I find 5.56 ammo, but across 3 playthroughs I found no AR-15, but the same rifle, pistol, shotgun and tons of ammo for them.  The 7.62 bullets do 2-20 damage with nearly no consistency and bad accuracy over 25 meters, and bigfoot (on LOWER difficulties) has 1500+ health,  Traps stumble him but run out, so you have a DayZ walking simulator until a 5 minute artificial difficulty spamfest of hitstun and bad accurracy.  Playing AS bigfoot was hardly any better. The four geniuses playing with us didn't leave spawn, and when I did find someone (with assistance from a friend on the other side) I spent 2 minutes whacking him into theground 9+ times to no kill, no permanent stunlock, nothing. Sure, there's "E" for fatality, but it didn't do anything. In this instance I would assume this is the game telling me I don't have the right equipment or status to fight the players, but I ate two elk and a bear so it couldn't be that.  Online play has a bugged, confusing lobby UI.  I cannot see the appeal of whacking at someone with nerf fists and shooting nerf bullets at a tank class, and this shoud not be $20, I got it for $6 which still feels too much.

Date 2022-02-20 Playtime 5h 10m Rec Negative The game is really strange.  Somehow it is impossible to win without exploiting a glitch. How one would complete the game, let alone the achievements without exploits would be a mystery to me. Once you find the exploit, the game loses its scaryness and difficulty. But nonetheless, a fun and scary game.  But won't ever touch it again.

Date 2022-02-15 Playtime 9h 13m Rec Positive The game is okay, Its kind of fun if you get into it. I feel like it is lacking some aspects , to me its worth the 20$. Hopefully they build onto it because it does have potential. as mentioned by others , bigfoots health is  overpowered and it starts to feel repetitive by the time you actually bring him down. Guns are under powered.  It does seem like they ran out of money and just threw out a half finished game and than started bringing out expensive cosmetics. More maps would be nice, and possibly more weapons and customisation for them. leveling up giving you more powerful weapons so you have something to work towards would be cool.

Date 2022-02-11 Playtime 2h 35m Rec Negative There's some great things in this game but...  Note to Dev's: Less looking in drawers for gear, more actually HUNTING BIGFOOT would make it a much more satisfying game.  Showing up to hunt Bigfoot with a single rifle for a 4-man squad...  Are we playing poor World War II Russian conscripts?  *Best read in thick Russian accent* "Here, hold ammo and if the other guy is torn to shreds by 10-foot Sasquatch just get rifle & fight for mother Russia!"  The Dev's should look to games like "EvolVe" for guidance for what this came could exploit to make the experience more enjoyable.  Like more tracking elements.  A reason to retreat both as the hunters and Bigfoot.  Hunters could rally for medical aid and ammo/gear.  The Bigfoot could have to eat wildlife for buffs and healing.  Hunters could kill, trap the wildlife or track Bigfoot's kill-path with the carcasses it leaves behind.  Maybe various types of hunters and Bigfoots.  Faster lighter ones, Heavier slower ones and maybe even mystical/supernatural Bigfoot elements to really add some twists to play styles for both the hunters and Bigfoot.    This game could be AWESOME!!!
Date 2022-02-11 Playtime 161h 35m Rec Positive bigfoot the game is awesome its so simple and when i say simple i mean the goals are simple find bigfoot and kill bigfoot or if you know you cant escape alive you can gather evidence and leave.. love the natural disasters like falling trees, rock slides and lightening strikes.. i recomend this game to anyone that is looking for a basic easy to play game
Date 2022-02-11 Playtime 4h 6m Rec Positive good game love the black history month inclusion with the main villain (possible racism) but good otherwise
Date 2022-02-11 Playtime 130h 49m Rec Positive I really enjoy this game. I bought it during the 3.0 version and even with its variety of issues held through into 4.0. Currently I'll give it a 7.5/10 and here's why:  - The graphics are very nice, especially compared to previous updates, they've come a long way. It's bright and cheery during the day and it gets very dark when the sun goes down, but it's really disappointing when the moon comes up and it gets quite a bit brighter, because if they stuck with the very dim lighting things would be that much scarier.        The player models look a lot better than they used to but they still have a ways to go. I got excited when I saw the tweet on new character animations but in the end they've continued to look quite clunky, and the player's faces (especially Jessica's) look like plastic, and the eyes move like dolls. - There's still not a lot to do besides kill Bigfoot. I assumed in the new update they'd introduce a story to the game, but currently you can only find long and uninteresting notes from the dead campers. I think what could make this game truly shine are more game modes, such as a challenge mode with randomized objectives the players have to meet with Bigfoot as the primary obstacle, a story mode where you get to learn more about the dead campers and Bigfoot, maybe even an alternate ending you choose where you are able to befriend him. - PvP mode is a mess. This could have been the goat but it wasn't, but I still have hope for it. Life is simply too good for Bigfoot, meaning anyone and their Grandma could play as Bigfoot and K.O the whole team. Quick times for some of his stronger attacks could really balance things out, as well as a small chance for his roar to be unable to smell hunters, or an instinct that causes him to leave downed survivors to prevent camping.  Other quality fix suggestions: - Three starter weapons as opposed to two. This means with a full team that everyone can have a weapon or the flare gun. - More range for the drone. Currently it just can't go very far. More range for the shock ability would also be beneficial, because more often than not I'll shock him or be very close to shocking him and nothing will happen. - Informative pop-ups when removed from a game instead of a very fast flash of a message in the corner informing either you've been kicked or disconnected (but no reason why). - Ability to mute players, ability to vote kick players in-game. - A more interesting victory cinematic. - More melee damage.

Durch die eingebaute Sprachfunktion, kann man aber sofort los legen und mit einem Random-Spiel beginnen.   Ich persönlich bin immer mit einem Kumpel online und versuchen zu zweit dem pelzigen Ar**** zu zerlegen.   Für den Preis auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert. :)

Date 2022-02-07 Playtime 9h 12m Rec Positive BigFoot is a confused mess of a game but there is fun to be had and it has potential.   As it exists right now, it is a first person shooter survival horror almost rogue-like game with a pvp mode tacked on. I say rogue-like because a game of BigFoot tends to be fairly short (3 hours tops) and you are expected to play it multiple times. If you go in blind you will likely get stomped, so you basically play a bit, learn, die and repeat until you can the hang of things. There is quite a bit to discover about the maps so even successful runs may teach you something about the map. There is no meta progression though.  The core gameplay is about you running around a forest map, looking for weapons and tools to fight bigfoot when he inevitably comes for you at night. Bigfoot is absurdly fast, so fighting him takes planning and knowledge. I think this works best as a solo experience. There is a bit of story telling with notes you can find, you start of with no landmarks on your map so exploration is a big factor, there is even a few jump scares built into the game, and the atmosphere is great. Seriously, during rain right before night is a great experience.  But the game also tries to shoehorn in pvp and this is where the problems start. Bigfoot just works and acts differently when played by a player.  The AI BigFoot heavily pulls his punches and as a result PvP is almost impossible to win against an even halfway decent bigfoot player since the game is balanced for PvE. I have played as Bigfoot, and even though I did not understand most of my moveset I won. The PvP just does not seem to function and worst of all, the mechanics accomodating the possibility of PvP make the solo experience worse.  Also, as mentioned, games can take quite some time, mostly when you don't know what you are doing, and 3 hours is a long time to commit to a multiplayer for fun round of something. Sure, eventually you can start ending games in less than hour but then the game has also lost a lot of its appeal. Does the game want to be about exploration and discovery? Then don't base your game on short matches. Does the game want to do be a fun multiplayer romp, that you play a few rounds of? Then make games shorter, reveal the map and balance the game for that. Right now the game feels too long for multiplayer (again, initially) but is then too short for singleplayer.  As of right now it is difficult to tell what the game wants to be. I had the most fun with solo play, figuring out how to beat the AI and getting into the atmosphere but I really wish there was a campaign, meta progression or something to promote that. It feels held back by making it multiplayer friendly, and the PvP is utterly broken.  Bottomline, I had fun with solo play and got a couple of hours multiplayer, but I seriously hope they either drop the PvP or make the game modes more distinct.

Date 2022-02-07 Playtime 14h 26m Rec Positive I really enjoy this game. My girlfriends and I play against the AI in a team of 4, and most of it is us screaming 'MONKEY! MONKEY!' while Bigfoot stomps our asses and flings us across the room. But I will confidently say we have managed to kill bigfoot multiple times, most of the time with me sacrificing myself as I place an explosive down, grab my gun then blow up bigfoot and myself as he charges at me. I would really recommend this game for multiplayer fun, Bigfoot would be a little too OP on your own though. Definitely more fun in multiplayer.

Date 2022-02-01 Playtime 1h 47m Rec Positive Bigfoot is incredibly overpowered. A real shame that this game left me, and my whole group of friends turned off by it's horrible balance problems.  For starters, normal guns do almost nothing to Bigfoot. Even the R700 sniper rifle does little to bring his health down and by the end of a whole minute of nonstop gunfire being pumped into Bigfoot, we see that only dealt about 10% of health even on his health and damage setting.  A possible fix for Bigfoot would be of course to lower his health significantly, but give Bigfoot latent health regeneration, which would only activate after killing and eating an animal. The process of hunting, eating, and regenerating should give the hunters some decent time to either look for loot, or track Bigfoot down, depending on the game progression.  Making Bigfoot's health lower would also encourage Bigfoot players to not attack without a plan. What happens much to often in PVP is that Bigfoot attacks the group as soon as possible and simply ignores whatever damage they have or lack thereof because he can just kill them much faster with no consequence.

Date 2022-01-31 Playtime 12h 1m Rec Negative The Game developers are schizophrenic and don't know what they want out of the game. They prioritize cosmetic items that cost more than twice of the actual game, rather than quality content improving the immersion and game play experience. Reviving teammates requires a ridiculous amount of work, collecting totems isn't enough. You have to carry them, as slow as possible across the map. Bigfoot loses his "scary" factor very quickly once the shock factor is gone and you learn his movement patterns  and becomes a grindy bulletsponge to kill. Speaking of which, they picked the worst model they could for the Bigfoot, and its a shame they added all of these DLC skins for it and made it the centerpiece of the game.

Date 2022-01-28 Playtime 2h 15m Rec Positive This game in its current state i feel is having an identity crisis.   I feel it was designed as a spooky not knowing whats around the next corner adventure game. Then guns were added because why not Then an assymetric DBD playstyle was added.  So now it is a mixture of all and none are particularly amazing. The first few minutes you definitely have a spooky feeling but then you realize how predictable Bigfoot really is and no real reason to be scared of it.  The gun play is just point and click with no real gratification of actually landing a shot. Just shoot Bigfoot a crap ton until he dies  For those who like the 4v1 style game there are definitely better let us just say that. Neither side is really that fun  However with all these negatives the game is still quite fun to play now and again. I hope that the devs can work out what they want to do with the game so they can make one great coherent game rather than 3 mediocre and forgetful styles of gameplay.

Date 2022-01-27 Playtime 104h 40m Rec Positive Я обожаю эту игру,если вы любитель игр в стиле сюрвайвал хоррор то вам эта игра тоже зайдёт,ведь в ней довольно частые обновления и игра без багов но есть 1 минус и это онлайн,не сам по себе онлайн хороший но если вы захотите поиграть с русскоязычными игроками то они вам попадутся с вероятностью 1 к 10 ведь сама по себе игра больше популярна в зарубежных странах так что для этой игры вам точно понадобятся друзья. а так игру советую,всем удачно провести время в этой замечательной игре!

Date 2022-01-25 Playtime 6h 34m Rec Negative !!VERSION 4.2!!  Nettes Indie aber early access seit 2017 ??? Bislang veröffentlichte Karten 2 ?? 20€ Normal Preis für 30 min spiel / runden zeit etwas überteuert...  Naja...   Zum Spiel: Story: Irgend ein Vieh Mordet im Wald   Ziel: Finde die Leichen/Vermissten Fotografiere Kratzer und Fußabdrücke geh zum Van fertig. Spiel beendet. (dauert am Längsten im ersten Rundgang)  Alternatives Ziel: Töte Bigfoot (geht am schnellsten)  Zur Bigfoot KI: Greift jede Nacht an bis zum Morgen (Außer die erste) Flieht nicht greift die komplette Nacht an. Weglaufen und verstecken bringt nichts Er weiß immer wo du bist. Zu leicht zu töten durch Sinn freie Handlungen (Tipp Seilrutsche Schießen Seilrutsche schießen...)  Gameplay/Items: Sich zu verstecken bringt nichts er weiß immer wo du bist. In Gruppen Stalkt er einen nach. Die Spawn Punkte der "Vermissten" sind immer gleich (Na gut es sind 3 Orte dicht beieinander)  Karten Events sprich Geröll von Felsen umfallende Bäume sind Bigfoot unabhängig. Man kann Fallen aufstellen die Bigfoot in der Nacht kurz aufhält. Gehen leider zu schnell kaputt und sind Zahlenmäßig dünn besiedelt. Käfige oder Fallgruben gibt es nicht. Die Kameras sind als Bewegungsmelder interessanter als Ihre eigentliche Funktion. GPS "Speere" dauern wenige Sekunden Waffen in den Tresoren sind immer Gleich die Codes immer gleich versteckt.  Im Gesamten fehlt einiges was sehr schnell eintönig wird.  Was ich mir Wünsche:  Etwas mehr Story! Hat noch kein Grusel Spiel geschadet.  Wenn Spieler gegen Bigfoot KI / AI: Wäre mal das Finden von Bigfoot Interessant mit Beweisen seiner Existenz statt das der gleich jede Nacht spawnt und Angreift. So alla Slenderman :) der macht dich auch nicht gleich am anfang fertig. Bigfoot soll mit der Umwelt Interagieren z.B. Geröll Bäume auf Spieler fallen lassen  Die Aufgaben zu Staffeln sprich Ziel 1 finde Beweise. (Bigfoot Interagiert mit der Umgebung statt anzugreifen) Ziel 2 z.B. Finde Bigfoot bzw. seine Höhle Ziel 3 Fange oder Töte Bigfoot (Jetzt darf Bigfoot angreifen aber nur wenn er sich Bedroht fühlt bzw. in sein Territorium eingedrungen wird.  Zu den Fallen: Mehr Auswahl! Fallgrube, Kamerafalle, oder Ähnliches! Schnappt euch einen Spaten :)  Zu den Waffen: Vivala USA  Pistole - OK Sniper - OK Schrotflinte - OK Sturmgewehr - .... warum nicht gleich eine Panzerfaust.... was wirklich fehlt sind Betäubungs-, pfeile / gewehre Pfeil und Bogen (Munition für Schießeisen soll rar bleiben) Stolperfallen Lärmfalle GPS - Tracker mit Sinn Beispiel: er mag Hirsch warum nicht den Hirschen fangen mit dem Tracker markieren und Bigfoots Höhle finden? Statt einem Punkt auf der Karte vom GPS Tracker mit einem Handheld alla Alien Isolation Motion Tracker oder für die CoD Fans Herzschlagsensor (also das Prinzip)  Anfangsequipment wie Phasmophobia: Missionen erfolgreich = "Geld" Kaufe Ausrüstung -> bessere Chancen auf dem nächsten Trip. Natürlich sollte die Möglichkeit bestehen das Feld vorher zu Räumen sich auszurüsten und das Spiel fortzusetzen.  Zum Beispiel  Mission 1 finde die vermissten - erfolgreich Finde Beweise - erfolgreich -> Van zurück zum Hauptquartier Geld kassieren bei bedarf ausrüsten. Fortsetzen finde Bigfoot usw....  Allgemein: Eine Auswahl an Schwierigkeitsgraden Tage / Nächte etwas länger machen Nächte teilweise zu hell.  Survival extra: <- Als EXTRA Eigenes Lager Aufschlagen können  Kälte Wärme Essen jagen (Tiere gibt es genug) etc.

Date 2022-01-25 Playtime 29h 30m Rec Positive 4/5 This game is very good and fun to play with friends, although it is a shame that Bigfoot is so overpowered when in PVP. The recent updates in this game have really elevated and its really fun to collect evidence.  Issues and possible hotfixes: The AI will run away from signal flares and the flare gun for a long while, while if a player gets hit by a blind they can just stand there and wait for the duration to end - as they have so much health even at the lowest health preset. It makes it unfair to play against unless the player playing squatch is willing to act more like the AI and run away when in a jam, because it is simply so easy to sit on top of the players and demolish them when all the flares are used up. I would like to see more opportunities for healing hunters health points (LET US COOK MEAT AT FIRES OR STOVES) and a lowering of bigfoot's health (and maybe making trash and dead animals heal him more to offset for this because currently the healing from them is dismal). This would fix a lot of the issues in the PVP mode. If you are currently looking to play this game, don't count on playing PVP unless you are playing with friends who are willing to roleplay and someone who can seriously step back as Bigfoot in order to let everyone enjoy the game much more. That being said, player vs AI is very very fun and spooky, although bigfoot can be cheesed (ziplines).  Please balance the game more! Or at least give the server host the option to set Bigfoot's attack and health even lower than the current lowest. Ultimately a slider bar in 10% increments would be best as opposed to 3 options.

Date 2022-01-25 Playtime 3h 46m Rec Positive this game is a load of fun, its absolutely terrifying at times. I wish there was more settings for a single player mode. I think it would be wicked fun if you actually had to seek him out, like at first if he would hide and avoid you and then become more aggressive each day. I get its made to be a multiplayer experience, but Id love a chance to actually do more than just get bum rushed as soon as I leave camp. just a thought, overall amazing game.
Date 2022-01-25 Playtime 183h 2m Rec Negative Bonjour, c'est le livreur de sel !!!  au premier abord, ce jeu est vraiment immersif, les graphismes et le gameplay ont été revue. les mécaniques sont basique, mais ça fait le taf.  Malheureusement , si vous tombez sur une équipe Ramdom,  je vous fait pas de dessins sur la mentalités des joueurs en général ...  les pires, c'est ceux qui sont les "hebergeurs" , souvent  ces derniers rage quit quand il ce fond tuer par le bigfoot (alors qu'il lui reste que 100 pv  au bigfoot à tout casser) du coup, fin du game, tout le monde retourne au lobby, un suppo, et au lit ! ça n'assume pas comme d'hab ...  c'est une mécanique obsolète !!! beaucoup d'autre jeux de devs indé ne l'utilisent plus !  des problèmes de collisions subsistent, ajouter à cela , un personnage limite en fauteuil roulant, et c'est un cocktail parfait !  Pour ce qui est stuff éparpillé au coin de la map, vous avez tout intérêt à rusher dessus car, beaucoup le fond, pour au final rien en faire, ce qui diminue drastiquement vos chances de survie.  quand un joueur rage quit, ou troll, vous voyez sont cadavre, mais vous ne pouvez plus accéder à son inventaire, le stuff est perdu, ça rush pour chopper le m4, et ça ce fait défoncer 3 seconde après ....  les trousses de soins fondent comme neige au soleil de plus, elles restaurent à peine 25 points de vie, ça aurait quand même bien de pouvoir manger de la viande, et de gagner 5 points de vie (c'est peu mais ça ne gâche rien à la difficulté). Bah non !  parlons du bigfoot, en IA, même avec les stats à fonds, vous comprendrez tout de suite le script, et vous vaincrez haut la main, avec un joueur cancer comme bigfoot, c'est tout autre chose : ça spam les attaques, limite, il vous empêche de vous relever en vous mettant des coups de poteaux dans la G*****, fin du game !!! bravo aux devs "free victory for noobs" mettre un délai entre chaque attaques spécial ne leurs ais pas venues à l'idée ... ils ont joué à leurs jeux au moins ?  le fait d'être Niveau 1 ou 100 change absolument rien !!! ont pourrait dire que ça évolue d'1% les stats des survivants tout les 5 niveau par rapport à leurs compétence, voilou .....  ou débloquer des skins, que dalle ...  sur le discord officiel , c'est désert total, du moins pour les fr. Il n'y à clairement pas assez de com sur ce jeu. donc, pour monter une solide équipe, va falloir trimer !  je ne peux vraiment pas Recommander ce jeu, le fun y est seulement avec une équipe plus que soudé, dans le cas contraire, bonne chance !  mise à jour :  le fait de sauter par une fenêtre, même cassé vous enlevera 2 points de vie, donc, si vous êtes en lutte acharné contre le bigfoot joueur, et qu'il reste peu de vie dans les deux camps, bas gros avantage au bigfoot ...  ça vous parle le mot équilibrage les devs ?   Exemples : si l'hôte ce déconnecte, le jeu continue, et si c'est le bigfoot qui rage quit, victoire aux survivant plutôt qu'a ce retrouver devant l'écran d'accueil ... Faire cuire la viande pour gagner 5 points de vie en la mangeant (retarder un peu le game over). Mettre un lapse de temps ou le bigfoot fais sont attaque de te soulever, et de te mettre en PLS au sol. Faire des pièges de fortune, mais qui est à but de stun le bigfoot . Faire en sorte de les débris de verres des vitres cassés disparaissent après vous être blessé une fois, nan parce que pour vous mettre en PLS, le bigfoot joueur va ce servir allègrement de ce malus ! Porter plus de signales de détresse. Avoir des buissons un peu plus toufus, nan parce que les joueurs cancers, c'est gamma 13 minimum la nuit, baissez ça distance de vision du bigfoot le soir ! Utiliser de la boue pour masquer sont odeur durant un certain temps.  Non parce que là, le bigfoot, même si vous débutez avec lui, en 2-3 games, vous allez soulever tout le monde !  passez vôtre chemin, il ne vaut vraiment pas plus de 5 €

Date 2022-01-22 Playtime 60h 49m Rec Negative DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  IT IS STILL GARBAGE EVEN AS OF 24 JUNE 2022!  Sometimes the game glitches and some of the evidence does not spawn! You change the difficulty and the game changes it back to default and won't let you change it anymore.  Bigfoot has way too much health and the guns do far too little damage.  Bigfoot can hit you no matter where you are (without him using a sign as a club his arm can reach about 15' even tho it's only about 5' long).  There is not enough first-aid kits, ammo, etc on the Winter Park map.  You get caught in his snare traps even though you're not even close to the loop.  Bigfoot always runs, so he's extremely difficult to hit (takes about 1200+ shots to hit him about 250 times).  Only some of the controls are listed in the Controls section of Settings, so you have to guess what some of the controls are.  It only has 2 maps.  The beginning and ending cut-scenes are lame (drive into park ... drive out of park).  No explanation as to what benefits you gain from leveling up (apparently no benefits at all).  The GPS tracking darts last maybe 20 seconds and are thus pointless to use.  You only get 1 dynamite.  Day and night are too short (each needs to be about 5 minutes longer).  Bigfoot is too short in height.  One the Redwood map, there is some red vegetation scattered all over the ground throughout the green grass and all over the base of large trees, which makes it look like the whole map was carpet bombed with red paint.  It looks stupid.  Bigfoot looks and walks like a gorilla instead of like a Bigfoot.  Also, he's wearing an arm band and a wrist band. He looks stupid.  As it stands, this should be a totally free game.

Date 2022-01-19 Playtime 7h 27m Rec Negative Если вы думаете, что это та игра, в которой вы будете искать бигфута, используя камеры, дроны, ища следы и прочее - нет, это не та игра. Бигфут с радостным топотом прибежит к вам на вторую ночь и больше не отстанет до конца игры. Будет передышка только днем, и если он вас достаточно потрепает, то он почему-то сразу переключается на другого игрока. Если непотрепанного игрока нет, то бигфут убегает до следующей ночи. Камеры, датчики, дроны - это всё есть, но это всё не нужно.  Если вы думаете, что это та игра, в которой вы будете прятаться от бигфута, используя укрытия, закрывая шторы, выключая свет, передвигаясь на корточках и прочее - нет, это не та игра. Все эти укрытия, двери, шторы, выключатели света есть, но они вообще не работают. Бигфут всегда знает, где вы, и бежит бить вас по самому короткому пути.  Если вы думаете, что это та игра, в которой вы будете ловить бигфута, используя разнообразные ловушки и прочее - нет, это не та игра. Есть только капкан, который используется как оружие: наносит урон и на несколько секунд задерживает бигфута.   Если вы думаете, что это та игра, в которой вы будете убивать бигфута - да, это та игра. Но у вас это не получится. У бигфута столько жизней, что вам придется совместно в несколько ружей стрелять в него больше часа, чтобы убить.  Если вы думаете, что это та самая игра - нет, это не та игра. Это самый примитивный pvp шутер. И в него можно хоть как-то играть, только если у вас компания из 4-5 человек и один из вас играет за бигфута. Но когда вас 4-5 человек, то нет смысла играть в эту игру, если есть столько других более качественных мультиплеерных игр.

Date 2022-01-19 Playtime 6h 22m Rec Negative [h1] Smoll Review [/h1] I would like to say this game has changed too much from its first game. There's some good and bad things they added to the game.  [b] Pro : [/b] 1. The new bigfoot realistic models 2. Now every place in the map feels filled, not like it used to seem empty 3. Diverse weapons and added puzzles 4. There's no safe place  [b] Cons : [/b] 1. The AI way too much easier to exploit 2. The map design is wide, but feels like it's narrow 3. Walking simulator to find bigfoot 4. Actually giving a story like we put bigfoot in a cage is better than other cutscenes 5. Multiplayer focussed 6. Skins skins skins  [b] Conclusion : [/b] Buy this game if you have friends to play with, but if you dont you can play with online lobby. Btw, now if you want to complete an achievement, it's better to grind in multiplayer than have to look for bigfoot AI that doesn't know where to go  [b] 6/10 [/b] Good concept, but good old concept is also discarded. A little sad :(

Date 2022-01-19 Playtime 6h 25m Rec Positive Hey i played this game before the big update and i wanted to say that im sad that i can't play the update becuase i got tottally unfrended by the person i was playing with but im really proud of the developer. The game now actually looks nice and fasinating and is actually nice gj
Date 2022-01-19 Playtime 21h 3m Rec Positive Games great in my opinion. It's true if you're playing solo it's not as fun because a lot of lobby hosts end up ditching, but definitely a good game for you and your mates. Plus it's beautiful scenery and on top of all of that the AI in the bigfoots actually really good.
Date 2022-01-19 Playtime 20h 2m Rec Negative Fun concept, good with a few mates, very limited replay value
Date 2022-01-19 Playtime 10h 13m Rec Negative It was cool early on. I mean EARLY ON. It was a search for Bigfoot and it was mysterious and creepy. And now "Bigfoot", aka my asshole friends come barreling out of the woods to beat my ass. Not impressed. Not fun. I hate it. And SKINS??? SKINS??? The hell you guys thinking?!
Date 2022-01-19 Playtime 8h 31m Rec Negative I enjoyed this game when it first came out, I wanted to give it some time to flesh out some the gameplay and iron some bugs... then they changed it to a non-original 4v1 **** em up that wasn't fun or unique at all and now the final straw... Skin DLCs, they've gone darkside... they have fallen for the greedy money grubbing douche baggery and I wish I had never bought the game or supported the creators.

Date 2022-01-17 Playtime 10h 23m Rec Positive I would highly recommend this game for a group of friends who are looking to play a new game. Even with all 4 players the game is still a challenge. With constant updates that devs are putting out to constantly improve the game. With big maps diverse characters with every character being different then the last. The game also has many weapons with lots of different guns,explosives and melee weapons. So if you and your friend group are looking for a new game to play look no further BigFoot is your answer.

Date 2022-01-17 Playtime 41h 2m Rec Positive nice 
Date 2022-01-17 Playtime 27h 4m Rec Positive This game is in early access, and in some places it shows. I have run into a few game breaking bugs, like when players get stuck in building geometry, keeping them from continuing the hunt for the legendary sasquatch. However, there is a lot that has really been worked on lately, especially with the advent of the 4.2 update! the improvements to Bigfoot's AI make the game a lot more than  a boring shooting gallery, I find myself planning ambushes around the new search mechanic added in this update. The search mechanic also allows players to have some breathing room on some nights, allowing them to hide and recuperate if they find themselves low on supplies or are looking to win via evidence route. Overall BIGFOOT is probably one of my favorite co-op games out there at the moment, I would even put it on a similar level to Phasmophobia (another great co-op horror game, would recommend that as well if you like this). Both games are very much still in development, but they both have so much to offer, and so much potential.

Date 2022-01-16 Playtime 7h 38m Rec Negative This Concept is in theory good but in praxis kinda boring.  You only search for loot on these not interesting built maps just to face Bigfoot sometimes. When you hit him a few times he will run away and you have to wait that Bigfoot strikes back again.
Date 2022-01-16 Playtime 30h 17m Rec Positive Great aspects for a multiplayer horror game. This game incorporates everything you would assume a game about the hairy creature would need. For example, the characters have different abilities that make sense for those characters, there is an feature where you can play as Bigfoot himself and hunt down your friends (or randoms if you like to play public) which was not a feature in the original version of the game, when playing with an AI Bigfoot he will eat animals that he kills and will occasionally let out a blood curdling roar that could make the most serious of horror game players jump (only the first few times though), they have also added a feature where Bigfoot can now smell garbage or put our fires (not 100% sure about the fires), since Bigfoot has the physique of an overgrown monkey it would make sense that he is intelligent seeing that he has set up traps around the forest.  The game is often being updated where every time it adds either something new to a map or a new map in general. Currently as I am writing this review there are two maps: Redwood Park and Winter Park. Some maps soon to come in future updates are: Ross Lake Park (One of the original maps) and Yellowstone Park and possibly more maps that will be released to the community soon.

Date 2022-01-15 Playtime 2h 19m Rec Positive Haven't figured out how to use the drone but I went exploring. I took a beautiful picture of a mangled corpse, hoping to enter it into the State Fair Competition.  It didn't take long for BigFoot to attack me in a cabin I was hanging out in.  A**hole.  I thought BigFoot was supposed to be hiding.  I shot him with a Flaregun and he ran off on fire.  I set up some remote cameras I could use to watch out for him but they were unnecessary....BigFoot tried to attack me when I was drinking in the RV.  I put down my bottle and blasted him with a shotgun through the window.  He ran away.  Apparently, BigFoot can break down the solid wood doors of cabins pretty easy but the RV doors must be made of solid steel because he can not enter.  Anyway, I'm a little confused.  There was this log that spelled out objectives you needed to do like photograph a BigFoot print, slashes on trees and other stuff to prove his existence.  I didn't expect BigFoot to ruin the fun by showing up in person.

Date 2022-01-15 Playtime 19h 50m Rec Positive BIGFOOT is a great game. Bigfoot is a 'work in progress', but it's a good one and when I once had a problem, the community was quick to help me on the ofc discord server. Yes, the game has some bugs, but none are gamebraking and I didn't see any of them until I went searching for them...  I do have a problem with the game tough. The game gets marketed as a game, where you search and gather intelligence about bigfoot. - You don't. Bigfoot finds you every night wherever you are, which was a rather big turnoff about the game for me
Date 2022-01-14 Playtime 32h 21m Rec Negative Ostatnia aktualizacja z dnia 14 lutego kompletnie popsuła grę i uniemożliwia granie w nią. Bigfoot jest upośledzony, pomimo zapewnień że bigfoot nie będzie wiedział gdzie się ukrywamy, to wielka stopa ciągle idzie w kierunku gracza. Oszustwo, tak mozna nazwać nowy przedmiot, gps tracker to największy scam w historii gier komputerowych, po rzuceniu gps na bigfoota działa on tylko przez 2-3 sekundy po czym znika. Nowe skiny dodane oczywiście bo hajs się musi zgadzać, ale zadowolenie graczy jest chyba twórcą gry obojętne. Nie polecam gry po aktualizacji 4.2 , jest niegrywalna.
Date 2022-01-14 Playtime 35h 15m Rec Negative Aktualizacja 4.2 zepsuła big foota, siedzę cicho a big foot wie gdzie jestem, idzie mnie rozjebać. Do dupy są te GPS trakery bo nic nie dają, są niegrywalne, działają 3 sec jeśli trafisz.  Kolejną sprawą jest to, że tyle czekałem na nową aktualizację no i jest do dupy XD Ja czekałem na nowe mapy i po takim długim czasie aktualizacja bez nowych map,  ale z "poprawą AI". Nic to nie zmienia i tylko wkurza, aktualizacja do dupy. AI do dupy, wszytko do dupy. dupa
Date 2022-01-14 Playtime 32h 3m Rec Positive Интересная и весёлая игра для двоих или даже для компании из 5 человек.  День в игре   Сначала страшно и непонятно с чего начать, а отойти от трейлера, так вообще равносильно смерти (так думали мы с друзьями). Но собрав яички в кулаки, мы отправились исследовать карту. Вокруг очень много звуков: то шелест или треск деревьев, то олень завопит, то ещё кто-нибудь захочет затащить вас к ♂dungeon master"у♂. Так проходит день в игре, т.е: лутание, приколы с друзьями (или без приколов, если нету друзей (реально жалко тебя парень/девушка (нет =) )) и боязнь окружающего мира.  Ночь  Когда наступает ночь, то о4ко сжимается до размера муравья. Вы начинаете вслушиваться в каждый бл"дский звук, чтобы эта горила не оказалась рядом. Ведь с наступлением ночи видимость персонажа падает, а вместе с тем, Бигфут выходит на охоту (ночью он даёт больше пиз"юлей, чем обычно).  Мой совет на ночь: прятаться в доме, перед входом положить что-то (и внутри тоже), будь то капкан или взрывное, чтобы поджарить его пердак. Это поможет вам хоть немного почувствовать себя в безопасности.  Так же в игре есть 4 персонажа и у каждого свои плюсы. Например у Книгер мэна выше живучесть и повышенный урон взрывчаткой.   Всем удачной игры и хорошего настроения =)

Date 2022-01-14 Playtime 10h 23m Rec Positive Hard unfinished game, like your mother
Date 2022-01-14 Playtime 7h 54m Rec Negative Bigfoot is coming along, but it's not nearly complete enough to buy now. There is simply a lack of things to do in the game besides the unpolished main game play loop.  There are balance problems whereby either Bigfoot is far too easy to kill, too hard, or too boring. You can adjust his health, damage, and collectables around the map, but in all cases you wind up with a Bigfoot who either stomps you into a puddle in his first encounter, or dies far too quickly, or takes ages to kill in a slow grind across a half dozen encounters. In some patch, another victory condition was added where you can collect evidence around the map to escape, but this amounts to stumbling over a footprint or dead camper, hoping you're the player with the camera, and then rinse and repeating 12 times for enough evidence.  Additionally, when playing in a group, a player dying puts the group in the awkward position of "should we quit and restart, or do we make the player spectate us for the rest of the game?" Spectator mode is quite limited, so the dead wind up idling at their keyboards with nothing to do but chat. If you went the slow grind route, this is probably 90+ minutes, or 45+ otherwise. Recently, totems were added which can be collected and used at an alter to resurrect a player, but finding these is as much a chore as the evidences are so really aren't a good replacement for just quitting the game (and playing something else!)  I really want to like this game. It should be fun. It has a winning premise. The atmosphere is great, the woods feel like home (here in the pacific northwest), the nights feel scary, you'll grease your pants the first time the hairy beast runs out of the woods at you, but the core element of the game is just... faulty.

Date 2022-01-13 Playtime 41h 28m Rec Negative This gameplay system is absolutely rubbish in this game as a hunter. Even on the lowest difficulty for hunter you cannot play the game with less than 4 players, and as I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone it makes it difficult to get done, especially when you go into an online lobby and when someone dies the lobby get s closed almost immediately. Bigfoot has too large a health pool, does too much damage, is too fast and there is nowhere you can escape from him to that he cannot get you (which I get because people would cheese the win, but cheesing the win seems to be the only way to get it).  I have watched many guides on the net as to how to win the game, with everyone stating that theres plenty of ammo around and plenty of med kits, but when  in a single game I can do >2k damage to the bigfoot and he still has >700 hp and he kills me and my second hunter with 320 damage total, I mean, it takes all the fun out of it and makes it seem impossible.  Maybe I'm just bad at the game, but in all honesty how god tier do you need to be at this game to win a single match against AI?

Date 2022-01-12 Playtime 10h 33m Rec Negative Super Unbalanced, the AI is wack.
Date 2022-01-12 Playtime 13h 3m Rec Positive The game still has some "placeholder" like gameplay aspects, like ranking, and lack of a tutorial. However the core gameplay exists, and is enjoyable. Essentially fight bigfoot, and or find the evidence. Fun in a group, but requires a lot of planning and coordination to actually take the big guy down.   I highly advise to get this game with friends, public lobbies basically don't exist, and playing solo is probably to much of a challenge.   Game still requires a good amount of work, so I'd get it on sale when possible, and don't be surprised when there is only 2 maps out of 4, and parts of the game feel unpolished.  But if you want to fight bigfoot, then this is the game for you!

Date 2022-01-11 Playtime 4h 51m Rec Positive I love getting hunting by Bigfoot and trying to survive
Date 2022-01-11 Playtime 14h 16m Rec Negative This game has great potential, is unique and is fun to learn. However if you take a look at the global Achievements, you will see that the game is far from balanced at this stage of Early Access, almost no one has completed more than a single play through, with only 0.3% of Hunters and Bigfoot players going twenty rounds,( which is speaks volumes and is unfortunate). As this game is almost impossible to win as Hunters.   Bigfoot is way too OP, the beast needs to increase and decrease in power depending upon the number of Hunters ( like the Patriarch in Killing Floor ), he also needs to be heard from a greater distance (crashing of branches, rumbling growls, stomping feet) not suddenly when he is almost on top of the Hunters. There needs to be more places for the Hunters to hole up, being owned by Bigfoot every single night gets old quick. Playing Bigfoot is fun, but its easy just to tank and gank every Hunter that you come across without too much worry for self preservation. It would be much better if Bigfoot needed to be more tactical when he approaches the Hunters, instead of just storming them because there guns are more or less useless.    There needs to be a wrist watch/clock, to give Hunters a sense of when to hole up for the night. Night tends to creep up quickly without any notice. A sense of time would be great.   I know this is Early Access, but its 2022 (it was made in 2017), so I cannot recommend this game.  I look forward to what the future brings.   Ohh, and for Achievement Hunters this game has at least one cheevo that is no longer relevant to the new updates (can no longer freeze to death), so won't unlock.
Date 2022-01-11 Playtime 5h 27m Rec Positive BigFoot Has Those developers That keep on updating the game The Game was once a Simple game with not much graphics but now it is amazing Worth buying
Date 2022-01-11 Playtime 155h 52m Rec Positive I've just started playing this game yesterday, and I absolutely LOVE IT! My parents are obsessed with it as well.

Date 2022-01-10 Playtime 26h 6m Rec Positive ITS JUST GOOD
Date 2022-01-10 Playtime 1h 24m Rec Negative Interesting concept with potential but needs some work. One of my biggest disappointments with the game is that I was expecting the gameplay to be more of a tense build up of exploring around looting, trying to find hints of where bigfoot is and track him down while occasionally getting spooked/attacked by him but what it pretty much actually boils down to is a tower defense game.   At night, he goes on the hunt, which at first I thought it just meant it would be more dangerous to be out in the open at night and you would have to sneak around more but no, there seems to be no stealth/hiding mechanic at all, bigfoot always knows exactly where you are, so what nighttime actually consists of is just setting up traps and defenses around your preferred area and trying to take as much health out of bigfoot as he attacks you. It is literally just an FPS tower defense game with a looting aspect, no good horror aspects to it at all.   So if that sounds like it might be fun, then maybe you'll like this game but honestly, just take a look at how many hours other reviewers have and that should be enough to tell you that this is just sort of a throw-away game as of right now. There really isn't shit to do or play for other than playing through each map once or twice, which there aren't many of atm.

Date 2022-01-10 Playtime 22h 11m Rec Positive Me and the boys went to hunt bigfoot, bigfoot hunted us.
Date 2022-01-10 Playtime 68h 7m Rec Positive So in my experience with this game I will re-iterate some things and others I'll actually say counter to.  To Begin, Bigfoot's A.I. Mode is NOT O.P. if you know how to play against him. Using everything including Map exploits such as Doors, Zip-Lines, Railing jumps and in cooperation with Flare Gun stuns, Signal Flares Blinding, Bear-Traps, Explosives etc. You can kill Bigfoot almost Easily with minimal damage to yourself even with High Health mode for Bigfoot. Not to mention if you have everything that's in the safes around the map.  That being said, Bigfoot in PLAYER mode is ABSOLUTELY O.P. especially if one plays as him a lot. Daytime damage isn't enough to deter anyone, the "Player Finding" ability is OVERWHELMINGLY overpowered. And it becomes very discouraging when Bigfoot wipes your entire team in One to Two nights. (Yes even with lowest settings)[Note: this coming from multiple online games and private family games]  To put it short,  Bigfoot A.I. = Beatable with Strategic Game-play Bigfoot Player = Unbeatable with competent Player.  Other than that, the game is Beautiful. I enjoy the Hunting for loot and codes for better loot. Environmental hazards are always a plus to keep you on your toes (Bears, Wolves, Tree's, Bigfoot Traps). I also love the soundtrack being ominous and intense at just the right moments. Never felt like it took away from the experience.  I would recommend this game, but by no means say its perfect and I hope improvements are made as new maps are released (Which I am excited for as well.)

Date 2022-01-09 Playtime 79h 19m Rec Positive The game has Big potential to become a good horror/exploring game, I just think they need to change some things to emphasize that. Such as making Bigfoot a lot weaker during the day that will make it easier for the survivors to loot and Bigfoot to not be too aggressive and prepare for the night. Just overall make Bigfoot weaker, his Abilities r too easy to use there should be a longer cool-down to avoid spamming them. The graphics R very good it feels sorta photo realistic, at night it can be scary when u can barely see anything and bigfoot has the advantage over u. The experience with friends is much better. Highly recommend.

Date 2022-01-08 Playtime 68h 50m Rec Positive Das Spiel ist aus meiner Sicht die beste Jagdsimulation die des derzeit auf Steam gibt. Bigoot bietet durch seine detailreiche Grafik und durch unglaublich realistisch wirkende Spielmechaniken einen langanhaltenden Spielspaß auf mit Leidenschaft erstellten Karten. Besonders viel Spaß macht das Spiel, wenn man es mit Freunden zusammen spielt. Freunde von Horrorspielen kommen ebenfalls auf Ihre Kosten da Bigfoot auch für den ein oder anderen Schreckmoment bei den den Spielern sorgen kann. Ich wünsche allen viel Spaß beim spielen dieses auf seine Art einzigartigen Spieles

I will say that once you learn the mechanics of the game, killing bigfoot can be pretty easy on the easy settings after a while, but if you set the difficulty all the way up you're in for a fun challenge.
Date 2022-01-08 Playtime 28h 26m Rec Positive Took me a while to finally figure out the strat to kill bigfoot, but overall it is really fun!
Date 2022-01-08 Playtime 40h 29m Rec Positive Атмосферная и не много пугающая, веселее играть в кругу друзей так как с ними полностью погружаешься в игру, правда друзей у меня нет. Единственный минус для меня, это то что если играешь со случайными игроками, бигфут может пойти убивать в первую же ночь, не дав возможности найти оружие. Особенно если игроки разбежались, то шансов просто может не быть

Date 2022-01-07 Playtime 2h 54m Rec Negative I like asymmetrical horror games like DBD so i thought id try bigfoot. quite disappointed with the game for a couple reasons, main one being that bigfoot is too OP, he can easily single-handedly take down a whole group of survivors without much ability to counter and if lets say 1-2 survivors are already dead then the chances of defeating bigfoot become much much slimmer than they already are. What about including more powerful weapons for the survivors or different ways to counter bigfoot.  For example, rare military checkpoints could spawn on the map where the survivors can find premium loot such as machine guns/ flamethrowers/ miniguns etc. The military checkpoints may require teamwork to reach, or be hidden away in tunnels found in the many cliffs in the game. Maybe even vehicles could be introduced! Or what about even increasing the number of hunters in the game ? to 6? 8? 10? Bigfoot's survivor-aura reading ability should also be nerfed, it gives the survivors no stealth advantages at all.  Another problem with the game is hosts ending the game because this happens far too often. What about enforcing some sort of penalty to players who do this regularly?  I don't recommend the game to anyone now, its far too unbalanced which makes it boring because you expect the same thing every time if you get lucky enough to finish a game before the host ends it. With some good updates I think the game has potential and could be more than just a meme.

Date 2022-01-06 Playtime 52h 2m Rec Positive Ich bin unfassbar aufgeregt, weil wir wirklich im Dunkeln nach BigFoot suchen. Ich habe auch eine 💩 Angst, weil wir halt im Dunkeln nach BigFoot suchen.... Wir geben uns zwar immer Mühe, aber die BigFoots spielen nicht mit.... Auf jeden Fall gibt es hier Mountain Lions, Bären, Schlangen, Skorpione,... ich wollte sagen es fühlt sich nicht gut an, aber es fühlt sich einfach 💩 an. Manchmal denke ich mir nur: Da ist was! Da ist was! Oder ich frage mich: Was ist hier los? Hab ich jetzt irgendwas gesehen an der Seite? Die Antwort habe ich eigentlich schnell parat, weil ich sowieso wieder nichts gesehen habe, ich bin jedoch immer aufgeregt, ich weiß es nicht... nervös auf jeden Fall... Es geht hier um so Wellen, plötzlich ist hier wieder Action... ist da was, ist da was? Und dann: nein. Da ist nichts. Ich lasse mich da so mitreißen und wenn da wieder nichts ist, bin ich erst enttäuscht und dann merke ich: Na gut, wir suchen ja auch nach BigFoot.  Fazit: Fast alle haben irgendwas gehört, oder gesehen. Nur ich nicht. Irgendwie ist es einerseits bisschen verdächtig, dass der TV auch immer nichts hört, andererseits habe ich vielleicht auch nur Pech. Egal was es ist, mir gefällts nicht.  Ich habe eindeutig keinen BigFoot gesehen, ich habe nicht mal einen richtigen Hinweis darauf gesehen. Ich kann aber sehr sehr gut verstehen, warum wir alle jedes Jahr das Spiel wieder spielen. Es macht einfach eine menge Spaß und mal ehrlich: Wann sonst schleicht man nächtelang durch die wunderschöne Landschaft, wenn nicht bei der BigFoot-Jagd?

Date 2022-01-06 Playtime 1h 40m Rec Negative Ожидал от игры намного большего, на старых версия игра была страшнее, и соответственно сам бигфут был выше и страшнее. Сейчас же кроме 100% ночных атак, также бесит эта ночь-тупо серый экран(якобы еффект темноты и тумана) , толи туман, толи кто-то обосрался (днем все ок). Пугаться тут можно лишь своих шагов и молний бьющих по деревьям. Что не скажешь про бигфута который пока добежит до тебя, весь лес обдристается от его шагов на всю карту (эффект неожиданости отпадает, там даже оборачиваться каждую секунду не нужно, просто включи наушники и ты услышишь то как он бегает в км от тебя с обосранной жопой и с табличкой в руке). раньше было лучше 🐑💂‍♂️👎

Date 2022-01-05 Playtime 6h 30m Rec Positive Hunt Bigfoot down as a team of 4 players of fight as Bigfoot against the players.  Even though Bigfoot is quite overpowered, the game is really fun. There is a total of 2 maps, which are well designed. There are various interesting locations to visit, varieties of weapons and tools to find (in order to fight Bigfoot), etc.  It is definitely not the best game ever, but it is kind of fun to play occasionally. I wish there were more maps, but the developers are probably working on this.

Date 2022-01-04 Playtime 5h 57m Rec Negative This game is nearing the 5 year mark and does not have the most to show for it. Updates/development seem to be incredibly slow, and it's hard to tell if the devs even care about this game, or if it's just a cash grab.   Gameplay was very repetitive, and that would not be as large of an issue if there were more than 2 maps. Almost 5 hours in the game and I find that you use the same strategy every time. I had hope for this game, but who knows if the devs will release any worthy content.  Got this in a bundle deal for charity. I would not pay anything over $5 for it.  Update: Still bad
Date 2022-01-04 Playtime 8h 33m Rec Negative Игра прикольная, но цену не оправдывает. Для этой игры была бы оптимальная цена рублей 200, а не 550...

Date 2022-01-03 Playtime 6h 36m Rec Positive If you have some extra money and were debating getting this game to play with friends I would recommend it. You can play with a group of friends to go and kill Bigfoot or you can have a friend be Bigfoot and kill your group. The game has seen leaps and bounds of improvement from when it was first released and is a very in depth game. I like the controls, the graphics and the overall horror experience when playing with friends. If you are reading this review because your friends are questioning why to get it, use this as a sign to get it.

Date 2022-01-02 Playtime 47h 17m Rec Positive Amazing game, very engaging and great mechanics. Love the aesthetics and atmosphere of the game. Overall great game but here are some things I think the game could use: 1. Better Bigfoot A.I.- Bigfoot becomes predictable after awhile. Increasing his AI to learn and overcome the consistent attacks we have with him at night provoking him and thus us to find a different way to battle would make the game that much more engaging. Recently I played with a friend where we went thru the same fight with bigfoot and he ran away (As he always does when the fight is over) but when we thought the coast was clear he randomly came back again surprising us and provoking us back into a fight. I found it exciting and it got me amped up to keep playing since it was both unexpected and welcome. 2. Teammate Healing- Medkits are severely lacking, especially when loot is turned all the way up and you have 3-4 teammates. Instead of running out of medkits to heal a fallen comrade (Because it will happen) we should be able to revive them when they're down without the use of any medkit or other item, medkits should just be used to heal ourselves when we're low on health/dying. I also noticed there's a partially opened medical box in the trailer, if we get all the loot in the map (Medkits for this instance) what if you go back to the trailer and the medical box gives 1 medkit for each player and replenishes every hour or so? (Maybe less?). And another idea goes into suggestion... 3. Crafting- To go along with the previous suggestion for health, if we run out of medkits across the map, what if you were able to find specific kinds of scraps across the map strewn about, and certain combinations created things like, I dunno... a makeshift medkit? Maybe you could even use said scraps to craft upgraded gear or unique loot? Say you could use a bottle scrap and a lighter scrap to create a molotov cocktail that you can use like dynamite to throw at bigfoot that does the same damage as the gascan? What if you could find scraps that allows you to upgrade the shotgun and starting rifle to add precision shots or quicker reload? Both would make us too OP so what if only one upgrade of the two was applicable.  These are just my opinions and I think would make the game ten times more fun to play. Another thing on my mind is an idea for a new map. What if you added a new map that was set in the Everglades National Park where the red-haired "Skunk Ape" version of bigfoot hunted you thru alligator infested swamp, palmetto hammock paths, and an abandoned road bordered by sunken cypress trees? Just think that would be pretty cool :) End of story, great game, never gonna stop playing it, have gotten all of my friendgroup to play it and we all enjoy it. Keep up the great work, you guys are onto something here!

Date 2022-01-02 Playtime 33h 8m Rec Positive [h1][b]Tag der Abrechnung 001# ⸺⸺⸺⸺⸺⸺⸺⸺⸺⸺ Kritik an "CyberLight Game Studio"[/b][/h1]    [b]Jetzt hören wir mal bitte alle einmal zu, nom.[/b]  Dieses Spiel wurde mir von meinen engagierten Schülern der [b]Klasse 5a des Mathematik G-Kurses[/b] empfohlen. Ich muss gleich mit offenen Karten spielen und sagen, dass ich eigentlich gar nichts von Videospielen halte. Alles sieht sehr unrealistisch aus. Die Situationen in denen ich mich bewege sind sehr unnatürlich und ausgedacht. Aus diesem Grund bin ich prinzipiell immer voreingenommen, nom.  Sooo, dann kommen wir mal wieder zurück zum Anfangspunkt! Meine lieben Schüler des Mathematik G-Kurses waren an das Berechnen von Brüchen nicht interessiert. Dauernd wurde ich beim Präsentieren des Rechenweges unterbrochen. Als ich mich dann locker und gelassen durch den Klassenraum bewegen wollte, flog ich plötzlich über zwei Schultaschen. Da blieb mir beinah ein Stück der Buttercremetorte meiner Ehefrau in der Luftröhre stecken.  [i]Nach erfolgreichen lebenserhaltenden Maßnahmen, wie in dem Fall der "Heimlichgriff" eines Schülers der Schulsanitäter-AG, wurde mir eines bewusst. Die Taschen haben nicht im Gang zu liegen und flogen deshalb kurzerhand durch dem gesamten Klassenraum - die fassungslosen Gesichtsausdrücke der Schüler waren unbezahlbar.[/i]  Dann sprach mich plötzlich der Adrian an. Er begann mich über sämtlichen Videospielen auszufragen. Ich dachte erst, dass sich der Adrian ebenfalls für die guten, alten Klassiker interessiert. Doch dann erzählte er mir etwas von einem Strategiespiel, in dem ich [b]"BIGFOOT"[/b] jagen muss.   [i]Ich dudelte ihm gleich meine Meinung und schickte ihn an die Tafel zur Auflösung von Aufgabe 5 - das Berechnen von Brüchen.[/i]   [b]Nichts ist wichtiger, als das Verständnis der Mathematik[/b]  Dann kam ich nach einem langen Arbeitstag nach Hause. Ich visierte zielstrebig meinen alten Computer an und rannte darauf los. Dabei habe ich meiner Ehefrau Claudia keinerlei Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt. Ich installierte mir, wie vom Adrian empfohlen [b]Steam[/b]  auf meinem Computer. Im Shop bin ich nach Eingabe des Stichwortes "Big" auch schon fündig geworden. Die Bilder in der Diashow waren wirklich beeindruckend. Somit war ich mir sicher, dieses Spiel werde ich mir jetzt sofort über "Klarna - 30 Tage" kaufen. Gesagt, getan.  [i]Nach einer Downloadzeit von insgesamt 6 Stunden, konnte ich dann endlich ins Spiel springen.[/i]  Als ich dann während des Spielens feststellte, dass es sich hierbei gar nicht um ein Strategiespiel, sondern vielmehr um ein Egoshooter handelt, bin ich schlagartig vom Drehstuhl geflogen. Eine Frechheit, dass mich meine Schüler anlügen. Das war wohl die Retourkutsche für das Blamieren vor der Klasse, als er Aufgabe 5 lösen sollte.  Fangen wir doch mal ganz Vorne an.  Zuerst musste ich mir meine Ausrüstung in so einem billigen Camper aus dem Anfang der 2000er Jahre zusammensammeln. Die Auswahl war für eine Spielrunde mit vier Personen gering. Da sich meine Teamkameraden schnellstmöglich die zwei Handfeuerwaffen stibitzt haben, ging ich wortwörtlich leer aus. Bei den Handfeuerwaffen handelt es sich um ein Scharfschützengewehr und eine kleinen Pistole der deutschen Bundespolizei.    Die Rohrzange wurde für mich übergelassen. Da stieg mein Ruhepuls schlagartig auf 180bpm. Dieses Ereignis erzeugte ein Kopfkino.  Das war der Moment, in dem ich mich fragte: [i]"Welche Idioten gehen zu 4. in den Wald um nach [b]BIGFOOT[/b] zu suchen, aber nehmen nur zwei halbvolle Handfeuerwaffen mit?"[/i]  Des Weiteren muss ich erwähnen, dass sich meine Teamkollegen die ganze Zeit von mir abwendeten. Aus diesem Grund musste ich völlig allein gelassen durch dem dunklen Wald pesen. Auf der gesamten Welt sind kleine Ortschaften verteilt, welche optisch wirklich nicht die gepflegtesten sind. Bei meiner Ankunft waren auch bereits alle Taschen, Kartons und Kisten geplündert. Nach einer Spielzeit von 20 Minuten war ich immernoch mit meiner Rohrzange unterwegs.  Plötzlich lief ich in eine Falle und hing wie vom Schreck getroffen in der Luft. Meine Lebensanzeige hatte von hier an nur noch ein Drittel der Gesamtleben. Und wie Gott es so will, rannte ein großes, muskulöses und übelriechendes Wesen auf mich zu. Dem Mundgeruch konnte ich dank meiner Vorbereitung seitens [b]Galileo[/b] auch direkt zuordnen.   [i]Dieser [b]Jumpscare[/b] hat mich so dermaßen vom Drehstuhl geschossen, mein lieber Scholli - meine Hüfte tut noch heute, trotz einer Hüft-TEP weh.[/i]  Als das große, muskulöse und übelriechende Wesen dann vor mir stand, brüllte es mich an wodurch mir ein unverdautes Stück Fisch ins Gesicht flog. Da dies noch nicht genug war, holte der Spinner aus und knallte mir eine, weshalb mir kurzzeitig die Lichter ausgingen. Nach einem kurzen Koma wollte ich wieder aufstehen, doch dann fackelte er nicht lange. Ich griff nach mir, schüttelte mich durch die Luft und schmiss mich wie ein Zahnstocher in den Busch. Und schon war es geschehen - ich bin gestorben. Meine Teamkameraden machten keine Anstalten, mich auch nur ansatzweise zu unterstützen, oder wiederzubeleben.  Deshalb komme ich zu meinem professionellen und kurzgefassten Fazit.   [b]Mein professionelles Fazit[/b] [table] [tr] [th]Pro[/th] [th]Kontra[/th] [/tr] [tr] [td]Schüler aus meiner Schule als Mitspieler[/td] [td]zu wenig Ausrüstung wie Handfeuerwaffen, Handwaffen[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]-[/td] [td]unkollegiale Teamkameraden[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]-[/td] [td]gebrochene Hüfte und Zustand nach Hüft-TEP 2023[/td] [/tr] [/table]  [b]Demnach keine Empfehlung meinerseits. Mein Ruhepuls steigt bei bloßer Ansicht schon auf 180bpm. Beim nächsten Erlebnis geht er hoch und dreht verrückt durch die Gegend wie ein Fidget-Spinner.[/b]  Jetzt noch drei simple Fragen an die Spieleentwickler: [olist] [*]Wieso gibt es nur 2 Handfeuerwaffen der deutschen Bundespolizei? [*]Was soll ich denn einer übelriechenden und laufenden Gardine mit einer Rohrzange anhaben können? [*]Bezahlt ihr mir die Operation der Hüfte (links)?[/olist]  Wenn du dich trotz meiner kritischen Meinung dazu entscheidest, dir dieses Spiel zu kaufen, dann mal ran an die Formeln! https://store.steampowered.com/app/509980/BIGFOOT/

Date 2022-01-01 Playtime 3h 49m Rec Positive I love this game, I love the concept and I love the work put in. I've followed the game for a few years since seeing a youtube video featuring it. It has come so far since the original video. I finally decided to buy it and it holds up. It's fun, fast paced and can be challenging at times. I do like the extra map. I'm excited to see the others. And I deeply enjoy the fact that the dlc is just skins and not a pay to win mechanic at the time of writing this. I will say the replayability drops significantly after a few goes. It's incredibly better with friends. I do wish there was a campaign mode or something like that where you have to catch footage and proof before the fight and capture encounter, possibly taking a much more drawn out way to experience and capture the beast. Something more akin to a Monster Quest episode or a show on discovery that ends with the showdown. I still love the game and plan on playing and watching for the new content to come. It has truly been a labor of love for the devs and I hope they continue to pour into this great game.
Date 2022-01-01 Playtime 33h 54m Rec Positive Great game. Love the challenge. But, it would be nice for there to be an actual hiding mechanic. Play a little more passively and suspenseful.  especially if you wanted to in by just finding the evidence.

Date 2021-12-31 Playtime 1h 47m Rec Negative This is the kind of game that you buy with your friends on a whim and play for a few hours. The novelty/horror fades after the first 30 minutes, and after that, there isn't very much to go off of. The graphics are nice, the lighting is decent, but the game is ultimately like a cake made entirely of icing. After you learn what's happening, the game gets repetitive and boring; balancing issues and a general sense of aimless don't really help.  I might pick this up again if it goes on sale for $5, but anything more than that is seriously pushing it.

Date 2021-12-31 Playtime 11h 21m Rec Positive Bigfoot, also commonly referred to as Sasquatch, is a purported ape-like creature said to inhabit the forests of North America. Many dubious articles have been offered in attempts to prove the existence of Bigfoot, including anecdotal claims of visual observations as well as alleged video and audio recordings, photographs, and casts of large footprints.[2] Some are known or admitted hoaxes.[3] Bigfoot is an icon within the fringe subculture of cryptozoology and an enduring element of popular culture.[4][5]  The majority of mainstream scientists have historically discounted the existence of Bigfoot, considering it to be the result of a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax, rather than a living animal.[6][7] Folklorists trace the phenomenon of Bigfoot to a combination of factors and sources including the cultures of indigenous people across the continent, the European wild man figure, and folk tales among loggers, miners, trappers, and prospectors.[8] Wishful thinking, a cultural increase in environmental concerns, and overall societal awareness of the subject have been cited as additional factors.[9]  Other creatures of relatively similar descriptions are alleged to inhabit various regions throughout the world, such as the Skunk ape of the southeastern United States; the Almas, Yeren, and Yeti in Asia; and the Australian Yowie; all of which, like Bigfoot, are engrained in the cultures of their regions.[10]

La idea de ser acechado por pie grande en medio de un bosque por la noche y no saber en que momento te va a atacar es aterradora y te llena de adrenalina.  Solo agregaria los mapas restantes, y pondria de nuevo las balas rastreadoras, para darle un poco mas de sentido al juego, y le agregaria un respectivo Lore.

Date 2021-12-30 Playtime 16h 44m Rec Positive  I just got this game like about two days ago. It is actually the best Bigfoot game out there in my opinion. Sure there are only two maps SO FAR, but you can explore more learn more and soon once you grow into the game will start playing it until it has like 9 maps and new guns. BTW did u guys read that ITS EARLY ACCESS  SO SHUT UP ABOUT THIS HAS TO LITTLE DEVS ARE PRESSURED WITH DEVELOPING. would recommend this game :D

Date 2021-12-29 Playtime 13h 8m Rec Positive First off, this game is great. Definitely a blast with friends and even alone if you're brave enough. It's difficult as hell, even on the easiest settings. Bigfoot is an absolute unit who acts like he's in a Shonen anime when he's getting shot at. The graphics, and environment are pretty gorgeous and relaxing during the day, but then give you Slender vibes when the night hits. Gives you a lot of spooky moments (with some jump scares). To add to the difficulty, there are "tasks" that you can try to accomplish while hunting Bigfoot, mainly revolving around finding and photographing evidence (i.e tracks, tree scratches, and dead bodies). However, the RNG can really affect if you complete them or not. I played this with one other person, and most times we could not complete all the tasks because either not enough scratches or tracks spawned or they were simply too difficult to find. And it's difficult to stay alive long enough to look for them figuring you start to typically run out of supplies by the 6th - 7th night. Lastly, I know there is now a mode which allows you to play as Bigfoot, however, I never got to experience it, so I wont make any comment on it. Overall, I definitely recommend. As even though its hard as hell, it's still mindless laughter and terror nonetheless.

Date 2021-12-28 Playtime 38h 25m Rec Positive As someone who has played COTW, I've always wanted a hunting sim with horror elements (and this gets really close!)  Why is BIGFOOT worth it? 1. Simple and enjoyable core gameplay + big brain play potential in PVP both as hunters and as Bigfoot. 2. Going in blind against the AI on the first night scratches that horror hunting sim itch. 3. Being able to play as Bigfoot and play with 4 of your friends (5 players.) 4. Biggest glow up in steam history IMO (look at any YouTube vid on this back in 2018 for context.) 5. Ridiculously easy rare achievements (currently.)  Some things to take note (Pro/Con depending on taste): 1. After a few matches the game becomes more action than horror. (But PVP is always intense when you are the one being hunted as either the hunters at night or Bigfoot during the day.) 2. Maps are not random, but are nice to look at and play well. 3. PVP can be tough even on hunter advantage with less than 3 hunters. 4. Mostly recommended for playing with friends. 5. Bigfoot has some pretty OP attacks that you can't avoid (You will obviously like this feature when playing as Bigfoot.)  Some things this game still needs: 1. Make it clearer to new players on how to revive teammates and add the ritual site as a marked location. 2. Be able to sprint when carrying dead teammates. 3. More comms support or a ping system especially for when playing with randoms.

Date 2021-12-27 Playtime 6h 6m Rec Negative While I love the feel of this game and the core could be very fun, the big foot AI is just too powerful, there isn't enough resources on the map at max loot to kill him not because there is not ammo, not at all but there isn't enough traps, flares, or heals to withstand Bigfoot's assault if I set it to min difficultly then I shouldn't have to play near perfectly to even get close to winning. overall I am sadden by as I said I love the idea of this game but at the moment I can't recommend this game
Date 2021-12-27 Playtime 10h 9m Rec Negative needs update: bigfoot to strong at minimum difficulty, Not even close to enough loot at max and bigfoot always knows where you are, He is too aggressive at night and heals  too much during the day. Hope its updated in the future but similar to the rake game doesn't seem like it will be.

Date 2021-12-25 Playtime 1h 42m Rec Negative 明明界面上有简体中文 但是却调不出来 你说气不气人  玩了几把  一局花费的时间堪比绝地求生或者是LOL 在那么大一个地图上找一个人如同大海捞针，我可没这个耐心。如果时间不充裕建议不要玩。而且没玩明白究竟是人类追杀大脚怪  还是大脚怪追杀人类？  游戏难度取决于玩家数量所以说没人玩就要1vs1？      It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack, or LOL, but it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack on a map that size, i don’t have that kind of patience. Don’t play if you don’t have time. And I don’t know if it’s humans hunting bigfoot, or bigfoot hunting humans? The game depends on the number of players, so 1vs1 if no one plays?

Date 2021-12-24 Playtime 49h 57m Rec Positive Hallo, liebe Bigfoot-Gemeinde. Dieses Spiel hatte ich mir geholt, um den Realismus von diesem Videospiel unter die Lupe zu nehmen. Ich habe mich anderen Bigfoot Fans angeschlossen, um als Gruppe nach Sasquatch zu suchen. Darf ich vorstellen? 1. Robert Carlier, unter der Woche kämpft er als Polizist gegen Verbrecher, in seiner Freizeit jagt er Bigfoot. Seit 10 Jahren hat er immer wieder mal Begegnungen mit ihm, und gibt bei während der Tour seine Erfahrungen weiter und ist zudem noch der Gastgeber des Bigfoot Wochenendes. 2. Matt Moneymaker,  ihm ist es sehr wichtig, dass das Beweismaterial an Wissenschaftlern weitergegeben wird. Er stand einst einem Bigfoot gegenüber, wir hatten noch etwas Bigfoot Hunter Training mit ihm ausgeübt. Laut Matt schlägt ein Bigfoot gegen Bäume um so mit anderen Bigfoots zu kommunizieren. Sein Plan war es, dieses Geräusch mit seinem persönlichen Bigfoot Anlock Baseballschläger zu imitieren. Sasquatches machen ein lautes schweres BAM! Das wars, das machten wir auch und lauschten eine Weile. Wir warteten nach dem ersten Schlag, nach ungefähr 5 Minuten können wir es nochmal probieren. Wir übten den Bigfoot Schrei, wo die  Dauer des Tons viel wichtiger als die Höhe des Tons war. Der Schrei sollte so anschwellen wie einer Sirene. Das wichtigste war es, den Ton lange zu halten. Die vierte Person hatte nichts beigetragen, wobei ich ihn nicht zu erwähnen brauche. In der Nacht begann eine einmalige Jagd. Wir spazierten etwas, als wir dann etwas rascheln hörten waren wir sofort in Alarmbereitschaft. Wir schrien den Bigfoot Schrei, und machten ein lautes BAM! Ich dachte kurzweilig, ob es nicht doch nur ein Puma oder eine Schlange wäre. Aber dann.... Ein ungefähr 2,50 Meter großes 320 Kilo schweres zweibeiniges Tier. Wir feuerten augenblicklich unsere Handfeuerwaffen auf das Wesen. Es gab unmenschliche Schreie von sich, so wie zuvor gelernt. Es verlor sein Gleichgewicht und wurde somit den Erdboden gleich gemacht. Wir inspizierten das Wesen ob es wirklich Bigfoot war, was alles exakt so wie beschrieben stimmte. Es war Bigfoot! Wir legten unsere Handfeuerwaffen ab und tanzten einen Freudentanz bis 4 Uhr Morgens um das Lagerfeuer herum. Am nächsten Tag habe ich alle Videobeweise zusammengelegt und bin schnellstmöglich verschwunden.  Fazit: Gefährlich, aber für echte Bigfoot Fans ist es echt Klasse!

Date 2021-12-24 Playtime 75h 11m Rec Positive This game is very fun. It has about 10 hours of game play that you can play again and again. I personally find the replay-ability, and making fun of Bigfoot my favourite part of the game.  I would only recommend buying if you have at least 1 friend who already owns the game, the new graphics is version 4.0 are very stunning when compared to the graphics in version 3.0. The safes that you have to find a code to unlock adds a new level of difficulty, and makes the game a lot more fun in my eyes.  The traps that the devs added in the 4.0 update add to the level of stress while you're on low hp with 1 medkit left, and they make the game overall more fun to have to avoid, and with the update where you can lower the damage you take from them by pressing a key that is shown of the screen is very fun. If you are a fan of hunting games, or a game like Friday the 13th, i'd recommend buying this game.

Date 2021-12-24 Playtime 35h 16m Rec Positive fun
Date 2021-12-24 Playtime 3h 1m Rec Negative tried so hard to enjoy this but the bigfoot ai is just terrible. there's absolutely no point hiding because no matter what you do in the day time big foot attacks you over and over at night until you die or get stuck in a wall. played with two other people and we tried multiple games with different bigfoot health amounts / item drops but no matter what we were constantly dying and didn't even come close to killing bigfoot. not fun at all when you realize how simple bigfoots ai is
Date 2021-12-24 Playtime 32h 37m Rec Positive [h1] First Impressions [/h1] It really did take my breath away   All that I do hope is that they keep updating it, we just got it for the Holidays and we are having so much fun. Please keep up the work Devs. [b] Love the game! [/b]  This game was truly something different and something that I was looking for! The game felt professional and complete. I major downside of this game is that Bigfoot's AI doesn't contain any stalkish behaviors. He just charges at you during the night at all through the night leaving you at -50% health every night unless you have flare guns or a zipline. Even that you wont last long. The guns dont do a ton of damage to him, and to my horror, he takes bullets to the face without any hesitation.   - Would this game be worth it to buy? Yes, this game can be played with friends or without them!

Actually awful.  - Terrible Bigfoot AI  - Terrible gun play and hit registration  - Weapons deal too little damage  - Character bonuses are negligible at best  - Loads of bugs and glitches  - DLC SKINS???? SERIOUSLY? You have next to no content or substance and you're releasing skins as paid DLC? Pathetic.  - Awful sound design  Easily one of the worst games I've ever played. It should not be getting the praise that it is.   And NO, the small dev team does not excuse them from these issues.  This game actually fucking sucks.
Date 2021-12-24 Playtime 17h 0m Rec Positive Its fun and good
Date 2021-12-24 Playtime 29h 32m Rec Positive I love this game but like all others it does have some issues.  Pros: 1: Very enjoyable to play with friends as well as playing alone. 2: Beautiful maps. 3: Fun combat systems. 4: Fun movement systems. 5: Peaceful game during the day, I would even go as far to say that if you played and liked the game Firewatch, then you would like this game. 6: Cool animations for Bigfoot attacks and Hunter window/fence vaulting. 7: Evidence gathering is engaging and not boring. 8: Ziplines are awesome. 9: Cool characters, each one having different perks.  Cons: 1: A couple bugs but none really game-breaking. 2: Save system is broken mostly with the evidence, sometimes doesn't save evidence, allows you to take multiple pictures of the same body, allows you to retake pictures of scratched trees and footprints, etc. 3: sometimes if you vault a fence that is clipping into the ground it will clip YOU under the ground. 4: Bigfoot AI is kinda predictable.  Opinions: 1: Totems seem useful but I haven't had to use them yet and honestly in my opinion I think they should be removed as they don't really fit into the game very well. 2: Safes are cool but WAY too predictable, I would like it if there was more RNG (Random Number Generator) involved but again, my opinion. 3: Bodies should have more clues involved as well as a heavy dose of RNG. 4: Overall, I feel the game should just have a lot more RNG implemented. I think that it would give the game more replay value and more of an urge to explore the map. 5: I think it would be cool if you are on a team that you could resuscitate downed teammates without a medkit, and instead of it happening instantly it would take a couple of seconds for balance sake.  Like I said though, I love this game in it's current state and cant wait to see the upcoming content the devs add.

Date 2021-12-24 Playtime 2h 52m Rec Negative The game is awesome but it takes forever to find bigfoot or him to find you. Then you spend an hour investigating and doing stuff to complete side missions.Finally you find him and he has like 957 health so your stuck there blasting him as he kills you. He eventually takes off and then spends another 20 minutes running around the map healing. Then he comes back and mops you and your team no problem. The AI needs an update because it sucks.

Date 2021-12-22 Playtime 33h 57m Rec Positive If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie  Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Date 2021-12-21 Playtime 16h 26m Rec Positive This game is incredible! I have only played this for about 10 hours but this game is super fun! It is really neat getting to explore the world and uncover all the secrets and the loose storyline. I love how you can play as Bigfoot and the co-op is great. It is fun when Bigfoot runs up and starts attacking because it happens so fast and you never really expect it! My main criticism of this game is how the map never changes and the limited number of maps. I am aware that Cyberlight GS is working on new maps and stuff, but it would be nice to have a few more to play through.  TL;DR: This game is great and I totally recommend it!

Date 2021-12-20 Playtime 16h 58m Rec Positive Such a great game, worth every penny, it just needs some optimization. And maybe make bigfoot a bit more natural, onother thing that i want improvement on is sound, especialy steps, great game over all, verry funny with friends, 10/10

Ich kann mich im Spiel NICHT umschauen (Maus funktioniert einwandfrei im Menü, im Spiel selber gar nicht)! Auch nach mehrmaligem deinstallieren und wieder neu installieren, funktioniert es nicht!(Treiber etc alle aktuell)  Wenn ich eine Lobby für Kollegen erstellen möchte, bleibt es im Ladebildschirm hängen... und lädt und lädt und lädt...  Ich warte nun noch auf Antwort vom Support, was aber wahrscheinlich lange dauern wird.  Vllt hat ja jemand das gleiche Problem und kann mir berichten, ob und wie es zu beheben ist.  Für mich leider verschwendetes Geld.

Date 2021-12-20 Playtime 5h 46m Rec Negative This game was released 5 years ago. I don't know what it started as, however, in 5 years of development I would expect a lot more from it. It is fun to play through one and kill big foot, but it gives you such an anti-climatic ending, leaving a kinda sour taste. I think the game had great potential, however, I think its a waste of money if you expect it to become anything better, and at the price point it's at, I would go spend it else were, as you can expect a solid 2 hours of gameplay.

Date 2021-12-18 Playtime 27h 3m Rec Positive Бигфут игра в который вы являетесь охотником и занимаетесь расследованием проишевствеем в заповеднике, там пропали туристы а в лесу слышен рёв.   ПЛЮСЫ -крутой коператив -хорошая атмосфера -реально умный бигфут -много пушек -чувство леса и охоты -хорошие и смешные воспоминания (из коператива) я собственно только в коператив и играл с другом   МИНУСЫ -слишком уш требовательно к железу  МОЁ МНЕНИЕ игра очень хорошая и стоит своих денег  но играть в основном только на минималках  P.S.  Игра заблокирована в России. Поэтому к игре и к компании отношение испортилось.

Date 2021-12-18 Playtime 4h 29m Rec Negative Versus AI this game is horribly balanced and the game is riddled with major bugs. I'll put it this way, I've had way more animals clip into me or buildings and kill me than I have in any other game. The game is not new or casual player friendly nor is the community. Many (but not all) people who play it are all kinds of toxic and elitist over the mechanics.  This game the loot system is made for single player, period, even if you max out the loot in settings you still won't have enough for 2 - 4 players and won't be able to get past night 5 for most casual / new players. Medkits are the biggest area where you simply don't have enough. This could be fixed with scaling to player count and mod support. But there was more guns when you started which worked for more players, the devs changed that apparently. Yet all these fabulous youtubers don't warn anyone of this when playing the game and makes the game seem more balanced than it really is.  The health and damage system for the AI however is more multiplayer balanced, as a single player you get destroyed so easily. You NEED the extra constant damage from other players to make a dent even if you set this to the lowest possible. Again scaling and / or mod support could fix this. Bigfoot is insanely fast and aiming and shooting way too slow in comparison for most guns. The game has been in development since 2017, it USED to start with more guns on multiplayer which WAS more balanced. I expected better from a game so hyped up. I don't think this game is worth its hype nor does it live up to its reputation.  So no I would not recommend this game,I wish I hadn't bought this through a retailer rather than steam for the couple dollars cheaper. I wish I could get my money back because this was not worth my money or my time. Its an utter disappointment and is just a rage game. -10/10

Date 2021-12-16 Playtime 3h 39m Rec Positive Game is definitely on the right track. Some things to note:  There NEEDS to be a way to play Bigfoot vs 4 AI. Call this a safety measure. Some people have that intimidation factor like in DBD when they don't want to try killer and get clapped immediately. This game needs a way to have you be able to play as Bigfoot and play against AI, it would also help make the game last and be more fun for longer. Also the guns. You can go the whole time and still only have the regular rifle and handgun. A real issue if you're trying to play with any more than two people.  Bigfoot itself needs to have that energy thing reworked or looked at. It takes so long for any of it to recharge and takes 15 or so to even break one single door down. The amount of damage Bigfoot needs to do to a person is crazy high, couple that with the severe lack of energy and you could have a game last 2 hours.  Fun game, I'm excited to see where it goes.

Date 2021-12-16 Playtime 196h 55m Rec Positive This game for its state in development is quite good, its fairly replay-able when fighting player controlled bigfoots but the ai can get boring due to predictability. The current version is lacking the spookiness of previous versions which is my biggest gripe. Would recomend.

Date 2021-12-16 Playtime 17h 58m Rec Positive This game has honestly given me a few good scares. But if i am to be quiet honest, I do honestly enjoy the original version a little more than the newer ones, but both are still amazingly good and both give you good scares and both have amazingly good graphics, even if you have all of your graphic settings really low.
Date 2021-12-16 Playtime 14h 17m Rec Positive Fun game, easy to pick up and understand. Great game to jump into with a friends, best case will be the entire game full of friends. There are public games, but if you play solo with others, it will go MOST likely play out:  - Game will start - The other players will sprint into the RV and grab every single weapon as fast as possible, majority of the time they don't even notice / bother to grab the ammo. Grabbing 2-5 guns trying to be all Call of Duty. - Call of Duty(s) will then walk blindly into the woods in the pitch black with a flashlight on,most of the time in a full speed sprint - Bigfoot will yell - 50/50 You will get attacked alone unarmed by bigfoot if you didn't sprint after Call of Duty -or- You will hear distant gunshots followed by Call of Duty will start  typing in chat something along the lines "He is here" or "HELP HES CHASING ME AND I'M DYING" meanwhile they took every single line of defense and med kit.  - Then Call of Duty will start to repeat in chat "HELP IM DOWN" or "Need heal" until they die and rage quit - Bigfoot then breaks all of your legs with 900 HP left  Lesson being, unless you want the following, play with friends, otherwise I promise you this will play out exactly like above every ******* time. Working together and communication is key...

Date 2021-12-15 Playtime 5h 13m Rec Negative bigfoot can be good but it has a sever lack of content or objectives that this game quickly gets boring after an hour, there has been countless times where me and my friend have explored the map and found nothing or more of the same, the encounters with bigfoot are fun but only last a minute at best and you have to wait a good while for him to appear again, overall bigfoot has alot of potential but its missing alot of features to keep me interested while playing
Date 2021-12-15 Playtime 82h 57m Rec Positive Great game, especially with friends. Super fun to hunt Bigfoot with another friend or a group of 4, and if you have 5 you could all switch being Bigfoot. You've got some good friends and a couple of hours then I highly recommend this game.

Date 2021-12-13 Playtime 13h 22m Rec Positive I really like the game. I dont know if developers will read this or not but there is a glitch in the snow map, bigfoot cant go through porches so it runs out of the house to get the person, also it locks on to just 1 person and doesnt change the lock until that person is down, together with the porch exploit all you do is jump back and forth while everyone else shoots him in comfort. It would be nice if you could fix the porch mechanics or at least the lock mechanics.

Date 2021-12-10 Playtime 11h 21m Rec Positive Bigfoot is a unique survival horror game that pits players against the legendary creature in an atmospheric and tension-filled setting. Developed by CyberLight Game Studio, it offers a blend of exploration, strategy, and horror elements that can be both thrilling and frustrating.  Gameplay and Mechanics: 7/10 The gameplay in Bigfoot revolves around tracking and hunting the elusive creature while managing resources and survival elements. Players must set traps, use surveillance cameras, and explore the wilderness to gather clues and track down Bigfoot. The mechanics are straightforward but effective, providing a sense of urgency and danger as you never know when Bigfoot will strike. However, the game can feel repetitive after a while, as the core loop doesn’t change much once you’ve mastered the basics.  Atmosphere and Setting: 8/10 The game excels in creating a tense and immersive atmosphere. The dense forests, eerie sound effects, and dynamic weather contribute to a sense of dread and anticipation. The setting is convincingly crafted, making players feel genuinely isolated and vulnerable as they navigate the wilderness. This atmospheric design is one of the game’s strongest points, keeping players on edge throughout their hunt.  Graphics and Visuals: 6/10 Visually, Bigfoot is a mixed bag. The environments are well-designed and atmospheric, but the character models and animations can be a bit lacking in detail and polish. The graphics are functional and contribute to the overall mood, but they may not impress players used to higher-end visuals. Improvements in texture quality and animation fluidity would enhance the immersion and overall presentation.  Sound and Music: 7/10 The sound design in Bigfoot is effective in building tension. The ambient noises, such as rustling leaves, distant animal calls, and the occasional growl of Bigfoot, create an unsettling backdrop for the game. The music is sparse but used effectively to heighten moments of suspense and danger. The audio cues play a crucial role in alerting players to Bigfoot’s presence, adding to the game’s immersive quality.  Replayability and Content: 6/10 Bigfoot offers a decent amount of replayability, particularly when played with friends. The cooperative multiplayer mode enhances the experience, as players can strategize and work together to take down the creature. However, the game’s content can feel limited, with the core objectives remaining the same across playthroughs. Adding more varied objectives, environments, and Bigfoot behaviors would significantly boost replay value.  Multiplayer Experience: 7/10 Playing Bigfoot with friends is where the game truly shines. The cooperative gameplay adds a layer of strategy and excitement, as players can coordinate their efforts and cover more ground. The shared tension and moments of surprise make for memorable experiences, and the game is considerably more enjoyable when played in a group. Solo play can be engaging, but it lacks the dynamic interactions that multiplayer offers.  Conclusion: Bigfoot is a solid survival horror game that delivers a unique and atmospheric experience, especially when played with friends. Its tension-filled setting, effective sound design, and cooperative gameplay are highlights, though the game’s repetitiveness and graphical limitations hold it back from being truly great. Despite its flaws, Bigfoot offers a thrilling hunt that can be enjoyed by fans of the genre looking for something different.  Score: 67/100

Date 2021-12-08 Playtime 1h 39m Rec Negative Leider sprießen Spiele wie  Bigfoot gerade aus allen Löchern!  Es ist im Prinzip überall das gleiche langweilige Prinzip bei schwacher Grafik!  Ich spielte dieses Spiel mit 3 Freunden und hier meine Cons, weshalb wir alle den Refund genutzt haben:  - Schlechte Grafik - Keine Abwechslung, alles ist immer an der selben Stelle zu finden - Bigfoot hat viel zu viel Energy! - Bigfoot ist viel zu schnell, ihn zu treffen hat mehr etwas mit Glück zu tun (Mein größter Kritikpunkt) - Munition ist rar... SUPERRAR! - Bärenfallen schön und gut... Fleisch braucht man nicht, er läuft auch so rein... - Shotgun machte 18 (?!) Schaden und das bei über 2000 HP - Viel Spaß beim ausrechnen, wie viele Treffer notwendig sind. Und ich spreche von TREFFERN, was ja schon schwierig genug ist. - Wozu Kameras und die Drohne, wenn er sowieso jede Nacht angreift? Viel zu umständlich und überflüssig! - Die "Sidequests" sind ein schlechter Witz! - Die "Buffs", die die Charaktere haben sind witzlos   Nachdem wir dann allen ernstes den Bigfoot getötet haben, was fast eine Stunde gedauert hat, habe wir gerade mal 25% des Skill-Levels füllen können??? Ich investiere sicher keine 4 Stunden (Vorausgesetzt man tötet den Bigfoot jedesmal) für EIN lächerlichen Level-Up, ohne zu wissen was der dann bringt?  Keine Empfehlung!

Hoping the game will get better as they build.  Have not killed Bigfoot yet, not legit anyways.  Some Glitches in game Bigfoot gets stuck and you can take him down if you have enough ammo.  To make it more fun give the player a better chance more med packs and Bigfoot does not take enough damage when you hit him with good vital shot.  I am not the best gamer when it comes to knowing what to do. But i would really like to try co-op

Date 2021-12-03 Playtime 1h 19m Rec Negative [b]Man I want to love it.[/b] A horror game about Bigfoot whats not to love? Well right now quite a bit actually. [i]Full disclosure I got a refund on this game and may revisit it down the road but below is my experience thus far.[/i]  [b]Bottom line[/b]: For early access its not too bad. It has potential, but I don't buy potential I buy a product especially in the gaming industry. In its current state I would be okay forking over $10-12 for it. Wait till it goes on sale if you really want it. Keep reading for a more in depth break down.  Essentially BIGFOOT is an objective driven survival looter/shooter. Think Predator: Hunting Grounds. Ironically, similar to the release of Predator this game suffers online matchmaking issues. This may change in the future but it was difficult to find open public games to join. I assume this is easily bypassed if you want to play in a private lobby with friends.  I love the idea of being in the woods and hunting/being hunted by Bigfoot. In its current execution however the I believe that for most players it will lose the novel mystique after a few runs devolving into a meta-driven 1v4 team death match with complete disregard to the horror theme.     One thing that would make it more eerie in my opinion is procedural maps. There are currently two maps of a medium size and it would be very easy to learn where all the structures/loot spots are. If I were the devs and knew anything about game design I would try to implement some kind of procedural map system thereby always keeping the player in a perpetual state of unfamiliarity/playing more into the horror genre. Imagine loading up a game and never knowing where loot/easily defensible areas are. Just my two cents.   Graphics: Nothing to write home about. Character customization: N/A prefab characters Atmosphere: Spooky but could see it getting mundane rather quickly Bugs: nothing experienced thus far     
Date 2021-12-03 Playtime 2h 48m Rec Negative -Dumb fun with friends -Game breaking bugs (glitched through ground) -Doesn't take itself too seriously (Bigfoot picks up a guitar as a weapon) -Not discernible way to kill Bigfoot -Nice graphics -Lots of flexibility with what you can do -Zones should respawn health packs, and if they do it should be at a faster rate
Date 2021-12-03 Playtime 7h 3m Rec Positive Unexpectedly fun game, especially with friends. It does not seem like it has a lot of content though and it gets very tedious once you are waiting for the night to come. Do I recommend this game? for a one time-thing, yes.

Date 2021-12-01 Playtime 8h 37m Rec Positive GAME IS THE TITS
Date 2021-12-01 Playtime 31h 48m Rec Positive The game is a cool concept, executed pretty well in my opinion. And it's a blast with friends. You can play as a hunter or bigfoot, and playing with a group of hunters is really fun. (especially when you split up and die like what happened to me) And it can be easy to be caught off guard, so teamwork is really nice to have. Solo is hard but can still be fun, although the game's design is much more aimed towards multiplayer.  At the time of writing this review, there's 2 maps, and more to come. I think the devs really nailed the atmosphere of the current maps, it feels tense and I would find myself questioning if I saw something and what was it.  The game mechanics are good, and you get rewarded for exploring. (especially if you can open safes you find around the maps) As for Bigfoot himself... he has A LOT of health, even on the lowest difficulty. It's fun to play as bigfoot since it's a completely different play-style.   There's only one bug I encountered that didn't let me open the esc menu, forcing me to alt-F4 every time I wanted to close the game or adjust my settings, but I was able to fix it using the game's steam discussions. It's early access so that's kind of to be expected.  For an early access game though, it does have a pretty good and well-crafted experience to offer, and if you have friends it's definitely worth checking out.
Date 2021-12-01 Playtime 11h 41m Rec Positive [strike]Before Update 4.0, [i]Bigfoot[/i] was a mediocre horror co-op game lacking any real depth or immersion. [b]After[/b] the update, suddenly it's a whole fucking new game. Playing this game with friends is the real S-tier experience, and with a group of five you can play versus against a player-controlled bigfoot. Choose characters, explore the map, find loot and bag a sasquatch; a great game to have some fun with on a Friday night with the boys. Personally however, I found the gameplay loop loses its charm after a couple of playthroughs, becoming repetitive and monotonous. Right now I'm waiting for more content to be released, and I'll be sure to hop back on the wagon. Excellent job, [i]Bigfoot[/i].[/strike]   Recently played the game again after several updates and now Bigfoot is practically nowhere to be seen - he jumps out of a bush every 45 minutes to yell at you before completely disappearing into the wilderness forever. I understand the studio behind this game is working under some unfavourable conditions, but [i]Bigfoot[/i] is nigh unplayable now. Save your money until the game is fixed.
Date 2021-12-01 Playtime 4h 23m Rec Positive i like it very much
Date 2021-12-01 Playtime 2h 44m Rec Negative Just another indie game running on the UE4 engine with a streamer bait premise that will never be built upon creatively and has zero chance of ever being completed.
Date 2021-12-01 Playtime 9h 50m Rec Negative  Bigfoot is the most polished contentless  game on Steam.  there is so much potential here That it hurts how bad it is. there are two parts to this game. You can loot and you can shoot Bigfoot. That's it. The camera system is really cool and you can see cameras from across the map. It even gives you a notification if one of the camera senses motion so you can see where Bigfoot is. I'm going to list the flaws in this game. there is no crafting, no Base building, The leveling system is terrible, and there really isn't anything to work towards. I had fun with my friend for probably the first two hours of playing this game. Bigfoot has so much health compared to the amount of ammo you can find. I have yet to find the assault rifle but I found myself wanting to get off the game after about 2 hours. the frame rate and optimization is wonderful. so you can experience boredom at 144 frames per second.  there is no way to avoid Bigfoot- he knows where you are at all times. Me and my buddy tried to turn out all the lights in a building and crouched all night but he ended up finding us either way. Bigfoot will chase you down if you try to run and it seems he has to get a certain amount of damage in on you in order for him to run away again. Add a crafting system, base building, or a turret system and I will change my review to recommended.

Date 2021-12-01 Playtime 16h 0m Rec Positive Okay so after following this game for years and then finally purchasing it after several of the major updates I was excited to experience it myself and with "friends". which is literally the only way to really enjoy this game.. Not such a bad caveat except, you will hardly ever get into an open game. If you do, forget cooperation. that's if you ever find an open game that ever even kicks off. which leads me to my only major gripe with this game atm. It feels like 89% OF ALL OPEN ONLINE GAMES DIE WAITING FOREVER FOR THAT 4TH OR 5TH PLAYER(pvp) TO START! Because this game although is playable by yourself. Does not work until it has 4 to 5 players (depending on the match type) in an online match. Now given its not huge like COD or your BF's there not that many people playing online. So perhaps just let people play online with 2-4/5 players and adjust the difficulty. That way, we can actually play online without it having to be private. Because after all, I bought it. I'd at least like to play online without waiting 25mins minimum for ONLY 4/5 people to join. Thanks now, bye bye then.

Date 2021-11-30 Playtime 16h 59m Rec Positive "Bigfoot" to gra, która przenosi graczy w odległe i niezwykłe miejsca, gdzie będą próbowali odnaleźć legendarnego Bigfoota, tajemniczą istotę przypominającą Yeti. To gra, która oferuje mieszankę eksploracji, łowienia dowodów i walki z potworem, tworząc niesamowite i pełne napięcia doświadczenie.  Jednym z głównych aspektów "Bigfoot" jest jego otwarty świat, który jest wypełniony różnymi miejscami do eksploracji i zadaniom do wykonania. Gracze muszą zbierać dowody, takie jak ślady, odchody, zdjęcia i dźwięki, aby zbadać obecność Bigfoota w okolicy. To zadanie wymaga uwagi i cierpliwości, ponieważ potwór jest biegły w unikaniu ludzi.  Gra oferuje również elementy walki z Bigfootem, co sprawia, że jest pełna napięcia. Potwór jest niebezpieczny i potrafi zaatakować, co wymusza na graczach strategię i taktykę, aby go pokonać.  Oprawa audiowizualna "Bigfoot" tworzy atmosferę tajemnicy i grozy. Mroczne lasy, niesamowite efekty dźwiękowe i realistyczny model postaci Bigfoota tworzą niesamowitą atmosferę.  Gra oferuje także tryb wieloosobowy, dzięki czemu możesz szukać Bigfoota razem z przyjaciółmi, co dodaje jeszcze więcej emocji i współpracy.  Podsumowując, "Bigfoot" to gra, która oferuje mieszankę eksploracji, łowienia dowodów i walki z legendarnym potworem. To tytuł, który dostarcza napięcia i tajemnicy, a jednocześnie zachęca do współpracy z innymi graczami. Jeśli jesteś fanem gier przygodowych i lubisz rozwiązywać zagadki, to "Bigfoot" może być dla ciebie interesującym wyborem.

Date 2021-11-30 Playtime 3h 48m Rec Negative Where do I even start?  This is basically dead by Daylight, icons for abilities and all. Even with bigfoot having the lowest HP possible, he has about 1500 hp and each bullet will reduce his health by about 20 depending on the weapon. A knife hit will do about 3. Completely and totally unloading on him will do basically nothing and he doesn't react to it at all. The AI itself is so idiotic that you can constantly vault over a fence and allow your friends to freely hit him until he runs away in the morning. He's not actually capable of de-aggroing on a player so if you don't exploit this, bigfoot will instantly know where you are and rush you the second nightfall starts.  The PVP is worse. Even at the lowest HP, bigfoot has 1000 health. If he finds you, you're dead. The only chance you have is if you still have flares and can blind the player for 10 seconds and hide. If that player doesn't, thats it. You're dead. There's no enforcement of day/night for the player so you can just murder any player you find with no repercussions because you can tank any gun forever.   Finding enough evidence to escape is a nightmare. There's only one camera so only one player can actually take pictures. I don't know if it's a bug, but if that player dies, you can't recover the camera, so the only win condition you have available is to kill bigfoot, which as previously stated, is so ridiculously difficult to do because of health/bullet damage it's almost an impossible task.  Overall, you might have fun for a couple hours with your friends, but you're not going to be levelling characters, that's for sure.

Date 2021-11-29 Playtime 9h 37m Rec Positive Good game, lot of love and care for it.
Date 2021-11-29 Playtime 152h 7m Rec Positive As someone who has played this game enough to the point that I've gotten the feel for it, I can say that this game is quite possibly underrated. Sure, Markiplier and other popular YouTubers have made videos on this game before, but if you were to actually look at the majority of people who play the game, most are only level 1 and they don't end up liking the game. There are a multitude of players I have seen get very annoyed with the game for Bigfoot taking too long to attack, Bigfoot being too OP, this game's too slow, etc.. And those are all true, but that doesn't mean the game has bad gameplay. I understand why some players may not be able to handle the slower gameplay, as on average AI rounds take about 30 minutes, but I've gotten rounds to over an hour before too. And with the real player matches they still take some time, but as long as the Bigfoot is open to attacking a lot, it won't need as much due to the fact that no delay is needed, and the more inaccurate play. This game is quite honestly a bit underrated. Most lobbies are filled with completely new players, and most don't stay. For crying at out, the most common global achievement (and one that's super easy to get), has only about 18.3% of players who have unlocked it. But as someone who has stuck with this game, I truly believe it is good. It's fun to play, especially with the new AI reworks, and it's very well organized. The only real problem I have with the game is that there are a lot of exploits with the AI. Like in Cedar Grove Lodge (dynamite lodge in Redwood Park), if you go into the corner of the bed and stay in the middle of that area, Bigfoot will get stuck behind the furnace and you can shoot him. The only way he can hit you is by using ram run. There are actually a few in that spot. There's also one in the only other map as of now, Winter Park. At the zip-line near the High Mountain Lodge and the Hunting Tower, If you go up onto that highland where it is, Bigfoot can't target you. That said, this game is very good overall.

Date 2021-11-29 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive I've been playing this game with my friends ever since it first came out. We've played since every major update, and it's been like a completely different game each update, and we all agree that this is the BEST Update so far. It's a shit ton of fun, and we can't wait to make our annual "New bigfoot update" video!

Date 2021-11-29 Playtime 22h 35m Rec Positive Bigfoot is very amazing and surpassed my expectations for an indie game. The graphics have a kinda comic book like vibe, especially the character models, and everything looks great. Fighting bigfoot is not too easy or too hard, its perfectly horrifying. Very fun with friends, as you have to rely on eachother during fights. The bigfoot AI when its not being controlled by a player is not half bad. He sets traps and can avoid cameras and things you place down. The subtle details are nice too, they put alot of effort into things such as animations for even small things, like reaching your hand out to fight when bigfoot grabs you, or instead of just taking fall damage, your character falls over and takes a few seconds to get up. Very nice, id say 9.5/10.   Graphics: 9/10  Gameplay: 9.9/10 Animations:9/10 Fun With Friends: 11/10 Horror: 7.5/10

Some dead body physics are weird, as well as the terrain in certain parts of the map are glitched (they're like see through and you walk through them). Other than that the updates in the past couple years were amazing!

Date 2021-11-28 Playtime 3h 36m Rec Positive Ich persönlich finde das spiel ganz cool, vor Allem wird hier von den Entwicklern auch immer noch mal ein kleines bisschen was dazu getan (Siehe Multiplayermodus wo man Bigfoot spielen kann neuerdings.)  Es ist nicht einfach den Bigfoot zu erlegen aber genau das macht es spielenswert, es ist eine Herausforderung, die man annehmen muss oder sein lässt :D
Date 2021-11-28 Playtime 7h 40m Rec Positive доброго времени суток.  напиши свой отзыв по поводу этой игры. взял её по скидке за ~ 450+ рублей и не пожалел. игра приятная на взгляд: графика не слишком мыльная. в техническом плане (fps) тоже не всё так плохо, с моей старой видеокартой AMD Radeon 7700 тянет в стабильные 30-45 fps.  в игре присутствует всего 2 карты: обычный лес и его зимний (изменённый) вариант. много функционала для игры с друзьями.  вообщем, поставлю ей 7/10 по причине немного количества карт и фишек за выживших. не плохой ремастеред игры "Рейк".

Date 2021-11-27 Playtime 22h 23m Rec Negative Finding Bigfoot is fun to play, but I love achievements and here is the problem. Some achievements are for maps that don´t exist and some are buggy as fuck :( The game is good, but I hate situations like this because it fucks up my general average. I give a thumb up when it´s fixed....  Finding Bigfoot macht Spaß, aber ich liebe Errungenschaften und da liegt das Problem. Manche sind für Maps, die nicht existieren und manche sind total verbuggt :( Das Spiel ist gut, aber ich hasse solche Situationen, denn dadurch zerstört es meinen allgemeinen Durchschnitt. Ich gebe einen Daumen hoch, wenn das gefixt wurde....

Date 2021-11-27 Playtime 5h 17m Rec Positive Très belle ambiance de jeu, avec de jolie graphismes
Date 2021-11-27 Playtime 17h 52m Rec Negative the game tries to be a hunting game but its just walking simulator with average graphics and occasional boss fights.  tracking him through the 6 cameras you are given provides literally nothing. using traps as intended (spreading them around the map and baiting them) does nothing (you have max 8 and they do 50 damage each.... against bigfoot who has 1000 hp?) combat is ass, hitscan is ass, the explosives are ass, hiding is ass, theres nothing good about this.  dont even get me started with the shitty "winning through evidence" bullshit because you have to go through every location and comb everything so finely that if you wanted to win with evidence its going to take you an hour minimum... in a round-based game??? if you miss an evidence you have to go back through everything so its like 1.5 hours so yeah its boring as shit.

Date 2021-11-25 Playtime 26h 24m Rec Positive the game is good but it would be better if bigfoot wouldn't go straight to u every night and would attack only when he is near u or would go to u if ur using the things that make sound (mega phone, radio, fireworks, ect). its fun with friends but u can find some fun on solo to. it would also be better if they made it where when u do all the task that u get a health boost or something to make doing all the task worth it. but the game is fun and really well made and can be scary at times   also why are the deers scarier than bigfoot

Intense and often frightening, not played with friends yet, but if I do, I will make another review, I would give this game 3/5  Good:  -Balanced day/night cycle -Bigfoot's health is balanced -Weapons are good -Map is large  Bad:  -Not as fun without friends! -Bigfoot can sometimes hit you from a fairly long distance -Can be tricky solo, as Bigfoot will non-stop attack you during night until day

Опишу свои пункты которые мне в игре не понравились: -Бигфут находит вас ночью вне зависимости от того прячетесь ли вы, стоите ли вы на одном месте в полной темноте и тишине, у него просто есть свой "радар" добычи по которому он вас "видит". (в режиме игры за бигфута можно понять как он работает) -нет режима уклонений от ударов йети, соответственно каждый раз перед ночью нужно запасаться минимумом аптечек чтоб залечить раны. Бой превращается в тупое закликивание мышки и беготни по полянке дабы хоть как то избежать прямых ударов бигфута. -лут ограниченый, поэтому если вы не успеваете за энное количество аптечек/взрывных устройств завалить йети - вы 100% труп. Причем количество патронов в игре достаточно большое, но это никак не влияет на результативность по вышеописанным минусам игры. Игра очень скучная, в ней нет ничего кроме как встреч с йети. Купил ради кооператива с другом, но суть кооператива лишь в увеличении огневой мощи, что тоже мало как влияет на способ прохождения! своих денег игра не стоит, пусть она даже и в разработке находится

Date 2021-11-24 Playtime 11h 41m Rec Positive Monke goes in my pp
Date 2021-11-24 Playtime 6h 22m Rec Positive I like this game. I also liked and disliked when I found a penthouse magazine before BigFoot 187'd me. My teammates found and killed the "hairy-palmed ape" as it was squatting in the bushes making "goofy, funny, and scary" sounds. BONUS: The magazine was recovered; however, it was covered with some sort of BigFoot lotion. Weird....
Date 2021-11-24 Playtime 6h 10m Rec Positive Awesome game. There are multiple glitches however where bigfoot will get glitched/stuck to random objects like logs. Other than that great game to play with friends
Date 2021-11-24 Playtime 13h 31m Rec Negative As it currently stands I wouldn't recommend this game. It has been in development for 4 years and 10 months at the time of writing this. That's a long time without an official release. The mechanics are buggy and the AI feels so primitive to fight against. He attacks all night and doesn't go away, then spends the whole day running and hiding form you. Bigfoot also sets traps  that you have to avoid. Only you can't avoid them. the traps are invisible until you trip them, then you get 0.5 seconds to activate a QTE or you get damaged.. The game punishes you for simply walking around and exploring. And now I see that this unfinished game has weapon skin packs available for purchase. Time and effort that could be put into completing the game is being used to push cosmetic DLC instead. This game is just not worth the money
Date 2021-11-24 Playtime 13h 34m Rec Positive 9/19/2022 Update:  They fixed Bigfoot! He no longer has a predictable AI. You don't really know where he is or when he is going to attack. It puts you on edge again and I love that.  The game is scary again.  That being said, traps are still invisible and I absolutely hate the quick-time events that go along with the invisible traps.  But I would recommend it now, seeing as how they listened to the community feedback.  ------------------------------------------------ Original Review:  This game has been in early access for nearly 5 years. It use to be terrifying but after the update it's just a walking simulator with a very predictable AI.  It's not scary anymore. Plus a ton of bugs have been introduced, big foot getting stuck in place or on roofs making for an easy kill. Weapon wheel not working, inventory going missing, etc. But the main reason I am not recommending this game is because they have started to add micro-transactions for gun skins - and the game isn't even finished.
Date 2021-11-24 Playtime 4h 47m Rec Positive Not entirely certain what any of the stats mean, after 7 days of hunting big foot he died in a trap in the most underwhelming way possible overall 10/10
Date 2021-11-24 Playtime 5h 10m Rec Positive the greatest shitpost ever
Date 2021-11-24 Playtime 3h 3m Rec Negative to long and has no story it is following
Date 2021-11-24 Playtime 21h 44m Rec Positive Game is really fun but only truly fun if you have friends or randoms with mics. This game is going to be a refund if you play this game by yourself so if you plan on getting it, IT'S a must to grab some friends along too.   Note that Bigfoot is plain out strong and if your alone you'll feel disheartened and mad as hell if you die but with friends it doesnt matter if you guys die or not. You laugh, you'll scream, you'll have fun with capturing Bigfoot as a reward bonus.  Bigfoot is really unique game and its because well it's thee Bigfoot and I hope this game grows further since Markiplier too has made a come back to his series so I hope this game grows up to be a amazing game.
Date 2021-11-24 Playtime 2h 33m Rec Negative Was interested but when I went to play I couldn't change items on my item wheel and couldn't switch my primary, secondary, or melee to anything else other than what I had picked up. Because of this i'm refunded it for now. Really like the look of it but it isn't user friendly it seems.   Edit: if you know how to swap weapons let me know I may have missed it.

Date 2021-11-23 Playtime 13h 9m Rec Negative If there was a middle option I would select that  In Bigfoot you go around the map, collect loot like guns, ammo, explosives and medkits and then when it turns night Bigfoot attacks you and you must fight him off. That’s literally it as far as core game play. You can use other gadgets like drones and cameras which have motion sensors on them, so you know when something is near them which is quite helpful but other than that its useless.  This is not a "Finding Bigfoot" game because that implies you are actively searching for Bigfoot. Instead, what happens is in the day you just wander round to different locations, collect loot and take pictures of evidence and then when the sun goes down you get rushed by Bigfoot. It does not matter how stealthy you are Bigfoot will always attack every night. Factors like noise and light level don’t seem to affect what Bigfoot does which is a real shame. You could be mag dumping your M4 into the sky or sitting in a bush doing nothing and Bigfoot will behave the same.   What this means is instead of "Finding Bigfoot" it’s a desperate race to get the loot needed to survive the next night. When you finally kill Bigfoot, the game just ends and your sent to the main menu. I remember in older versions Bigfoot was put in a cage after you "incapacitate" him, and you could freely explore the map and find evidence without being charged by him but that’s all gone now.  This is all coming from a single player perspective but from what I have read on the forums the multiplayer "Hunters vs human controlled Bigfoot" mode is impossible to win against a good Bigfoot player  TLDR: This is not a "finding Bigfoot" game its more getting loot and killing it. Bigfoot AI is very shallow and lacks intelligence. After you kill Bigfoot for the First time there is no real reason to return other than killing Bigfoot faster. Might be better with friends.

Date 2021-11-23 Playtime 13h 35m Rec Positive Team vs Player: Bigfoot is a little OP, even with all of the game settings in the survivors favor. Haven't played a full 4 survivors yet but I'd imagine its a little better, but with a 1v2, hes completely OP.  Team vs AI: Bigfoot is still kinda OP, we got his health down to 50% in a 1v3 on the easiest difficulty. It could just be that we suck literal dog balls but I severely doubt thats the only reason.   Overall its still a very fun game, it could just use some tune-ups and some nerfs to bigfoot/more customizable settings.

Date 2021-11-22 Playtime 8h 50m Rec Positive It's not so much of a game about hunting bigfoot as it is trying to survive a 2 ton seeker missle on steroids. There is no way to hide at night thanks to the player perputually pissing themselves from having to endure this nightmare. The only evidence you will take back with you is your gaping A$$h0le. Now bend over and prove the existence of bigfoot.

Date 2021-11-20 Playtime 19h 1m Rec Positive Bigfoot eats garbage and throws signposts at you. True to life recreation of all stories told on the hit TV show "Finding Bitfoot." All they got to do is play this game to find out how the capture the elusive squatch. Also don't forget, Bigfoot eats literal garbage out of a trash can and attacks you with signposts.  7/10, fun but not enough garbage and signpost variations.

Date 2021-11-20 Playtime 1h 21m Rec Negative This game is not horrible by any means. However, It feels like a walking simulator, and when it doesn't, it is way too difficult. Not being able to revive downed teammates and very scarce first aid kits (even with the loot mod at max) are some of the things that make this game stupid difficult. I could handle the difficulty, if the game was actually interesting. Almost zero lore at the start of the game. The only source of story are dead bodies scattered across the overwhelmingly small map. Its just you and some friends wandering around the woods and occasionally getting attacked by an over powered entity. THAT IS IT. if that sounds fun give it a buy.
Date 2021-11-20 Playtime 15h 48m Rec Positive Primer intento, yo solo contra el chango... la batalla duró cerca de 3 horas entre que looteaba y exploraba de día el misterio de los desaparecidos y de noche me preparaba para los marrazos, porque el chango anda tranquis de día, como que el calorcito lo hace webonear , pero de noche se te deja ir con todo y garrote, corre rápido, esta feo, esta peludo y ruge como león... fue una batalla de resistencia física, de paciencia y de echar coco... tu llegas con tus rifles, pistolas, trampas y cámaras, o sea bien equipado el bato y toda la cosa, y luego resulta que el neandertal ese empieza a jugar tu juego y te pone trampas también !! entonces cuando caí en una de sus trampas por primera vez, me subestimó... el pleito se volvió personal... no solo quería cazarlo para evitar que mas personas murieran a causa del animal, en ese momento cuando me vi colgado de cabeza tratando de escapar pensé... "lo único que quiero es patearte el trasero con bota pitera" y al final después de un last stand en el día 14 donde a mi ya no me quedaba medkit y me encontraba mal herido y al mono le quedaban 100 puntos de vida, milagrosamente encontré en esta cabaña una última trampa para osos que me permitió inmovilizarlo en críticos dos segundos que me permitieron darle el tiro de gracia... y así resulté vencedor.  P.D. Lo jugué en la dificultad mas baja posible y con el máximo posible de loot en el mapa... así que si lo juegas ya sabes lo que te espera XD... sobre el apartado técnico no tengo absolutamente nada que criticarle. los gráficos hacen su trabajo visual y el sonido hace su trabajo de inmersión como corresponde... aunque si me gustaría que hubiera mas gadgets de "surveillance" aparte de las cámaras y el drón... algo así como un microfono direccional estaria padre, o unos sensores infrarojos o térmicos. P.P.D. me gustó mucho que ademas del pleito con el chango hubiera historia en el diseño del mapa (jugué el del bosque) y que este tuviera muchos puntos de interés por descubrir porque eso ayudó mucho para la ambientación y el contexto del juego.  Le doy a este juego un 100 de 120 estalkerpuntos.

Fotokamera für Fotos von beweisen. Gute Idee - aber wofür? Hätte man mehr draus machen können.  Es läuft immer gleich ab: Erster Abend/Nacht: Looten - Bigfoot greift nicht an Erster Tag: Looten und eine Stelle suchen um zu kämpfen Zweite Nacht: Bigfoot greift an. Fallen, schießen und im Notfall blenden Zweiter Tag: Looten und eine Stelle suchen um zu kämpfen Dritte Nacht: Bigfoot greift an. Fallen, schießen und im Notfall blenden - Bigfoot stirbt im Normalfall.

Date 2021-11-17 Playtime 28h 37m Rec Positive Very Good game. Absolutely had a blast playing it, the new update is fire and highly recommend playing it. However, it would be nice to play as Bigfoot single player only, where the human hunter is AI.
Date 2021-11-17 Playtime 38h 38m Rec Positive A good game idea and the gameplay itself is even good, but you should work on optimizing the game.

Date 2021-11-17 Playtime 33h 6m Rec Positive Bigfoot is a concept that seems simple and boring on paper. But in practice it is an incredibly enjoyable experience.  you play as one of four characters and hunt down bigfoot, but its alot more then just that.  first, the maps. each map has a really unique feel and vibe. They are also huge with lots of exploreble places and secrets.   second, character design. The main cast of characters feel right out of a 2000s mockumentary but thats not a bad thing, its a plus. The actual design of bigfoot is hit or miss, while i do like it, i really loved the unique more monkey like look of the bigfoot when this game was first released.   third gameplay. the shooting is nice and the weapons sound great. the animations are a little stiff but i imagine they will be improved as development continues.  overall i would highly recommend to those who are fans of games like DBD or the Friday the 13th game.
Date 2021-11-17 Playtime 75h 8m Rec Positive yes

Date 2021-11-16 Playtime 12h 41m Rec Positive This game is really fun especially with friends me and my best friends love playing this beat it both ways killed him and discovered him really fun game...HOWEVER the jumping needs to be a little better can't jump over stuff well and last time i played i got stuff in between 2 rocks and couldn't run or jump out the way until Bigfoot grabbed me and knocked me out the rocks, the loot is also something not a major problem just slightly annoying always checking bags and getting nothing everything should hold at least something whether its ammo or first aids or even meat the loot system could be better in my opinion and add some kind of defense system against Bigfoot but other than that i really enjoy this game since its in early access its understandable to have problems but this game is great for early access not many bugs or problems fun with friends like i said

Date 2021-11-16 Playtime 49h 39m Rec Positive UPDATE: Proton Experimental works with the Game Now, And has 4 Maps Now.  Played on Linux using Proton-GE 6.16-1, Game runs Great, Play "Player vs A.I." most of the time, did try "Players vs A.I." once and it seem to work okay, and also tried "Players vs Player", I was Bigfoot but for some reason once game had loaded i could not move and all keyboard presses and mouse movements did nothing, Had to kill the Game with ALT+F4, Have not tried "Players vs Player" since.  Might get a bit boring playing alone with bigfoot A.I., but so far i love playing alone. Did try joining other "open" multiplayer Games but got kicked off before i could even pick my Player, so just setup your own "Open" lobby and hope some people join in.  Only 2 maps at the moment but i think at least another 2 are coming, Graphics are okay, Sound okay apart from some over loud sound fx's in places (and will make you jump), Game play is okay, search the map, find stuff by day, get ready to get a beaten at night.
Date 2021-11-15 Playtime 5h 46m Rec Positive fun little game 
Date 2021-11-15 Playtime 18h 2m Rec Negative This is one of the cases that i wish steam had a "Neutral" review option.  The concept of Bigfoot is really cool, loot in the day then fight in the night. But it has some real problems, for example, safes with stronger weapons are always on the same spot(yeah i know that the codes for them can spawn in 4 different places, but still the weapon is always on the same spot)which make it really easy to get the strongest weapons in the game. If you know what you are doing you can get it right on the first day.  Another problem that this game have and for me is the most critical is the PVP, the PVP is so absurdly unbalanced that make it not fun at all. Bigfoot is extremely overpowered and can attack you right from the start, and differently from COOP he can attack you both in days and nights, so you dont have time to loot nothing and cant do none of the tasks.  And last, the development of this game is SLOW, the game came out in 2017, but still has only 4 main weapons and 2 maps, you can see all the game has to offer in something around 3 hours.  I think that if you have friends to make a full private session(5 people) and make some rules, then the game can be fun in PVP otherwise forget to play with randoms.  If you want to play only in COOP you can have some fun for a couple hours, but dont expect randoms to share any loot at all.

Date 2021-11-15 Playtime 2h 36m Rec Positive Finally, a game about our favorite cryptid, the legendary squatch him self. This game actually has really good potential but there are some design choices made by the developers that really take away from the experience which I will talk about soon. Overall, this game was exhilarating and scary. Being in the woods alone with your mates, hunting down bigfoot and finding footprints and evidence of dead bodies adds to the world making it more alive and adds something to do other than walking around for half an hour trying to find guns. It has a similar feel to phasmophobia, with lots of ways to track bigfoot or lure him.  But, the AI for bigfoot is horrible. Bigfoot is almost impossible to kill. Even on the lowest health setting, a 5.56 round will only do 6 damage and that is if you do manage to find a AR-15 or the like. The 7.76 round, for the bolt action also only does 6 damage. At night, bigfoot will immediately start running over to your and your mates location, apparently capturing your scent in the entire redwoods forest. You can hide in the hosue with blinds closed and lights shut off all you want, but bigfoot will find you. You will hear the deep growl and cry and next thing you know, the door is being violently busted open. Unload all the shots you can, but you will barely make a dent and if your lucky, make him retreat for about 30 seconds.   Bigfoot will survive even explosives and propane tanks. He seems to just walk through the traps and ignores explosives and fire. After rigging two traps and setting up a fuel canister and propane tank, we baited bigfoot to rush into the wooden lodge we staked out in for the night. After busting down the door we shoot the propane tank and a fiery explosion occurs engulfing the lodge in flames and launching us backwards into the wall almost knocking ourselves unconcious. Bigfoot though seemed to not even be fazed as he bum rushes into the room and starts slamming us down to the ground, chokeholding us, and beating us violently with a road sign with flames sorrounding us. The only way to escape is to quickly run and jump out the back window and find a zipline but this is only a temporary escape. As long as night is still up, bigfoot will sprint towards your location and attack you with no way of running away from him. After beating someone down to no health, bigfoot will automatically switch to one of your mates.  The RV, your central command, is also not safe. If you stay in the RV, big foot will smash the windows and constantly swipe his hand knocking you down repeatedly as if he was shaking the van. I was convinced he was going to flip it over.   This game is scary, very funny, and quite a blast but only worth playing 3-4 times. It has a lot of potential and still in early access so hopefully the developer will make improvements, especially to Bigfoots health or player damage.
Date 2021-11-15 Playtime 31h 58m Rec Positive This game is good but it could use more story to what happens when you kill the Bigfoot like show your character loading up the Bigfoot on the trailer and  his face in the paper for killing Bigfoot proving that it exist or something. it seem like a lot to hard game play to not have a cool ending.

Date 2021-11-14 Playtime 29h 8m Rec Positive The game is fun scary for the first few times.  There are bugs but each patch it gets better and better.  They need to make it so you can start another round with the same people if yours ends on multiplayer.  Also they need to have an option for 2 Bigfoots, like two AI or a combo of AI and players.  The hop over railings can be annoying at times.  A straight jump would be nice compared to that or at least an option to stop it.  The lack of guns at the start makes it so if you have a faster connection you get a gun.  Kinda unfair, should just randomly give them out or give a standard gun to everyone.  Anyways great stuff hope they continue to expand with maps or different / additional AI etc.

Date 2021-11-12 Playtime 0h 15m Rec Positive (note: I have been following this game through launch by watching youtube videos, and only recent picked it up myself)  The last 4 years of development were very shaky, but it was still a decent game. It was what you would expect from this genre of hunting indie games.  But these last few months, everything has significantly improved.  Graphics - The maps have been absolutely beautiful and decently optimized from what I can tell Gameplay - The gameplay loop has come such a long way. Before, you just kind of wandered around until you found bigfoot or located him on your cameras. Again, it is what you might expect in the genre, and was nothing special. But with the recent update the gameplay loop is now very involved with looting and exploration. In the day time, you explore the map and new locations, trying to scrounge up ammo and medkits in order to survive another day. At night, you set up for bigfoot to hunt you. You can set up traps, work with locking the doors on bigfoot to slow him down, and using other items to stun and take down bigfoot. It is still a good balance of difficult yet possible. Sound - The sound has always been pretty good, and still is. Multiplayer - Lastly, they have added a player vs player gamemode where you can play bigfoot. It isn't super well balanced but it's an alright option if you want to try it with friends or in public lobbies (in-game chat included). The co-op multiplayer is also great, and one of the recent updates finally allows you to revive teammates. This was a significant issue in all previous versions, because the hunting expeditions can take up to 2 hours, and a dead friend really sits them out for a long time, often forcing you to restart if you want to play with your friend.  These past few months have been awesome and promising for this game, setting a new bar for this genre of game.
Date 2021-11-12 Playtime 21h 47m Rec Positive This game is really fun playing with friends. I wish the maps are a tad bigger. The loot is kinda bad even when you increase the in game loot. There is no blocking system in this game. So, your screwed when bigfoot attacks you...You can be dead on target when you shoot but goes through the body like the bullet doesnt register a lot. I know its in early access but wait till you buy it on sale because its not worth the full price YET :).
Date 2021-11-12 Playtime 54h 46m Rec Positive Started playing with v4.  THe made some major improvements and made it very fun and very replayable, especially with the right group of friends.  WHen they added the winter map it really opened up what you could do, and it was nice to see them work the new features like the ziplines into the old map

Date 2021-11-12 Playtime 117h 47m Rec Positive This game is great but the only problems i have with it is the fact that bigfoot isn't that scary and when you stand still a lot of animals start spawn and it looks silly seeing a wolf. a moose, two raccoons, and a bear standing in the same area as you.
Date 2021-11-12 Playtime 53h 18m Rec Positive Very nice, its fucking hilarious when you are playing with your friends, just be aware that the foiilage in the game (primarily Snow map) will tank your computer if it doesn't have a good enough processor. specs wise, I love this game, it has a terrifyingly fun atmosphere, and it ca get really funny with your friends!!
Date 2021-11-11 Playtime 11h 28m Rec Positive Fun game 
Date 2021-11-11 Playtime 2h 37m Rec Positive I did not see any footage of this game until recently, expecting it would be an interesting new game. Turns out it's in Early Access For almost 5 years...   Bigfoot is one of those minimalistic games which can be a lot of fun for a short period. You and a few other players have to hunt down Bigfoot, which can either be controlled by AI or by another player. You run around the forest to find other camps which contain items etc. and at night Bigfoot appears to murder you.  There are quite a few items you can pick up; some more useful than others. Things like medpacks, ammo, nightvision goggles, traps etc. You can set up cams or place traps. Not sure how useful these items are because at the end of the day Bigfoot will catch you and you have to try to shoot your way out. You can also go and find clues to Bigfoots whereabouts.   In my experience it's more fun to play against AI Bigfoot than player Bigfoot because the AI buggers off at some point and most player Bigfoot probably won't which could be a problem, especially if teammates don't share their loot with you and you run out of ammo.   Basically all you do is run around the map, find some loot until night comes and then wait for Bigfoot and try to kill him.  There are some other animals you can hunt for meat, some of them will attack you but your character doesn't get hungry or needs to drink or sleep which I think could make this game way more interesting.   Apparently the developer still does some work on the game but on a very slow pace. Currently 'Bigfoot' has 2 maps and 2 maps 'coming soon'...  there are still a bunch of people playing the game but most are on private servers.  The reason why I still recommend this game is because it can still be fun as a party game between friends (which is why most players are on private servers) but considering this game's normal price is way too steep, I would at least wait until you can find it somewhere for a small price.

Und allgemein wie er angreift ist sehr komisch er geht erst wieder zurück wenn er allen spieler so eine combo an angriffen austeilt er geht nicht weg bevor er die die kombo macht. Also ich finde das spiel in ordnung aber auch nicht super geil es gibt viele andere dinge die einfach blöd gemacht sind wie z.b diese Falle die er machen kann, Ansich ist die ganz krativ gemacht aber man sieht diese Falle nicht bevor man sie sieht. Es gibt noch viele andere blöd gemachte sachen aber auf die werde ich nicht mehr eingehen.

Date 2021-11-09 Playtime 3h 29m Rec Negative Can't really recommend the game wholeheartedly. Too slow-paced for my taste, and there's really no incentive or whatever to actually complete the tasks since Chonky Monkey will always hunt you every night. Bigfoot's currently too OP imo, even on a 4-player team, and Bigfoot's health only 1 bar, it's still really hard. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS AT FULL PRICE. PROPS TO THE DEVS FOR RELEASING NEW MAPS, BUT GAME'S MECHANICAL NEEDS A FIX.

Or like playing dead by daylight only the monster has a reason to be more careful and not tunnel it's victims. Yes it's hard at first, and yes you will be eaten by Bigfoot alot in the begining. However, you eventually find out the mechanics the devs made that are the weakness of big foot. He's killable.

Date 2021-11-08 Playtime 11h 24m Rec Positive BIGFOOT - многопользовательский шутер PvPvM  [h1]Вступление[/h1] Командная игра про охоту на Бигфута. Не сказать что это новый жанр, но всё же спасибо что не очередная игра с зомби сеттингом. Атмосфера располагает к отличному кооперативу с друзьями, игра получилось довольно зрелищной и эмоциональной.  [h1]Суть игры[/h1] Типичные правила для игр такого жанра - команда из 4 человек + 1 может выступать в роли Бигфута, либо эту роль может взять на себя ИИ. По легенде вы направляетесь на расследование зверских убийств и охоту на это чудовище, но по факту вы какие то бомжи которые приехали и взяли с собой на 4 человек всего лишь 2 ствола и десяток патрон.  Оружие и патроны нужно будет лутать по всей карте. Сразу скажу что меня очень сильно расстроил тот факт что респаун оружия фиксированный, поэтому люди которые провели в игре чуть более 5 часов со старта резко бегут на точки респа чтобы первым схватит желаемое оружие, это немного убивает общую атмосферу игры.   Убить бигфута в открытом поле у вас не получится, так как он по всем параметрам превосходит вашу группу даже если вы вооружены до зубов. Вам нужно убивать его хитростью, заманивать в капканы, использовать ландшафт и инфраструктуру чтобы с умом расставить взрывчатку, а потом так же с умом взорвать её, а не как это обычно бывает что ваш тимейт попадает в ловушку гораздо чаще чем сам бигфут. Главное оружие в сражении это ваш разум.    Хочу отметить что в игре есть различные гаджеты типа дрона или стационарных камер, а также ловушки с мясом которые нужно ставить по разным локациям чтобы то ли отвлекать бигфута, то ли заманивать. С планшета можно наблюдать как бигфут попадается в капкан и потом в гневе ломает камеру, первые пару раз я смотрел это с интересом, но потом как то наскучило. Сути этих действий в игре я так и не понял, все эти приспособления выглядят эффектно но совершенно не эффективны в борьбе с бигфутом. Однако это скорее плюс, так как эти средства для достижения реалистичности атмосферы выживания и охоты. Тут скорее всё зависит от вашей команды, и вашей цели в игре. Если хотите изучать повадки бигфута, почувствовать себя настоящим охотником и создать атмосферу ужастика то эти гаджеты не кажутся бесполезными, а если ваша команда состоит из рандомных игроков и все разбежались в поисках оружия то вам тоже стоит поискать ствол и убежище, а не фотографировать следы в лужах и царапины на деревьях.  [h1]Графика[/h1] Бигфут прорисован очень хорошо, он действительно пугает и внушает страх, в первые несколько раз вам захочется выкинуть свой дробовик и залезть под машину как только встретитесь взглядом с его налитыми кровью глазами. Бигфут очень зрелищно ломает окна, выбивает двери и делает добивания жалким людишкам, последний процесс лучше наблюдать конечно же со стороны. Что касается остального мира то он весьма посредственный, видно что ресурс разработчиков был ограничен и упор они сделали на бигфуте и некоторых частях инфраструктуры. Травка, деревья, животные и прочие объекты вблизи выглядят довольно скромно.  [h1]Баги[/h1] Багов в игре довольно много, особенно расстраивают ситуации в которых Бигфут застревает или не может вас достать, на эти баги школьники пишут руководство не понимая основной цели и удовольствия от игры.  Ещё есть множество недоработок, это уже не баги но всё же разработчику стоит обратить на это внимание: Нет полосы азимута, не удобно подсказывать напарникам на какой градус или на какую деталь нужно обратить внимание. Если организатор лобби сливается то сервер падает и вы не получите опыта за игру. Для тех кто ищет в играх какую то цель и любит прокачивать аккаунт этот минус станет ключевым. Нет разницы стрелять в голову или в ногу, урон фиксированный для каждого типа оружия в любое место бигфута. Это упущение очень сильно расстраивает.  Перезарядка оружия иногда багается, анимация перезарядки есть но пополнение боезапаса не происходит. Фиксированное место спавна оружия, убивает весь интерес. Если за бигфута играет не ИИ то есть баги где он пробегает через ограды и ставит капканы через текстуры.  [h1]Вывод[/h1]  Разработчики работают над игрой, пока всего лишь две карты но дальше будет больше. Я не сомневаюсь что данный продукт доведут до ума и пофиксят все баги. Проекту желаю успеха, игра стоит своих денег, рекомендую к покупке.   [h1] [i] Подписывайтесь на [/i][url=store.steampowered.com/curator/32707647/]куратора[/url][/h1]

Date 2021-11-07 Playtime 4h 37m Rec Positive Juego muy entretenido pero repetitivo
Date 2021-11-07 Playtime 0h 40m Rec Negative It's so bad xD I understand the concept, but in practice it's just not fun at all. Maybe if you love the bigfoot myths and get a team of people who know what to do - this could make sense. But if you want some random coop fun, it's definitely not the place to look for it
Date 2021-11-03 Playtime 13h 51m Rec Negative Really fun with friends - but the community is literal cancer. People hosting open games and still kicking you if you join. Bigfoots leaving midmatch causing game to end. Hosts in general leaving 10sec into games and causing game to end.  I havn't gotten a full game going for ages.  Also even on lowest settings bigfoot has way too much health. He is often unnecessarily hard to find during the day - and since the sniper rifles do so little damage it is hardly worth even chasing him. Better to hoard items during the day and during night bunker up, since he will be coming for YOU 100% every night, atleast once.  The new weapons also make it less of a "hunt for bigfoot" and more of a "war against bigfoot". Everyone running around with M4's shooting like it's the Gulf War or something.  Improvements I'd suggest would be to lower bigfoots HP, keep his damage high, and to have AI take over bigfoot if the bigfoot player leaves.  How I'd expect game to be: "Bigfoot walks into a trap. He takes alot of damage, and is shootable for a couple of minutes. Sniper rifles deal OK amount of damage on him, and he is mostly trying to hide, but get's aggressive when confronted at close. Also a bit more aggressive during night, since he feels more safe."  How game actually is (Singleplayer): "Hoard items during day. At night, bunker up with traps and other goodies in some house and blast away at bigfoot as much as possible. Repeat til game ends."  How game actually is (Multiplayer): "Game starts with a rush to hoard all items in the caravan. Then players scatter out and some get instakilled by bigfoot, since they forgot to grab first aid kits. (Hope for dear god that wasn't the host or the game will end).  The rest of the game revolves around waging war against bigfoot day and night. When bigfoot comes close, you throw out a trap and shoot him like mad with an M4 assault rifle. If you die, don't worry, because you have 4+ first aid kits to revive yourself with (hope he doesn't corpse camp you aswell)."

Date 2021-11-02 Playtime 31h 8m Rec Positive Honestly if you have 4 traps and any gun you can kill bigfoot pretty quickly using the houses with 2 stories - just start on the top floor and ensure you close the doors. 1. You can shoot bigfoot while he knocks the doors down 2. You can shoot bigfoot when in the traps 3. Can be repeated at both doors (the door leading to the balcony) 4. Drop down from the balcony to the first floor and repeat  Plus if the traps survive, you can keep repeating the process.

Maybe if they bring back some of the gameplay that involves actually hunting BIGFOOT and the tension that comes from it I'll change this review, but for now it just blends in with the other countless "OOGA BOOGA SCARY MONSTER" youtuber games.

Date 2021-11-01 Playtime 11h 43m Rec Negative If I could give this review a half-vote, I would. It's on early access and it's been on early access since the very beginning of 2017, which is quite a long time for development. Yet there is missing so many possible features that would make this game good.  Usually when I go to the forest to kill Bigfoot and if I know it would take several days why would I not take a clock with me? You can not tell the time, ever. Just exactly when it is "night" and when Bigfoot is about to attack.  The maps are the same every. single. time. Like seriously, 2 maps in almost 5 years of development. The only randomization in this game are loot (except guns, every firearm is at the exact location every single time), dead bodies (which are useless pieces of evidence, don't know if it even gives any more experience) and the passcodes for the vaults, as far as I know.  It gets quite boring because you would just go for the M4 and almost solo the hairy man. I'm not one to strategize for each game, just go with the game and see what happens.  Bigfoot himself seems quite OP even at 1 health, 1 damage and 3 loot. Couldn't kill him with my friend. Got 1 more friend to play with us. Still kind of couldn't get him killed. Fourth player finally got us a victory, which resulted in only around a 30% xp increase. Well done.  The funny part is after such a long early access, instead of adding randomization they added SKINS. TO KILL BIGFOOT IT'S JUST A CO-OP THAT YOU PLAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THE SAME MAP
Date 2021-11-01 Playtime 3h 47m Rec Negative I really tried to give this game a good try, and I did enjoy it. but mostly because I was playing with a friend. In its current state, not worth $25 AUD. Very little replayability since the only changing mechanic is Bigfoot. Pick it up on sale to give it a try but if you do give it a pass, you're not going to be missing a whole lot.

Date 2021-11-01 Playtime 18h 43m Rec Positive 游戏还行，有bug存在，但对玩家游戏体验的负面影响不大，甚至极其舒适（卡怪），下面分享一点游戏经验： 拿WinterPark来说（个人比较喜欢这个图，白天光线充足，而且没有特别复杂的垂直地形设计），地图上的枪械全是固定位置出现，在地图四角边缘的几个点位（洞穴和木屋）分别能搜到房车里的那把猎枪和霰弹枪，初始点房车正下方的木屋里面有一个标有黄色标签的保险柜，柜子里是一把AVM（AWM），用的762mm子弹，打开保险柜的方法就是找到并输入对应颜色标签的四位数密码；第二个红色标签的保险柜在地图正上方河流上边，里面是炸药（好像是只能通过开枪引爆，没有找到遥控引爆的方式）；第三个绿色标签的保险箱在地图正下方偏右一点的小木屋里，里面是一把M4，用的556子弹，是这个游戏输出效率最高的一把武器。保险箱对应的密码一般刷在保险柜所在的房屋内或者附近的点位，比如old hunting tower（塔上面）、camp（睡袋上）这些地方，有时候会刷在滑索两头的木桌凳子上，一定要仔细。 怪在第一天晚上（night -1）到第二天晚上（night -2）之前绝对不会出现（你要是意外碰到它就是另一个故事），所以这段安全时间尽可能的多搜集武器弹药补给和陷阱，尽量能开1-2个保险柜，路上看到的爆炸物一定要捡，一定要捡，一定要捡！爆炸物是对怪物造成伤害的最暴力的方式，子弹不够可以去地图中心的村庄搜一搜，大多情况一圈下来762肯定不会缺了。 到了第二天晚上（night -2），在听到第二声怪吼叫后就会开始搜寻玩家，pve不管玩家躲在哪里，怪都是能找到的，所以关灯关窗帘躲角落里瑟瑟发抖还不如找个比较好守的地形把爆炸物和陷阱布置好，在宽阔的地形下可以适当布置摄像头和无人机来预测一下怪来的方向。陷阱夹子和爆炸物尽量不要放在一起使用，因为两个东西都分别会对怪物造成一定时间的硬直时间来让玩家乘机输出，如果怪在同一时间触发陷阱和爆炸物就只会触发一段硬直，非常不划算。所以个人建议找一个比较长的通道，把陷阱和爆炸物排成一条线让怪物吃满硬直时间（注意爆炸物距离小心炸伤自己），待怪物近身后用信号枪或信号弹来将其驱赶（信号枪需要正中打在怪身上），然后迅速补充身上武器的弹药，地上有还没坏的陷阱赶紧重新部署一下，等怪回来。（ps:信号枪打在怪身上会给怪一个很小的硬直，但是硬直结束后怪会有一定概率继续攻击玩家而不是逃走，所以信号枪是概率驱赶怪；而信号弹拿在手里左键挥舞一下是必定能把怪驱赶走的）无人机也是一个非常重要的陷阱，无人机发射的电流能够直接把怪电倒在地上抽搐很长一段时间，但代价是无人机消耗大量电池，如果捡到无人机电池比较多久可以尽情使用。 pve的怪晚上攻击玩家的机制比较固定：跑到玩家所在的位置、去附近找一个能当武器的玩意拿在手里（一般是路牌、小工具或者屋内的吉他）、开始攻击玩家（如果玩家在屋内，会先去玩家离得最近的窗户抠一下，然后开始破门）、平a玩家1-5下，然后把玩家举高高再往地上摔。怪物离开的机制也很固定，一般一晚上消耗玩家60血以上（不同难度可能不同）或者天亮了就会跑掉，再也不回来，直到下一个晚上。所以玩家在晚上猎杀期间就算用信号枪或信号弹把怪物驱赶走了，只要玩家的血量从入夜以来没有损失60以上的话，怪必定还会再跑回来继续攻击玩家。 综合怪物猎杀机制，玩家每天晚上尽可能的用自己更少的血换怪更多的血。多人的话可以一个人溜怪其他人输出，单人的话要么被怪举高高要么就利用滑索等工具逃走，但是要当心一点，怪是能拆滑索的（玩家每次在怪面前通过滑索逃走时怪会攻击滑索柱子一次，攻击第二次滑索绳子就会断开），尽量不要在同一个时间点坐同一个滑索两次，否则你很有可能会从半空中摔下来。 地图上有几个bug点会把怪卡住，但是pve游戏总体难度不高，没有必要去卡。只要玩家充分利用爆炸物和陷阱，怪大多情况活不过第六晚上。 全文纯手打，纯分享个人经验给萌新指路，大佬不喜勿喷，希望各位点个赞。

Date 2021-10-31 Playtime 15h 42m Rec Positive Love the game. When they updated the game they boosted the graphics to steroid levels along with the added features of ziplines and character buffs it made it into a strategic game instead of the same old same old, this is why I recommend it to people with the 20 dollars CAD ( i got it on Wintersale last year (it was like $9 or $11-ish CAD)

Date 2021-10-31 Playtime 12h 13m Rec Positive Well, you can't bind the aim to any key, it is default right mouse button. You can't even use the right mouse button for anything but aim. Lets say you want to use your right mouse button to move forward, you can bind the right mouse button to walk forward but it will also aim at the same time. You should be able to bind aim. This really needs to be fixed. Also if you can add a setting to toggle for crouch, run and aim mode, that would be helpful. I find having good controls in game really helps the experience. I won't point out other bugs in the game that other people already have commented about. That being said, the game is fun. Graphics are sharp and fluid. I also bought this for my daughter and son so we can play together. We all had a blast. Would I recommend this game? Yes and No for the simple fact that a small issue like aim can not be bound. Hey Dev Let us be able to bind the aim button to another key!!  They fixed some stuff ;-) I am more happy
Date 2021-10-31 Playtime 1h 16m Rec Positive Huge let-down that Bigfoot doesn't have an enormous monkey dick that he uses as a baton to break into wherever you're hiding, Other than that it's a good game

Date 2021-10-31 Playtime 1h 47m Rec Negative Das Spiel hat einen guten Gedanken, doch die Umsetzung ist nicht so der Hit. Animationen und Bewegungen sind sehr schwach. Bei "ins Fenster springen" habe ich mich fast übergeben. BigFoot hat viel zu viel Health und der Damage ist so gering. Die Medkits sind leider sehr selten und somit kann man eigentlich einpacken wenn man nicht genug hat. Von mir gibt es für dieses Spiel 3/10 Punkten. Keine Kaufempfehlung...

Date 2021-10-31 Playtime 26h 29m Rec Negative During like the first "build" this game was really scary.  Bigfoot looked really creepy and there was like a "lightning bolt" jumpscare that was amazing, but both are removed from the game for some reason.  Now Bigfoot looks like a big monke. And not slightly creepy at all, just annoying... Now when he attacks he just coming after you over and over again and ignores other players and only chases one FOREVER almost. Once he chased me for about 10 min while running around a tree and the other players shot him dead...  In my own opinion, switching the game into a "Dead By Daylight" mode that one is Bigfoot, was the worst decision EVER. Now it feels it is less focus on making a scary game and making just another PvP game...  Also... DLC skins?? Nah...

Date 2021-10-31 Playtime 34h 43m Rec Positive Best Game ever
Date 2021-10-31 Playtime 3h 39m Rec Positive I've had this game for a few hours, and for the most part it's enjoyable.   LIKES: Large maps with lots of interesting places to explore! Each character has unique strengths, which makes co-op a little more interesting.   DISLIKES: Sometimes a little frustrating that there are so few firearms. Feels like there's a lot of ammo just laying around, but not the boomsticks to use them. If there was an element of crafting from some of the items you come across (more than just meat to bait traps with), that could be a pretty cool way to give yourself a way to protect yourself from Biggie.   First aid kits seem to be impossible to find. If I'm at a ski-hill, I'd like to think there'd be first aid kits fixed to a chair lift or something at the ski-hut. Same with the cabins at each site.  Bigfoot's super aggressive behaviour. I feel like Bigfoot should be a little more elusive and not just be 100% aggro'd throughout the night. Like damn, he should be nomming on berries or dead campers or something... It would be nice if players could have a chance to escape by breaking line of sight or something too, instead of Biggie being some kind of heat-seeking laser guided behemoth monkey.  When a team-mate is incapacitated, and you do not have any means of healing them -- it would be cool if you *could* pick them up and carry them. Doesn't seem fair that you can pick up a dead body, but not a hurtin' one.   Oh, and it's kinda annoying when Biggie grabs you inside a building or trailer, from outside and lays you on your ass through the walls. :S

Date 2021-10-31 Playtime 7h 10m Rec Positive it good
Date 2021-10-31 Playtime 16h 0m Rec Negative Decent Game. But small flaws become unbearable the longer you play.  Fun an interesting however AI is a big letdown. There is less hunting and more waiting until night for bigfoot to attack. For PVE AI is a big letdown.  For PVP its fun if you can find a decent group to play with. To often public servers you will wind up with one of your teamates grabbing all the starting gear ramboing it through the woods to die immediately and bitch about why no one is reviving him. Or as soon as someones downed they leave. Or as soon as the Bigfoot player begins to lose they leave and ending the game for all. There is a ton of noobs that come into the game and have no clue what to do in multiplayer.  Thats completely fine, BUT the voice chat is completely borked NO one can hear one another the volume is way to low even when turned in settings to 100% voice, and game volume down to 15%.  All I can say is its a fun experience but these small things prevent this game from being fun past intial few hours. Buy it if you have a friend to play with and can use discord, otherwise move on. If these issues get fixed especially voice I would be happy to re review this title.

Date 2021-10-31 Playtime 43h 9m Rec Positive The game's great with a group of friends. Especially the 4 v. 1 mode where Bigfoot is an actual player.   However—DLC for an early access game? $3 a piece for the least inspired goddamn skins I've seen in my life! The skins took an hour at most. Probably 15 minutes!  Are the developers smoking crack? Injecting LSD? Jenkem?  Seriously, what the fuck.

Date 2021-10-31 Playtime 1h 44m Rec Negative Purchased this with x3 other friends and we all played together and just didn't have much fun with it at all. Big Foot is just way too OP, your weapons do nothing against him. You can just kill the entire group with ease unless you all run away in separate directions and so one part member dies. You can revive him eventually but regardless, it's not fun.. simple as that.  This game runs and plays great but it needs a lot of work to just be enjoyable to play with your own friends. Wouldn't recommend if you want a thriller Dead by Daylight or horror type game. It's more survival that anything which just doesn't work.

Date 2021-10-30 Playtime 1h 49m Rec Negative Honestly, this game has potential, but its just not there. only 1 map available (2 maps during winter), You can crank Bigfoots damage, AND health all the way down, and still brutally destroy everyone. The only people that will have fun with this game, are the ones that have been playing it for a while and know exactly what to do each time. Otherwise, you will be destroyed by bigfoot. The team vs AI is not bad, but not nearly as fun as having someone be Bigfoot. Beyond just running around forever trying to kill him, there is no motive to the game. Nothing to do.

Date 2021-10-30 Playtime 21h 45m Rec Positive hunt the monkey, monkey hunts you. honestly a really enjoyable game if you have a few friends to play it with. there are some bugs that need to be ironed out and the variety of equipment is a bit limited. Other than that, it has been amazing to see the work that has gone in to improving the game, especially from a small studio like this. I would only request more ways to trap and mind game the monkey, more guns, and go back to the old model bigfoot cuz that was big monkey.
Date 2021-10-30 Playtime 22h 8m Rec Positive Low Key a Fun game to play late at night with the squad. You can do some crazy things to track down the Squatch and its a blast to Loop the crazy money in house while your friends are attacking him with clevers. The game does need more weaponry to be added as weapons are very rare to find. Also adding new traps to hunt would nice since hunting animals feels pointless since its just better to use your traps in house to block him from running away. No point in killing boars for meat its just easier wait for night to take him down.   Highly Recommend if you got friends to play with as there is no match making, this game that you got have people who want to do play. Also support a local studio they can use all funding and support they can get to make something they care deeply about.

Date 2021-10-30 Playtime 15h 16m Rec Positive pretty good for beta :D cant wait for more
Date 2021-10-30 Playtime 2h 44m Rec Negative Extremely unclear how players are supposed to win, non-violent options are super hamstrung by only 1 person getting a camera which is VERY weird considering the context of the game.  Guns are so bad at harming bigfoot its actually comedic, even at lowest health (~1200) the 5.56 rifle headshot does ~6 damage, 6 out of 1200. The map is super huge with almost nothing in it, and there's no tutorial whatsoever.  However in 3 hours of running around where we just gave up and had the friend playing bigfoot trying to help out, we could not figure out what the game wanted us to do.  There's also a revive system and it might be the actual worst revive system in any game I've played. You need to get 4 skulls, find an unmarked location, and then carry the corpse which slows you to a CRAWL  If you die on the opposite side of the map from stonehenge, too bad!!! I ain't walking for literally 10+ minutes to pick you up!  Game's biggest problem right now is that it just plain isn't fun. I would have rather been just hanging out in a discord call talking with my buds, would have been better than bigfoot tbh.  I hope the devs keep up work on it, the idea is solid the execution is just very poor atm
Date 2021-10-30 Playtime 1h 38m Rec Negative The game feels unfinished. Movement feels clunky, especially jumping, and there's really not much to do. Shooting also feels awkward and doesn't feel rewarding. Expected way more. If the concept was executed to a T, it'd surely be an amazing experience. Maybe I'll come back to this in a few years when it receives the treatment it deserves.  E: Also, the sound design for footsteps is pretty poor. It sounds like someone is running next to / behind you when you're running, which is annoying.

Date 2021-10-29 Playtime 10h 23m Rec Positive He leído varios comentarios quejándose de algunos aspectos del juego y he de decir que en el estado actual en el que se encuentra están subsanados esos problemas. Casi a punto de terminar su periodo en Early Access ha mejorado drásticamente y todavía le queda por añadir 2 nuevos mapas y otras novedades que todavía no están anunciadas.   El juego en sí es divertido y está bien hecho, con un buen enfoque en lo que pretende ser. Se puede jugar tanto en solitario como en cooperativo y ambos modos son igual de jugables e igual de buenos (dentro de los modos de juego coop hay uno que es 4vs1 (IA) o 4vs1 asimétrico. En solitario te rodea esa atmósfera que se vuelve en soledad e intranquilidad; tú solo, en un gran bosque investigando de día y de noche mientras una bestia te acecha sin que te des cuenta. Y, por otro lado, el modo cooperativo.. todos sabemos que con amigos todo es mejor, puedes compartir la tensión y los sustos de la aventura.   La idea del juego es bastante buena e innovadora por un lado. No es el típico juego coop de terror/survival, las partidas tienen una duración más larga (puedes incluso guardar partida en el pve) y las mecánicas no son como las de otros coop del estilo. Debemos dar caza al Bigfoot, sí, eso es lo principal, pero hay otras misiones como encontrar cadáveres de campistas, pruebas de que el Bigfoot existe como: huellas en el suelo y macas de sus garras en los árboles. Es decir, es un juego coop con una pequeña campaña.   El mapa está oculto, no aparecen los lugares ni los suministros. Debes ir descubriéndolo poco a poco- Hay varias localizaciones, y en general da una sensación muy buena de estar en mitad de un bosque, descubriendo sus campamentos y lugares. Los gráficos son bastante decentes y el espacio sonoro está conseguido, te mantiene alerta. Al igual que los animales salvajes que hay por el mapa: osos, alces, mapaches, lobos, ciervos y más.  En definitiva, es un juego muy completo con el cual te divertirás jugando con amigos o incluso en solitario, si eres valiente, te aseguro que te "gustará" esa sensación. Si te tuviera que dar una nota le daría un 8/10

Date 2021-10-29 Playtime 9h 32m Rec Positive Muy divertido para jugar con amigos, las primeras partidas pueden costar para hacerse al juego pero luego es sencillo de entender lo cual no quita que sea complejo (he de decir que puedes cambiar tanto la dificultad como la vida del Bigfoot como la cantidad de loot) ya que el Bigfoot tiene una IA que lo hace difícil de localizar pero para el es muy fácil sorprenderte, aun esta early pero me parece un casual genial y con mucho potencial para jugar en cooperativo y pasarlo bien intentando cazarlo en compañía.
Date 2021-10-29 Playtime 28h 51m Rec Positive Kann dieses Game nur empfehlen und spiele es seit Release. Seit dem neuen Update wurden die alten Fehler deutlich verbessert und es ist nun auf einem ganz anderen Level. Viel Spielspaß, vor allem mit Freunden, aber auch alleine ist auf jeden Fall gegeben.

Date 2021-10-22 Playtime 7h 13m Rec Positive Amazing game!!!!!!
Date 2021-10-22 Playtime 0h 13m Rec Negative Oh my gosh, I looked at the reviews and they were good. I looked at the pics and they look promising. THE GAME WAS SO BAD. Everything in the game is very low quality, very low framerate even though my PC is higher then the recommended specs. It wasn't fun, and the game is very unclear. For example I find a drone I place it down it just says charge or pickup. They don't tell you how to use anything! I join a game with only one dude and the bigfoot is an AI I'm excited to play because this game looks very promising. Then I start walking... Everything goes downhill from there. The walking is so choppy and the framerates are so low. My partners character model looks like a literal toe. And the characters look weird. My guy is supposed to have a shotgun, he has a flaregun. Every lobby is on private or nobodies in the lobby (one person) Literally everything except like one drawer is "empty" I fall from a huge ledge, I only lose like 20 health. The game is just broken. I can tell the developers are actually working on it. It's not just some "low effort" cash grab (although it's overpriced in my opinion) So even though I'm bashing on it, the devs do obviously care about it. But while it's in this early state sadly from what i've seen I cannot recommend it.

Date 2021-10-22 Playtime 1h 38m Rec Positive BIGFOOT is a huge blast and plenty of fun to play.  The key is to explore, explore, explore, but be very careful of BIGFOOT.  Watch, listen, and proceed.  I played for 1.4 hours and BIGFOOT killed me.  I totally enjoyed every second and minute of this game.  I look forward to more time playing and killing BIGFOOT!!!

Date 2021-10-18 Playtime 1h 10m Rec Negative [h1] Сделан реваунд. [/h1] Я по сей день не понимаю почему игру берут, она нисколько не стоит 500 рублей, максимум сотку.   [b] Из плюсов [/b] бигфута только графика - красиво... Это всё... Реально всё, плюсов нет больше  [b] Из минусов [/b] БИГФУТ нападает КАЖДУЮ НОЧЬ, в чем смысл охоты? Это пушистое е*ло всегда знает где ты находишься, мы даже специально выясняли, найдет ли он нас, он тупо прибегал в точку, когда даже признаков пиявок [strike] (Отсылка к Green Hell) [/strike] там не было.  [b] Лут. Лута нет. [/b]   Вообще нет. Мы с корешем выстреливали фулл магазины за одну ночь, а ресурсов на карте вообще нет, настолько мало, что даже в соло хрен вытянешь.  [b] Отсутствия смысла в приборах [/b]  Поясняю, в начале игры дают приборы, ну которые ВООБЩЕ БЕСПОЛЕЗНЫ. Польза есть только от одного капкана или канистр раскиданных по карте. Камеры в игре нах*р не сдались из-за того, что это создание к тебе прибегает каждую ночь. Про дрон вообще молчу, если камеры бесполезные, то он тем-более, он ещё жрёт батарейки, как еб*н*тый  [b] Настройки игры [/b] Мне было больно играть в это, а причина этого - неизменяемый fov.  Я вообще не понимаю в чем трудность сделать такую нужную настройку. Про своего кореша вообще молчу, у него большая дюймовка монитора, ну... я не е*у как он ещё видит что-то. Глазам больно.  Я по сей день вижу по ней ролики - абсолютно скучная игра, тугая, нелогичная, но красивая... Игра вообще не стоит своих денег, да, вам может быть весело, если у вас фулл пак людей и кто-то играет за пушистое х*йло, но это не точно, ибо как решиться проблема с лутом и прочим. Непонятно. И по сей день не понимаю, что люди находят в ней такого привлекательного, что куча положительных отзывов Возьмите что-то другое.

Date 2021-08-29 Playtime 11h 26m Rec Positive BIGFOOT para ser un juego proveniente de una empresa pequeña esta muy bueno.  En el juego podemos jugar solos o multijugador, se puede ser cazador o bigfoot, el juego tiene una mecánica bastante interesante, usaremos tanto armas, trampas para cazar a la bestia, como también cámaras, un dron, herramientas con las que obtenemos información, y del lado de la bestia usaremos sus habilidades, el ambiente, objetos y trampas que dejaremos escondidas en el bosque.  El juego actualmente no está terminado por lo que tiene varios bugs, esos bugs pueden ser reportados por los jugadores y indicar su nivel de importancia, igualmente se vio que los desarrolladores le dan mucha atención al juego ya que esta recibiendo muy buenas actualizaciones de tanto arreglos como también añadidos.  Lo recomiendo bastante, es de esos juegos que vale la pena jugarlos, esta muy bien logrado y realmente cumple con lo que promete, no hay muchos juegos de bestias míticas y este salio muy bien del horno en términos generales, 8,75/10.

Date 2021-08-28 Playtime 25h 53m Rec Positive This game is great with friends and can even be fun on your own. Has A LOT of downtime where you just do nothing. So really its less about your decision to get this game and more about your friends decision to get this game with you. Playing alone is the most mind numbingly boring experience in the world because you spend so much time just waiting for bigfoot to do anything. Overall I would recommend it as a game to play ONLY with friends if you have any that have this game

Date 2021-08-26 Playtime 12h 26m Rec Positive The major update of the game makes it more interesting, was hoping for bigfoot(player) vs Humans (AI) mode in the future

Date 2021-08-26 Playtime 6h 25m Rec Positive Oh I love this Game so much - its the closest thing to playing a Predator movie game accept its Bigfoot. I have had this game from day one and its been fun - but this new 4.0 Update has blown it out of the water and the game is now stunning, scary and amazing - especially in Co-OP. However playing now in Solo has been a lot of fun but very hard so be warned. This game has amazing sound design where the forest comes alive and when you hear the Bigfoot roar the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, the Bigfoot even knocks on the trees to scare you or let you know he's near by. But when he attacks all hell breaks loose and it is terrifying but so much FUN!  Everyone needs to experience this terror - awesome game.

Date 2021-08-26 Playtime 3h 37m Rec Negative the game is fun but needs work  it is almost impossible to "hunt" bigfoot as there is no way to track him during the day apart from cameras would be nice to have tracking rounds +a gps tracking device (to track the rounds in bigfoot) 
Date 2021-08-26 Playtime 26h 33m Rec Positive Don't eat poison sumac. She was just eating poison sumac before she gave me a KNOBBER. She'd have that shit on her fucking lips and shit. My WEEN is gonna be breaking out and it ain't gonna be with the herb. You know what I'm sayin? This sucks! I don't know what to do. I'll never go back down there alone without a dog or a gun. I don't like being treated like a piece of meat like that. Manhandled by some big, hairy female, right. That was the worst. Seriously, that was the worst! I can't even believe I blew my LOAD. It was difficult but I figured. You know, she was making an effort. I figured at some point I should too
Date 2021-08-26 Playtime 33h 34m Rec Positive Bigfoot fucked me and my friend in the same cabin on the same night   10/10 would get sauced again
Date 2021-08-26 Playtime 9h 22m Rec Positive fun to play with friends but boring alone 
Date 2021-08-26 Playtime 6h 39m Rec Negative            Should be called "Waiting for Bigfoot"  Dump multiple shots in him to do 0.1% damage, then it either runs off at warp speed never to be seen again or it attacks you dealing a ton of damage making you waste precious medkits, then it runs off never to be seen again. Then you wait. And wait. And wait. And wait some more. And maybe you see him and maybe you can get another shot on him but it feels like you're shooting marshmallows at the creature. There's no way to camp up, traps are a one-use thing so you either sacrifice those doing moderate damage, then you're back to the same waiting game doing little damage. Or you use the traps/meat to lure it then take a shot before it steps in the trap, saving the trap. I put a gas bottle down near a trap, blew it up when he got stuck in it, and I must've done like 5 damage out off 1,000+ with a phucckin gas bomb. And the lighting is just terrible, there's terrible bloom from the sun, the sniper scope is like dirty or hazzy, the flashlight is wayyyy to weak for how dark it is, there's no point to using the "night vision camera" because you have to put your weapon away and by the time you pull your weapon out you can't see the target anymore. After the creatures throws you around, you can't immediately get up and start firing because you have to take your weapon again, and by that time its already run off again. Fire rate is too slow, reloading is too slow, flare gun doesn't even work that well as I thought it was gonna totally scare it off  but nope, it kind of just paused and shrugged it off then continued to take all my health away. Then it zips away, off it goes into the vast void of the map. The noise it makes when its far away sounds like its coming from directly in front of your position when its not. There's no real way to track the beast and "find" it. Really it should be called "Waiting for Bigfoot". Honestly "The Rake" is better than this. Drone and cameras are useless because you see it on camera and then what?? By the time you reach the spotted position its long gone Even if it stepped in a trap.

Date 2021-08-25 Playtime 3h 8m Rec Positive Pretty good game, excited to see whats coming up next!
Date 2021-08-25 Playtime 1h 5m Rec Negative Its just so boring. The game is nice looking but it feels like all you do in it is just sit at camp and wait for Bigfoot to come and attack. Then you do like 1% of his health in damage before he runs off. I don't understand the point of any equipment besides traps and guns, you have these cameras that you can plant around the map but whats the benefit of seeing Bigfoot on them? Just so you can go "Whoa! There he is!"? He runs around the map at incredible speeds so its not like you can rush over there, even if he steps in a trap, he will probably be out of it before you can get there, and if you actually do get there, you get what? Another percent of his health?  I commend the devs for not just abandoning this game and actually continuing to improve it(The main menu was surprisingly cool) but it feels like they don't know what they want the game to be(Or maybe its just in a transitional period?). A game about finding a sasquatch is an entertaining concept but this is like an action game where you have to kill a monster which just so happens to be Bigfoot. I was hoping it would be like Finding Bigfoot, like how Phasmophobia is like Ghost Hunters.
Date 2021-08-25 Playtime 22h 5m Rec Positive Fun way to spend a few hours. I don't know about long term play but short term, playing in between other games is a fun break.

Date 2021-08-24 Playtime 15h 30m Rec Positive Gameplay ☑ Alert bigfoot as you are entering into the woods. "I am here to see you, not to harm." ☐ Find a big piece of wood. Average sized log. smack against a tree twice.  Music ☑ Deep howls (kind of like grunting men in a gym.)  Graphics ☑ Look around your surroundings. Look for possible shelters such as broken down trees leaning against other trees.  Have fun and don't be afraid of the unkown! best of luck and ask questions!

Date 2021-08-23 Playtime 32h 31m Rec Positive This game has been massively improved which is great but it is hard to find a lobby that has not been started yet or is not private. If you buy this game you must be ready to play solo / wait for a server to open (or start your own) / or have some friends who already have the game.

Date 2021-08-23 Playtime 5h 27m Rec Positive Very fun to play with friends against a bot bigfoot, but no point trying to play against a player bigfoot.. very unbalanced, no chance at all.

Date 2021-08-22 Playtime 14h 31m Rec Negative IMPOSSIBLE TO KILL THE NEW UPDATED BIGFOOT... 1 meter range away from him with shotgun and he takes minimum damage almost 1/50 HP per shot.. WTF.. When u hide behind trees ( far away from him) and only looking at him through manually placed cameras or drone in the air, HE ALWAYS KNOWS WHERE YOU ARE ! Its too insane in my point of view.  HOWEVER, the mechanics, nature, weapons, exploration... good. I HATE  that your rifles do NOT have night vision themselves as Optic part. You can use the Night vision binoculars but its pointless since he is too fast and by the time you remove the binoculars.. HE IS GONE.

Date 2021-08-22 Playtime 2h 23m Rec Negative For now i dont recommend the game, its very beautiful and everything, but bigfoot coming straight for us. Even if we make no sound at all, and just hiding. Ruins the experience for us. Sounds should scare him of or he should wander random routes, and when he looks at you, then he can engage.
Date 2021-08-22 Playtime 15h 17m Rec Positive В принципе обосратся можно, хороший co-op хоррор выживалка, явно рекомендую.
Date 2021-08-22 Playtime 14h 43m Rec Negative It could have been a fantastic game, but it fails in so many ways. The mood and sounds is intense and greath. The first hour or maybe 2 I was very exited, but I got wiser and very dissapointed. Even at the lowest level, it seems impossible to kill Bigfoot because of too less medical kit and ammo. When you start game with settings "I" for Bigfoot health and Bigfoot Damage and "III" for Loot amount, start the gamle, save the game and then load a saved game, then all 3 levels suddenly are set to level "II" and it cannot be corrected. It look strange and you do not know what level you actual load into. Anyway the level is still much too hard. I guess this game only are realistic to complete if you play multiplayer and you are 3-4 persons. You cannot use stealth at all, Bigfoot will find you each night no matter where you are and no matter if you have closed all light and doors (if you are in a house). Seems pretty unrealistic and makes the game extreme monotonous. So in fact, there is not much tactics to choose besides just choose allmost anyplace and begin shoot, trap and explode Bigfoot. You cannot save games in seperate slots and you cannot pause the game. I've seen one video where 3 persons managed to kill Bigfoot (and they were close not to kill Bigfoot). After Bigfoot was killed, a very short video (maybye 3-5 seconds) appeared in which Bigfoot dies and then the game ends. "Bang" and the 3 players also complained that they were not even able to go over and look at the killed Bigfoot. Wished I never spend money on this game.

The only thing I can see is that the replayability is not amazingly high right now with only one pre designed map, but it's a gorgeous one for sure. I'd love to see a bigger focus on immersion in this game (Please give me the option to turn off some HUD elements pretty please). I cannot wait to see more content for this game! I love it and would highly recommend!
Date 2021-08-16 Playtime 3h 29m Rec Positive BigFoot is hot. I like it when he smash me hard, and pound me while I lay on the ground. His hairy chest is always nice to look at while he pummels me. Me also like when he watches me from the bushes. uWu. Plz add naked BigFoot mod
Date 2021-08-16 Playtime 6h 31m Rec Positive This game has always been great, since its first release, but the rework is amazing and made me want to finally buy the game, I used to watch Fooster play the game but now I feel like the game is in a great state to buy it, the PVP is really fun, and the Bigfoot AI is very good, haven't experienced any bugs in this game yet, I 100% recommend you should play this game.

Date 2021-08-16 Playtime 29h 32m Rec Positive Genuinely one of the most fun games I've played with my girlfriend and our group of friends. At first we loved it because it was scary, but now we just enjoy how hilariously funny the situations we put ourselves in can be because the game can be a buggy mess sometimes, but in a  good way. Very excited to see where the developers take this game as I see it having a lot of potential once it is a finished product.  edit: my girlfriend is now my fiance :)
Date 2021-08-16 Playtime 6h 59m Rec Negative I will keep playing this for two reasons: 1) my friends have it and B) I am past the refund time. It's not terrible, but after like four games you've seen and done it all. Hopefully they add more to the game.

Date 2021-08-16 Playtime 0h 51m Rec Negative Bigfoot chases you on a daily basis and it's unavoidable. The game provides ample opportunities to avoid and hide, but the creature always knows where you are, whether you're hiding crouched in the dark for 15 minutes. It does not care. When the antagonist of a game is this aggressive and totally unavoidable it ruins the eerie and scary atmosphere that follows you throughout the game. It seems intended as a horror survival experience but it has way too much action, the game doesn't need to be this fast paced. I don't get to enjoy systems like camera tracking and drones because finding Bigfoot is pointless. Just sit in a cabin with a shotgun. It's honestly unfortunate.

Date 2021-08-14 Playtime 45h 56m Rec Positive Bigfoot je velmi dobrá hra.... Po tĕch letech se posunula už na dobrou úroveň.... Je tu zatím jedna mapa ale další 3 mají brzy následovat.... Graficky se hra posunula také dost.... Konečně více druhů zbraní.... možnost hrát za bigfoota není špatná... Hodně se mi pak líbí možnost nastavit si jak velký život Bigfoot bude mít a jak velké zranění bude způsobovat..... možnost nastavit si kolik zásob bude schováno po mape.... Podle mě stačí pouze doladit hratelnost hry, možná více možnosti jako třeba možnost rozďelat oheň a stan jako to bylo ve starých verzích..... Pak už jen ty mapy 3 a myslím, že to je pak velmi dobrá hra o bigfoot..... ( pouze s přáteli )

Date 2021-08-12 Playtime 9h 50m Rec Positive 我很喜欢玩这个游戏，每次我都不敢出去，一直在房车，我闲着无聊，开始玩无人机，玩着玩着，没电了，我放下遥控器，突然大脚怪在房车外挠了我一下，我被吓呆了，过了一儿，我才反应过来，拿着▄︻┻┳═一一开了大概5 6枪，之后我打算不玩了，这时刚好我同学过来了玩了，我就打算让他玩这个游戏,吓死他,他来了之后，他直接打开游戏，说：“恐怖吗？”我说：”不恐怖“，他说：’有枪吗？“我说：“有”，之后我把操作给他讲了一遍，他上来就拿着枪直接向森林深处走，这时有大脚怪的背影出现了，还有很恐怖的声音，他二话不说，直接开枪，边开枪边向天上打信号枪，他转了过来看见我捂着耳朵，在床上说着:"快把游戏关了!快把游戏关了!玩别的玩别的。"(本人当时10岁）【2025年3月7号年本人考古，当时玩这个游戏是2020年发表评论是2021年，我小学时的评论，现在看好怀念】

Date 2021-08-12 Playtime 1h 45m Rec Negative Easily one of the worst payments I have ever made towards a game. It goes and carries the legacy of that Early Access title on its sore back like a poor mule as it wanders directly into a ravine and dies. The game in its state has zero reason to ever be Early Access and should have just been finished before release, especially with the gaudy price it thought was acceptable. The presentation is terrible and reeks of Unity store asset ripping with almost zero flare. The game can easily be lost as supplies aren't abundant in the slightest. Losing entire teams to the Bigfoot in a single encounter is common and revives are not easy to come by. The entire goal of the game is poorly constructed and a nightmare to carry out. At most you'll end up finding Bigfoot and then likely dying immediately or waste ammo into the bullet sponge he is. There's definitely some nonsensical idea of "strategy" that really boils down to working against the game rather than with it.  What scent radiates from this decaying carcass of a "game" is easily just bait for Youtubers and Lets Players to fondle a bit before getting bored. Do not waste your time with this crap, seriously.
Date 2021-08-12 Playtime 15h 58m Rec Positive An Amazing Game! - Bought it to play with my friend, endless hours of fun! - Just a quick note to anyone who want's to buy and play- you will need to allocate time for the game, as it can go on for hours, and sometimes you run out of time to play or something like that, it's a great game, and the new update really spiced it up! :> <3

The reason i'm giving it a negative review is the bloody traps in trees they spawn and you don't even see them until you are trapped on them it ruins the immersion and slightly spoils the game, i know its an early access game but that's a simple mechanic.

I love the gamemode where you can be bigfoot.  Theres one thing that i would love if they fixed: Sounds. When i walk i can hear myself everywhere around me. Its just annoying   overall the game is amazing and still in early access. Im sure they will add a lot of different stuff like workshop for maybe maps or weapons and all sorts of things.

Date 2021-08-11 Playtime 11h 55m Rec Positive I'm very mixed on this game, It really needed the 4.0 update. It made the game feel more polished and the added features were extremely needed to and made the gameplay way better, But there still is issues them being how ruff this game is on some spots motion wise but that doesn't ruin the game, I have personally found that every single night you get attacked by bigfoot and there is no way to stop it, You can't hide like you used to be able to before 4.0 and he would be harder to find before 4.0 and I think him showing up so often kinda pulls me outta the horror that it used to have. I've also barely seen any animals anymore. I only found it really fun if you have friends to play with, I've played with one of my friends but it would be way better to have 5 friends to play with and have one bigfoot and the rest hunter it would be tons of fun. I found I actually perfer playing online because it makes bigfoot way more interesting being played by a person, That was a big pro to the 4.0 update is playable bigfoot it's extremely fun. This game is definitely worth the buy if you have friends to play with and it's also worth it if you enjoy these types of games alone. It's not worth it if your new to these types of games and don't know if you'll like it and don't have any friends that have it, But if you and another friend are willing to get it then go for it, It's worth the 22$ CAD

The days are way to short and you don't even have to use cameras cause you have to run all the time to find a med kit and if you dont find you won't last long.

Date 2021-08-10 Playtime 4h 57m Rec Positive Very fun with friends, best mode is players vs ai, but the players vs player need improving such as less location hints on players while being big foot, and making more traps and ways to defeat big foot as the hunters. The new update has also made this game a top tier co op game. Would recommend
Date 2021-08-10 Playtime 4h 20m Rec Negative na
Date 2021-08-10 Playtime 6h 1m Rec Negative Spiel ist an sich nicht schlecht, echt gut geworden, allerdings weißt es noch einige schwächen auf. Bigfoot ist extrem overpowered und die Anzahl an Erste-Hilfe Kits ist ebenfalls sehr gering. Zudem tritt man gefühlt an jedem 2. Baum in Fallen von Ureinwohnern.
Date 2021-08-10 Playtime 14h 21m Rec Positive This game is absolutely terrifying and yet so fun at the same time. Really helps your team to understand how important it is to work together to overcome very large and aggressive obstacles. I would definitely recommend this game to friend groups to play, especially at night.

Date 2021-08-10 Playtime 14h 4m Rec Positive This game made me die in the game to bigfeet. 2/10
Date 2021-08-10 Playtime 27h 0m Rec Positive That game got a big update and its just very good. It is like a new game.. I bought that game before that update and I didnt like it because you couldnt really do something, like bigfoot was to strong and the 2 maps were kinda nice but to small and there was not so much loot. Now the game has very good grafics and much more usefull stuff like flares and with them you can blind and stun the Bigfoot. You can play alone or with a Team against the Bigfoot or against a player Bigfoot. It isnt that hard to kill him if you have good strategies. You can also change the dmg and heal from Bigfoot so you can decide if it should be strong, middle or weak (but I would not call that weak) You can also decide how much loot should spawn. And the new map (Red wood) is just the best map so far. There are also animals which you or the Bigfoot can kill and many, many more stuff. Just check it out it is nice.
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 33h 34m Rec Positive i love it
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 20h 15m Rec Positive big
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 5h 32m Rec Negative was way better before but now it is impossible to kill bigfoot because he can heal and has a immense amount of hp also guns are shit and no more tracking bullets  wait for another update where they add the fun stuff and make bigfoot not just scripted fights to buy
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 37h 51m Rec Positive real good game, so much fun, yes
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 34h 38m Rec Positive You dont feel like a hunter, you are hunted. AI is super aggro contrary to how a real monke would be. really fun though. tons of potential
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 26h 30m Rec Positive Das Spiel ist sehr viel besser nach dem Update - nur 1 ist schlecht - der Bigfoot ist zu stark ( als KI oder von Mensch gespielt ) er rennt 3 x schneller wie ein Spieler, er springt 3 x höher, er baut Fallen, er kann fast alles zu Waffen machen ( Straßenschilder, Sperre ) - er hat ne Lebensleiste von 1000 P....1 Schuß macht -7 P, ein Messer 3 P, eine Bärenfalle 5 P Schaden - rechnet selber wie lang man braucht - er selber macht pro Angriff um 25 % Schaden - bei einer 100 Leiste !!! das Spiel ist aber auf dem richtigen Weg - nur mehr Balance   The game is much better after the update - only 1 is bad - the Bigfoot is too strong (as AI or played by humans), it runs 3 times faster than a player, it jumps 3 times higher, it builds traps, it can almost turn everything into weapons (street signs, barrier) - he has a life bar of 1000 P .... 1 shot makes -7 P, a knife 3 P, a bear trap 5 P damage - calculates how long it takes - he does pro himself Attack by 25% damage - with a 100 bar !!! But the game is on the right track - just more balance
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 37h 29m Rec Positive Very nice Yes
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 136h 44m Rec Positive Good game should be on mac. If some are strong enough  Update: As of july 24th I am not recommending this game to anyone who doesn't have an epic games account our who doesn't want to link their steam account to an epic games account. Also I have a 3060ti and it only runs at 30 fps. 2nd Update: They removed the update back to 4.0 so now I can actually run the game without it freezing
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 60h 17m Rec Positive Najs
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 10h 13m Rec Positive Love the game would like it more if Bigfoot was more ape like but still enjoyable.
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 18h 49m Rec Positive игра классная всем рекомендую, но есть  1 минус для некоторых игроков-это отсутсвие ограничения фпс и изза этого выдеокарта больше нагревается.Прошу добавьте опцию ограничения фпс
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 50h 10m Rec Positive Great game, especially after 4.0 update. But I do have some things to say: Tree traps are annoying. You can't see them coming because their assets only load in when someone got trapped. There are some hard mechanics that I cant find an asnwer to, like what do I do when my character broke a limb? For newer players, finding safe codes are going to be hell. My advice on it: search not only the location where the safe is, but the neighboring ones too. Even if you think they're too far away.  Edit: Traps got quicktime events now, yay.

Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 5h 53m Rec Positive This is a fun multiplayer bout. haven't played the new update yet so my experience is pre version 4.0. but based off what I have played, I have enjoyed what little this game has to offer. Not to talk down to the game. having little to offer isn't bad if what is offered is done well. and I think it was done... mostly well.  The map is big and your one task is kill bigfoot. that isn't very doable with only one person so definitely invite some buddies to join in. With people, this is fun. on your own. not so much. if that sounds like a good time. pick it up. I've heard the new update added even more stuff so your experience will probably be even better than mine.
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 13h 16m Rec Positive good game big foot
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 9h 55m Rec Positive Good game and good idea, but does get boring after playing it for a couple days straight. Best recommendation if you want the game, spread the times you play this game apart and make sure you have friends too.

Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 9h 55m Rec Positive bigfoot touched me
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 63h 18m Rec Positive Initially, this game was fun and mildly interesting. But then version 4.0 came out and everything changed. Now that 4.0 is here, Bigfoot is very interesting and very exciting at first. Replayability really depends on the person; typically, you either beat Bigfoot once or twice and stop or you can play it many times over until you've seen just about everything. If you're familiar with the games Folklore Hunter and In Silence, think of Bigfoot as a cross between the two. Overall, good game, potentially has a lot of replayability (dependning on the player), not many others like this.

Date 2021-08-08 Playtime 102h 2m Rec Positive EDIT: Since the review, the game has improved.  >Keybinding support >Better balances >Better UI >Better gameplay mechanics  However, there is still a lot more to go in terms of overall progress, but this game is now looking to be POSITIVE.     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Interesting concept, but somehow game-play quality has degraded.  The previous version (which had been left untouched for a year) was actually playable. This game currently is one big bug, to put it simply.   >Bigfoot is too much of a tank (all of the firearms are essentially useless unless the player purposely plays bad) >The animations look like they have a slight case of muscular dystrophy >Unable to join other lobbies unless you change the download region (never seen that in a game before) >Graphics are cool, but it is just a terrible disguise to hide all of the internal game problems. >The AI somehow decreased in quality despite it taking the developers 1 year to make it better. (Can hit through walls, get stuck on objects, constantly attacks) >FOV is worse then looking into a kaleidoscope while being constantly fed shrooms.  >Movement is bland, jumping does nothing for bigfoot at all. Acceleration is non existent. >Key game-play mechanics like tracking bullets and flare stuns have been removed.

Date 2021-08-08 Playtime 32h 50m Rec Positive Bigfoot more like id rather stuff 3 bricks up my ass before i play this game again, it would be less painful than watching this games life threatening frame rate, in the original version of this game i found the bigfoot model with the vomit green eyes to be quite frightening but in the newer version they just replaced the bigfoot with a detailed model of Mark zuckerberg, the AI is almost as bad as Mark's in real life, this being said i felt like i was chasing a sacred hairy ballsack, throughout the game it was more like playing tag as a child but with a hint of ligma and alzheimer's.

Date 2021-08-08 Playtime 28h 34m Rec Negative Унылое гавно. Максимум раза 3-4 поиграть и всё.   - Геймплей сводится к поиску оружия, патронов и прочей фигни (которая вряд-ли поможет). AI Бигфуд ужасно предсказуем, каждую ночь, где бы ты не находился и как тихо не сидел, он находит тебя. Да, его можно вспугнуть 1 раз за ночь фальшфейером, он не надолго убежит. но потом вернётся и сломает лицо, потому что 2 выстрел лишь на время заstunет его на месте на пару секунд. Вы будет молиться, чтобы в следующем ящики Вам упала аптечка, но он не упадёт.  - Атмосфера. На 2-3 игры, потом всё. Крафта нет, стелса нет, динамики нет, аптечек - всегда мало. Единственное, на что годится эта игра, напугать друга в co-op, который боится хорроров

Date 2021-08-06 Playtime 27h 18m Rec Positive Ok so joined in last year or so. And now seeing the 4.0 update dropped. They've done incredible job. So much better looking. Scary as hell. Great options on game modes. Team of players again AI, Player Solo against AI and then Team of Players vs a player as BigFoot. That is a perfect selection. And looking forward to more work being added.

Date 2021-08-06 Playtime 14h 24m Rec Positive Ein nettes, Spaßiges Spiel vorallem wenn man es mit Freunden spielt :D Denke mit dem großen Update das hoffentlich bald kommt, wird das ganze noch mal spannender und sorgt für den ein oder anderen Lustigen Moment unter Freunden.  Von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung, für Leute die ein Spiel für ein paar lockere Spieleabende mit Freunden suchen ^^
Date 2021-08-05 Playtime 6h 48m Rec Positive I'm kinda mixed about this, but I'll recommend it for the concept.  The concept is great. All the stuff is here for a great game.   But the bad part about it, and I'm sure a lot of people will agree with me, is that there needs to be a lot more balance with Bigfoot.  He has WAY, WAY, WAY TOO MUCH health, and kills you very quickly. It took me 6 hours straight with a partner in co-op to kill this thing. If this game had some more balance (lower big foot health, spawned more often, did less damage, etc.) and had some bug fixes, it would be an amazing game. Like I said, concept is awesome but the execution isn't quite there.   I would wait to buy it on sale, or wait for an update to balance out the game.
Date 2021-08-05 Playtime 8h 58m Rec Negative My friend forced me to play this game. Sometimes u wish u could go back in time, atleast after u have played this buggy game.  Kiitti Arttu

Date 2021-08-02 Playtime 12h 22m Rec Positive хорошая игра
Date 2021-08-02 Playtime 18h 12m Rec Negative Игра не стоит своих денег СОВСЕМ. Я не знаю кто все эти люди, которые оставляют положительные отзывы.  Геймплей.  Разработчик заявляет о мифическом, скрытном и чрезвычайно хитром существе, якобы придётся постараться, чтобы поймать его. Что же на самом деле? Стелса здесь нет. К вам просто прилетает нечто и фигачит всю тимму, пока кто-то не спугнет его ракетницей. Сидите в доме/фургон? Ему плевать. Он откроет дверь, зайдёт и также начнёт колотить вас. И все, вот и весь геймлей. Ты не можешь прятаться от этого нечто, нельзя его обмануть. Рано или поздно он приходит к тебе и начинает сносить твои хп. Катастрофически мало взаимодействий с бигфутом.  Оптимизация. Ее просто нет. Неважно какое твоё железо,фпс будет скакать, будут фризы, особенно на локации с дождём. К слову о графики. Она здесь отвратительная. Снежная локация еще радует глаз, можно позалипать на северное сияние, но вот лес... Кислотно-блевотный дождь будет забирать твой фпс и желание смотреть на эти мерзко прорисованные текстуры с кучей дыр. Ужас. Баги. Баги. Баги. Их здесь миллион. Текстуры все дырявые. Достаточно сделать два шага и ты провалишься либо под карту, либо в текстуру, где бигфут не сможет тебя достать. Я понимаю, что игра вывозит чисто тем, что единственная в своём роде и аналогов нет, но это не повод ставить такой ценник и так забивать на качество. Оно должно соответствовать. Игра 4 года находится в раннем доступе и имеет столько багов и такое отвратное качество. Делайте меньше цену, тогда и претензий будет меньше, но пока что это нельзя назвать игрой,и даже то, что она в раннем доступе, не даёт право делать её с таким отношением. Разочаровала игра, не рекомендую никому.

Date 2021-07-31 Playtime 38h 0m Rec Negative Une IA complètement débile, des bugs à gogo, des ressources parfois insuffisantes. Dans l'état actuel du jeu le 31/07/2021 je ne peux que vous déconseiller ce jeu et vous orienté vers skinwalker qui est bien mieux réalisé avec peu de bug et un gameplay plus riche et plus angoissant. Malgré cela j'ai pris du plaisir dans l'ensemble à essayer de tué bigfoot.
Date 2021-07-31 Playtime 72h 47m Rec Positive Super good!
Date 2021-07-31 Playtime 20h 5m Rec Positive This is such an underrated game title. I have been playing this week and REALLY enjoying the unique take on the game. It reminds of the old Rake game, but very much improved and multiplayer. I can't wait for more!
Date 2021-07-30 Playtime 5h 31m Rec Positive It's really fun to be hunted by a big hairy monke inside a forest, that is more tanky than a literal tank.  
Date 2021-07-30 Playtime 3h 22m Rec Positive This game makes me feel some ways especially towards that hairy boi...

Date 2021-07-30 Playtime 6h 12m Rec Negative Somehow even buggier than the alpha version. If you want a bigfoot survival game play the free roblox version.  Bigfoot has more HP than an M1 abram tank and it spawns you with next to no supplies. Vs AI is alright but the AI is predictable, however PVP is terrible because there is nothing stopping the player controlled bigfoot from just constantly rushing you and spamming the roar ability to pinpoint where you are.

Date 2021-07-11 Playtime 5h 58m Rec Negative Bigfoot runs through the map like an bear stung by a killerhornet and is aggressiv like one.. Not the mysterious hunt that I expected where you can be happy if you got to see a glympse of bigfoot.    Also your weapon is against him as effektive as against a german Tiger Tank, wtf?

Date 2021-07-10 Playtime 121h 21m Rec Positive I like the idea of hunting Bigfoot while you yourself and friends are being hunted as well. I like how it is an AI and not another person which I feel would ruin this beautiful concept of a game. I love having traps, cameras, and all these various equipment you can use to fight bigfoot and I kind of wish there would be more added to the game, maybe better AI, more equipment. Anything would be nice. As of right now I highly recommend this game.

Date 2021-07-10 Playtime 1h 7m Rec Negative Shit game, do not buy. This shit is not scary, the AI sucks, and it takes fucking forever to kill the big man. It took me 5 minutes to discover that falling was more dangerous than Bigfoot. Do not buy, not worth it.
Date 2021-07-10 Playtime 1h 0m Rec Negative this game is trash. homie runs at like mach 5 towards you you shoot him once and since hes a lil bword aword fella he will run away at the same speed and then swoop around like a warthog and do a drive by on your aword while you do about 1/20th of his damage with 10 rounds of rifle ammo. bad game.

Date 2021-07-08 Playtime 5h 44m Rec Positive As a member of Washington State I thought a review was suitable since this is part of my culture. It is pretty true to life and this game is the most fun I've ever had in the entirety of any game I have ever played at all ever in my entire life. There is indeed big monke and he has the agility and speed of a cat. not only does he sucker punch you and run away leaving you with no health, he will eat your meat and gallop off into the night with barely any damage from the trap. I never killed him and will be returning the game but not at all because it's a bad game, the only disappointing part is that there is no way to romance big foot as I assumed this would be an enemies to lovers romance game. Also did not get feet pics 9/10
Date 2021-07-08 Playtime 84h 18m Rec Positive Bigfoot is a good game! Please get this game and get your friends to buy to hunt together against Bigfoot.

Date 2021-07-07 Playtime 6h 54m Rec Negative This game is totattly unrealistic when you camp out for a night with no trace out in the woods he always knows where you are even if your on the other side of the map. graphics are great so is the co-op but the fact that BIGFOOT HIMSELF HAS F****ING WALLS IS TOTTALY STUPID. Stop worrying about the looks and graphics focus On the gameplay DEVS! (same review as chaserr)
Date 2021-07-07 Playtime 68h 0m Rec Positive This game is the definition of an early access experience. Throughout years of playing i have seen this game develop itself and this is being written before update 4.0. Recommend for anyone willing to wait to see this game become a perfect multiplayer experience.

Date 2021-07-06 Playtime 1h 33m Rec Negative Oh my god I am more disappointed in this game than my parents are in me, and that's saying something.  I played it with mates and the only time we felt happy was when we closed it and requested a refund from steam.  The game isn't hard, just tedious and so mind numbing... it was plain boring.   If this was a title worth 5 AUD I wouldn't care but to charge 20 AUD for this POS... the balls on these developers.

Date 2021-07-06 Playtime 12h 0m Rec Positive игра классная но одному играть скучно!!!
Date 2021-07-06 Playtime 1h 10m Rec Negative I understand this game is early access and has in fact been updated quite a few times, but the core of the game is flawed.  Decisions such as Bigfoot's enormous hp pool to compensate for lack of interesting combat mechanics, no stamina bar coupled brutally slow movement, and struggle to find sufficient ammo plague this game.  I'd give the game a solid 4/10, which is so close to what it needs to be an acceptable game.
Date 2021-07-06 Playtime 5h 59m Rec Positive Its a fun game but you need to be with one friend or 3.

Shot it 50 times and only took a sliver of damage. On top of that, you are constantly getting attacked by bears and wolves

Date 2021-06-30 Playtime 1h 16m Rec Negative This game is just not good in its current state. The lack of guidance in terms of tutorials and such isn't balanced by any in-game mechanics, so half the time you spend trying to figure out what to do. My friends and I played for a couple hours and ran into bigfoot ONE time. I shot him and took maybe .27% of his health, he slapped me (but I didn't die) and that was it. We spent the entire rest of the game trying to figure out wtf to do, and honestly it was just super boring.  Game devs need to add more stuff to do throughout the maps (puzzles, better fights, etc.) and increase the amount of times you actually SEE bigfoot. Alternatively, they need to decrease bigfoot's health to account for the lack of bullets, ammo, and traps you have, and make it so you can actually track him instead of it just being RNG.
Date 2021-06-29 Playtime 32h 29m Rec Positive Twórcy staneli na wysokości zadania, owszem długo to trwało ,ale mogę z przyjemnością powiedzieć ,że z gry niegrywalnej stała się jedną z moich ulubionych. Funkcjonujący multiplayer, możliwość grania Wielką Stopą, lekka fabuła, nowe bronie to tylko cześć z nowej zawartości. Stanowczo warta uwagi.

Date 2021-06-28 Playtime 1h 21m Rec Negative trash game, walking simulator 101, had to search up a map for all landmarks to just find ammo because you get so little of it. Then had to walk around the map for 30 min just to find ammo. Graphics look like trash and the game also preforms like trash. Don't buy this, it isn't no where near worth the full price.

Date 2021-06-28 Playtime 5h 33m Rec Positive this game was overpriced for how repetitive it was and boring i would not recommend.my friend got thrown by a naked man (edit) as of update 4.0 great game and very fun. Best played with 3 or more friends even when bigfoot is a player.
Date 2021-06-28 Playtime 2h 44m Rec Negative Unfortunately this is game is not what I expected. Don't get me wrong the game's content is great I like the whole idea of it, however it was wayyy to buggy when I tried to play it with my friends. It would start out fine but then we would have to keep remaking games since the game would have technical issues; falling through the map, falling out of the sky when logging back in to the game, getting stuck to bigfoot, etc. Eventually my friends and I gave up on trying to play it, but I would re-download it again if they can fix all the bugs because it genuinely was fun when it was working at some points.
Date 2021-06-28 Playtime 1h 42m Rec Negative This game was released on Jan 31, 2017 and has not seen any bug fixes (to my knowledge) since. Some problems include: Not returning after your friends heal you, no selection of options when trying to give stuff to friend or lighting fires and when big foot attacks you your player is messed up afterwards. Although now might be different to when it was still a beta game.
Date 2021-06-28 Playtime 2h 27m Rec Negative Eh... its not what its hyped up to be, there are some bugs, and 6 shots to the face wont kill BF, and he will just toss you about. More fun with friends, but if i could id get a refund.

Date 2021-06-27 Playtime 35h 59m Rec Positive IS FUN
Date 2021-06-27 Playtime 0h 53m Rec Negative i literally played with 4 people and somehow the first time we found bigfoot we got rko'd immediately and almost killed us all despite us using all our ammo on him while he only took a slither of damage and then after he proceeds to waddle away at the speed of light, i feel ripped off and i would still feel ripped off even if this game was free like the big foot monke does not outway the feeling of being rko'd 3 times then chasing a waddling bigfoot that looks like an incel who dosent shave
Date 2021-06-27 Playtime 0h 54m Rec Negative This has the same worth of a free game.  Most fun part was hearing him scream with primal rage then aggressively waddle towards me and my friends and body slam my friend. Second most fun part was laughing hysterically at the fact my friends got R.K.O'd by FUCKING BIGFOOT. Almost everything is bad except the graphics and even those are trash. Please don't buy this game unless you like disappointment. (Also why tf does the trailer show everything BUT hunting bigfoot????)
Date 2021-06-27 Playtime 1h 6m Rec Negative I am tempted to positively review this. The reason for this, is monke. However, you are not given nearly enough supplies to do even 10% of bigfoot's health. My group of four fired all of the ammo given to you, and he was barely scratched. After running out of medkits 10 minutes in, the entire group was downed scattered across the map. Every time I found bigfoot alone, he sprinted to the opposite direction, being tracked to the complete other side of the map, only to run again. If he however decides to hunt you instead, he rko's you within seconds and then vanishes before you can react.   Overall, the bad outweighs the monke.
Date 2021-06-27 Playtime 0h 56m Rec Negative Bigfoot runs a impossible speed, was standing there hear him roar 1 second later get rko'd by him, the most entertaining part of it was making fun of it, pretty shit game tbh, its been out for 4 years and this is the product I payed 10 dollars for actual trash, cant even hit him at all, he runs way to fast
Date 2021-06-26 Playtime 3h 45m Rec Negative Pretty much running simulator. I tried playing solo, and then with my friends. We can't kill BIGFOOT. There are not enough resources.

Date 2021-06-26 Playtime 0h 56m Rec Negative [h1]Nah.[/h1] The game looked promising from the video and screenshots on the store page but overall it feels choppy and boring.    A majority of the time, I had [b]headache-inducing micro framerate chops[/b] [i]even though[/i] the steam overlay is telling me I'm getting [b]75 FPS[/b]. Bigfoot comes out of nowhere and attacks you with [b]no element of stalking or a predator/prey relationship[/b]; [u]it sprints out of a bush, charges you, hits you until you get knocked down, and then goes for your friend or continues [/u][i][u]pummeling[/u][/i][u] you[/u]. This game gives me the continuous "[b]what in the fuck do I do?[/b]" feeling and the [b]migraine-milking FPS chop[/b] makes it worse. After roughly [b]56 minutes[/b] of wandering, we managed to burn through all our first-aid and most of our rifle rounds while only doing 15% damage to Bigfoot.   If you want to support development so that eventually the game will become the gem it aspires to be, go ahead! It is pretty cheap. Otherwise, put this game in the back of your mind for the future in case the game improves.   In my most humble summary,    [b]it smells.[/b]

Just want to play against a player controlled bigfoot who will absolutely obliterate you regardless of the time of day? = Will enjoy this game.  Pros: Can be scary and semi fun to play against AI bigfoot and can fight back against the AI bigfoot.  con: If bigfoot is a player they will absolutely obliterate you. You cannot outrun bigfoot. You can barely damage bigfoot. Player bigfoot will also obliterate you during the day. You will die in vain, as player bigfoot is not scared of weapons during the day or night because of how pathetic their damage is.

Date 2021-06-22 Playtime 43h 43m Rec Positive I bought this game when it came out a couple years ago. It's a fun game, but it still feels unfinished. I have seen this game improve over the years. It's a lot better now then it was all those years ago.  Bigfoot is still very glitched and he is impossible to kill, if he is not glitching.  Me and my friends have managed to kill him multiple times while he was stuck glitching somewhere, because that's the only way you can kill him. If you want a finished, non-glitching game I do not recommend Bigfoot.

Date 2021-06-20 Playtime 9h 21m Rec Positive Hallo zusammen, In meinem heutigen Spieltest sind mir viele gute und wenige schlechte Dinge aufgefallen. Zum einem fand ich die Grafik sehr gut und die Atmosphäre im Spiel. Außerdem war meines Erachtens nach die Geräusch Kulisse Überwältigend. Nun möchte ich aber auch meine negativen Erfahrungen nennen. Die Zeit bis Bigfoot kommt, dauert etwas lange. Außerdem würde ich den Entwicklern empfehlen, die Grafik zu Optimieren, weil meine Grafikkarte sehr heiß wird.  Im ganzen finde ich das Game sehr gut und auch spannend.  Liebe Grüße Grantelbart der GAMER    Hello everybody, In my game test today, I noticed a lot of good things and a few bad things. On the one hand, I found the graphics to be very good and the atmosphere in the game. In addition, the background noise was overwhelming. But now I would also like to mention my negative experiences. It takes a long time for Bigfoot to arrive. I would also recommend that developers tweak the graphics because my graphics card gets very hot.  Overall, I think the game is very good and also exciting.  Greetings, Grantelbart der GAMER

Date 2021-06-14 Playtime 3h 19m Rec Negative Had a bit of potential but, it definitely didn't and wasn't finished/near. With the amount of supplies/how limited you are in terms of supplies it's not enough.  I don't know who or why everyone is saying it's good. Too much health for just limited supplies. And when we run out, can't do much. Even bullets don't work as much.
Date 2021-06-14 Playtime 3h 10m Rec Negative For those who want to play this game, I do not recommend it due to the lack of supplies the game gives you. It is almost impossible to kill Bigfoot without any glitches. We tried for 3 hours and our best run was doing 20% damage with all our supplies. Devs need to add more supplies, instructions, and lower the health of Bigfoot. Game definitely has potential but needs a lot of hot fixes.
Date 2021-06-13 Playtime 18h 17m Rec Positive this game is fun you can play with friends and it is just super fun 
Date 2021-06-13 Playtime 6h 4m Rec Negative Decent graphics but the game was pretty boring. The first interaction with Bigfoot was thrilling, but that wore off quick. Shot him several times and barely put a dent in his health. Not interesting enough to try and figure out how to take bigfoot down. The world feels empty and lifeless.

Date 2021-06-11 Playtime 45h 4m Rec Negative Here are a list of pros and cons: Pros: -Great Graphics -Good Story -Gameplay is alright Cons: -Bigfoot has too much health -You have to hit every single shot in order to kill him -Not enough loot around the map -Bugs Me and my friend were playing for 4 hours + and we never could kill him. We tried different strategies to kill him but we never could. This was due to the amount of bugs in the game, sometimes bigfoot would just get stuck on the trailer and he couldn't move until you got close to him which then he came after you. Another problem is the lack amount of loot. The more people that are playing, the more loot will spawn and a increase in bigfoots health. But there still isn't enough loot in the game. If your wanting to buy this game, expect a lot of bugs and a very hard time killing bigfoot but if you like a challenge and are ok with the bugs then go ahead.

Date 2021-06-07 Playtime 4h 52m Rec Negative This game is fun, and the graphics are nice... however it is very unoptimized and it seems the devs forgot about the game.  It is very difficult to kill or even capture Bigfoot.... like a ridiculous amount of firepower.  Something about it is so lacking and uneven... worth playing maybe, for free.

Date 2021-06-07 Playtime 8h 15m Rec Negative Не очень понравилась эта игра , так как не хватает ресурсов на карте.В начале можно залутать всё,  потратить сразу ,а потом бегать за монстром с палкой по всей карте ,а у него полная полоска здоровья. Если играть ночью и на лесной карте будет интересно, но только с друзьями но на много часов эта игра нет протянет.

Two friends and I spent almost an hour trying to find bigfoot, only to have two of us one shot and the other kill bigfoot with a knife while he stood there frozen.  On the plus side, 63 minutes in and we completed all the objectives.  Just enough time to get a refund.

Date 2021-06-03 Playtime 1h 12m Rec Negative Not a fun game by itself. The only crumb of enjoyment I got out of it was hearing my friends scream at the mere sight of the monster monkey. I have no clue how people can play this for more than an hour and not feel like your brain cells are deteriorating. TERRIBLE graphics for its price point. Great concept but terribly executed. If you liked the game try Phasmophobia similar and also way more spooky.
Date 2021-06-03 Playtime 1h 21m Rec Negative It was very fun and cool entering a new game clueless of what to do at first, but later becomes very irritating and annoying that game gives you no information on what to do and it is almost impossible to kill Bigfoot. I do not recommend this game because it is really not done.

Date 2021-06-03 Playtime 7h 17m Rec Negative no sense of direction, doesnt give you any basic information on how to trap or kill bigfoot, not enough ammo just to straight up shoot him to death. also you could plant meat for him hide in the house he wont go after the meat breaks open the door and beat the hell out of you. there is no way to win this game i wish i would get my money back but steam shafted me with the two hour play return rule but when you play this game it will literally take you two hours just to get you bearing in the game and still get F***

Date 2021-06-02 Playtime 1h 59m Rec Negative The concept seems amazing but this game is just downright awful after a few playthroughs. I do not recommend getting this game if you plan on playing alone or with random people. The only slight instance of fun that occurred during my time playing was when I was playing with friends.   The devs really need to work on this game.  Glad I got to see a monke though

Date 2021-05-30 Playtime 26h 51m Rec Positive Ha bisogno di aiuto questo BIGFOOT. Il gioco è interessante ma ha evidenti problemi sia negli attacchi del bigfoot, sia nella ricerca degli oggetti necessari per terminare la partita. Se il bigfoot attacca e non si hanno oggetti utili, risulta impossibile scappare o nascondersi senza l'utilizzo di bug... Aggiornatelo... perchè il bigfoot si incastra nelle rocce mentre è in giro... e se non lo ritrovate la partita diventa letteralmente infinita.

Date 2021-05-29 Playtime 1h 40m Rec Negative I love the concept. Unfortunately, I have requested a refund.  The game feels very shallow and unfun in its current state. Bigfoot just comes to me, making traps, cameras, and attempts to track him feel pointless. He seems to have a massive health pool, and bullets don't do much to decrease it. Bigfoot is super fast and employs mostly hit-and-run tactics if he doesn't just kill me immediately. Supplies are limited. And it doesn't seem like you can effectively hide from him. So combat feels very imbalanced in his favor.  I would definitely give the game another try in the future if it receives significant balance changes and updates to how the gameplay loop plays out.
Date 2021-05-29 Playtime 1h 32m Rec Negative This game is cool for like 10mins then gets boring quick. Watched this game when first came out after playing nothing really changed. Don't why this game is still on steam for sale.

Date 2021-05-28 Playtime 1h 15m Rec Negative This game just feels unfinished. It really is impossible to kill bigfoot without some sort of glitch. The game does not give you enough supplies, even with exploring the map/camps. It was fun to play one time with friends, but there is no replay value. Super overpriced. A lot of potential if the devs ever give it love.
Date 2021-05-28 Playtime 5h 0m Rec Positive My Friend Shannon got me this game and all she did was yell at me and make me feel bad saying I don't talk and I never take the lead and that i hate the game but I was having fun this game likes a 10/10 with people who don't shit on you all game

Date 2021-05-27 Playtime 1h 27m Rec Negative Esta muy buena la idea, pero el mapa es ENORME, y se hace muy tedioso andar caminando por todo el mapa para explorar. Literalmente estas 1 hora recorriendo el mapa y capaz no encontras todo. Estan buenas las mecanicas del juego, en sentido de poner trampas, atraerlo con comida, pero literalmente dura 1 segundo y se escapa y te entra a dar guantazos a lo loco y te mata de 2, 3 golpes. Basicamente depende de tener las balas suficientes para ir bajandolo y una vez que lo matas termina el juego. Muy buena idea, pero mapa excesivamente grande, mecanicas flojas, ambiente 6/10.
Date 2021-05-26 Playtime 1h 38m Rec Positive Fun game to play with friends but hard
Date 2021-05-26 Playtime 128h 44m Rec Positive PLS!!
Date 2021-05-26 Playtime 25h 33m Rec Positive Aaah.. BIGFOOT... C'est un jeu d'horreur qui m'attirais pas mal à l'époque, je l'ai donc pris cette année et j'y ai joué avec deux potes, les premières heures de jeu sont assez fun, on flippe, le pelo nous poursuit tu vois les bails. Puis après quelques heures de jeu on commence à vouloir finir la première map donc on commence à jouer "safe" et on essaie d'abattre la grosse boule de poils.   J'en viens donc au premier soucis de gameplay, les loots sont aléatoires ce qui fait donc que soit on se retrouve avec beaucoup de soins et peu de munitions ou soit c'est l'inverse donc pour 3 joueurs c'est vraiment difficile d'arriver à la fin avec peu de balles.. En solo c'est clairement faisable, n'ayez pas peur.   Ensuite le deuxième soucis qui est que le drone qu'on nous donne bug à certains moments, il tombe aléatoirement ce qui le détruit pour rien.. Assez désagréable quand on veut s'occuper pendant la nuit.  Et j'en viens au dernier soucis, c'est peut-être fait exprès j'en ai aucune idée mais je préfère en parler. Les corps des campeurs décédés... On doit en trouver plusieurs dans la map mais après quelques games de "tryhard", IMPOSSIBLE de trouver tous les corps, on en trouve toujours 3, même après avoir chercher dans tous les spawn possibles...  Le jeu est encore en early acces donc il peut encore s'améliorer ! Hâte de voir les prochaines mises à jour, il a un grand potentiel, à suivre de près.

Date 2021-05-25 Playtime 7h 22m Rec Positive this game is unique, and it's not for everyone. a lot of people won't like this game, i personally do but i understand why others don't, the game needs a LOT of work, it's very buggy and has lots of problems, but even then it can still be enjoyable, walking through the dark woods with your friends searching for supplies to survive and defeat the monster lurking somewhere out there.        big monke choke slammed me then ran away

Date 2021-05-24 Playtime 11h 26m Rec Positive Oh my god this game had me scared shitless. I loved it anyways and enjoyed my time playing it. 100% going to be playing in the future with friends. A few kinks and bugs yet fun as hell. 10/10 because Monke Man stole my wife (I hated her anyways)

Date 2021-05-23 Playtime 35h 18m Rec Positive Игра понравилась, но с друзьями. В кооперативе игру проходить весело и это самое главное. Когда проходишь игру в одиночку, встречается ряд проблем.  ▪︎Хотелось отметить долгою прогулку по лесу, с целью неожиданной встречи с большим и лохматым гигантом. ▪︎Проблема с сохранением в кооперативном режиме.  ▪︎Полное нежелание(говорю про себя) играть в игру после убийства BIGFOOTа на обоих картах. После выполнения главной задачи игры - убийства снежного человека, играть дальше не имеет смысла. Но так как это ранний доступ, игра будет дальше обновляться, и вскоре(я надеюсь) выше упомянутые проблемы исчезнут.

Date 2021-05-21 Playtime 0h 10m Rec Negative Wouldn't even let me into the game. I got this game three days ago, and it downloaded fine. I then started the game, but it wouldn't open properly. This game is either broken, OR is just bugged too bad. I requested a refund, so I do NOT recommend this game.
Date 2021-05-20 Playtime 0h 31m Rec Negative Found mjolnir, but that was the only upside playing this game.
Date 2021-05-20 Playtime 52h 2m Rec Positive Ein wirklich tolles Spiel mit viel Spielspaß. Freue mich schon sehr auf das Update
Date 2021-05-20 Playtime 107h 44m Rec Positive This game is really fun if you can get your friends on, I can't wait to see it fully out. I feel like Bigfoot be a bit OP but it is early access sooo yea. BigFoot kinda be scary :0

Date 2021-05-19 Playtime 12h 47m Rec Positive This game is piece of shiet. Big gorrila is in the jungle and running doing nothing but ruining my life. I hate this game becuase I got jumpscare by gorrila in jungle. This game is like i imagine a mystery. As you guys can see I have a lot of hours in this game so i know what im saying. I payed 100 American dolars for this game and im dispaintend. I prefer golf with my friends and amogus nights. There is a bug in which when I rejoin to multiplier game in snow world I fuckind die. Like what the fuck dude what is this shiet. Graphics are pretty good. t=The gameplay is amazing. 0/10. But there is a mystery going on. The big gorilla in jungle is white when its snowing. I thinks It's a paradox becuase. I would recommend this game for everyone. Mystery is suspicious and the only way to kill the gorilla is to shoot him 1 million times with sniper rifle this is very annoying and fuicking stupid like dude what the foiac . The game have problems with shadows if you set shadows to low its 1000 times brigher like WHAT FAUSCK. Thjis game is really cool but i thinks its not. Thanks for playing my game.

Date 2021-05-18 Playtime 0h 31m Rec Positive Played for 31 minutes or so... Bigfoot runs up and very glitchy-like slams me on the ground and then runs away lookin like a B movie extra. Needs work, but I guess I get it. I'm not going to not recommend just because I don't like it, but there are better games out there for the price tag for the quality of this game.

Date 2021-05-16 Playtime 6h 30m Rec Positive Редактирую обзор из-за глобального обновления 4.0. После РЕЛИЗА нового, бесплатного обновления в BIGFOOT я на радость был удивлён что компания CyberLight Games решилась на улучшение своего продукта! Игра получилась достаточно хорошей и наконец "почти" доработанной. Появились новые возможности, новые механики, а так же как по мне хороший ИИ. Но и без минусов не обойтись!  1. Лобби : Лобби стало достаточно красивым но "кривым". Не ровный таймер, шрифты портят впечатление о игровом процессе, т.к это именно то что требует внимания. Лобби очень важная вещь в играх, это то что игрок видит впервые когда заходит в игру. Не стоит портит впечатление о игре на этом этапе. 2. Анимации оружия : О анимациях оружия и звука я вообще молчу.. Персанаж держит оружие и пистолет так, как буд-то из далёкой CS 1.6.. Кривые модельки и так далее портят впечатление. Стоит хорошенько поработать! В общем и целом игра почти доведена до идеала. У игры хорошее будущее и потенциал. Спасибо разработчикам CyberLight Games за такую "страшилку".
Date 2021-05-16 Playtime 0h 6m Rec Negative the game wont even let me in i uninstalled it and installed it again and all it does is says is steam is prepairing to open it and then gos  away then nothing happens its so dumb.
Date 2021-05-16 Playtime 1h 24m Rec Positive Игра довольно классная, да и страшная. Была конечно проблема, но её исправили. А так игра в принципе нормальная.
Date 2021-05-16 Playtime 2h 53m Rec Negative people dont buy this game its boring and a short game. you find end game loot when you start. Its not worth it 
Date 2021-05-16 Playtime 16h 18m Rec Positive So there I am, me R. in the forest expecting this to be easy. False, Bigfoot does exist and this game will prove it. You need the brains and the firepower to overcome Bigfoot's big brain and his uprising strength. also here are some strategies for the game from the great R. #1 when it's night Bigfoot starts literally stalking you and will hunt you down till you are dead. #2 always keep your bullets on tracking just in case of an encounter #3 Bigfoot is scared of flares/rockets shot from your flare gun #4 try and hunker down for the night in a safe space #5 there are some locations around the map containing some useful items #6 play with other people, that makes it 0.005x easier  there are some basic tips Good luck  wish you luck -R

Date 2021-05-14 Playtime 20h 30m Rec Positive wowo this game is super good idea but the mechanics of the bigfoot himself need work, when he is low he just runs into you then hits you and runs away and you be hunting him for hours with no ammo to actually shoot him until all your friends eventually log off.

Date 2021-05-12 Playtime 28h 26m Rec Positive Игра понравилась, но есть ряд косяков, к примеру охотник медленно ходит и постоянно бесит его усталость, лучше сделать бесконечный шифт, т.к. этот Усэн Болт бегает со скоростью света и его хер догонишь. Иногда он багуется на болоте, бегает просто туда сюда и все, так же багуется в трейлере в начале игры, если подходить к двери и к окну, то он будет туда сюда бегать. Совет: ставьте капканы по всей карте, он рано или поздно сам их все соберет, обязательно маскируйте их и ставьте мясо.

Date 2021-05-12 Playtime 1h 0m Rec Negative This game has clearly been abandoned, much like you will be in life and in this game when you’re tasked to hunt the meandering hulk known as the Sasquatch. He keeps killing me and I don’t think he’s beatable. I’ve also tried to make him a pet to no avail. 1 star down.

Date 2021-05-08 Playtime 11h 48m Rec Positive Clairement inspiré de Rake, Bigfoot ne brille peut-être par par son contenu mais il a tout dans son concept de chasse à la créature paranormale quelque chose d'intéressant et prometteur si le jeu venait à recevoir des mises à jour plus conséquentes. Malheureusement des jeux bien que différents mais dans un style similaire comme Phasmo le dépassent largement, en moins de temps et pour moins cher. Mais reste que c'est un jeu à tester si on aime vraiment ce qui entoure le paranormal et la chasse. Autour de la cryptoozologie j'ai aussi entendu parler du jeu HellSign qui rend hommage à sa façon a Supernatural. Il faudra que je le teste mais son gameplay semble radicalement différent de ce jeu-ci qui a opté pour la vue FPS.

It takes 7 hours to kill the fat monke, you need to wait 5 hours for your teammates to find a medkit and revive you if you're down. Because I spent most of the time waiting for my teammates to revive me, steam won't let me refund this game. If I could, without hesitation, I would refund it. fix your game.

Date 2021-04-26 Playtime 98h 50m Rec Positive Bigfoot beat me to death with a stop sigh. 10/10 would get head trauma again. 
Date 2021-04-26 Playtime 3h 49m Rec Negative The traps dont work he just constantly comes at you, runs away and then comes at you again on repeat never goes for traps making it impossible to kill him. Not enough supplies leaves the player completely outmatched. had high hopes for this game so I hope it gets improved soon

Date 2021-04-25 Playtime 9h 32m Rec Positive very buggy game, bigfoot (and yeti) gets constantly stuck in place, thats the only way you can kill him, if he gets stuck and you knife him. there are not enough bullets and medkits on the map to kill him otherwise. though its very fun to play with friends, so i recommend it otherwise

Date 2021-04-25 Playtime 23h 59m Rec Positive EZ, lul. All you do is go to the miners cave, wait for bigfoot to run at you. He gets stuck on the door, if you dont shoot a flare at him he wont run away. Just keep shooting/stabbing that idiotic monkey man and you win. Bigfoot deis and cries that were a camping hack.   In all seriousness I did have fun plasying this game, but I think you need to fix that so I cant just absolutely dominate bigfoot in that cave.

Date 2021-04-21 Playtime 1h 45m Rec Negative [b] Please do yourself a flavor and don't purchase this game. [/b] It looks like an indie developer made it and the Bigfoot mechanics are very bad. This game has been in early access for 4 years which makes me doubt it will ever get any better.  I also managed to beat it before the two hour window for my refund. How does $15.99 for less than two hours of "entertainment" sound?
Date 2021-04-21 Playtime 1h 44m Rec Negative Dont reccomend
Date 2021-04-21 Playtime 7h 29m Rec Negative Not fun. The inventory system is weird asf, takes forever to kill him, but he can just barge right into the trailer and kill you when he wants to. don't waste you're money on this, and if you did, get it refunded.
Date 2021-04-21 Playtime 1h 26m Rec Negative The hairy man ran away for almost two hours until we ran out of supplies and jumped off the cliff to end our suffering 2/10 funny until after the first interaction

Date 2021-04-20 Playtime 2h 44m Rec Positive Fun, and good graphics, but lack of controller support makes it sit on the shelf.
Date 2021-04-20 Playtime 9h 25m Rec Negative I loved this game. The main idea is exciting and it's a fun game if you're patient. Don't listen to people who say you can't get enough supplies to win. But now heed my warning. The second map in the game sucks and the devs haven't touched the game in forever. This game has potential however I can't recommend it if the devs are never gonna fix the crazy bugs, not worth 15.99 in it's current state.
Date 2021-04-20 Playtime 29h 7m Rec Positive pretty sure steph currys in this game
Date 2021-04-20 Playtime 51h 42m Rec Positive The game is very creepy at most points you have to hunt and go out so you cant stay safe.
Date 2021-04-20 Playtime 1h 35m Rec Negative Its a  fucking terrible game dont recommend had to turn all my settings down so i cloud play and you never have a enough supplies to beat Bigfoot and the supplies you find dont help you
Date 2021-04-19 Playtime 15h 28m Rec Positive Who doesn't wanna kill bigfoot.
Date 2021-04-19 Playtime 8h 40m Rec Positive It's a cool game that you can play well with friends. I myself have often been frightened and sometimes afraid
Date 2021-04-19 Playtime 3h 12m Rec Positive Love this game! Don't listen to others that say this game isn't worth it because it is worth it! Yes the game needs some tweaking but you got to remember its an Early Access title. This game has a lot of potential and I fully back the development team! Me and my friends have played and enjoyed it and look forward for more countless hours of being chased by Bigfoot through the woods and trying to survive the other predators that lurk in the woods. Y'all are doing amazing work and hope to see more of what you have coming to this game CyberLight!
Date 2021-04-19 Playtime 26h 44m Rec Positive no
Date 2021-04-18 Playtime 0h 41m Rec Negative this is a very bad game. he said choosing his words carefully! the intro of the helicopter landing in the forest missing the trees should be a warning, it just gets worse...pointless. I want my soul back ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Date 2021-04-18 Playtime 2h 12m Rec Negative The game has some potential to be fun, and in theory should run on a potato, but I had all kinds of weird system behaviour when I ran this.  My system is more than capable of running this on paper, but I would get lots of crashes, temp\usage spikes etc.   Game is very slow moving compared to similar titles.

Date 2021-04-14 Playtime 6h 55m Rec Positive Absolutely, what a phenomenal experience hunting this great majestic beast was. This game will turn boys into men, and men into boys. Multiple of my comrades wept as Bigfoot's health bar slowly depleted until there was nothing less and we were left with no option but to end his suffering. You learn so much about not only yourself but your friends as well, I lost 3 friends in real life to this game. The sudden realisation that they would never amount to as much as the hunters we were within the game was too much for them and they could not continue knowing they would never be the men we were within this game. This game is not for the faint of heart and should be played knowing that for many, you cannot complete the game for the game shall complete you and shall be left with nothing.

I never said thatt I swear. But yeah get this game if you like feet but not that I do or anything *sweats nervously
Date 2021-04-11 Playtime 12h 29m Rec Positive It's a great game for people who want adventure and some jump scares. All in all not too scary! I like it a lot, and I can get spooked easy... lol Good graphics and you can play with your friends or random people. Super Fun!

Date 2021-04-10 Playtime 12h 17m Rec Positive Tryharded to get him for six hours now and everytime bigfoot bugged himself somehow. Impossible to win the game sadly. Eventho it makes fun.  Edit: Since 4.0 Release it's finally worth to play. But 20 Bucks could be a little much. The atmosphere is so great.
Date 2021-04-09 Playtime 17h 58m Rec Negative There are a lot of bogus positive reviews of this game. If you read the negative ones, they sort of sum up the end results of playing this game, but they do not give you any details on why it is / can be fun.  This game, as many of the negative reviews state, starts out really well, but leaves much to be desired. I will list the pro’s and con’s as I found them, but a quick summary would be simply to say that this game, like many EA / In development games, leaves you feeling like you were duped.  Pros:  1. Beginning storyline and environment setup is really great. I actually felt both spooked and excited to try this game out. The first time BF attacked me, I got the rush of adrenaline and felt the fear that I was hoping for. Really great beginning! Some good laughs, especially with Friends. The times where BF attacks your group and everyone is running around shooting chaotically, or when BF throws one of your pals off a mountain...all sort of lend to the potential memories you could have with a game like this.  2. The environment starts and continues to be quite nice imo. The music, clue discovery and encounter sounds all lend to a nice, and immersive ambiance.   3. Some neat bells and whistles like the drone and cameras, as well as tracking bullets.  Cons: 1. Seems like Developers took the money and ran. It’s clear that there hasn’t been a real update in a very long time, and promised updates are nowhere in sight.   2. As many others have stated already, once you sort of encounter BF a few times, the game becomes very boring, very quickly.   3. Supplies are too limited to make it interesting. It would make more sense to have too many supplies and more AI to use them up than what is currently in place. You can kill BF with the allowed supplies, but its a very precise calculation. Deviate from a planned approach at all, and you will not have enough of something.  4 .Bugs are in every EA game, but when the obvious way to kill BF is the main bug, it sort of takes the joy of out fighting him.  5. BF AI is sort of wacky. Definitely needs refinement and tuning. Don’t just have him appear out of nowhere beat on you and run away. Every time….easy to lose interest in this approach and easy to overcome.  6. More content needed desperately. Play the main mission once and its pretty much the same. Stick a fork in BF, he is done. Add more maps, random BF variations, AI tactics, more environmental hazards, etc. This game is a one shot one hit (less than) wonder in its current form.   7. Soooo much potential...that is just sitting idly by. Kinda feels bad that a game that perks my interest so easily ends up being anticlimactic in about 2 hours.  Summary: Perhaps this game is worth a few laughs with friends when it’s on sale for 4.99. Outside of that, I would not recommend. I would not want to give the Dev’s any more money to support their Fortnite habits, or whatever they do with their time. Perhaps there is hope for a game like Folklore Hunter instead to have a BF type creature in one of its future DLCs.

Date 2021-04-09 Playtime 31h 18m Rec Positive i will be honest this is one of the best and well made games i have ever played. it offers a challenge to the player forcing them to leave the safe spots to win. this makes the number one spot on my top ten best games i have ever played list. i recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure games... or fnaf. which is why it hurt when my computer broke and i borrowed someone else's computer and played it. however when i got my new one this game was the first redownlode i made, but anytime i try to launch it it says game running i have done everything possible to fix it but it just wont work, i have played other games alot since then and sometimes they do the same thing but to fix it all i have to do is backup game files but the only game that this does not work for appears to be this game. so steam cyberlight games please fix this i have 13.7 hours on record and just want to play the game again.

Date 2021-03-23 Playtime 2h 5m Rec Negative I cannot believe I paid actual money on this game. The devs should be ashamed for creating this monstrosity they call a game. Absolutely unbelievable and very sad. Incredibly disappointed and it offended me so much I am going to remove the game completely off my steam store so it wont grace my presence ever again.

Date 2021-03-22 Playtime 52h 35m Rec Positive jfjjf
Date 2021-03-22 Playtime 2h 12m Rec Positive Ill start out by saying this, the first go is pretty exciting, thrilling, and spooky due to the anticipation of finally seeing him and being fucked by this big ass MONKE. This is how my only 3 attempts in the game went.  -1: Trudged around for a bout 30 minutes with a friend. We split up to go check out two different areas. I find myself up in a hunting tower when big foot decides he wants to come on out finally to clap some cheeks. He breaks the hunting tower im standing in causing me to fall through the stairs and get absolutely bodied by his big ol' monke hands. After having beat me into the ground a few solid inches he takes off in search of my friend. After trying to stand up, i come to the realization that i cant move. I am now one with the remainder of the hunting tower's staircase. Tried everything in the books to escape for a solid 20 minutes with no success. Leave the game because now i was forced to wait until monke man showed back up to finish the job.  -2: Monke man (after about 35 minutes) attacked us both back to back, and pretty much insta killed us.  -3: Big boi killed my boi while he was looking at cams in the camper. I let him leave, place all the fookin' traps i had around every entrance and waited as my boi listened to spotify and scrolled through tinder while waiting for me to also die. Monke man returns. Hits every one of my traps, i dump about 40 shots into him only for him to finally make it inside the camper to also kill me. Beats me into the ground in the corner near the computer. I get back up shortly later and slip past him only to realize the dumb ape had gotten himself stuck in the corner. Now glitched and with no way to defend himself, i stabbed him repeatedly in the ass until he was very much so dead.   -rating 5/10  apex monke man cant walk in small space, gets stabbed to death in rv because human brain=smarter than monke brain. Would recommend for the first hour or two, after that it loses its allure. Plus getting stuck between objects only to have to finangle your way out or be stuck there and die is pretty.. cancerous.

Date 2021-03-19 Playtime 3h 52m Rec Negative I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GAME AT THIS TIME. This game could have a lot of potential to it IF it was actually worked on and the bugs fixed, I played this with 3 of my friends and it was HORRIBLE. Bigfoot was Way to hard to kill, we couldn't find enough health packs or ammo to support all 4 of us, even though i read somewhere the game is supposed to up the supplies you get for each person playing, we found every item we could and we had more tracking bullets then actually bullets to kill him. we all died off because we couldn't find health packs to keep us all alive, the other thing that sucked was the players that were 'killed' never truly died, they just stayed on the ground while the rest of us walked around . I can see this game becoming something great if they fix the bugs, and make Multiplayer and the game in general Better. I have not tried Single player, as i don't intend to play this without friends so i cant speak for how that runs.

Date 2021-03-16 Playtime 1h 42m Rec Negative Its meh, honestly. Starts out fun, but gets boring fast. I thought it would be more of actually trying to find clues to find bigfoot, but he attacks wherever you are every day. So you can just sit there and wait for him.
Date 2021-03-16 Playtime 8h 16m Rec Positive This game will instill the true fear of god into your heart. Bigfoot is superior to you in every way, Bigfoot is the Messiah of Emasculation. After countless attempts to defeat Bigfoot to succeed only once, Bigfoot proved to one up me regardless. From beyond the game, Bigfoot would go on to take my wife, managing to make her cum 5 times in the timespan of 30 seconds. Bigfoot developed a stronger bond with my son, proving to have been a better father figure to him than i could have ever dreamed of. He would live on to walk my daughter down the aisle on her wedding day, forever holding her heart as her surrogate daddy. He would impress my own father, taking my place as the heir to the family business, becoming the boy he could be proud of. Bigfoot destroyed me, he made me into a husk of the being i once was. 10/10 fun with friends :D
Date 2021-03-16 Playtime 9h 56m Rec Positive Big foot, the big bitch he is, did steal my fucking body at least once. For an hour, i was just a concept. hardmode was way too easy 10/10 would catch bigfoot again.

Date 2021-03-15 Playtime 10h 32m Rec Positive This game is very fun and challenging. Bigfoot is probably the hardest enemy in a video game, but that's what I love best about this game. The desperation you feel as you hunt down Bigfoot. I have experienced difficulty in lakes and other water sources, and fall damage seems to vary wildly with no relation to distance fallen. I'm sure, however, that that'll be patched out in the next big update. One final note: this game is BEST WITH FRIENDS. Play this with your friends and you'll have a lot more fun.

Date 2021-01-20 Playtime 13h 32m Rec Negative He literally decides to go incognito, and run to the corner of the map, and hides forever. He only comes out a few times, and decides to always avoid your traps (which are masked), also the radios which are supposed to attract him don't work, but when he does decide to attack you, he absolutely raw dogs you and your entire team, and then runs away.  I wish I could return it, but I have 10 hours, cause I keep looking for him!

Date 2021-01-14 Playtime 2h 24m Rec Negative Я понимаю, что это ранний доступ, но контента в игре всего ничего. Гаджеты не помогают в игре, от слова совсем. Камеры бесполезны, дрон не нужен.  Аптечек мало, патронов мало, территория большая бегать по ней скучно - нет интересных мест и событий. Бигфут жрет в себя много патронов. Капканы работают только против игроков, был момент когда бигфут начал разминировать замаскированный капкан - зачем маскировка тогда?! Из всех работающих вещей в игре - винтовка да нож, ну еще пистолет сигнальный.   Бигфута затыкал исключительно ножом найдя игровой баг. Весело ли было мне? Если бы не кооператив - не очень, в кооперативе развлекают игроки, но не игра.
Date 2021-01-14 Playtime 2h 15m Rec Positive 4 день, спустя два часа изучения карты, мы наткнулись на интересную пещеру. зайдя в нее, мы обнаружили волосатого ломаку(бигфута), который застрял в текстурах. игра 12/10 текстурных ловушек
Date 2021-01-14 Playtime 2h 44m Rec Positive После 20 минут скитаний по миру игры, я и мой товарищ решили сделать привал в нашем трейлере, спустя 5 минут прибежало это мохнатое чудище, но на тот момент у нас кончились патроны и мы наблюдали как этот примат переросток судорожно пытается нас достать. У него не вышло, но и у нас покинуть трейлер тоже, зато удалось покинуть эту игру В общем 10/10

Date 2021-01-13 Playtime 0h 43m Rec Negative This game hasnt been updated in 3-4 years, the quality of the game is absolutely garbage. The gameplay and survival aspect of the game makes no sense, I feel like im playing a shittier version of doom on the n64 or whatever. I really thought i would get scared by BIgfoot but I found myself picking up sticks and stones for the majority of my 43 minute play time. Also, the snow looks like poorly made fake snow you see at a inner city ski hill. I feel like this game has potential but failed due to its willingness to adapt and just get good. Fuck this garbage ass horror game that revolves around cameras and sticks, and a shitty tent.

Date 2021-01-10 Playtime 62h 8m Rec Positive really Good Game
Date 2021-01-09 Playtime 0h 54m Rec Negative I played this game with 2 other friends  in co-op. I spent 54 minutes with them. The first 20 or so minutes was enjoyable, until we learned this games critical flaw. How shallow it is.  It went like this: -Spawned. -Worked out how to build a campfire. -Found a cabin with weapons, cameras and ammo. -Got excited about the possibilities these items brought. -Slightly cringed that after 3 years in development there's still a half-baked reload animation. -Set up some cameras a few hundred metres away from our cabin. -Panicked as bigfoot found us. -Restarted and played strategically. -Laid down traps and cameras. -Let bigfoot fall into said traps. -Fired a few rifle rounds and barely scratched the thing. -Realised how boring fighting bigfoot really is. -All 3 applied for refunds.  A game about hunting a big animal should not feel like as war of attrition. We should have to outsmart the big guy and bring him down. Not endlessly line battle the thing.  If the devs stopped making new maps and maybe attempted to flesh out their core gameplay loop and actually make the game enjoyable, then i'd be interested. I hate to say it, but this game feels like a cash grab.

Date 2021-01-01 Playtime 1h 50m Rec Negative If you hate money and hate having fun then this is the game for you. It sounds like a fun game to play with friends and although its fun for a little while at first it gets old really fast. The map is boring and has very low locations and gives you no good loot. The main enemy bigfoot is an overpowered 5 star alabama commit who holds the world record for the 40 meter dash. They give you a gun at the start that shoots lucky charm marshmallows. The main way of dealing damage to the bigfoot is to spam traps and find meat to lure it in, bigfoot comes in and hits the trap (and breaks it lol) and loses some of his health then runs away at mach 10 only to teleport to you seconds later. You repeat this trap method over and over again with no changes. I also encountered a bug where I tried placing the meat on the trap (keep in mind this is the only way to win the game) and the meat vanished from my inventory and the meat wasn't placed on the trap. Also when I fell into one of the traps I ended up being hurt so bad by the trap that I fell through the world. This game is not worth 15$ if you're interested in playing this game you should wait for at least a 40% off or more sale. This game will probably get better over time as its still in beta (even though it released 3 years ago lol) but for the time being it is not worth your money and you will get bored of it very very very fast with its repetitive gameplay.

Date 2020-12-31 Playtime 2h 6m Rec Negative I mostly stop myself from writing any bad reviews but this game just earned it, if you wanna call this a game that is. The atmosphere is good however there is no game really. You have some mechanics like the camera control, and traps, however the key points of the game should not be those. The game tells you that the "monke" is clever but you only encounter him 2 ways. 1, he bites you bottoms off and 2, you trap him and he runs away. It feels like a bad algorithm with 2 different routes rather than a game. Even finding corpses is not satisfying since they don't feel real. Compared to a game like "The Forest", which gave a seat number for every passenger. This lack of reality and complexity in this so called "game" makes it unplayable more than 2 hours anyways...

Date 2020-12-31 Playtime 1h 12m Rec Negative Gameplay just isn't fun. The cameras and a lot of other equipment just isn't useful and add nothing to the game. You can run out and find him pretty easily. Once you find him he suplexes you and proceeds to run for the rest of the game. He doesn't act like an animal at all. Animals are very shy and cautious creatures, they study their prey while camouflaging with their environment, but here bigfoot runs around in the open and doesn't care if people see him.   TLDR; bigfoot attacks and then the game becomes a walking simulator

Date 2020-12-31 Playtime 21h 40m Rec Positive Utrzymana w konwencji survival horroru pierwszoosobowa gra akcji, będąca debiutanckim projektem niezależnego, ukraińskiego studia CyberLight. Jak sugeruje tytuł, fabuła Bigfoot koncentruje się na legendarnej, humanoidalnej istocie, żyjącej gdzieś w głębi Gór Skalistych.  -Fabuła Jak sugeruje tytuł, fabuła Bigfoot koncentruje się na Wielkiej Stopie – legendarnej, humanoidalnej istocie, która podobno żyje w okolicach Gór Skalistych w Ameryki Północnej. W 2016 roku grupa turystów zaginęła na terenie jednego z pobliskich parków narodowych. Pomimo że policja przekonuje, iż był to jedynie wypadek, główny bohater i jego towarzysze postanawiają udać się na miejsce, by przyjrzeć się sprawie z bliska. Śmiałkowie wierzą bowiem, że za tymi owianymi tajemnicą wydarzeniami stoi sam Sasquatch (jak Wielką Stopę nazywają rdzenni Amerykanie).  -Mechanika W wydanym na platformę PC Bigfoot akcja prezentowana jest z perspektywy pierwszej osoby (FPP). Do naszej dyspozycji oddano rozległy otwarty świat, w którym na odwiedzenie czekają jeziora, bagna i przyprawiające o dreszcze jaskinie. Rozgrywka kręci się wokół polowania na tytułowego przeciwnika – naszą bazą wypadową jest przyczepa kempingowa, a w trakcie łowów robimy użytek ze strzelby, wszelkiego rodzaju pułapek oraz gadżetów pokroju kamer, czujników ruchu i noktowizora (niezastąpionego, kiedy protagonista znajdzie się w dziczy po zapadnięciu zmroku) Mocną stroną gry jest sztuczna inteligencja, która czuwa nad poczynaniami Sasquatcha – autorzy dołożyli wszelkich starań, by oponent zachowywał się niczym żywa istota. Warto przy tym pamiętać, że ów przeciwnik dysponuje magicznymi mocami, zatem bezpośrednia konfrontacja z nim zazwyczaj nie kończy się dla nas najlepiej.  -Tryby gry W Bigfoot można grać zarówno w pojedynkę, jak i w trybie współpracy opracowanym z myślą o maksymalnie trzech graczach.  8/10

Date 2020-12-30 Playtime 26h 7m Rec Negative Very glitchy BigFoot just up and despawned but me and my friend could still here him. Wolfs when killed sometimes would not allow to be skinned for meat and were still growling. The game would glitch and make me not able to hold certain items or see certain things. I got kicked a few times for no reason. Needs a stamina bar. Needs markers for teammates to show eachother things and night vision needs to be better to even be useful. Would not recommend unless they fix some apparent issues.

Date 2020-12-29 Playtime 8h 26m Rec Negative This game is WAY to buggy and filled with glitches EVEN THOUGH it has been out for 3 years. When you get stuck in rocks, you can't get out. When Bigfoot is targeting you while you are stuck in a rock, Bigfoot can't hurt you or run away so you can just knife him to death. The game still needs a lot of work even though it has been out for 3 years. Would not recommend buying this game until it is fully completed, maybe in a couple more years.

Date 2020-12-13 Playtime 5h 53m Rec Positive yes
Date 2020-12-13 Playtime 39h 53m Rec Positive NOTE: This is a review before of the Early Access version of Bigfoot and the massive update that is being teased at the time of writing this has not yet come out. Other than that, this game is very well made with great visuals for what I assume is an indie game. It is very fun to play with friends and challenging, but it does get stale. As there are barely any updates to keep you interested in the game. But that can be forgiven as the game is in early access, and a massive update that is supposed to complete redo the game is coming soon hopefully. Other than that, this game is a great game to play with friends, but can get boring in single player, but gets much more intense in single player. The mechanics are good and are fairly easy to figure out. There are some minor technical issues, though nothing game breaking, and overall is a very fun experience. 7.5/10 would definitely recommend.

Date 2020-12-09 Playtime 39h 31m Rec Positive For the money it a great game, IF you have a friend willing to play co-op with you! Glacier Bay is unplayable as there is a save bug that kills you when you reload the game but its BETA these things are inevitable! Ross lake is a ton of fun with friends and you will get your moneys worth even in BETA stages.  Im looking forward to Future updates and would recommend friends looking for something to play to pick this up!

Date 2020-12-09 Playtime 60h 23m Rec Positive Игра хорошая, так же есть мультиплеер, можно играть с друзьями. Ну и тематика бигфута и хоррора смешали тоже неплохо, даже ютуберы поиграли в неё. И графика в игре очень даже красивая и добавляет атмосферности) Советую игру всем.

Date 2020-12-08 Playtime 11h 44m Rec Negative A game with so much potential, but at present executed poorly. The game is graphically pleasing and runs well on an old laptop. The map is large enough to be exciting and there's two locations to choose from. Also quite a good game to play in multiplayer. There are other things to watch out for, from bears/wolves to your body temperature level (these depend on the maps). [b]HOWEVER[/b], I do not recommend this game at the moment because it is near impossible to complete. Resources are extremely scarce. You'll run out of ammo for your single weapon far before getting anywhere near to killing Bigfoot/Sasquatch. Bigfoot, on the other hand, is a lot more overpowered than you are. The ability to run faster and deal much more damage. Your game will, if not from you deciding to leave because you are bored, dying because Bigfoot has attacked and you have run out of first-aid kits.

Date 2020-12-08 Playtime 15h 36m Rec Positive Hra má velký potenciál. Aby to ale k nečemu bylo, musí na tom vývojáři ještě hodně máknout. Teď je to spíš jen taková ukázka o čem to asi tak bude, která vás zabaví možná tak na dvě hodiny. Bigfood je jako tank, vyprázdnil jsem do něj několik zásobníků, protože se šprajcl na dostřel a chodil pořád dokola. Dávám palec nahoru s tím, že to nechci pohřbít, protože jsem hrál zatím jen beta verzi. Jinak teď zatím nedoporučuji koupit, vážně na tom ještě musí máknout a to hodně.

I loaded into a map with 2 other people and I couldn't move, proceeded on for 10 minutes until i quit because i was staring at two people questioning why I wasn't moving, a lot of typos, first thing you see is "Friends' lobbys" and if you attempt to join a game in progress, "game allready started" Unique concept for a game, poorly executed, I would personally recommend waiting to buy this game after it's left early access (if it ever does)

Date 2020-12-01 Playtime 2h 13m Rec Negative Люди которые написали этой игре положительный отзыв, вы вообще играли вот в это?  Если уж для вас это "что-то новое" и это творение прямо наполнено хорошими задумками, то спешу вас огорчить, такая игра уже существует, и от Rake по геймплею её отличает только наличие дрона. Ах да, даже не пытайтесь убить этого мохнатого киборга, без багов это сделать невозможно, периодически игра будет просто зависать секунд на 5-10, к тому же скорее всего у вас просто не хватит патронов, и пока вы будете бегать за этим атлетом, вас или ваших тиммейтов просто сожрёт медведь, а после этого вы будете бегать по всей карте за аптечкой, которых на карте буквально 3 штуки, а одна из них у того самого бедняги которого обнял медведь, но ты не можешь её взять у него, не смотря на наличие кнопки. В конечном итоге ты находишь аптечку, ресаешь товарища, но вот незадача, в этой игре, видимо, не предусмотрено воскрешение союзников, так как после реса, управление просто не работает, после чего вы всем своим сквадом нажимаете alt f4 и больше никогда не включаете эту игру. Выражаю соболезнования, если вы все же заходили в это творение и хостили игру, так как начальной заставки вы не увидите и управление мышью будет работать только с зажатой кнопкой на мыши (кем нужно быть, чтобы настолько накосячить с игрой и не исправить элементарные вещи за 3 года?)  Я все понимаю, в данном жанре не так много игр, но это явно не та игра на которую стоит тратить время и деньги.  1 разбитый об дерево дрон из 10

Date 2020-11-30 Playtime 9h 40m Rec Positive This game sucks. Your bullets basically tickle Bigfoot and you get about 100 and it takes like 1000 to kill him. He also sinks in the water while you swim and he just kinda looks at you. Don't buy this piece of shit game. Thank you

Date 2020-11-30 Playtime 14h 5m Rec Negative Exactement 2 heures... 2 heures ou à part des loups random qui nous attaqués, à perdre notre temps puisque pas une seule fois le Big foot nous a attaqué. PAS UNE SEUL FOIS. Franchement ça m'as casser les c***** de claquer 11 euros là dedans alors que d'autre jeux, moins cher, en beta comme en alpha  sont plus fun comme in silence ou labyrinthine etc.. Attention, l'ambiance de la foret comme de la map enneigée sont bien travailler, le lever comme le coucher de soleil aussi. A part qque glitch rien de méchant. MAIS la base c'est de voir le Big Foot au moins. 2 parties ou on a fait que chercher, découvert les corps et ainsi de suite, MAIS PAS DE BIG DE FOOT ! Sur ceux, passez votre chemin attendez ptete encore un an, avec un peu de chance ça sera corrigé. Mais en tout cas. Déçu et mes potes aussi. Vraiment dommage.

Best night of my life, I will never forget the time big foot slaughtered my two friends and then myself. It was the best moment of my life when my last friend alive killed BigFoot with a knife. So many amazing moments to be had while playing this game. I can't express enough how much of a master piece this game is. I hope that who ever reads this will also crack open a cold one with the boys and hunt some BigFoot.

Date 2020-11-27 Playtime 41h 43m Rec Positive I think this game has a lot of potential. I bought it a year ago, and still play it. Yes, my hours may say otherwise, but still, it's an amazing game. They have a new update coming out which is very hype, showing that they still care about the game. New weapons, looks, behavioral styles from the looks of it, and characters as well as a story. Yes, it may be buggy right now, but that is what comes with a game this big being changed and revamped, but I feel this is a huge step that is taken very well. I would definitely play this with your friends, it makes it more horrifying. One cool thing I would recommend is vicinity voice chat if possible just like Phasmophobia. It would immerse more and fit nicely into the horror-like atmosphere with walkies and such. Maybe cut the audio off during thunder storms would be a cool little feature as well. I rate this game a 9/10, but I'm sure with the new update, it'll be an 11/10!

Date 2020-11-27 Playtime 0h 43m Rec Negative how is this a game? how is this an "beta"? this is more like an alpha 0.1. this game is clearly not ready for ANY sort of launch. this game and its current state is literally at its most early of stages and to claim that this game is worth any sort of money is straight up robbery. everything about this game is extremely buggy, at one point you can access your allies inventory and later when you really need to, you cant. theres no "survival" aspect about this game. you are simply thrown in a world with some gear to hunt down big foot, but rather than hunt, big foot randomly walks around, attacks you, throw you around and leaves. can you even craft bullets? how about medkits? i dont know, and i dont intend to find out.

Date 2020-11-26 Playtime 38h 49m Rec Positive If you're familiar with 'Rake' or 'Goatman', this plays along similar lines, but is far more refined. Perhaps in part due to usage of the UE4 engine, but also from good work from the developers.  In any case, the systems at play here all function fairly well. Maps have numerous defined locations but the items that spawn on them are randomized each game, and while on either map you spawn fairly close to a campsite from which to gather a decent amount of initial materials, it's easily possible to run out quickly, so this encourages exploring, finding and looting every possible discoverable site on the map to get full supplies, as well as to collect sticks, leaves and stones along the way you might use.

Date 2020-11-25 Playtime 2h 36m Rec Negative Bought this game with a couple of buddies, we were excited and had some high hopes for this game. However when we all were able to get on and try to play together the game would only load with 2 of us at a time, we kept restarting and creating a new lobby/game until after about 20 minutes it finally let us all get in the same private lobby. The game at first was kind of cool visually. We figured out the tools and map fairly quick and were excited to start finding Bigfoot, well he would appear randomly and would hit ridiculously hard, which we were like ok so we just need to prepare traps and what not better and be a little closer together to actually take him down. Well then the glitches started happening. We would get stuck on rocks with no way to move/die/unstuck button or anything so we would have to restart a new lobby again. Bigfoot would walk over a set trap had meat on it was covered up with brush and not ever get trapped. Basically the game play went go set out all these traps and look for clues etc etc to try and capture/kill bigfoot, and then we just end up chasing him around the map with tracker darts and never really get any progress. Prob the most fun we had was a glitch we found for an easy kill. You get on top of some rocks, fly the drone to Bigfoot, aggravate him with the drone and he comes running to the rocks where you have your party. Have whoever he is focused on as close to him as possible but still on the rocks to avoid getting hit. The rest of us jumped down used all the ammo on the map (which wasn't enough to kill him) and just had to knife him repeatedly for 5 mins til he died. The only reason we had fun was bc of how game breaking this glitch was. We tried the second map and it was worse, huge tip is to avoid the water at all cost. If you fall off the rocks in the water no way to get out. With all of the glitches with this game and how hard it was just to be able to play with friends we all returned the game and got our money back. Would advise until they do some major updates and balancing to avoid this game for now.

Date 2020-11-24 Playtime 1h 55m Rec Positive BIGFOOT to pierwsza i jedyna (jak narazie) gra Firmy CyberLight Game Studio. Gra jest od kilku już lat w wersji wczesnego dostępu. To już 3 nazwa tej gry i jest strasznie podoba do RAKE gry w której tropimy dziwnego stwora w lesie i próbujemy go zabić, to samo robimy tutaj tylko tym razem szukamy Wielkiej Stopy która jest Poszukiwana od wielu lat i istnieje wiele materiałów które mają potwierdzić istnienie tej istoty ale wiele z nich nie jest prawdziwych. Jest to poprostu Legenda jak wiele innych. W grze wcielamy się w jednego z 4 łowców, gra również oferuje tryb co-op do 4 osób żeby sie nie nudzić samemu i mieć większe szanse. BIGFOOT ma naprawdę dużo życia więc zabicie jego nie jest łatwe i również często atakuje z nikąd np. Szukaliśmy z moimi znajomymi schronień i zagubionych wycieczkowiczów a tu znikąd przybiegł Bigfoot i zaczął nami rzucać jak piłką do koszykówki. Gra ma całkiem dużą mapę a nawet i 2 mapy, jak narazie grałem na tej standardowej ale też jest jedna w górach ze śniegiem. Grafika jest ładna ale to normalna rzecz jak sie robi gry na silniku Unreal Engine 4. Rzeczy które potrzebują poprawy to napewno fizyka jak i zapasy ponieważ ich brakuje tak naprawdę cały czas. Ale jeżeli przymkniemy oko na to i będziemy w to grać ze znajomymi to napewno można mieć dobry czas podczas szukania tej Legendy i krzyczenia ze strachu jak ją wreszcie znajdziemy. Polecam to dla osób którę lubią takie Survivale i mają znajomych do grania bo wtedy jest najlepsza frajda.

Date 2020-11-23 Playtime 1h 12m Rec Negative Listen, the idea of this game is amazing and once you first join the anticipation is real and it truly is scary going out at night and hearing noises but i do not recommend this game for 16 dollars, it is truly overpriced. Me and my 2 friends went to go camp out near the watch tower and bigfoot came out and my friend went on the watchtower and bigfoot got glitched i\under the watchtower, this game is super buggy although in early access. half the time my friends couldn't see me and the dead animals were still making noises and the bigfoot model isn't scary at all its scary waiting for bigfoot but as soon as you see him its not as scary and we went through too many bugs and glitches so we all refunded

Date 2020-11-22 Playtime 4h 53m Rec Negative В трейлере показывали как здорово будет выслеживать Бигфута с помощью дронов, скрытых камер и другого современного добра. Что вы будете сидеть в засаде ожидая часами, так как Бигфут ловкий-умелый и крайне скрытный парень. Сложилось впечатление, что выследить его и поймать будет целым квестом. Я уже намечтала как буду планомерно прочесывать территорию, ставить камеры в местах его потенциального появления и шкериться в кустах в надежде хоть мельком увидеть его в дали. Короче, вообразила себе романтичную охоту на красивых локациях, с легкими нотками сжатого очка от возможного внезапного нападения Бигфута. В реальности все оказалось по другому. Вы попадаете на локацию и не получаете объяснения как пользоваться чудесными современными приборами для выслеживания, как устанавливать ловушки и тд. Изучаете все методом тыка и ненависти, тратя уйму времени. Темнеет. Вы слышите вопль раненого бизона - это наш Бигфут. После вопля он гарантированно появится перед вами в течении 5-7 минут, что не вяжется с концепцией охоты и скрытности. Он точно знает где вы и просто выскочит на вас и начнет лупить, издавая гортанно-пердящие звуки на манер тувинских духовых инструментов.  Если вы будете сидеть в трейлере и смотреть камеры - он придет туда и ласково постучится в окошко, или вообще зайдет в гости. Вот тут да, очко сжалось, особенно первый раз когда ты сидишь попивая чаек смотришь на камеры, не пробегал ли там Бигфут, а он вот, собственной персоной прямо перед тобой. Когда Бигфут ударяет тебя - ты начинаешь неистово лагать и плыть в текстурах, что удручает. Еще из душевного равновесия выводит что Бигфут получил очень много пуля в лицо, но остался бодр и весел, продолжая колотить тебя издавая неприятные звуки. Я играла 37 минут, за это время скрытный неуловимый Бигфут трижды орал и выбегал из кустов. Дважды заставлял меня плавать в текстурах и ни разу не умер. Шарм охоты в игре просто теряется - гуляйте по карте и бигфут обязательно покажется в первые 10 минут. Мне потребовалось меньше 40 минут чтобы понять, что пока в игре делать нечего. А еще два мужских персонажа похожи на Путина, но это так к слову и за минус не считается, потому что Владимир Путин молодец - политик, лидер и боец. И кому как не Путину охотиться на Бигфута?  P.S. Мы дали Бигфуту второй шанс и сыграли еще разок за отряд Путина. Результат неоднозначный. Повторно отметили, что лута на карте маловато относительно живучести Бигфута и если выйти на почти честный бой и зарядить ему пуля в лицо, то пуля очень быстро закончится, а ответочка от нашего бессмертного друга не заставит себя ждать. НО! В этот раз мы поразили Бигфута его же оружием - он погнался за мной и лагнул в камнях, куда я аки скайримская лошадь щеманулась от него. Там то я и достала ножик и начала кромсать его почем зря. Кромсала минуты три, с учетом того что треть жизни мы ему сняли пулями в лицо. Бигфут все это время усиленно кряхтел на меня и продолжал дрожать в текстуре, а потом (наконец то) умер и игра на этом закончилась. Мы официально отомщены за былые унижения и купания в текстуре, теперь остается ждать, когда исправят все лаги и игра станет нормальной

Date 2020-11-22 Playtime 3h 10m Rec Positive I'm rating this a yes, but I would definitely say it needs some work. I really want to adore this game, but it needs a tutorial to teach you how to play and learn how to use everything in there. I think it would definitely need some crafting type of setting due to the limited supplies and/or a way to change the aggression level since I got pretty bored trying to trap the bigfoot. I also think another thing that could be done is decrease the map size or offer smaller maps. Since like I said the main problem i had was how long it took since it got pretty boring trying to find it. I would have loved if the game was significantly quicker and easier to understand overall. I really can't wait for the next update so I can see the changes that will happen.

Date 2020-11-21 Playtime 4h 31m Rec Negative A fun concept, but a flawed:  This is a great concept for a game, and this could be very fun, but after a few matches it is obviously not fun. Bigfoot has so much health that he's near impossible to kill in a multiplayer match, there's no variety in weapons, the resources are so scarce that you'll run out of ammo by time you get him to half health (unless you never miss a shot against a target that runs like Usain bolt).

Date 2020-09-27 Playtime 30h 31m Rec Positive First off, let me say that I'm a Bigfoot Expert. I'm a founding member of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Society, and have donated the life savings of both me and my wife to the cause. I own more than $20,000 worth of memorabilia, including a custom paint job on my 1995 Toyota Corolla, the interior of my house (Took eight months for the painters to finish), silverware, clothes, a life-sized statue made of granite, and of course, Funko Pops. I've also spent tens of thousands of dollars flying across Country and across borders to meet with fellow Bigfoot experts, and investigate sightings.   My experience with the game was more life-like than anything I've ever experienced on this Earth. I spent 32 in game days, (Roughly 6.5 hours irl), walking around aimlessly, finding nothing whatsoever aside from the freezing cold and endless amounts of vicious wolves. Upon my returning to the Cabin for the preparation for my seventh consecutive hour, I found that Bigfoot himself was waiting for me. I immediately went inside, and luckily, Bigfoot glitched his fat a$$ into the fuck1ng wall. Helpless, I spent the next half an hour wailing on the beast with my trusty knife, the radio behind me screeching insanely loudly, blaring static noises ripped straight off of YouTube through my $5 headphones (I tried numerous times to turn off the radio but I couldn't.) After a half an hour more, the mighty beast fell, his body disappearing off the map, leaving me stuck in the game for additional five hours.  In a nutshell, if you in ANYWAY criticize, mock, or demean this humble piece of artwork; you are a troglodyte and are worth no more than the slime on the boots of a lowly peasant. Hurling insults at such a fine depiction of a mystical being is such an offense, that I truly hope that Bigfoot himself encounters you in a forest you may find yourself in one day, and tears your flesh limb from limb.

After many hours talking strategy, dying, and finding hilarious bugs, we finally managed to catch the beast. While it may be a bit buggy, it is still in beta version and the bugs we encountered don't affect the core gameplay. I can't wait for the full release with the new maps and definitely look forward to hunting again.
Date 2020-09-20 Playtime 18h 46m Rec Positive Even though it is just the beta version of the game, therefore it is completely understandable that there are bugs, I greatly enjoy playing this game. My friends and I have spent the past few weeks trying it kill bigfoot and tonight we finally did. I am very much looking forward to the full release and have complete faith in the developers to deliver a satisfying game experience. Have already, and will continue, to recommend this game to people I know :D
Date 2020-09-20 Playtime 39h 16m Rec Positive I've been hunting Bigfoot for years now, and finally they got a simulation to play. Playing this game is less dangerous than actually hunting Bigfoot, so now I don't have to risk my life in the woods to prove his existence to the world... Thanks CyberLight!
Date 2020-09-19 Playtime 1h 50m Rec Negative [quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35125347-SpieleVZ/]🎮 Folge uns & erhalte alle Spielempfehlungen auf einen Blick 💎[/url][/quote]  Bigfoot ist ein Open World Spiel, welches auf 2 Maps gespielt werden kann. Ziel ist es, wie der Name des Spiels schon verrät, Bigfoot zu suchen und zu töten. Bei dieser Mission werden einem viele Hilfsmittel mitgegeben, wie z.B. Gewähre, Messer, Nachtsichtkameras, Fallen, Drohnen, Erste-Hilfe Sets und noch viel mehr. Gerade anfangs kann das Spiel sehr frustrierend sein, da man keine Chance gegen Bigfoot hat und bei einer Sichtung direkt stirbt. Bei unserem Test waren wir aber relativ schnell erfolgreich da sich Bigfoot in unseren Wohnwagen gebuggt hat und dies leider kein Einzelfall war. Des weiteren gibt es auf der Map verteilt 4 tote Touristen, welche man finden muss. Die Spielidee ist gut und auch die Atmosphäre konnten die Entwickler gut umsetzen, das Erscheinen von Bigfoot löst beim Spieler, wie es auch sollte, einen Schrecken aus. Leider ist das jedoch schon alles positive am Spiel, die Map bietet zu wenig Abwechslung, die Story rückt zu sehr in den Hintergrund und Bigfoot buggt sich wie schon erwähnt des öfteren fest. Hier muss der Entwickler auf jeden Fall noch nachbessern, wenn an diesen Punkten gearbeitet wurde wäre Bigfoot ein schönes, gruseliges Multiplayer Spiel.

Date 2020-09-18 Playtime 38h 13m Rec Positive This game is an absolute blast to play with friends! The portrayal of Bigfoot is incredibly well-crafted; the moment when the colossal creature silently appears, charging towards you, never fails to create heart-pounding excitement. While the game's overall experience is fantastic, there are occasional instances where Bigfoot might get stuck or have trouble locating players. However, these occurrences are minor hiccups and hardly affect the overall enjoyment of the game!
Date 2020-09-18 Playtime 111h 25m Rec Positive Its a funny game.

Date 2020-09-14 Playtime 1h 32m Rec Negative This game is trash, It will keep you occupied for about 30 mins until you realize that there is really nothing in the game. You hunt Bigfoot, thats it...an even that barely happens in any exciting or fun capacity.

Date 2020-09-11 Playtime 12h 50m Rec Positive Edit for the new Big update 4.0.  This is sooooo much more fun now and I mean like seriously the team have created something amazing. Its almost like a whole new game compared to when I first got it. Worth your time trust me.

Date 2020-09-09 Playtime 29h 31m Rec Positive honestly a lot of fun to return to with friends, personally think the early acces glitches and bugs add to the fun of the game.

Date 2020-09-08 Playtime 8h 58m Rec Positive Играл в игру очень давно когда она была в раннем доступе и вот несколько недель назад она вышла из раннего доступа и я решил поиграть в нее еще раз с другом. Игра очень интересна по своему, можно ставить ловушки, камеры, приманки, запускать дронов и много чего еще. Игра намного круче и интереснее игры Rake. Всем советую
Date 2020-09-08 Playtime 3h 16m Rec Negative 前往别买，没有任何引导，动作僵硬，武器伤害低的离谱，大脚怪血量高得离谱，真的蠢  和朋友俩个人打大脚怪，打死大脚怪看了下游戏总结，一个开了76枪 伤害602 我开了82枪 伤害672 才打死，玩个锤子
Date 2020-09-08 Playtime 0h 44m Rec Negative Die Grafik ist auch bei der Ultra Auflösung der letzte Mist. Das Spiel ist langweilig. Völlige Zeitvergeudung.
Date 2020-09-08 Playtime 31h 4m Rec Positive Игра прикольная: хоррор, приключение, охота - всё как надо, задумка просто топ, реализация не очень, но как для первой игры компании CyberLightGS довольно хорошая. Из плюсов можно назвать отсутствие конкурентов, так как это первая игра в своём роде, довольно интересная игра, есть задумка (предистория). Из минусов: есть баги, например, у раненого союзника нельзя забирать вещи, или же при сохранении игры и перезаходе в сохранение пропадает выполнение квеста по поиску пропавших туристов, ну и отсутствие более подробного объяснения как, каким образом ловить бигфута да и описание всех предметов, например для чего нужна ракетница, она есть, но не написана цель её предназначения, так же есть глюки в переводе, я нашел только один, в украинской раскладке игры, перевод палки-"алкаП" . Ну и последнее, на летней карте очень мало локаций и очень трудно убить бигфута из-за отсутствия аптечек в достаточном количестве.

Date 2020-09-03 Playtime 4h 14m Rec Positive The game is amazing! Played with a friend 3 hours non-stop! If you want to get spooked, or want to buy a really nice game,i highly recommend this game for everyone!
Date 2020-09-03 Playtime 16h 53m Rec Positive Great Game, I would recommend playing with friends as the game gets very eerie without others and it is also very fun to watch Bigfoot target one of you friends while you run away. Only problem with game is that i have is that there isn't enough maps and i know its still in early release but it would be nice to see more coming from the creators. Also there are some glitches where Bigfoot gets stuck and you can just deal damage without worrying about taking any. In my opinion it kind of ruins the game. Still very fun!!!
Date 2020-09-02 Playtime 14h 33m Rec Positive Very fun with Friends but a bit to hard alone. It could use a bit more items. But over all its a great game!
Date 2020-09-02 Playtime 7h 59m Rec Positive better now :D

Date 2020-09-02 Playtime 39h 14m Rec Positive 这都9月份了！怎么还不更新啊
Date 2020-09-01 Playtime 1h 21m Rec Negative Its a fun concept, however the gameplay loop is very shallow. Find the set list of tools. Walk around. Randomly get smacked by bigfoot who runs off. Shoot them.  I'd like to give more specifics about the problems, but its what you expect from a less polished game.  It could be fun if you buy to play with friends, but after giving it a go, I just couldn't see myself picking it up again.
Date 2020-09-01 Playtime 17h 5m Rec Positive I do like this game very much. Very scary if you turn off your lights.
Date 2020-09-01 Playtime 3h 17m Rec Negative Game seems like it's made in 1 day and it is soo boring. I placed a few traps and then what? Wait for 3000 years so he comes and then kills me because he is ultra fast and has hp like tank.Game is just bad and boring , no fun in it at all.

Date 2020-09-01 Playtime 21h 43m Rec Positive If your looking for a good horror game but cant find one BIGFOOT is the game for you its scary but not at the same time its really good. I know people make longer reviews but i'm not that kind of person who spends 20 min on a a review.

Date 2020-08-31 Playtime 20h 10m Rec Positive Nicht anfängerfreundlich aber sonst gutes  spiel :D
Date 2020-08-31 Playtime 11h 41m Rec Negative Ich weiß echt nicht wieso dieses Spiel so gut bewertet ist. Es ist einfach schlecht in jederlei Hinsicht abgesehen von der Idee. Die Animationen könnten auch von nem 5-Jährigen sein. Die Bigfoot-KI ist auch nicht allzu geil. Man bekommt nicht genügend Munition um das Vieh überhaupt "töten" zu können. Der Multiplayer ist....interessant. Es gibt unendlich viele Bugs. Ich kann das Spiel nur dann empfehlen wenn man sich drüber lustig machen will.

Date 2020-08-30 Playtime 11h 7m Rec Negative Omg guys this game is so scary i almost poopied my pants (i did).  The grapghics on bigfoot is so realistic i coudnt tell if it was real or not.   And one time biggie boy came in to ma car and he just demolished that thing and then he ate me.  10/10 really scary (play at own risk)   edit: even after the update this game stinks

Date 2020-08-30 Playtime 1h 4m Rec Negative Игра еще очень сырая,Бигфут вообще не стрышный.  Бигфут мне напомнил моего соседа алкаша дядю Гришу Он тоже нападает на людей и иногда орет на весь лес.
Date 2020-08-30 Playtime 23h 56m Rec Positive Bigfoot kidnapped me TWICE and it was hilarious  This game is buggy. It isn't perfect by any means; but it is definitely a fun game to come back to occasionally with friends.   Every time me and a few friends hop on to play, we get spooked and cry laughing.  Excited to see what this game has to offer with future updates. Lots of potential, but the time between updates is quite big as there is a small dev team
Date 2020-08-30 Playtime 30h 38m Rec Positive He kidnaps my friends and walks on water. Haven't had this good of a laugh in a game in a while

Date 2020-08-29 Playtime 6h 9m Rec Positive Its fun to play with a friend. Basically you run around of 10 minutes, see bigfoot then get butt fucked by him before he runs off into the sunset. it honestly is a good game that you have to be strategic about with traps and baiting bigfoot.
Date 2020-08-29 Playtime 39h 14m Rec Positive Good game.
Date 2020-08-29 Playtime 3h 1m Rec Positive great
Date 2020-08-28 Playtime 11h 44m Rec Negative the first day i got this game it worked perfectly fine and was a ton of fun, but the next day i tried opening it and it just says fatal error and closes the game. i haven't ever been able to fix this and seek help from someone who might know how. 
Date 2020-08-28 Playtime 34h 40m Rec Positive it's fun yeah but there is no way to kill the bigfoot without some clitch spot because there ain't enought ammo or first aid kits to survive with 4 people it's impossible to get even half of the health from the bigfoot
Date 2020-08-28 Playtime 29h 55m Rec Positive Игра ТОП!.Особенно с другом или друзьями вместе кричать и угорать веселее!!!!!!
Date 2020-08-28 Playtime 3h 55m Rec Positive Игра очень хорошая, интересно играть с друзьями, но есть один минус это оптимизация
Date 2020-08-28 Playtime 14h 29m Rec Positive fun. liked the part where i saw the beefy man
Date 2020-08-28 Playtime 5h 0m Rec Positive nice
Date 2020-08-28 Playtime 1h 40m Rec Negative I know the game is in early access mode. It took me about 30 minutes to find my first bigfoot, when I did, he was impossibly hard. I know this is challenging but the gameplay just seems rushed. Love the concept though.

Date 2020-08-27 Playtime 1h 4m Rec Negative Shit game 
Date 2020-08-26 Playtime 27h 50m Rec Positive I think this game is really fun when played multiplayer not so much when by your self. Sometimes when i play this game it gets really boring. Like when your just wandering around setting traps and waiting for bigfoot to get stuck in a trap. Or he comes out of nowhere and smashes your face in and you start screaming. One time bigfoot scared me so bad I almost fell off my chair.
Date 2020-08-26 Playtime 5h 50m Rec Positive Scary 
Date 2020-08-26 Playtime 3h 19m Rec Positive He look like a orangutan runnin out da zoo
Date 2020-08-26 Playtime 15h 43m Rec Positive Что ж, поиграл немного в эту игру и хотел бы высказать свое мнение. В целом, она увлекательная и захватывающая, особо негативных эмоций после проведенного времени не оставляет. Поэтому я с уверенностью могу порекомендовать ее другим игрокам, любящим атмосферное прохождение с друзьями. Итак, перейдем к более подробному разбору. Из плюсов можно выделить; + Небольшой вес игры и системные требования при неплохой графике + Общая напряженность и ожидание того, что что-то вот-вот случится, определенно приукрашивают атмосферу  + Обилие разных звуков, как резких, так и нагнетающих, что придает еще больше обос%атушек + Красочность местности. Можно не только развлекаться, нашпиговывая мохнатый зад свинцом, но и насладиться видом + Кооператив, несомненно, является огромным плюсом (не одному же мне штаны менять, в конце-то концов) Одному порой бывает настолько напряжно играть, что хочется запереться в фургончике или ближайшей палатке и поиграть в симулятор Фнафа с камерами, ибо выходить, особенно ночью, мягко говоря, нет желания (P.s. не советую этого делать, хорошим не заканчивается) Как не прискорбно, баги не обошли стороной Бигфута. Видимо, его сверхзвуковой скорости не хватило, чтобы от них сбежать. Минусы: - Малое количество амуниции и аптечек. Жизней у Бигфута довольно много, а попасть по нему иногда затруднительно, из-за чего его убийство становится в разы сложнее. Кроме того, лохматый тяжеловес бьет с силой падающей 25-килограммовой гири, почти не оставляя шансов на выживание, а аптечки не восстанавливают хп полностью. (Хотя, может, это я просто играть не умею:)) - Баги. Проход сквозь текстуры как героя, так и Бигфута. Достаточно забраться на какой-нибудь шалашик или стол, Бигфут просто ходит вокруг или останавливается, и убить его так довольно легко. И другие малозначительные баги вроде надписи "открыть", висящей перед вашим лицом, когда вы находитесь в камере.  Вывод: Лично для меня плюсы и атмосфера все же перевешивают минусы. Но я надеюсь на исправление недочетов в будущем. 9 Бигфутов из 10!

Date 2020-08-24 Playtime 6h 45m Rec Positive I'm still very new to this but have to say that already it's a fantastic game. I've only played solo as I tend to like games that I can pick up and play when ever as a break from my usual MMO but I imagine that this is also fantastic when in a party. Words I'd use to describe the game-play, world, feel and overall vibe of the game are atmospheric and tense - think hunting simulator meets survival-horror. At first I was running around the map like a loon but quickly realised that it's a game of patience and forward thinking. If you run around like mad Bigfoot WILL punish you for it. I like to setup a camp or knuckle down in a hut overnight with a few traps outside; only exploring the map more in the daylight. As this is still in Beta stages there are of course a few things that could be improved. My main beef is that on one occasion I've been sat silently in a hut with fully baited/hidden traps outside and with a dead deer nearby as bait but the AI let Bigfoot still just storm in to my hut and beat on me - I felt this was a tad unfair as it was as if the AI just pulled Bigfoot to me and ignored all other environmental interactions. It does kind of feel like Bigfoot is slightly overpowered too; when he starts charging at you there is nothing you can do to halt his attack - he just flees after beating you at which point you can chase him and hopefully land some shots. It kinda feels at times like it's a turn-based combat system even though it clearly isn't meant to be. There is no clear way to me that you can get the upper hand once combat has been initiated, even if you get the first shots in before he hits you. However, having said this, you CAN win providing you use traps properly, explore to get health packs and ammo and make the most of any opportunity you get to put some shots in him. I also feel there is room for another weapon or two; to give a variance to play style - perhaps a bow and arrow, some poison darts to do damage over time on Bigfoot for example - there is a lot of scope to add more cool stuff to the game but I feel that this is only a credit to the devs who have come up with a unique and fun as hell game. Highly recommend and can't wait to see how it progresses.

Date 2020-08-22 Playtime 6h 38m Rec Negative Все эти навороты с камерами и дроном приводят лишь к тому, что обезъяна (пользуясь тем, что персонаж не шевелится в процессе мониторинга) заходит в спину. Зато реально необходимых вещей навроде аптечек, патронов и в особенности капканов непозволительно мало. Да какие охотники вообще будут не уважать себя на столько, чтобы пойти на 3 х метровую гору мускул с жалкими винтовками?? Тут гранатомёт брать нужно было. В конечном итоге одолеть существо удаётся !исключительно! если оно залогало. Реальной возможности победить за счёт игровых средств нет. Кроме того - Йетти временами просто игнорирует присутствие игроков на карте занимаясь какими -  то своими монструозными делами и находясь возле края карты можно простоять на месте полных двое суток и.... ничего. Карта мала, обучения нет и в помине, никаких наводок где искать жертвы гориллы, волки и медведи нападающие в дождь и игнорирующие громыхающие ружья и попадания по себе, мгновенная смена дня и ночи напрягает, полнолуние в течении 10 суток и кол - о осадков за эти же дни превышающее норму для континентального климата раза в 4 И что самое забавное - конгу видать перелили крови соника, потому что 400 кг махина перемещающаяся со скоростью вертолёта по пересечённой местности... ну эт как то звездец  Единственные 2 плюса сего творения - лес, похожий на лес, да работа с светотенью. Фонари союзников светят и для тебя, реалистичные тени, смотреть на закат сквозь листву сосны вообще релакс.  но тут же тебя хватает за ногу неубиваемый орангутанг и всё настроение летит к чертям. Вопщим 400 рубасов эта штука если и стоит, то с безумной натяжкой. Работать и работать ещё

Date 2020-08-19 Playtime 107h 11m Rec Positive Works perfectly better than any other game ive ever played ever.
Date 2020-08-19 Playtime 38h 51m Rec Positive for sure worth the price but only if you have friends to play with. gameplay can be tedious but it's all fun. remember the game is still in development so there are some bugs here and there (you can read about them on the discussion boards for the game) but overall the game is put together very well. cant wait to see what the next update brings!
Date 2020-08-19 Playtime 72h 10m Rec Positive lots of fun and very scary at times.
Date 2020-08-19 Playtime 20h 27m Rec Positive As an unfinished game BIGFOOT is quite playable and maintains a whimsical quality of peaceful, natural serenity while still mustering an unsettling thrill of the hunt excitement simultaneously providing a hunter and hunted context. The core mechanics are functional and there are even other animals to worry about or take down and use for baiting purposes. Some advanced features are lacking still such as: diving/sliding from sprint, hurdling/mantling animations, any settings to alter the semi-procedural generated global contents (ex: loot or tourist finds not always in the same places each play-through but are generated), no character or loadout customization and of course there is NO splitscreen or LAN play for multi. At this time there is only 2 playable maps as well (8/18/20) although the update with the Glacier map brought along quite a few desirable improvements from the initial map release including swimming and remote control camera drone added to each map and so it's conceivable another update may continue this trend to package maps and feedback driven improvements together. This is a beta, early access, title still and naturally has much room for improvements and add-ins; which will most likely increase the price as updates seem to be slowed or halted currently due to this 2020 Covid-19 SARS2 paranoia still causing pandemic lack of work problems I would recommend the current or even sale pricing. At the present state it is a modest price $16 and a re-playable multi-or solo play experience that could still allow for many hours of gameplay even IF it simply remains unfinished. However, those of us that want a polished and high end title will be rather argumentative regarding the unrefined nature of the fundamentals and the frequency of "bugs" related to the AI BIGFOOT somewhat often becoming hung-up on a terrain feature or an unforeseen snag due to programmed behavior and multiple targets creating occasional exceptions that are left unresolved as of yet where-in BF may actually stand between a downed teammate and a ready hunter just growling suspended for an indefinite amount of time (actually melee killed him once due to this) and a couple of exploitable terrain elements that have unaddressed clipping issues (walking into large rocks or collecting items through walls etc) will surely drive perfectionists into fits of rage. Overall the game is fully playable and can even take quite a bit of 'pushing' the boundaries of its environment without any mega glitches or crashes thus far. And those silly or daring enough to actually want the BF AI to resume pursuit if he gets stuck just need to shoot a flare in his face to send him back off and reset his approach. I could go on and on in greater detail but if anyone wants specifics just message me on here and I'll fill you in thx.

Date 2020-08-17 Playtime 2h 35m Rec Negative I went into game thinking me and my friends could fufill our duty and finally kill this fat hairy fuck, but after endless trial and error of getting shitted on with no first aid, no bullets, Bigfoot just jumping over bear traps and not being able to hide, we gave up. We were broken down, both physically and mentally. There was no point or will to it anymore. I don't wanna find bigfoot anymore.

Date 2020-08-16 Playtime 12h 48m Rec Positive Very fun and scary game recommend it for sure
Date 2020-08-16 Playtime 3h 41m Rec Positive This game has changed my life. I was previously fired from my job. On my way home to tell my wife the sad news I found her with the neighbours' son, Jamal. In the span of ten minutes I lost both my career and my dignity. I was close to ending it all before a friend of mine asked if I'd like to hunt big foot. At first I thought he meant hunt big feet, as I have a well documented foot fetish so I was quick to oblige. To my disappointment, he actually meant hunt down this big brown bastard. When I first layed eyes upon the yellow eyed beast I found a soul much like mine, broken, buggy and a bit of a mess. But I could see the potential. I've been playing this game now for the past 3 weeks, my friend has long since stopped, but every time I get ass blasted from behind from this guy, I am left feeling more fulfilled than the last time. I would recommend this game to anyone wanting to feel something again. And it is also much cheaper than a therapist.

Date 2020-08-13 Playtime 3h 1m Rec Positive good game 
Date 2020-08-13 Playtime 11h 0m Rec Positive its a very good game but its hard to find him
Date 2020-08-13 Playtime 5h 40m Rec Positive I feel like the game itself is missing a more survival aspect to it. where the hunters should be more cautious of their hunger or their thirst possibly. I think adding a survival aspect to it will change the dynamic of the game. Maybe by adding some new either weapons or maybe have the hunters have certain abilities to have a better change of pace. Overall i love the game just by playing it and capturing bigfoot i feel like i am almost cheated on a better experience that we can all enjoy by making it longer or like building a base. I know it saying alot to basically completely change a game but damn this game has some awesome potential. Maybe a bigfoot 2?

Date 2020-08-11 Playtime 51h 56m Rec Positive Bigfoot is a good game to play when your bored, and craving something creepy, but not SOO horror-filled. Its an action and somewhat of a "horror" game. I would recommend this game to anyone!

Sonst passiert eigentlich gar nichts. Ach ja Plötzlich spawnt Big Foot mitten im Lager und haut alles kaputt und  bugt sich weg. Vielleicht soll das ja so sein...Man weiß es nicht.Ach ja einen Bär hab ich auch mal erschossen.  Welch unglaubliche Abwechslung. Gähn.....  LAAANGWEILLIG !

Date 2020-08-04 Playtime 11h 39m Rec Negative The bugs outweigh the fun factor. Save up for a better game. This game being made on Unreal doesn't help either.
Date 2020-08-04 Playtime 21h 14m Rec Positive Dieses Spiel ist wirklich toll. Ich habe mit einer anderen Person dieses Spiel gespielt, jedoch gab es für uns (2 Spieler) eher weniger Loot ( bzw. zu wenig Munition, Fallen und Medi-Kits ). Trotz allen ein wirklich cooles Spiel!
Date 2020-08-04 Playtime 37h 53m Rec Positive It's a good game if you're playing with friends while live streaming, makes for good content and really funny jokes. I only have a few gripes;  1: Supplies don't match up with how many people you're playing with, for example; if you're playing with one other friend the supplies scattered around the map should accompany that, right? Wrong. You don't get enough supplies to actually kill bigfoot. If it was something like an airdrop every 3 days or something for the players that would be great! Hopefully that will be in the next update. 2: Bugs. So many bugs. I beat this game with a friend of mine by merging into a mountain, getting bigfoot stuck, and then slashing at his arm until we killed him. Very funny, but...ya know. Not great. 3: Bigfoot's AI makes it increasingly more frustrating to deal with. Sometimes he won't show up for over 30 minutes and other times he'll show up for 2 minutes and before we even have the chance to put tracking bullets in him, he's gone.   While I like the game a lot, I wouldn't pick this game up until some of these problems are fixed. However, getting it in early access is really fun! All in all, it's really up to you...just make sure you get this for a friend too. :)

Date 2020-08-02 Playtime 4h 21m Rec Negative i bought this game to get hunted by bigfoot but at day 3 we realised that that was not gonna happen. we went to the only place on the map we hadn't been and guess who was there. It was bigfoot, stuck on a river rock. we began unloading bullets upon him and when we realised that he was never gonna move we stabbed his shins until he collapsed in the river and got caught. all this happened in the span of 49 minutes. this game is absolute shit (now it's even worse)

Date 2020-08-01 Playtime 8h 50m Rec Positive I think this game is fun, but after awhile it gets quite tedious. They need to add in a way to actually play as bigfoot, and a way to make it where whoever is playing bigfoot and just focus one person down. Like someone else said on a review "there is no real change in bigfoots actions in the game" and its true, nothing really changes about the game.... You load in with you and your friends, or by yourself if you choose to. You load up, get your stuff together and search for bigfoot! You eventually find him / or he finds you, and you duke it out, he runs away and do it all over again until he kills you or you kill him. Missing flavor, but fun for awhile.
Date 2020-08-01 Playtime 35h 17m Rec Positive 12/10 -в игре  пожилое присутствие  атмосферы леса ,природы , немного страха  .Есть мелкие баги , но это мелочи , надеюсь разрабы не забьют половой орган на игру , и сделайте карты побольше ) Чпасибо за понимание )
Date 2020-08-01 Playtime 21h 26m Rec Positive this game is amazing the graphics and the story but there are still some bugs like how bigfoot only goes after one person when attacks you and if your in the right position where your in a little ditch and bigfoot is on a ledge he doesnt jump down and your friend could scurry up and stab bigfoot and bigfoot would do nothing and you can beat the game in seconds devs please fix some bugs it would make the game a 10 out of 10 game please and thank you

Date 2020-07-31 Playtime 28h 2m Rec Positive This game is fun and all with all ur firends I would recommend to people, but there are some glitches in the game that need to be fixed that can sometimes make u have to restart the whole game.
Date 2020-07-31 Playtime 4h 51m Rec Positive Игра само по себе офигенное но сетим обновлением я чувствую что это игра будет вапше ахуеной
Date 2020-07-31 Playtime 22h 32m Rec Positive Amazing game
Date 2020-07-31 Playtime 54h 56m Rec Negative This game is a waste of time and money. DEV's are trash when it comes to monthly updates. I don't think they even work on it anymore.
Date 2020-07-30 Playtime 17h 51m Rec Positive game best ever
Date 2020-07-30 Playtime 9h 7m Rec Negative this game never updates and costs way too much for the amount of content you get
Date 2020-07-30 Playtime 42h 30m Rec Positive This game is absolutely phenomenal. The graphics are insane, the game's idea is extremely creative and it's one of the funnest horror style games I have ever played. It is very scary when bigfoot shows up. It is a really fun experience to hunt down a legendary creature. Everyone should try this game!

Date 2020-07-29 Playtime 104h 39m Rec Positive great game
Date 2020-07-29 Playtime 0h 58m Rec Positive 创意还不错，就是游戏初期阶段过渡起来很困难。第二天开始就有大脚怪来搞你了！而且很肉血很厚！子弹打他就是挠痒！！都不知道怎么干掉他..没事捶你几下你就死了。我觉得还是需要完善开发更多的玩法与模式吧~ 比如说：娱乐模式（happy time）拿RPG追着大脚怪杀、剧情模式（movie mod）让玩家扮演的角色定位更加准确，有对话文本，能够有逻辑地展开调查，了解大脚怪怎么杀人，失踪的人背后的种种可能性。 希望能够好好完善吧，这个游戏看起来还是可以的，就是价格离谱

Date 2020-07-29 Playtime 26h 18m Rec Positive its all fun and games until a giant, horny ape coming charging at you in a dense forest at the dead of night.  10/10 would experience again
Date 2020-07-29 Playtime 11h 1m Rec Negative Still beating my head against the wall for this game, but I really don't recommend it.  Graphically the game looks decent. I think the lighting especially is weirdly quite good. In particular the actual Sun + any light through a camping net/mesh looks fantastic if not the best in a game I've ever seen. That's about it for praise.  I find myself wondering what the point of this game is. Is it just for meem? Too much time and energy went into this game for meem. But Bigfoot has zero changing behaviors, there is zero depth to the game, and it's obvious the devs don't really care about the gameplay loops.   Why bother with the graphics, the lighting, everything involved with the game when your idea of fun, riveting gameplay is "Shoot Gorilla 900000 times with scarce supplies of ammo."  Health packs don't work properly. Clipping and getting stuck is common. Sound resets every session - not every time you boot the game, every session of the game loaded. If you reload a save, your audio resets. I've never seen this before and likely will never see it again, and it confuses me how a product available for money has this sort of bizarre, easily fixed bug.  And yet the netcode is some of the best I've ever seen. Zero latency, zero sync issues.  I'd like to blame everything about this game and its lack of fun under developer ineptitude but I just don't get how they nail some of the hardest aspects. Laziness? Meem? Is it meem?  What an anomaly.  Addendum: So they added a PvP mode. How? How does this dev know how to make PvP, but the gameplay is still shoot gorilla 900,000 times? PvP is unexplained nonsense with a gigantic map and too little indication for the gorilla. If you have a team of screeching birds, yeah it'll eventually find you, but if you even mildly pretend to be quiet it will be like early Evolve days - wandering around wondering where the other is. Only Evolve had a way smaller map. Eventually Gorilla finds you... and he can just wipe you out. Balancing is astronomically out of wack, but I like the idea of it. It COULD be fun. But it needs a LOT of work and it is way too boring as it stands. Devs, please see In Silence for a similar concept you can iterate upon.
Date 2020-07-28 Playtime 21h 36m Rec Negative Ok i'm gonna be honest this game sucks as it is. They need to update this game before i'm gonna enjoy it. Bigfoot is way to hard to kill you don't get enough bullets to even kill him and the overall game play seems to robotic like you can predict when its gonna rain in the forest. As it is i'm not gonna play it.
Date 2020-07-28 Playtime 28h 10m Rec Positive amazing

Date 2020-07-28 Playtime 18h 20m Rec Positive there is absolutely nothing wrong with this game  besides the graphics the gameplay the bugs th-  good game buy it
Date 2020-07-28 Playtime 6h 26m Rec Positive I was very happy with this game. The graphics were decent quality for the price. One problem is that this game breaks steam chat, the quality is often ruined while I'm in the game.

Date 2020-07-28 Playtime 9h 2m Rec Negative Такое очко игра бигфут  терминатор не убиваемый вообще интеллект бота предсказуемый до смеха а если люди играют за него то просто ливают а вы продолжаете играть думая что вас просто не могут найти на большой карте даже не оповещая о выходе из лобби нет никаких надписей и вас не кидает в меню как в других играх вот и все аргументы ах да и цена на это 540 р не понял вообще шутки если честно
Date 2020-07-28 Playtime 3h 42m Rec Negative This game is just bad. Bad graphics. Bad Gameplay. Bad.
Date 2020-07-28 Playtime 16h 32m Rec Positive My friend also has big feet. Maybe even bigger then Bigfoot's. I don't know who to be more afraid of.

Date 2020-07-28 Playtime 14h 6m Rec Positive Good game Super fun
Date 2020-07-28 Playtime 11h 2m Rec Positive Bigfoot is extremely fun, as it is that one game that you can depend on when you are bored with your friends.
Date 2020-07-27 Playtime 38h 29m Rec Positive This  game is beyond amazing. Yes, it's glitchy and very hard to beat bigfoot, but oh myyyy when bigfoot gets you off guard  it is goooood. All i  will say: update the bigfoot AI to scare us (the players) more, make him run past us swiftly, appear and disappear, just every tension building moment possible! Overall, amazing game....Buy ittttt

Date 2020-07-26 Playtime 4h 40m Rec Negative Постоянно пропадает бигфут. Минут 20 игры и он пропал... Минимальные системные требования не соответсвуют указанным
Date 2020-07-26 Playtime 10h 40m Rec Positive I first bought Bigfoot in 2018 and have played it from time to time. This game is more fun in multiplayer, true, but I've enjoyed both. This game is kind of part horror when Bigfoot sneaks up behind you and the fact that you have no idea where he is adds to the fear. Bigfoot is a well polished game that I would advise buying and playing.
Date 2020-07-26 Playtime 12h 32m Rec Positive ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER

Date 2020-07-24 Playtime 15h 16m Rec Positive 9/10 Would sh*t myself again
Date 2020-07-24 Playtime 1h 27m Rec Negative I don't know... this game wasn't funny at all, kind of glitchy, repetitive, not immersive at all. Once you shoot bigfoot with the tracking bullet the game turns in some kind of persecution until you kill the freaking monster. Sorry, boring, awful game.
Date 2020-07-24 Playtime 7h 28m Rec Positive totally did not scream when playing this, game good.

Date 2020-07-23 Playtime 36h 29m Rec Positive Élvezetes játék, ha van kivel játszani
Date 2020-07-23 Playtime 1h 16m Rec Positive Bought the game because it looked like a "horror" game I didn't need to take too seriously. Played it with 2 of my mates and we were messing around taking the piss out of it. Roughly midday on the second day we hear a howl from behind us and before we turn around I am pinned to the ground by a large hairy man screaming bloody murder and several curse words. After taking the fattest dump yet known to man on my health bar this hairy abomination which had sustained little to no damage from about 12 bullet wounds stands up and runs away at like mach 2. We return to our campsite roughed but alive to have the caravan shaken by this same demonic entity before it rips off the door and reaches inside to slap me up a bit.  I died.  10/10- Let me live out my life fantasy of being spanked by a hairy man.

Date 2020-07-21 Playtime 15h 28m Rec Negative За такие деньги... Ерунда какая-то. Одному скучно, вдвоем тоже быстро надоедает, ибо Бигфут как будто из титана, а патронов кот наплакал, еще и фиг их найдешь. Концептуально игра хорошая, но в остальном извиняйте
Date 2020-07-21 Playtime 4h 27m Rec Positive Good Horror game, gives u alot of adrenaline Specially  playing alone
Date 2020-07-20 Playtime 2h 49m Rec Negative Terribad.  Super opaque; no tutorial, no guides, no help in understand basic interface or tool usage. Game penalized player for explorarion.

Date 2020-07-18 Playtime 19h 55m Rec Positive Its a 50/50 chance of a person liking it or not, but I do recommend it to others for a few reasons; Good Graphics, Sound Quality is good and Online Gameplay is the best in horror games.

Date 2020-07-18 Playtime 0h 45m Rec Negative jank in the bank with no room for spank  But for real, if this game is your type, and you don't mind a very small gameplay loop without a ton of depth, go crazy.   Just not my cup of tea.

Date 2020-07-17 Playtime 6h 14m Rec Positive Immer wieder lustig und spannend, vor allem im Multiplayer. Austesten wie man Bigfood fängt und selber in die Falle gehen. Ein tolles Spiel mit Freunden und immer wieder lustige Momente. Vielleicht kann dir mein Gameplay und Angezockt die Entscheidung etwas erleichtern und einen besseren Einblick geben. Von meiner Seite her eine positive Resonanz und eine klare Kaufempfehlung https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1E4nuU3r1E&feature=youtu.be
Date 2020-07-17 Playtime 1h 0m Rec Positive 一開始能正常遊玩，但約20分鐘過後直接當機，開機顯示 CPU Over Temperature Error，而且摸機殼很熱。 我的CPU是 i7-7700K 無超頻搭配Cooler Master的12熱管塔散，機箱內部幾乎沒有灰塵(幾個月內清理過)，平常使用也沒有問題，這是我的電腦第一次提示我CPU過熱。 因為顯示過熱不敢開機，等了約20分鐘後才開，所以沒有辦法用軟體測量是幾度。 開機之後再次開啟了遊戲，然後CPU溫度慢慢的升了10度(這應該是正常的)，然後又當機了(可能有其他bug)，不過這次不是過熱。 再次重新啟動電腦之後，沒有開啟遊戲，也都沒出什麼問題了。 我沒有比較低階的CPU可以換，所以可能是因為這個CPU用這散熱器壓不住？ 希望以後可以改善。
Date 2020-07-17 Playtime 3h 18m Rec Negative Buggy beyond belief. My friend got hit by bigfoot by the lighthouse, and then everything on the map was about a foot to the right on his screen, so he'd constantly be running into walls when what he saw was a doorway or something like that.
Date 2020-07-16 Playtime 11h 21m Rec Positive 10/10
Date 2020-07-16 Playtime 4414h 0m Rec Positive Najlepsza gierka survivalova horror. Samo to że w grze trzeba zapolować na mityczne stworzenie (bigfoot), Gierka ma bardzo ładną grafikę,unikatowe lokacje jak i przedmioty oraz easter eggi chociaż to mniej ważne. Gra ma bardzo dobry system temperatury ciała jak i otoczenia. Jakość strzelania nie jest najlepsza,ale da się znieść. Fizyka tej gry jest na wysokim poziomie jak i grafika otoczenia. Muzyka która załącza się w losowych momentach jest tak klimatyczna, że czasami strach się bać. Sam Bigfoot nie jest bardzo trudny do pokonania (zależne hp jest od tego, czy gra się samemu czy z innym graczem lub graczmi) ale trzeba trochę wysiłku. Co do zimowej mapy, mapa bardzo ładnie stworzona,piękne lokację,dźwięki wilków w oddali które dodają klimatu podczas nocnych obchodów, wiatr który daje bardzo dobry klimat i dużo innych. Gra jest naprawdę super i bardzo polecam każdej osobie która lubi survival i horror. Daje grze 9/10.     The best survival horror game. The fact that in the game you have to hunt a mythical creature (bigfoot), the game has very nice graphics, unique locations and items as well as easter eggs, although it is less important. The game has a very good body and environmental temperature system. The shooting quality is not the best, but it is bearable. The physics of this game is as high as the graphics of the surroundings. The music that plays at random moments is so atmospheric that sometimes you are afraid to be afraid. Bigfoot itself is not very difficult to beat (HP depends on whether you are playing alone or with another player or players) but it takes some effort. As for the winter map, the map is very nicely created, beautiful locations, sounds of wolves in the distance that add climate during the night celebrations, wind that gives a very good atmosphere and much more. The game is really cool and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes survival and horror. It gives the game 9/10.
Date 2020-07-16 Playtime 1h 4m Rec Negative it might be a bit fun with friends but i wouldnt recommend it, there are better co-op survival horror games out there
Date 2020-07-16 Playtime 1h 57m Rec Negative The idea of the game sounds fun, but the gameplay isnt, you spend ages walking around a forest, finding nothing, then you find bigfoot, shoot and use traps, he wont lose much health. The game only has one task, so they give him a stupid amount of health to make it last long enough for a game. Boring and refunded.

Date 2020-07-15 Playtime 4h 36m Rec Negative The game is buggy, and borderline impossible to beat/finish. Your character cannot sprint for more than 5 seconds and then proceeds to walk at snail speed. The only way to beat this game is if bigfoot manages to get stuck. The bullets do virtually no damage.

Date 2020-07-14 Playtime 27h 30m Rec Positive Игра крутая но есть один минус, мы с другом спокойно играли на гитаре, но к нам пришел какой то пьяный бомж и разбил нам окно и избил нас. Теперь нам холодно! Топ обнова! Желаю вам успехов в следующих обновлениях, чтобы игра стала ещё круче и интереснее!
Date 2020-07-14 Playtime 0h 10m Rec Negative The game never launched, it downloaded but keeps crashing!!!! I wasted my money!!!!
Date 2020-07-14 Playtime 1h 0m Rec Negative The game was quite fun, but it needs some SERIOUS polish and reworking, going out at night and attempting to do anything with the foot man about was absolutely fucking terrifying, but for 15$ the game is not worth it. Movement feels floaty yet stiff, and god help you want to hop a 2 foot tall wooden fence, because it is the most difficult thing ever. The entire premise and concept of the game is a very cool and scary one, many reworks to the execution need to be made, the supplies system is wonky and apon being injured with the "You are dying..." screen, my partner was entirely unable to help me up, even with like 3 medkits, it got us nowhere. The entire menu system felt clunky and rushed, the Camera system was likely the most polished aspect of this game due to it's simplicity. Graphically however, the game was gorgeous, and it ran pretty well on my lower end PC, all graphics at high. The audio design was mostly adequate, not much to change or improve. I think my biggest complaint is that the only playable black guy looks like a monkey and I hate it.  Oh yeah there was one point where I watched foot man just waltz into our RV like it was his own home and Suplex my best friend, to which she laid down crying for many minutes.

Date 2020-07-11 Playtime 19h 46m Rec Positive Attention aux anciens avis qui ne sont plus (en tout cas pour la plupart de critique) représentatif du jeu actuel.  Depuis la 4.0 le jeu est devenu bien meilleur. résultat: -beaucoup moins de bug (pour mon expérience) -bien plus beau -nouvelles mécaniques intéressantes -des nouvelles armes supplémentaires -la possibilité de contrôler le bigfoot -des personnage bien plus intéressant  Ils restent bien sur quelques défauts qui ont des chances d'être corrigées: -le jeu reste lassant malgré des loots généré aléatoirements et un système de niveau(montant bien trop lentement...) -le bigfoot a un odorat ce qui est bien, sauf qu'il est du coup impossible de ce cacher ce qui est un comble pour un jeu de chasse... (une mécanique de camouflage d'odeur avec de la boue ou autres pourrait être sympa) -le bigfoot depuis cette mise à jours est beaucoup trop agressif il est rare de ne pas le voir le premier soir, donnant ainsi une ambiance moins pesante -qu'une map, cependant ce défaut risque de tomber car c'est pas 2 mais 3 autres maps qui sont déjà annoncer en espérant que ses derniers seront diversifiées et intéressantes.  Alors est-ce que je vous le conseil en cette état ? La réponse est difficile, car autant certains seront réceptif au concept autant d'autres moins. Cependant je le recommanderai surtout à ceux qui ont des amis avec qui il peut jouer car le jeu est bien meilleur à plusieurs.

Date 2020-07-10 Playtime 4h 12m Rec Negative 他の人のレビューにもある通りBighootの体力が多すぎる まあそれはこのゲームの目的がBighootを倒すことなので簡単に倒されたら、それはそれでクソゲー つまりどう転んでもクソゲー 体力を多くして長くプレイさせたいのはわかるけど、対Bighootの物資も少なすぎる 旅行用のクソデカキャリーケースを漁っても回復1個ってお前はAmazonの箱か  令和のCoopオンラインゲームでゲーム内VCなし アーリーから3年クイックチャットすら実装できなかったの？ APEXよろしくあそこにゴリラが居るよって教えるPinとかクイックチャットでもよかったのに、ゴリラ見かけてチャットしてたら、もうそこにはゴリラ居ないよ 一応ゴリラ討伐以外にも目的あるけど、ゴリラ討伐の過程で嫌でもやることになるから実質ゲーム内のやることはゴリラ倒すことのみ このゲームもまたアーリーアクセスが生み出した魔物

Date 2020-07-09 Playtime 17h 4m Rec Positive If your looking for a good multiplayer survival horror game then you have found it. All though it does have its glitches and bugs. Its a fantastic game and i strongly recommened
Date 2020-07-09 Playtime 19h 18m Rec Positive Отличная игрушка-хоррор, которая может увлечь на пару часов !!!  Главная задача игры поймать мифическое существо которое зовётся Бигфут, и разузнать что случилось с пропавшими людьми. В вашем полном распоряжении будет ружьё, сигнальный пистолет, капканы, камеры и прочие инструменты охоты.  НО (и ещё раз НО) !!! Категорически рекомендую играть с другом, ведь так будет гораздо веселее и увлекательнее !!!  Моя оценка 8/10                                                                               Удачной охоты !!!

Date 2020-05-07 Playtime 3h 48m Rec Negative Bigfoot is wayyy overtuned. No interesting ways to track or capture him, you have to just have to stumble upon him (which he typically finds you). He does have a couple of home bases, but it's the same each round, so becomes uninteresting quickly. Otherwise, you literally just shoot him, but there's nowhere near enough bullets on the map. Me and my friends won two out of three games, but only because the yeti got bugged/stuck/had dumb AI and it had to be knifed for several minutes. This ain't it.
Date 2020-05-06 Playtime 23h 37m Rec Positive I wish this game has Mac support, in a future update if you could make it where this has Mac support that would be greatly appreciated!

I know the game has a lot of potential and bugs, but we could play it without any problems. We also gave the second map a try. Definitely recommend this game! Looking forward for some updates though.

Date 2020-04-29 Playtime 2h 14m Rec Positive This game has a lot of potential. It has a great environment and some nice scenery. It plays more like an aggressive game of hide and seek - who can find (and kill) who first, but it's early access so it gets a pass. Seems to be more fun with friends than as a solo player, but worth keeping and eye on as they get closer to release and add in and refine more features.

Date 2020-04-28 Playtime 4h 6m Rec Negative When i got the game i was expecting to hunt bigfoot not get hunted by him. And there is a way to bug him and kill him with a knife :D. Also he just rushes you form the other side of the map i mean there is no point of the cameras and anything.  I am not pleased with the way this is presented. There are a lot of things to change when it is out of Early access. I would have loved to see him stalking you before attacking.

Date 2020-04-28 Playtime 7h 8m Rec Positive AMAZINGLY GOOD
Date 2020-04-28 Playtime 2h 31m Rec Positive Мой обзор смешанный. В игре много багов. Но в целом она интересная. Довайте начнем по порядку. Я могу предложить несколько идей, но скорей всего они будут затуманены слоем тысячи коментариев. 1. Пусть игру опимизируют для салбых пк(я играю с 30-9 фпс и меня все устраивает, но минус это звук, он просто лагает и скрипит) 2. Сделайте ИИ более правдоподобным. Например если ты стреляешь в волка(медведя) и сносишь ему больше половины HP, то он убегает, но не быстро, чтобы можно было добить. С бигфутом такая же история. 3. Камеры толжны пугать бигфута(маскеровать их). 4. Камуфляж(скорей всего я пишу обзор на симулятор охоника, а не хоррор) 5. ПНВ для дрона и более доступные батареи(слоничные батарейки как на камерах сошли бы) 6. Больше карт, локаций, обьектов и сюжета. И последнее 7. Больше скримеров и страшных звуков. На этом мой обзор кончаеться. Я непонимаю зачем менять модель бигфута если можно оптимизировать игру и приманить аудиторию с плохими пк. Я знаю что это бета и игра еще сырая, но все же. А так хохлы молодцы, что делают игры. Манить бигфута на сало очегь интересно. 4 из 10

Date 2020-04-27 Playtime 51h 18m Rec Positive First of all, I must say that Horse Simulator is a revolutionary leap in the digital landscape, transcending the mere concept of equine imitation. As you gallop through the cornfields, you're immediately reminded of the great debate between ubisoft and cats. The debate intensifies as you navigate through the pixelated realm, where every pixel whispers secrets deep into your ear canal  The controls are as intuitive as deciphering the ancient hieroglyphs found on the walls of your local laundromat. Speaking of laundromats, So there I was, minding my own business, waiting for my clothes to stop spinning at approximately the speed of light, when I hear a whisper. A deep, gravelly voice, like a retired jazz musician chimney who smoked too many cigarettes but still has lungs somehow. I look around no one’s there except some guy staring too intensely at a vending machine full of spunk flavoured snacks. But then, I realise: it’s the dryer. The dryer is talking to me.  “Back in my day,” it rumbles, “I didn’t just tumble clothes. I rode horses.”  Excuse me?  The dryer then launches into a long-winded monologue about how it was once a champion equestrian rider, galloping across golden fields, feeling the wind whip through its nonexistent hair. “It was a simpler time,” it sighs, its lint trap rattling with nostalgia. “Before the great transition. Before… the spin cycle.”  I’m just standing there, absorbing this madness, while my cum socks slap against the glass in the dryer. The dryer tells me about its prized stallion horse "cocksucker" and how they won The Grand Dryer Horse Rider Competition of ‘82—a prestigious event that, according to the dryer, only happens once every 200 years and is entirely judged by an elite panel of Metal Horses that can talk. But, as fate would have it, the dryer was betrayed by its own jockey—a rogue washing machine named Sexy Steve—who framed it for fabric softener fraud.  “And that’s how I ended up here,”   “Tumbling socks for strangers. Forgotten. Alone.”  At this point, my clothes are dry, but my mind is drenched in confusion. I slowly collect my laundry, avoiding eye contact with the machine that just trauma-dumped its entire horsecock-riding past life on me. As I walk out, I swear I hear it whisper:  “Tell cocksucker I still believe in him.”  And now, I have to live with that.
Date 2020-04-27 Playtime 3h 56m Rec Negative So the fact that Bigfoot just rushes you in the first 5 min of the game going ape shit just kills the whole game experience makes you regret you bought it, although the idea of tracking Bigfoot sounds cool there is no mystery no tension just plain shooter, the only thing its missing is the zombies. Bigfoot is supposed to be elusive hiding from people, there are no clues for finding the missing people to make the game longer. On top of everything there isn't a proper strategy against Bigfoot just a huge health bar that stays all time on top. The game has allot of potential, a few improvements in the main monster apperance and the way you track it especially in the difficulty of that, in general it needs more tension build i mean the jump scare is bad so far so anything can be an improvement.

Date 2020-04-27 Playtime 11h 48m Rec Positive very scary bigfoot put his arm in the house and i peed
Date 2020-04-27 Playtime 43h 19m Rec Positive The game is very fun! Although it is tedious to play singleplayer, it provides a steep challenge to balance ammo and health conservation while hunting the bigfoot. It's glitchy as hell, but I wouldn't say it's game ruining (Unless bigfoot gets stuck in place which can be disappointing). Overall, 7/10 game, very fun but needs polishing
Date 2020-04-26 Playtime 21h 21m Rec Positive great work for a small team. Its really fun and i look forward to the new content drops

Date 2020-02-01 Playtime 4h 4m Rec Negative Fico num impasse entre recomendar ou não esse jogo porque ele é divertido tudo, melhor ainda com amigos, mas ele cansa, ele fica repetitivo não tem pra onde você ir depois de um tempo, as ações são limitadas é tudo limitado. Você só pode fazer algumas coisas e essa limitação toda acaba deixando o jogo uma merda de bigfoot enorme porque você não tem mais pra onde ir nem o que fazer, se eles fizessem uma sobrevivência mais elaborada junto da caça do bigfoot até ficaria legal, mas é só aquilo, tu joga umas horas depois já fica com sono e tédio e fecha esse jogo e nem lembra mais que ele existe.  O que é bonito nele são os gráficos e o que é feio é os desenvolvedores abandonarem o jogo, pegou o dinheiro da galera e enfiou tudo no rabo e não atualizaram mais jogo por isso ele tá tão chato e sendo abandonado.  Enquanto não voltarem a dar atenção esse jogo ele vai continuar sendo dinheiro jogado no lixo.

Date 2020-01-28 Playtime 8h 52m Rec Negative We just spent an hour and a half on the glacier map sneaking around, finding items and placing cameras, just to discover the sasquatch stuck in the cave, he couldn't move. So in an attempt to unglitch him, we saved and left the server. When we restarted the server we spawned in midair on the other forest map, so we just fell to our deaths...  The tent and nightvision cameras and firepits don't seem to be of much use(other than warmth in the glacier map)  Great atmosphere, but the game needs a lot of work.

Date 2020-01-27 Playtime 9h 6m Rec Negative My previous review was written two years ago and most of my problems I had with the game back then, still exist today.  Let me sum up the biggest problems with the game in five points.  *Bigfoot has over 1,000HP.  *A headshot with the rifle deals 5 damage.  *There's enough ammo on the entire map to bring him down to 30% if you unload everything into him.  *He gets stuck and just stands in place while you use all your ammo on him slowly but surely.  *His attack AI is to run over, knock you down, run away, repeat; and it looks and feels very janky, sometimes he'll run over with a sign or guitar and slap you with it or throw it at you.  Rest of the time he is walking and or running around aimlessly and ignoring bullets, probably because they're barely leaving a scratch on him.
Date 2020-01-27 Playtime 31h 6m Rec Positive Very fun game to play with friends but not really much to do. Once you beat bigfoot you have beat the whole game.
Date 2020-01-26 Playtime 20h 29m Rec Positive Как бы игра хорошая, но нужно учитывать несколько вещей:  1)Играть одному - нереально скучно и сложно 2)Бигфут поначалу вроде легкий, и вообще все хорошо, но когда вы убьете его на половину, он будет постоянно за вами бегать и почти ваншотать, а аптечек почти нету 3)Ебааать он мало ли что неубиваемый и сложный, так еще вы не успев снести ему половину обнаруживаете, что у вас закончились патроны и аптечки  как бы я кншн все понимаю уважаемые разработчики, но ебать есть еще одна игра, похожая на вашу - rake, да она хуже по всем параметрам, но там хотя бы его можно убить, тут же нереально, нужно патронов 150 в него всадить, когда всего вы найдете штук 60-70 на карте   дурка ебать, а не игра

Date 2020-01-24 Playtime 1h 49m Rec Positive Bigfoot'u bulmak çok uzun sürmediği için uzun bir oynanım sunmuyor. Kameralarla, tuzaklarla uzun uzun uğraşıp Bigfoot'un hiç alakasız bir şekilde birden ortaya çıkması acayip saçma. Madem oyuna kamera ve tuzak türü şeyler eklenmiş, onları kullanarak yerini tespit edelim ve yakalayalım ki daha uzun bir oynanımı olsun.  Genel olarak çok geliştirilebilir bir oyun. 15-20 TL arası bir parayı rahatlıkla hakeder.

Date 2020-01-22 Playtime 21h 59m Rec Positive This game is really fun to hop on with all the boys, and chill out. It's got pretty good graphics and visuals as well as being very engaging. My only problems with it is it tends to be slightly buggy, and it also seems too easy to just complete and then be done with. Kinda wish there were either more modes or something to make it more replayable.

Você tá andando, ele aparece, você não consegue fugir (pois ele é muito rápido) e por isso ele te bate pra caramba. Depois, DO NADA ele foge, e você não consegue alcançá-lo [strike](pois ele é muito rápido)[/strike]. Uma vez, ele focou tanto em mim, que eu acabei morrendo e meu amigo não podia me curar, pois não tínhamos encontrado nenhum Kit Médico, o jeito era reiniciar em um novo server.  *A vida do Pé Grande é ridiculamente grande.

People used to throw rotten fruit at me in the street and women despised me. However, after playing this game, my cancer vanished, cured all my aids and my parents came back. I can get any woman I want with a simple snap of my fingers. I'm not sure if its the rough booty clapping BigFoot gives me, or the fact I'm on cocaine and currently in a drug induced coma, but my life has never been better!

Date 2020-01-15 Playtime 21h 5m Rec Positive Its a fantastic game, really good with friends although it can be played solo if you are willing lol. I do think maps need a bit more loot and bigfoot needs to have less health because thus far ive only been able to kill him with a friend due to a glitch causing him to get stuck in place. I hope the developers update the game cause i really wanna see this really fun game get even better :)

Date 2019-10-31 Playtime 6h 25m Rec Negative By far one of the least fun games I've played in my entire life. There is barely any content, and the content in the game is the most boring and repetitive gameplay imaginable. The devs clearly have no idea what they are doing in terms of fun gameplay. The game is full of bugs and missing features. Do not waste your money on this joke of a game. The most fun part of this game was laughing at how terrible it was.The game is only in early access, which excuses the lack of content, but that doesn't excuse the excruciatingly boring content that is available. Hopefully this game remains early access and is abandoned by the devs in hopes that they move on to a somewhat enjoyable game to work on.

Date 2019-10-25 Playtime 23h 19m Rec Positive This game can be really fun in multiplayer but it is kinda boring when you are playing in singleplayer .The graphics are pretty good the map is a little bit small but still its a good game .
Date 2019-10-25 Playtime 5h 29m Rec Positive This is a pretty fun game where you and a couple of friends have to find bigfoot and capture him, but Bigfoot has quite a lot of health, so taking him down isn't easy and you have don't have very much health at all. So, you would think that a hunting rifle would be able to do a lot of damage but doesn't much at all which is strange, so the game forces you in that aspect to use bear traps which actually damage Bigfoot a lot. The game doesn't tell you this but something you have to find out. There is other wildlife in the maps, such as deer and wolves. Both of them can be killed, so you can get meat from them and put them on bear traps which lures Bigfoot to them. Also, there's cameras to be set up across the map to see where Bigfoot is moving around and it is a big map to walk across from top to bottom with different locations to be discovered that have an assortment of items to be picked up. Another useful item in the game is a controlled drone that a player may use in finding Bigfoot. You have an option of playing two maps, a forest biome and a snowy mountain biome.   Pros. The game has a lot of potential to be something really great and stand out. Fun mechanics. Challenging gameplay.  Cons. Needs more balancing with items doing damage against bigfoot. Items are scarce. Glitches.  Below,  I have a link of a video I made with my friends and it's more of a funny moments but depicts what the gameplay is like and if you are unsure about purchasing the game, please check it out and you'll be able to see it for yourself.  https://youtu.be/jrZgQ_kVk5s
Date 2019-10-25 Playtime 7h 55m Rec Positive Игра просто прекрасная.Советую всем поиграть пока не сдохли. Есть один недостаток  в виде не доделки карт: В пещере можно легко залезть на камни и просто резать Бигфута, что упрощает поимки данного зверя.(работает на обоих картах)

Date 2019-10-21 Playtime 1h 29m Rec Positive this is still in Beta mode so people must remember that, so there will be bugs and improvements still to come. But what i saw on the whole i enjoyed it.   It's not a full game (Beta) and it is only 1.8gb in size, but the environment looks nice with day/night cycle, weather and a nice low mist round the swamp areas.  Things that need to be improved: Bigfoot can't reach you when you're standing on a log 4 feet in the air. Bigfoot runs too fast as well.  your character runs as if he or she is on 'ice' and looks a bit weird. The Sun rises and falls too fast. I'd like to see it a bit more subtle and would like to see daylight last longer than the night cycle which is about 50/50 atm. I would like to see a compass added as the map is quite basic. More detail added to your character would be beneficial as well. A general improvement of animal AI and add more animals would be great.  The above isn't a negative but an honest feedback and independent developers must be encouraged to pursue their goal and don't forget this is in Beta atm......  If you want to encourage independent devs then buy Bigfoot and support this game. the more support then hopefully more improvement.   I am not affiliated to the devs of this game what so ever.

Date 2019-10-20 Playtime 1h 37m Rec Negative This game is BEYOND buggy! Me and a friend tried it out and ended up returning it within an hour to get a refund. I ended up getting stuck INSIDE bigfoot somehow and carried around for a good fifteen minutes or so until my friend found bigfoot (and me) again. Hilarious and good fun but very, very buggy! Maybe try it out for a few dollars if its on sale? I'd pay five dollars MAX for it.

Miały w sobie unikatowy klimat. Z każdym większym updatem ten klimat ulegał zmianie i niestety w najnowszej wersji zanikł, co nie znaczy że gra jest zła.

Date 2019-10-01 Playtime 279h 55m Rec Positive Eiso da ich mir das Spiel bereits 20 Stunden angesehen haben muss ich echt sagen, Fuck dieses Spiel ist der reinste Nervenkitzel :3. Diese Atmosphäre mit dem Rascheln und den anderen Tieren bringt dich immer wieder auf Spannung bis dann einmal Bigfoot von hinten kommt und dich durchnudelt....  Jedenfalls ist dieses Spiel seinen Preis wert und auf jedenfall Sehenswert.
Date 2019-10-01 Playtime 14h 17m Rec Positive So it's fun for the first few hours But after a while you begin to learn the mechanics He becomes very predictable Although I highly recommend not reading too much into it I also highly recommend beating the forest map before uninstalling No recent updates tho:/
Date 2019-10-01 Playtime 6h 6m Rec Positive This is a very good game for one in early access. Me and my friend recently bought it and have had a blast the past week. It is definitely better if you have a couple friends that join you, so keep that in mind. I do think there should be some sort of crafting mechanic so you can make med kits, and I also think there should be a sleep/hunger/thirst mechanic too. but overall, I'd give it a solid 5/5.
Date 2019-10-01 Playtime 10h 5m Rec Positive The game is epic, and I am really excited for it's release. I know the game is in early access, but one suggestion is to make a way to make first aid. Me and my friend were playing, and he got knocked but I had nothing to heal him, and I couldn't find any heals around the map. It's little stuff like this that is bad. Overall though I love the thrill of playing this.
Date 2019-10-01 Playtime 5h 31m Rec Positive Honestly a hilariously fun game. Probably not if you're playing solo, but I play with a friend and its got us laughing and freaking out for hours. 10/10 recommend.
Date 2019-09-30 Playtime 25h 29m Rec Positive Ein sehr tolles Spiel!  Mit Freunden macht das Spiel am meisten Spaß. Die Anspannung wenn man durch den dunklen Walt läuft oder in der Eismap ist echt spannend. Auch wenn Bigfoot relativ stark ist ist das Spiel mit ein wenig Glück und kaum Skill zu meistern.  Fazit: es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall!
Date 2019-09-30 Playtime 10h 27m Rec Negative Game spawns me somewhere in the stratosphere, and then promptly drops me and gravity works it magic on my sweet, sweet, fragile bones. A pleasant event, if you replace the word pleasant with annoying and frankly kind of disappointing over all. Only seems to happen in online CO-OP, as singleplayer works fine. Still would like my multiplayer game to work with multiple players, however.

Date 2019-09-24 Playtime 24h 59m Rec Positive The game is great and I really enjoy playing it. The sound design is amazing and the graphics are great. Although I am experiencing a glitch. On the glacier map whenever I try to reload and pick up from where I left off I fall and end up in the forest map. Sometimes I stay within the glacier map but just take a lot of damage. I'm not sure how to fix this or if anyone else is experiencing this too. Help will be greatly appreciated

Date 2019-09-16 Playtime 28h 55m Rec Negative My main issue is that Bigfoot is too strong, and the gun/ammo spawns are actual trash (literally played with max loot, and found almost nothing). I liked the old build when you got 3-4 guns in the spawn van (compared to the 1 rifle, 1 pistol) & Bigfoot could actually be taken out. Also why does that knife do 3 damage? It is pretty much useless. There are also a lot of bugs in this current build, Bigfoot will not always get blinded, and taking damage while in camera mode bugs out your screen, I cannot recommend this game in it's current state.   Please Nerf Bigfoot's health, or increase human damage.

Date 2019-09-12 Playtime 7h 19m Rec Positive BIGFOOT это когда с другом играть страшнее , чем одному.BIGFOOT это когда капкан полезнее ружья.BIGFOOT это когда погнался за енотом и попал в лапы к Йети . Первые часы играешь на одном дыхание,пугаешься каждого шороха,каждый куст осматриваешь фонариком.НО. Потом(это по моему мнению проблема всех хороров) привыкаешь,вырабатываешь рефлекс,Йети становится не страшным и пугающим , а угарным и смешным. Итог: BIGFOOT довольно интересная и увлекательная игра.Она займёт достойное место в нише приключенческих хороров. P.S. Не надо геройствовать, Йети легче завалить капканами.

Date 2019-09-08 Playtime 13h 8m Rec Negative [OUTDATED REVIEW - APPLIES ONLY TO INITIAL BETA]  I can see so much potential in this game, but right now I'd say it''s mediocre and in need of work by the Devs. It kind of seems as if they've abandoned the game, which is a shame because with some more work I'd absolutely love it.  Positives:  1) It's definitely fun to play with friends. 2) The graphics are quite nice, especially the lighting, weather and the general landscape looks awesome. 3) The idea behind the game is interesting, and I like how it works. 4) The atmosphere of the game is quite nice. I wouldn't call it scary, but it's certainly tense when you first play it. 5) The audio is decent too. 6) I love the fact you can watch the cameras and fly drones to track Bigfoot using your in-game tablet.  Negatives:  1) It's full of bugs. I've only played the game for several hours and already I've encountered plenty of bugs. Sometimes these are fine, but sometimes they really affect your ability to survive or fight. 2) After quite a short time, it becomes too predictable. Once again, I haven't played it for long, but already I'm beginning to work out the mechanics of the game, such as when Bigfoot attacks etc... 3) There isn't enough variety in the places you can discover.  4) There is also quite a big lack of supplies across the map which makes it incredibly difficult at times when you need to share your supplies among your team. 5) This leads me onto my next point, which is there should be difficulty options. It could just be me but it becomes incredibly difficult to actually kill Bigfoot (and I'm talking about a 4-man team here against him). He has a massive amount of health and weapons do very little damage. We very quickly ran out of ammo even after finding all locations on the map and found it nearly impossible to find enough to share between us. 6) The character models (especially for Bigfoot himself) aren't brilliant.  What could be added to the game:  - More maps available (at the time of writing this, there are only two). - Better animations and character models. I mean Bigfoot pretty much just looks like a shadow in the shape of a gorilla. - More things you have to do, such as finding/cooking food to survive. - Possibly some more weapons which have different abilities.  Overall, it's a fun game to play with two or three other friends and it has a lot of potential, especially if more maps and features are added to it. I'd say the price may be a little high, but I suppose if it's ever on sale it would be worth a try. It does seem like the type of game which you'd get bored of relatively quickly in the state it's in at the moment. The fact that it's been in early-access for so long isn't exactly promising and I really hope this isn't totally abandoned because it would be a massive shame!  My final score: 4.5/10

Date 2019-07-07 Playtime 1h 9m Rec Negative Ganz im ernst ich kann die guten Reviews nicht verstehen. Man hat in diesem Spiel Fallen, Köder, Kameras und sonstige Möglichkeiten den Bigfoot ausfindig zu machen. Allerdings ist davon alles komplett irrelevant denn er wird euch eh alle 5 bis 10 Minuten finden und Krankenhausreif prügeln. Ganz ohne dass man überhaupt nach ihm sucht. Also leider ziemlich langweilig und nicht wert Geld aus zu geben.

Date 2019-06-30 Playtime 24h 29m Rec Positive The game is great but takes too long to see bigfoot and kill him.
Date 2019-06-30 Playtime 48h 42m Rec Positive This is actually an awesome game. The Idea of attempting to track down a giant beast in the woods at night like on those T.V shows is super appealing. To begin with the atmosphere set by this game is so thick. The fact that a majority of the game on at least the Ross Lake map is in the dark and during a rainstorm really makes the sudden appearance of an animal or Bigfoot himself that more scary. And before I continue I must really talk about the star of this game, Bigfoot. The sounds of him really fit and although the model is very impressive (which is understandable compared to the rest of the animal models) it really does feel like he is a real Sasquatch coming roaming the woods when you see him. This game is also a very fun game to play with your friends in a third party platform like Discord as currently there isn't anyway to communicate in game without opening a chat. I think unless they add a voice chat in game then something like Discord is the best way to play this with friends. It is a lot of fun to track down Bigfoot and make traps with your buds along side you. However this game isn't perfect. Like I've said before the models of this game could use an upgrade and the map does need a bit more life. I think adding some animal ambience like birds of even putting birds in the sky or adding the sounds of frogs in the swamp would make the game feel a lot more real. Maybe even some ingame events to add more life too like a pack of wolves or a bear fighting Bigfoot or Bigfoot catching a deer. I do feel also that the Glacier Park map is a bit too bright and could be a bit darker at night to make it more spooky. I do think this game could also add a couple new gamemodes. Some of my ideas include one where you play as Bigfoot or some new maps. An Australian one with a Yowie could be nice. There could even be more monsters like the Mothman, Chupacabra, Jersey Devil, Loch Ness Monster, a Lizard Man, or even a Werewolf. This game could also be so much more then just Bigfoot if you really wanted. Overall this is a really fun game that I highly suggest and believe could be turn into something great.  PS ~ Bigfoot ate my A$$!

Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 121h 26m Rec Positive A great game overall. Overtime I have watched the community and the game itself grow over time while playing and talking about it. I enjoy this game for a number of reasons. One of which being that playing it with a few friends is always a great time. There are not too many limitations in Bigfoot which I personally enjoy as there is an objective as well as feeling like a sandbox.

Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 12h 51m Rec Positive Best looking game i've ever played in my whole life. The graphics are so damn good, even in low settings! It is very fun to play with your friends, they improved the game so much since it's initial release! Hunting bigfoot gives you the best terrifying feeling ever, or is he hunting you?  Oh and if you decide to go alone then you're basically f*cked, but it doesn't matter if you go alone or with friends, the experience always is en always will be the most terrifying and scary experience you've ever had ;)  Happy hunting!

Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 1h 15m Rec Negative Schön gedacht, aber zum Teil falsch umgesetzt.  - Es fehlt die komplette Einführung(Tutorial), daher ist alles "Learning by doing". + Es gibt schöne Schreck-Momente - Der Reiz das Spiel dauerhaft zu spielen (damit sich das Geld lohnt) fehlt. - Sehr viel Wartezeit indem man nichts tut, außer in der Nähe einer Falle zu sitzen (vllt. auch im Zelt) und abzuwarten ob der BigFoot in die Falle geht um ihn danach erschießen zu können. +/- Deutsche übersetzung Schulnote 4+  Zum derzeitigen Zeitpunkt kann ich das Spiel leider nicht empfehlen, es hat zwar potenzial, aber dies wird durch die lange Wartezeit zunichte gemacht.

This is a minor criticism  and a big bug otherwise great game.                                                 p.s thank you people for making a good cryptid game and putting in effort.

Date 2019-06-20 Playtime 3h 56m Rec Positive Начнём с того что игра отличный выбор для компании , так как играть в одиночку в неё очень скучно. Сам Бигфут ёбнет тебя один раз и убежит , поэтому Бигфута поймать очень сложно. Бегает он очень быстро и бьёт тебя тоже очень больно , а аптечек на карте очень мало и вам в любом случае придётся идти за ними и патронами , а пока вы будите идти вас ёбнет Бигфут и убежит. Патронов тупо не хватает но в этом и прикол что на месте сидеть не получиться и надо идти исследовать карту! Пока карты всего две но я надеюсь что разрабы всё же добавят побольше разных карт и сделают их генерацию рандомной потому-что когда ты полностью изучишь то играть уже будет не интересно. А так игра отличная , для большой компании в самый раз! И как многие говорят что игра страшная , как по мне в ней страшно только первый час , а потом ты просто ходишь по карте. 10 Бигфутов из 10!

Date 2019-06-19 Playtime 27h 53m Rec Positive This game is god tier
Date 2019-06-19 Playtime 25h 34m Rec Negative Negatives: This game is mediocre, not worth the full 15$, it has its elements, but overall Big Foot himself does not look that scary, the character models look off, there is tons of glitches (just jumping in the van causes you to clip through the top and see through it) The game has no side game modes, its just one game mode (solo and co-op survival). game play is just to bland, and rushed once you take down like a forth of his health he goes after you, over and over again, giving you no time to prepare. Another thing this game is missing is a difficulty setting, the game by it self is kinda easy, the thing about attacks is all it takes is one flare, and he is off running, its extremely basic when it comes to attacks, where you just hit him with a flare and he comes attacking, something I'm not sure if I'm missing, but you cant throw a signal flare, something minor but that can overall ruin a situation, where you can only drop it so when ever you use one you are at complete risk, there also is not that much diversity in places to go to.  Positives: it is fun to play with friends, and AT TIMES it can be stressful but mainly the start (when you get the first attack on him) because he becomes SEMI harmful, and it causes you to be on your toes, where after he attacks so much, its predictable and gives you way to long to learn the mechanics  Suggestions:  Try to make the character models more natural, and the animations. add more game modes (maybe one where you can become Big Foot and hunt other players) add difficulty (and harder difficulties makes it less obvious that he is coming and its not super easy to make him leave) Possibly make them actually characters, voice lines (kinda like left 4 dead) make more features, likes possibly cooking food and eating it and stuff like that.  edit:   yeti mode Now When writing the review I played the main map, however I did not play much of the yeti map, now after playing the yeti map i would say that the difficulty is better, just because the one extra gameplay setting, being the temperature, the game still maintains its bugs and mediocre design (in my opinion) but the yeti mode I would say is better, because it actually forces you to go outside and makes the game harder, i would recommend playing yeti mode, its, in my opinion what the core game mode should have been, but this still does not excuse the bugs and many glitches that take place, so a continuation of my review:  positives (core game mode): I could'nt find much for this edit, but I would say that if you do move around more the game is funner to play, but it still is bland, So if you are playing, move around, don't just stay in your camper if you are looking for a better experience.  negative (oh boy): I feel like there is a lot this game misses out on, and one of it being its to bland, like its extreme simplicity makes it fun in some cases, but the type of game it is, its simplicity just does not work, the game usually goes down to this:     Day time you explore, night time you hunt and explore, but there is almost no diversity in exploring so in the end your exploration is more a resource grind then something you will actually have fun doing and you almost never actually spot him on the cameras, they are more of a buzzer that he is coming.  Now, the thing is it is not really that scary, after those first 2 "Oh nO HE iS HErE" and you realize how crappy looking the model looks and how funny it looks when he runs away, and the animations that look horrible, you really just cant be scared of it, you can be scared of him coming at the beginning and soon enough you are not even scared to go toe to toe with him. And on that note, after the game gets to a point your just trying to find and kill bigfoot, and its not scary when he attacks, its more of just oppurtunity and it has very little fun value when you are just looking around to shoot him, and bumping into the ocasional hunting tower and animal walking by, but it gets boring and repetitive where you are seeing the same stuff over and over again.  Now when it comes to bugs, I feel like I should have named more to show how game breaking they are some times so: ROCKS Rocks are the true enemy of bigfoot, if bigfoot gets caught on a rock it completely destroys your play through because he literally can not move, and you just kill him, you cant get him to move he is just stuck, so yeah, thats nice. Not sure if its a glitch but it oddly happens a lot, if you open up cameras you sometimes randomly hear glass breaking, this gets extremely annoying because it can be a complete false alarm and cause you and who you are playing with to have to go check, and just dissapointment. Now this is also not really a glitch, but its really causes some inconsistancy, now when firing your flare gun usually he leaves, but you can fire it at him at point blank and he ignores it, and it does not seem like bullets come, so if bigfoot comes there is very little way to get him to go away, and the way that is supposed to work can not work, I would say dont even change it, but add more ways to make him go away.

Date 2019-06-18 Playtime 27h 33m Rec Positive At first the game was slow, and had some issues. with the new up dates and fixes, and a new map. Love it. We were being hunted. the game will always need tweaking. I would beg for a couple more med kits, and say 2 or 3 more boxes of bullets. We like hunting the bears and wolves. I now say this is a good game. not to long, Me and my son got him with 4 bullets, and 1 trap left. We had a great time being hunted. Hope it goes on sale so more people will buy the game. I really like it. Good Job guys. i Jumped a few time and we had a good laugh. Thank you.

Date 2019-06-15 Playtime 8h 40m Rec Negative Абсолютно не подходящая для времяпровождения игра. Вы ищите хорор, с интересным сюжетом и локациями? Тогда вы промахнулись с выбором. Всё начинается с однообразной механики, тучи багов и скудности игровых фишек. Основной противник, Бигфут постоянно телепортируется, бегает под водой, бьёт сквозь стены. Элементы выживания на уровне застрели животное - найди мясо, которое ты есть не будешь, ведь оно нужно для капкана. То же происходит и с лутанием: рюкзак на 30 огромных булыжников - зачет, ветки - да хоть целое дерево из них собери. А процесс согревания на зимней карте? Чтобы согреться у костра, тебе нужно встать внутрь него, иначе тепло не распростроняется, и игрок всё равно замерзнет. Единственный обнаруженный мной плюс связан с мультиплеером - присоединение к друзьям работает быстро и без сторонних программ. Так что если есть желание посмеяться с лагов игры - создавайте лоби с другими, выкинувшими деньги на ветер, людьми.  Абсолютно не оправданное вложение. Резко негативное персональное отношение. Своих денег не стоит точно.

Date 2019-06-14 Playtime 5h 53m Rec Negative Jeu sympa,   Ambiance assez cool et graphiquement beau, un coté survie serait le bien venu, boire, manger, cependant pas mal de choses à revoir :   - mes cameras ne fonctionnes pas sur l'ordinateur de la caravane, - le Bigfoot te voit meme  caché dans la végétation sans bouger depuis 5 min... pas possible embuscade. - la vitesse de déplacement du bigfoot est trop élevé et ses mouvements pas convainquant. - manque de variété niveau piège. - j'aimerai voir plus de vie sauvage, écureuils, oiseaux, poissons ....   - pouvoir piéger une porte ou une tour de guet quand le Bigfoot vous prend en chasse.  - une esquive, roulade ... pourrai servir.  - bug niveau audio quand il y a de l'orage le jeu perd des FPS.  - j'ai croisé aucun ours ?? que des loups.   voila encore pas mal de choses a revoir ou voir, mais dans l'ensemble j'aime bien ce jeu et son principe.   Vivement du contenu et de l'optimisation !   Un pouce négatif pour le peu de mise à jour, depuis le mois de mai aucune mise a jour ???   Good game.

Date 2019-06-13 Playtime 20h 22m Rec Negative So just wanting to put this review out here since the first time i got this game with my pals and decided to give it a go this game was somewhat Decent. We completed it without many issues, but after each new update (Including the ones that gave us new maps, the game kept breaking further and further.) The Big foot began to get stuck on things, Instantly draining any motivation we had to play this, as we just thought that there is no point. So we dropped it. Now with the 3.0 update we decided to give it a go again and after finding out that this is actually more playable like back in the good old days we kept playing... UNTIL Bigfoot managed to punch me down and put me into Dying State. From which my friend revived me and that is when i found myself being carried by bigfoot.. No the problem wasn't that i couldn't do anything.. The problem was that I ended up killing the bigfoot with the knife while being carried by it.  Ruining the experience once again.. Maybe in the future updates we are willing to give it another go, but that shall be seen.
Date 2019-06-12 Playtime 17h 54m Rec Positive Ich persönlich finde Finding Bigfoot Bzw BIGFOOT ein sehr cooles und spanendes Spiel.  Erfahrung:  Immer wenn ich das Spiel spiele ist es einfach nur Spannend, weil ich habe permanent das Gefühl beobachtet zu werden und den Gedanken das Bigfoot nicht einfach so randomly bei mir spawnt wenn er bock hat, sondern irgendwie durch die Map läuft und zufälliger Weiße auf mich stößt.   Ich finde das Ambiente des Spieles mega: Umfallende Bäume, Blitzeinschläge, Bigfoot der zwischen durch mal schreit, die Rehe usw.  Fazit:  Wenn man auf art Horrorgames steht dann sollte das ein perfektes spiel für einen sein. Ich würde empfehlen das man es mit einem Freund oder mehr spielt da es sonst extrem Creepy werden kann. (auser man möchte ein creepy feeling haben lol)   Frage: Ich verstehe aber noch nicht ganz:Kommt Bigfoot nur den ersten Tag nicht und danach immer. (egal ob Tag oder Nacht)                                                                                                  Oder nur in der Nacht und nicht am Tag? Wenn das jemand wüsste wäre es nett Wenn es mir jemand sagen könnte. Danke. 
Date 2019-06-11 Playtime 32h 56m Rec Positive [h1] Here's the Pros and Cons of BIGFOOT: [/h1]  [b] Pros: [/b] - This game is an enjoyable experience to play with friends - The camera and drone system are easy to use - Getting chased by a 10 foot hairy being that has a horribly ugly face while it stomps and causes shrieks in your Discord call adds some spice to your night - The map is a decent size to explore in pairs or a group - BIGFOOT is fairly cheap and a group of preferably 4 people would have a great time playing  [b] Cons: [/b] - There isn't much to do besides hunt and kill Bigfoot - Bigfoot is very difficult to kill and often runs away after being shot and returns 30 minutes later  [b] Feedback/Suggestions: [/b] - When scoped in on your rifle, it is pixelated and takes away part of the realism of this game - Make Bigfoot easier to kill - Add more wildlife and traps - Create a need for food and water - Make Bigfoot more aggressive and give him the ability to destroy cameras - Add more weaponry - Bigfoot is fast and it proves to be difficult to chase him down even when he's been shot with a tracer bullet  [b] Tips for New Players: [/b] - If you're playing with friends, evenly divide the loot among yourselves, specifically: cameras, traps, bullets, signal flares, etc. - Don't fight with your friends it gets you nowhere - Don't buy the game to play it alone  Overall, for $15.99 and still in Early Access, this game is a solid 8/10 and I'd recommend it to anyone who asks about it.
Date 2019-06-09 Playtime 104h 34m Rec Positive Hey guys. Just played 90 mins of BIGFOOT. I'm quite impressed. I had played The Forest quite a bit and was thinking this would be comparable. I enjoyed this more as it felt more realistic. If possible, please include more wildlife, such as snakes, birds, rabbits etc. Also, if we were able to craft more things and also dig traps...this would be cool. Also, any chance of a shotgun and bow? Great work!
Date 2019-06-09 Playtime 15h 42m Rec Positive Can be a little buggy at times. But overall an extremely fun game. Especially co-op with friends. Bigfoot is big, strong and hits like a truck. This game gets dark creepy forest and isolated frozen wasteland right. The bigfoot AI still needs work but even in his current state, he's a formidable foe. We had to change strategies a few times. Highly recommend this one. Can't wait to see the finished product.
Date 2019-06-08 Playtime 0h 41m Rec Positive I am not a fan of scary games, but this i've bought for playing with friends. Quite  horrifying when you meet this big black nibba at first. Especially at night while rain drums on the roof of your shelter. My first tip — never type Bigfoot in your tablets search. NEVER, TRUST ME, YOU DON'T WANNA SEE IT.
Date 2019-06-05 Playtime 8h 59m Rec Negative Das Spiel ist nicht wirklich schlecht aber auch nicht wirklich gut. In den ersten Momenten ist es Lustig und spannend zu spielen aber das hält nicht lange an. Nach knapp einer Stunde hatte mich schon die Unlust gepackt Bigfoot noch fangen zu wollen. Der Nervenkitzel hält nicht lange an und beim Spielen hat man schnell das Gefühl auf der Stelle zu treten und das ohnehin schon getane zum X. Mal zu wiederholen.

Date 2019-06-01 Playtime 10h 58m Rec Positive At first, this game gave me a decent scare, some good tension, jump scares, etc. but when you build the confidence to go on the offensive, you start to realize how much of a baby ol’ Bigfoot really is. He can give it, just can’t take it worth jack.
Date 2019-06-01 Playtime 18h 52m Rec Positive This game is a great idea! I love games like this. This is even better than what I expected. It is really realistic and I love to play online. I highly recommend this game for people who likes being in the wilderness and having a monster lurking around inside of it. I love this game. I can't get enough of it.

Before that it was an enjoyable rinse repeat gameplay of hear roar shoot with tracker freind shoots with bullets when dancing gets hard shoot with flare. wait 5 minutes repeat.  however after bigfoot getting stuck on something or falling through the world and being unfindable. and a player falling through the world(me) with the offensive half of the teams gear.....  I put in for a refund and called it a day. I don't know about singleplayer because I only bought it to play with my friend

Date 2019-05-20 Playtime 28h 33m Rec Positive 10/10 Best Indie horror game that I have ever played. Leaves you shit scared but also memeing.
Date 2019-05-19 Playtime 51h 14m Rec Positive Heute entschloss ich mich ein Review über das Spiel ,,BIGFOOT´´ zu schreiben  BIGFOOT ist ein Open world Spiel, welches man alleine, sowie im Multiplayer mit bis zu 4 Spielern spielen kann. Es geht darum Ausrüstung auf den beiden Maps zu sammeln und Bigfoot zu fangen.  Positives am Spiel:  - verschiedene Ausrüstung wie Gewehre, Messer, Nachtsichtkameras, Fallen,       Gewehrmunition, Tracking-Kugeln, Signalfackeln,       Signalwerfer, Zelte, Fleisch,       Drohne, Kameras, Erste Hilfe Sets, Akkus - die Karten sind gut gestaltet - 2 verschiedene Karten (Glacier Bay, Ross Lake) - Tiere die man schießen kann um Fleisch für Fallen zu bekommen - man kann sehen, wie viele Leben Bigfoot noch hat - kann Orte entdecken (Touristenlager, Hochsitze, Forschungslager, Minen usw) - an jeden weiteren Tag wird Bigfoot aggressiver  - man hört manchmal Musik wenn er angreift - muss sich an Lagerfeuern warm halten - im Multiplayer steigt der Loot und Bigfoot HP  - muss 4 verschollene Touristen finden, die allerdings schon tot sind  Negatives am Spiel:  - Bigfoot buggt an manchen Orten - Tiere buggen manchmal - Bigfoot kann unter Wasser rennen, was ziemlich unlogisch ist - man hört Bigfoot nur noch selten schreien, deshalb weis man nie wo er ist    Ich würde mich noch sehr freuen, wenn man andere Kreaturen in das Spiel einbringen    würde also das man jetzt nicht nur immer Bigfoot jagd sondern irgendwelche anderen    Viecher. Für 13 Euro finde ich das Spiel ganz gut.    Ich empfehle das Spiel weiter, aber man sollte nicht zu schreckhaft sein.

Date 2019-05-18 Playtime 14h 51m Rec Positive Although I have mixed (but mostly positive) feelings about this game, it is still a great time to be had! Well, most of the time...  Let's start with the good things first:       Genuinely scary! The atmosphere created by the fog and all of the forest noises are great, and successfully make you creeped out! The wolves are a great addition, and so are the bears, as they both keep you interested for when you go 10+ minutes without finding bigfoot. Speaking of, when you do find Bigfoot himself, it is so great! All you hear are his roars and footsteps, all the way up until you get punched, or body slammed. Or both! The game excels in all of those aspects.       It also looks beautiful! With a decent computer, this game just looks so pretty. However, the corpses of the people you find look really bad compared to everything else in the game, but you only see them for a few seconds.       The multiplayer is so great! Even with only one friend, this game becomes super fun! Things are always so tense, and every noise creates a reaction from somebody. And seeing your friends getting body slammed by Bigfoot is something you can't beat!  But, not everything is so great:       There are constant glitches that take a lot of the fun away, for example the noise glitches. One glitch I've experienced is after I shoot a bullet, there is a constant buzzing noise that gets very irritating. Bigfoot getting stuck is very annoying as well, and it gets very boring just stabbing him a couple hundred times and then winning.       A VERY small nitpick is that you can see through many things if you just simply crouch and walk into it. This is very avoidable, however, and doesn't change too much about the game play, except make it just that little bit less scary.   Overall, I really like this game! The multiplayer is really the main reason that I play this game, just because it is so good! Making YouTube videos about this game is a great time both recording and editing. And watching as well, although I am pretty biased to my own stuff. This game earns itself a SOLID 7.5/10... it would be an 8 or 9 if the glitches weren't so abundance. Definitely reccomend this game! 
Date 2019-05-18 Playtime 2h 14m Rec Positive Love the game and the new Update! The new update is Great!!

Date 2019-05-17 Playtime 5h 48m Rec Positive This game has made HUGE upgrades to the ai and the overall aspect and has been a great game for me to play with my friends. It's great for spooky fun nights or days. Overall rate 9/10
Date 2019-05-16 Playtime 5h 31m Rec Positive If you would like to  hunt, stalk, and then get the holy piss thoroughly beaten out of you repeatedly by Bigfoot, then this game will be your jam. Bigfoot is a tough game. Partially because Bigfoot her/him/they-self, is big, fast, and mean. Also, because this game is sparsely populated with the items you need to aid you on your quest, such as traps, bullets, tactical nukes, and Chuck Norris. But seriously, this game is early access, and it feels like it in a lot of ways. There are items and things, such as tents, radios, guitars, etc, included in the game that seemingly don't serve much of a purpose yet. Hopefully functionality will be increased. Campfires work, but don't seem to do anything to keep Bigfoot away. I enjoyed the other wildlife in the game, most of which will attack viciously and promptly kill you. The first map I played, the one with the RV seemed to work best. It's a lot more playable than the snow one, which seemed to be an empty and way more glitchy land.  The graphics and sound are ok. Nothing outstanding, but they work ok. Multiplayer works well. The controls are standard WASD type of stuff.   The bottom line with Bigfoot, is that it's not a bad game. In a lot of ways, it's a potentially really, really, good game. That potential hasn't been met yet however, and the experience is kind of all over the place.  It's early access, so there is hope for Bigfoot to become something special. But right now the game is kind of middle ground. I'd say play it if you enjoy hunting games, are interested in Bigfoot, and can handle early access games.     I give this game 23419134031349134 out of 48210981348913489138 bloody hunter corpses, using the official bathroom trash game ranking criteria.
Date 2019-05-16 Playtime 54h 2m Rec Positive Doing great,keep up the faith in an true horror game.Just beware Bigfoot can enter your camper! Will piss on my self again.
Date 2019-05-16 Playtime 1h 57m Rec Positive I was really surprised by this game, the tension is amazing. Setting up camera's around the map, getting a hit on one of them. Then you find it was a deer.  Suddenly you get attacked by bigfoot, you manage to shoot him with a tracking dart. Now the chase begins!
Date 2019-05-16 Playtime 27h 30m Rec Positive While there the game is still in beta and there are issues to be fixed, and while I'm not the biggest fan of horror games, I actually really enjoy this game. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a game to have the odd scare and a good time with friends.

Cameras can't be shared anymore? old map has an extreme lack of any loot- serious more glitches than there were before the update Bigfoot got trapped in the mine shaft so we stabbed him to death with our knives  Bring back the fun and add more loot!

Date 2019-05-13 Playtime 1h 6m Rec Negative ....la compra de la que más me arrepiento  Digo, no está mal, y su precio es accesible, pero, si no tienes amigos, cagaste  ACTUALIZACION: tengo muchos juegos por completar, por lo que no se tomen en serio esta reseña, a este juego lo jugue cuando aun era una version alpha, asi que pronto le volvere a hechar un vistazo y ver como cambio, con amigos esta vez
Date 2019-05-13 Playtime 11h 41m Rec Positive It's an enjoyable game with fun survival elements, especially with friends, but there is at least one game breaking bug that make it impossible to play.  Sometimes when Bigfoot hits you, you end up being stuck on the ground and just unable to move at all.  This has happened a few times to my friends and I.  Some other things I have to say is add the settings option to the game so we can adjust volume and etc. while in-game.  As far as I can see, there is not a way to leave the game without closing the application.  Otherwise, it's a fun game with a lot of potential !
Date 2019-05-13 Playtime 1h 37m Rec Positive Played BIGFOOT with some friends not really expecting much considering the pictures and videos. However, what I learned very quickly is that whoever designed the sounds for the game decided to make the lighting fx louder than the big bang that created the universe. If you use headphones I hope your ears survive this game.

Date 2019-05-10 Playtime 14h 43m Rec Negative I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The first playthrough is awesome, but right now, there’s not enough to pull me back in for a second time. I played with a friend for the 3x I’ve played this, and I feel like the Bigfoot AI is not advanced enough to make the second playthrough interesting. The first time, you’re not too sure what to expect, which makes it a little creepier, but after a few ambushes, the creepy aspect goes away. Bigfoot charges you at the speed of light and strikes you with the full force of Jesus Christ himself. He wears Kevlar plating under his skin, as the rifle is relatively useless. What is the point in giving players rifles if the damage they do to the creature is incredibly miniscule? Unloading 10-20 rounds into Bigfoot will usually result in 1/10 of its health missing (and that’s generous), so the main way to kill him is to use traps. These require no skill. You place down the trap, put meat on it, and cover it with leaves. Eventually, he finds the meat and tries to eat it, and triggers the trap. This does a decent bit more damage (however nothing to write home about), but there’s no skill involved in placing these traps, which is mostly the only way to kill him. On our first playthrough, one of our traps killed him, and we didn’t even know where he was. These mindless traps take all the fun out of it. The game also gives you a knife, which would be neat if it did damage. It appears to just be used for skinning foxes and other animals, so I’m not sure why it exists outside of an animation. The cameras would be neat, if watching them was useful. They act as motion sensors as well, so if he trips the camera you’ll get a beep. Then you must scurry to find which camera he’s near. Why wouldn’t they just be motion sensors that ping on the map? It seems like this would be more useful & streamlined to me. However, the main disappointment is the Bigfoot AI. It’s relatively simple, with him running up to you super quick, hitting you a few times, and then flying back into the forest at an unattainable speed. Tracer bullets are theoretically a neat feature, but it’s demoralizing to watch him zoom through the map at speeds you cannot match, just to have the tracer wear off within a couple of minutes. It’s very difficult to catch up to him. The first time we played through, he got stuck on a rock and we were able to do ridiculous amounts of damage to him with our rifles, but after we ran out of bullets, he became unstuck. We didn’t have any more traps to hunt him with, no bullets for our rifles, and no more supplies to supplement us. We were forced to quit, being unable to take his last 1/3 health. We nailed him quickly on the second playthrough, and the third time around was very recently when we saw that an original map had been added back. We got bored within half an hour, however, because it was the same thing as before, just with a different map, and an ever so slightly better AI. I hate writing this because the game is gorgeous and has ENORMOUS potential, but please, please, please work on the AI before other content. It needs a drastic overhaul to have replayability. I understand this game is in early access, and so I cannot wait to see what the developers do to the game, but I would hold off a bit longer until the AI is more advanced.
Date 2019-05-08 Playtime 8h 35m Rec Positive Early access but i like it. :)
Date 2019-05-08 Playtime 6h 8m Rec Positive Had a tree get struck by lightning 2 feet away from me and i just about cried  ripheadphones/10
Date 2019-05-07 Playtime 2h 33m Rec Positive So I got this game as a gift from a friend. We played it for a bit a few months back and then forgot about it. Then we decided to pick it back up and get a copy for a fourth player. We ran around the woods getting attacked by Bigfoot and finding bodies and skulls. It was a wonderful time. We were scared and laughing our butts off all because of Bigfoot. While the game clearly has some issues with it still you would be doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game now. It has a good foundation already and the bugs aren't game breaking. If anything, they improved our experience with this game.

Date 2019-05-05 Playtime 13h 40m Rec Positive THE DEVS HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN!  This game is not dead. I will give the dev's some credit. Only a few days ago people thought the developers had forgotten about the game, but they are still working on it. A lot of new stuff have dropped the last couple of days and I am super happy.  I will throw some hours into this game again. Play it with my brothers and have a good time.   Thanks for not abandoning this game! Great concept and really fun game :)
Date 2019-05-05 Playtime 0h 15m Rec Negative game is literally trash. uninstalled it in 15 minuets. dont even feel like explaining why tbh, just dont waste your money

Date 2019-05-04 Playtime 12h 52m Rec Positive Bra spel, ljudet försvann
Date 2019-05-04 Playtime 32h 49m Rec Positive I love the idea of all the new things they have added, but the execution is just horrible I'm afraid. It hurts me to give a game with such potential a "Not Recommended", and this may change, but for now, I'm sorry Bigfoot.  EDIT: With a new update on the horizon, I'm going to update this review to recommended as the new content revealed via Cyberlights instagram looks very promising
Date 2019-05-04 Playtime 11h 5m Rec Positive  this game seems to me to be a good game especially since the old map has been replaced even if it is modified, it is not bad either the second map where you have to deal with yeti instead of bigfoot, it is my favorite game when she appeared, I expect to get the official version 
Date 2019-05-04 Playtime 2h 4m Rec Negative fun with friends but gets boring quickly bigfoot only attacks like every 10 minutes and gets annoying constantly running across the map
Date 2019-05-04 Playtime 2h 1m Rec Negative It's a realy good game but... it gets boring way to fast i played for 22 minutes and enjoyed it but theres not enough stuff to do.

Date 2019-05-03 Playtime 17h 19m Rec Positive richtig geiles spiel
Date 2019-05-03 Playtime 17h 52m Rec Negative hmmm...where do I start.  Stamina does not even come remotely close to something manageable to get "BigFoot".   Manageable you say?  NO stamina bar or feedback...run...run..run...suddenly stop for no reason.   Tracking bullets are a joke, too short for any effectiveness.  Bigfoot is actually not a real bigfoot, its Usain Bolt in a bigfoot costume.  Mafuckah sprints miles at a time, while my stamina runs out after 100 yards.   Bigfoot does around 25 MPH ...human   3 MPH.  They should call this game.  "lets press W for 2 hrs".   Can't drop items.  Can't heal partner down.  Can't see shit flying the drone.   I would call this game garbage, but I don't want to give garbage a bad name.   I hope the code for this game does't leave a shit stain on my SSD...
Date 2019-05-02 Playtime 96h 8m Rec Negative this game could be a lot better.  its also been in early access forever now, 2019's versions were better than the current.  I loved this game but even The Forest was better during it's early access.
Date 2019-05-02 Playtime 39h 19m Rec Positive I think this game is a very good game and it is very scary when bigfoot attacks you. It is good that it isn't too hard to kill bigfoot. Update 3.0 was a very good update and I can't wait for the Full Release!
Date 2019-05-02 Playtime 37h 33m Rec Positive love it

Date 2019-04-30 Playtime 2h 33m Rec Negative I haven't spent a lot of time in this game (a couple of hours as of writing this review), which is why I'm writing this review. This game seems like it could be fun, but the user interface is really messy and I can't figure out how to perform the various functions available in the game. I feel like I have to do a lot of clicking to access my arsenal of tools, and it needs to be much more streamlined than that. I can't so much as scroll between my items, which in the heat of the moment makes it difficult to remember what item is pinned to which key. Bigfoot came running at me and I had no way of switching to my rifle in time. In the game's current state, it is beautiful but unfortunately the mechanics are too clunky for it to be an enjoyable experience. Every time I've played I've gotten confused and bored too quickly.

Date 2019-04-29 Playtime 24h 33m Rec Negative Don't waste your money. Ever since the recent changes they've made this game impossible to play.  If you use a tracking bullet good luck catching Bigfoot because by the time you're half way to him it runs out since now he's been given one hell of a speed boost. I can't even change the settings while playing, have to force close and reopen since ESC doesn't work. This game was more enjoyable during it's original release.  UPDATE!  Last review was on April 29.  Decided to give this game another try after I saw that they had fixed up some bugs. They did increase the tracking, he was slower however there were even more bugs than before. Can't skip the beginning cutscene. The host can't turn head unless holding down the right mouse button and cannot see or use the UI in multiplayer. Falling through the map. Still can't use ESC key. Players will get frozen randomly when attacked by bigfoot, only way to unfreeze them is setting a trap down below them. Enter key to type wasn't working.
Date 2019-04-29 Playtime 5h 27m Rec Negative Silent wolf death and many huge glaring bugs that should have been picked up before release.     Bigfoot you used to be cool.

Your money will just go to waste for twenty dollars.

Date 2019-04-14 Playtime 15h 0m Rec Positive Оригинальная задумка, Rake нервно курит в сторонке и бомбит.  Довольно таки хорошая оптимизация на средних-высоких настройках графики. ( NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 2 GB, Intel Core I5-3570 3.4 GHz 4 core, 12 GB RAM DDR3.  Угарный бигфут с походкой МакГрегора, в три игрока ( чем больше тел в лобби, тем он сильнее ) сильно не бьёт, дизбаланса нет.  Отличная проработанная зимняя карта.  Атмосфера.  Можно обосратся если услышать как бигфут орёт от капкана.  Есть другая дичь, ( Лиса, енот, олень ) которую можно подстрелить и скормить этой белой махнатке.  Разработчик из моей страны ( УКРАИНА )  На игру не забили бибу и разрабатывают.  С друзьями можно играть, и играть.  Из минусов:  Пока что корявый перевод  больше не нашёл.  10 "БЛЯДЬ ХУЯРЬ ЭТОГО ПИДОРАСА ТАПКАМИ ПОКА ОН НЕ УШЁЛ НАХУЙ! ЗА НИМ БЛЯТЬ! ОТДА-АЙ САЛО! из 10
Date 2019-04-13 Playtime 1h 56m Rec Positive После попадания в бигфута он начинает убегать и хоррор превращается в орные догонялки с палками и ножами. Это надоедает как только бигфут теряется из видимости, пусть у него будет одна цель - убивать)) И Можно побольше лута по карте?) Еще есть баг с палаткой, когда в нее заходишь перс начинает как будто падать и сам выезжает из палатки, вдвоем зайти в неё невозможно (тут ещё может играть тот фактор, что я в неком роде того рукожоп)), но ведь это не только у меня, а у всей тимы)

Think twice before buying/playing this game [/quote]  BIGFOOT is a game developed and published by CyberLight Game Studio  The game offers some okay graphics, nothing amazing and has some awful texture work and UI interface, you can clearly tell it was made on the Unreal engine  The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but an okay game nonetheless and ends just at the right time  BIGFOOT overall, however, is an okay and sometimes genuinely fun game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an okay horror game to play in short bursts!

Date 2019-03-16 Playtime 11h 29m Rec Negative The game used to be decent, but had a few problems like no saving the game and not having a 4th player option. Though after a big update fixing some of the minor problems, but went backwards by replacing the forest map with some snow map instead of having both, having the game break just by trying to run or use a flashlight, making fall damage more deadlier than bigfoot(which me and my friend could rarely find), and a bunch of other stupid crap.  Such great game improvements by Cyberlight game studios themselves.   16 dollars I'll never get back.

Date 2019-03-15 Playtime 10h 7m Rec Negative Последнее обновление хуже не куда, до этого можно было ещё как то играть, т.к. сам Бигфут был активнее (нападал, наносил повреждения), на карте дополнительные цели были (найти трупы туристов), и сама карта была интереснее...Сейчас всё наоборот, Бигфут только нападает на хижину, всегда убегает когда приближаешься к нему, карта зимний лес скучная, я даже не понимаю какой вообще смысл в этой игре, а самое главное - цена не соответствует качеству...

Date 2019-03-01 Playtime 17h 58m Rec Positive Несмотря на наличие тупой шавки с полной кучей HP, это игра очень меня радует своей неожиданностью особенно в кооперативе когда у этой дылды всё больше HP а патронов на базе всё меньше и приходится лазить по местам этой локации для выискивание всех важных ресурсов. Около 2 лет назад когда игра вышла только в первые версии мне она казалась более интересной, возможно это из-за старого движка но мне кажется что эта дылда была но тот момент более умнее ну это уже решать не мне а так игра мне очень даже понравилась так-что я рекомендую в неё поиграть(желательно в кооперативе)
Date 2019-03-01 Playtime 7h 59m Rec Negative THIS GAME IZS SO BAD I  HATE IT 
Date 2019-02-28 Playtime 34h 47m Rec Positive This game scares the poop out of me, but I love it! You have to find meat for traps so you can bait bigfoot and have him get that big ol' foot caught (be sure to disguise the trap though (hold the f key). There are hunting towers littered around the map that have extra supplies in them (trust me, you'll probably need them). You can shoot animals for meat to bait traps, use flares to scare bigfoot away, and you can even use Nightvision goggles (haven't used em' much but they look cool). A really good game and worth the price of 16$. A tip for fellow chickens like me: turn up your game's gamma setting so that it is brighter, it makes it less scary (might need to mess with the slider for a while, its a little buggy). Watch your temperature, you don't want to freeze and die. Collect sticks to make fires & keep warm (you also don't need to make a new fire once it goes out, just press Left click while your holding a stick to place a new one on the fire (or better yet, while holding sticks left click on the stove to use it as a fire instead of needing to make one). More sticks make it hotter and thus you should put like 3-4 sticks down). Definately a game to consider if you like Bigfoot. And whatever you do: DO NOT TYPE "bigfoot" INTO THE TABLET'S SEARCH BOX (I don't want to spoil it but you'll need clean undies on standby,...).

Date 2019-02-22 Playtime 59h 26m Rec Positive Вышла  обнова 3.0 добавили новую карту и теперь он нападает часто ура! Рекомендую.
Date 2019-02-21 Playtime 90h 29m Rec Positive I like the game but i wish There were a TON more maps and for bigfoot to be more active in the game because i can never find him with my friends i cant find animals ether pls fix those and i will love this game so much. p.s i mainly want more maps! 
Date 2019-02-20 Playtime 1h 48m Rec Negative This game certainly has a fun concept. On the good side, this game features:   - Spooky atmosphere: Bigfoot is definitely intimidating (though too overpowering) and the dark atmosphere is easy to immerse yourself into and have a bit of fun with friends.  - Compelling goal: it can get personal and I promise you'll want to track Bigfoot down and kill him.  - Challenging survival mechanics: watch your body temp, and definitely spare along your resources.   -----------------------------  But it has some key issues preventing it from being truly fun and worth buying:   - Scarcity of loot: There's simply not enough loot on the map to make killing Bigfoot viable. There aren't enough bullets (it seems) and/or they're hard to find, and it's very hard finding loot in general requiring lots of searching for little reward. There is also a serious lack of medication which plays into the next few issues...  - Fall damage too punishing: falling a couple feet can vast chunks of your health, and the terrain is very rugged, so you have to really, REALLY watch your step.   - Bigfoot damage too severe: Bigfoot simply knocks you down, then your friends, and does untold damage in the process. This, fall damage, and the scarcity of medication makes the game almost unfinishable.   - Lack of settings: when creating a match, you can't tweak any settings, like adjusting Bigfoot aggression, damage multipliers, time cycle, loot abundance, or permadeath.   - Permadeath: once you die, you can only watch your teammates, so once you die (probably from falling too much), you're out, and the matches can take quite some time, so once you're out, you're out... Or you start a new game, which is what my roommates and I were doing. This is frustrating. It would be nice if you could have at least a certain amounts of revives, or revive with some kind of penalty (maybe you come back with frostbite, so reduced health).   - Cannot pick up drone: so once you deploy that badboy, you're using it until the (scarce, if at all existent) batteries are dead.   - Hostile developers: if you scan through other reviews or do some Googling, you'll see that the developers have been highly hostile toward the player base, resorting to extortion in some cases (check out WarriorDan's review.. they were particularly nasty to him). Other reviews claim that people lost their keys because the devs claimed to pull it out of EA, but as of 19 February 2019, it is still indeed in EA. This is unacceptable behaviour from developers.  - Slow development pace: speaks for itself.   -----------------------------  In its current state, the game is too frustrating. The combination of scarcity of medication and bullets, the amount of time it takes to find a pittance of supplies and the excessive fall damage and damage from Bigfoot makes it challenging to finish matches. As well, it would really be nice if death wasn't permanent, or at least we were given the option to turn that feature off. If you're playing with friends, you have the choice of either watching them finish the game (which can take some time), or restart the match if somebody dies, and that isn't very fun.   The most disturbing con for the game though is the hostility from its developers. They have done everything they can to quiet dissenters and critics, banning them on the forums, revoking their keys, and harassing them for leaving negative reviews. Steam, let's not support bad developers by buying their Early Access games until they prove to us that they care about their products and those that purchase them.  -----------------------------  tl;dr: this game is broken and needs some love. Don't support this game until the devs change their tone and fix the game and change their ethic.
Date 2019-02-18 Playtime 18h 52m Rec Positive Buggy, but fantastically hilarious. Playing with friends and chasing around a giant roaring Bigfoot that sometimes enjoys taking a dip in the ocean while shooting at him is, in fact, priceless.  Well, kind of. Just- don't spend too much money on it expecting something polished or in any way good. Your experience heavily depends on those you tag along with, so getting it on sale may be the best idea.

Date 2019-02-15 Playtime 42h 21m Rec Negative My initial 2019 review: A very good game concept but very poorly executed. I played again because of the update but fall damage is still the biggest killer in matches and Bigfoot is a little too powerful still. Definitely not worth the money in the game's current state.  My 4.0 patch review: It's still a very good game concept, yet I'm still disappointed in how little things there are on the map to get once you've gone almost everywhere. I feel like there's still not nearly enough medical supplies for you and your allies solely based on the fact that Bigfoot's traps seem to do half of the damage to your team. I would understand why they do so much damage if you miss the quicktime event IF they were visible before being set off, but they aren't.  In summary, what I'm saying is that Bigfoot still seems to be too strong even on the lowest difficulty, although predictable.  In my opinion, ways of fixing the main issue would be to either allow items to respawn after some time of being picked up, lower his health, make survivors' damage output higher, or make it to where the traps are visible in trees before being set off.

Date 2019-02-04 Playtime 9h 22m Rec Positive Great game if you have a group of 4 to squad up. If your going it alone, this game may not be as fun for you. You will get jump scared by bigfoot at some point so just be ready for that.
Date 2019-02-02 Playtime 20h 51m Rec Positive I love the game and how it works but it is alot to fix here! The tent is bugged, Bigfoot never attack. I played with my friend and we was 4 peoples. Bigfoot just attacket us 1 time and rest of the time he just ran away all the time. We played like 3-4 hours and just been atacked 1 time. This need to be fixed! The 1 time he atacked us it was VERY funny but. He throwed us and hitted us and that was very funny but that happend 1 time. The tent dosent work at all. The drone cant be picked up or you cant switch a new battery. If you ask me the map is Too big. Its take some time before we see bigfoot and then we see it and we begin to shoot, bigfoot just EVERYTIME ran away, soo we have to track him down to finish the game. He rans away in the day and the night and it kind a boring that he rans away everytime. If The gamedevelopers can make gamemodes like Easy or peacfull so he dosent attack or a normal that he attacks the night but not the day, and hard that he attacks the day and the night. SOO HE NEVER JUST RANS AWAY EVERY TIME!!!!!!!!!!!! It had been pretty funny if they added things that you have to find tools and guns and you have to exsplore the map to find the drone in caves or something! Plz fix this. I like the graphics and the rest of the game i think! 5\10 And its beta soo i recommend this game if they updata this game!

Date 2019-02-01 Playtime 20h 4m Rec Positive This is a game to play with friends, some updates and performance fixes are really needed for this to play smooth, some downgrades in this game are that bigfoot is getting stuck very often, like if you explore the map at night he gets stuck somewhere in map or in the rocks, you should add more maps like a Taiga or something like that, birch forest or Hoia Baciu from Romania, that would be great, you should lower the price to 10 Euros, not 16, it's not worth that much for some Bigfoot hunt with friends and play hide'n'seek with bigfoot.

Date 2019-01-26 Playtime 14h 29m Rec Negative Ich habe mir dieses Spiel gekauf, aus dem einfach Grund das ich mit meiner Freundin das Spiel spielen wollte. Somit investierten wir insgesamt 30 Euro für das Spiel. Anfangs überzeugte mich das Spiel. Die Grafik ist inordnung und die Spannung ist aufjedenfall gegeben.  Leider habe ich es bis jetzt nicht schaffen können BIGFOOD zu töten, da das Spiel bugte und er nach Stunden nicht auftauchte.  Die Athmosphäre stimmt, und der Spaßfaktor ist vorprogrammiert. Es ist zudem gruselig und fesselnd und die Map zu erkunden steigert das ungemein.  Bigfood darf nicht buggen, ein unbug funktion wäre hilfreich. z.B. ein Respawn oder etwas der gleichen. Denn ein Neustart der Runde reset den Fortschritt und das wäre Schade!

Date 2019-01-17 Playtime 1h 54m Rec Negative I give this game a 4/10.  It has some gameplay but isnt very fun and is overpriced. This game should cost 7 dollars max.

Date 2019-01-15 Playtime 19h 23m Rec Negative This game has a lot of potential although there are some major issues that need to be looked into. The loot is rough. You search for so long to find supplies with little reward. Bullets do not do enough damage to Bigfoot it takes way too many to kill him with what you are given. You get 4 traps and i have yet to find a campsite with more traps. once you weaken Bigfoot he is reluctant to come around you even at night and without traps he is extremely difficult to track down as hhe just keeps running away. Also fall damage is ectremely unrealistic and you take damage for just jumping sometimes. This game could be so much fun if they changed a few things and maybe aqdded an option to make the monster more ot less aggressive. Add more loot spots on the map, reduce fall damage a bit, increase bullet damage or add a headshot multiplier. The fear factor in this game is however great. Please update the game it will attract so many more players with better reviews.
Date 2019-01-15 Playtime 13h 0m Rec Negative - Com'era il gioco all'inzio.. Non male davvero, pochi contenuti ma l'idea è ottimale, ovviamente non è un gioco della madonna a tutti gli effetti, ma comunque rimane in piedi. La coop è semplice e veloce, fino a 4 giocatori, trasmette molta ansia e molta tensione. Voto? Non credo proprio, dall'ultimo aggiornamento l'hanno rovinato parzialmente rendendomi poco voglioso di giocarci ancora, la grafica, i colori, i movimenti dei personaggi, le skin dei personaggi e I SUONI... Non so cosa gli sia saltato in mente ma lo hanno rotto in parte lasciando gli unici aggiornamenti con contenuti *buoni* resi inutili da un big aggiornamento che di *buono* ne ha veramente poco... Peccato delusione all'ultimo, finchè non rimetteranno tutto apposto non modificherò questa attuale recensione, spero faranno un buon lavoro per risolverlo perchè l'impegno per creare questo videogame c'è e si vede.  Voto: 6/10

Date 2019-01-13 Playtime 9h 44m Rec Positive So my last review was super harsh and I want to now say. This game is WAY BETTER Than when it was in the earlier versions of it. It's improved so much and has truly baffled me. I honestly had fun going back and replaying this game again.

Date 2019-01-12 Playtime 8h 21m Rec Positive Coop is a bit buggy but completely playable. Bring back the old map and Kee p the current map playable too please. I played for about a little over 2 hours with 2 other friends and we had a blast. I love the camera mechanic too and hope you have only 8 to spread around the map. I would for sure say it's worth it if you get it when it's out of beta because there will be a lot more content.

Date 2019-01-01 Playtime 12h 26m Rec Positive Great game but I have several suggestions to make it more user friendly as well as less friendly towards exploiters. Things that could be added: • Keep the ability to climb on to structures but add a karma like system where if you attempt it the creature will heal to some degree. • Add the ability to cook meat on the research station stove to make up for medicine in the case that the players run out of it. • Add the ability to make the creature more or less aggressive. I've had game where we only saw it thrice. • Add the ability to tone up or down the storm if visibility is less valued than framerate. • Add a more noticable penalty to the creature's movement in the ocean/lakes. • Fix the tree falling on the research station as it makes it harder to see in the building. • Add a little instruction leaflet to the research station on how to use the drone, for example, how to change it's batteries. • Go into more detail with the instructions on the menu tab as well as how to use the tablet. After 10 games we still didn't know how to make it work. • Add the ability to mark points on the map.
Date 2019-01-01 Playtime 11h 42m Rec Positive i love playing bigfoot, but since the new update. i cannot use my tent to get warm.
Date 2018-11-09 Playtime 18h 30m Rec Negative I really like this game. It's a ton of fun and I recommend buying it. The updates just make the game better and better.  I bought it for 3 of my friends. However the game was not available on Steam for a day for some reason. During that time I tried to recieve the game on G2A. I bought it from someone for $15 and got scammed. Can I please get a free copy to justify my $15 that's gone? I will give it to one of my friends so we can play more! If I can get one copy of the game for free these will be the best developers!!  Edit: devs suck. no free bigfoot :(
Date 2018-11-08 Playtime 8h 6m Rec Positive It really seems like Bigfoot's path is completely f*cked... After downing the first 50% in about 10 minutes he just stopped attacking us and taking bates. Instead he spent the rest of the games running around the map (way to fast to be caught up to when seen on a camera). Each time we found him we dropped all our ammo on him and ended up using all our bullets to leave him with 10% hp. The game isn't fun because once you've wounded him, he never attacks you, he just runs around super fast and you spend hours trying to find him to put a tracker in his butt... We found him 3-4 times just swimming on the border of map. I still recommend this game because it has a lot of potential fun BUT : It really need to be fixed, we need more ammo and Bigfoot needs to grows some b*lls (attack more instead of randomly run around outside the map).
Date 2018-11-08 Playtime 0h 12m Rec Positive This game is terrifying if you're going singleplayer, but a blast with multiplayer...when you can actually get other players.
Date 2018-11-08 Playtime 19h 21m Rec Positive Its good but i dident like the new map and style of the game but its still good
Date 2018-11-08 Playtime 10h 20m Rec Positive Bought this game during it's early access stage. It has definitely come a long way since then, with a far more immersive atmosphere and unique mechanics.   In spite of this, as of writing this review, the game still has its fair share of bugs. These mainly revolve around Bigfoot itself, the player model, and fall damage. Bigfoot relies on shock to scare you so if you're more tolerant to jumpscares it's almost comical when you're attacked by it.   In the end this was fun to play with the lads so I recommend it if you're going to be playing it with friends.
Date 2018-11-07 Playtime 37h 27m Rec Positive The rare Bigfoot is rarely seen outside of cameras. The tents are now alright but still a little glitchy, and for that reason it's a 6/10 camping simulator. It is however a 7/10 Bigfoot hunting simulator. It is actually rather scary at some parts. in my opinion, it's overall a 7/10 game at the moment.
Date 2018-11-06 Playtime 4h 2m Rec Negative If you are looking for even the most miniscule amount of enjoyment, you are looking in the wrong place. My friends and I bought this game, expecting it not to be good, but our hope was that it was at least bad in a way to get some good laughs out of it. We were dreadfully wrong. The one game we played was 4 hours long, the first half hour we knocked the Bigfoot down to half health, then the remaining 3 and a half hours were spent trying to track down the Bigfoot while it did nothing but run away and hide. Even in the rare case where we found it, instead of trying to attack us, it would quuckly sprint away towards areas that we could not physically get to. The only reason the gane ever ended was because the horribly made AI of the Bigfoot even got tired of the game, and decided to try and drown itself in the ocean. When this happened we finally managed to kill it, simply because it refused to come back on shore. When we were done, myself and two of my friends playing proceeded to have mental breakdowns for an hour after the fact. Moral of the story, dont get this game unless you want to feel like the Bigfoot toward the end of our game.
Date 2018-11-06 Playtime 2h 30m Rec Negative i Cant even buy this game! Its not say anything to pay! I get this box Check this box if you received this product for free (?)
Date 2018-11-06 Playtime 12h 32m Rec Positive ass nice
Date 2018-11-06 Playtime 1h 27m Rec Positive I had seen a youtuber play this game before I got it from a friend and we played it together for a bit, I admit my computer is not the best, but even on low graphics, it is still very laggy for me and takes at least 60% of my cpu to run. I'll list out the rest of my pros and cons.  + Very interesting game concept + It's very fun to me, but this is just an opinion. + Bigfoot is well executed, and a good challenge + Lots of tools to test out and use in your hunt  - Not very compatible with average laptops - Motion blur, If there was an option to disable it, I would but I can not find one.  In the end, I do recommend the game if your computer can handle it.
Date 2018-11-06 Playtime 3h 57m Rec Positive This was the worst game of my life. I loved it so much.
Date 2018-11-06 Playtime 20h 19m Rec Positive Hello. I have been playing this game for quite some time now with my friend and the longer we play the more we realize that it has gotten way too easy. When we first got the game it still had the old map with two bigfoots. The game was pretty balanced at the time and we had a lot of fun trying to win. It wasn't easy and it took us at least five hours before we finally won. The game was scary and really enjoyable. Sure, the game didn't look great in terms of graphics and bigfoot was ugly as hell but it didn't really matter.  After the 2.1 patch a lot of things had changed. The biggest change was the map, it had been completely remade and was more compact and better looking both in graphics and structure wise. But the gameplay wasn't as good. After the 2.1 patch bigfoot got a rework; both the graphics and A.I. Bigfoot looked great, yeah, but the A.I didn't work as good as it had before.  The biggest difference was that they had removed one bigfoot. Before the patch they had both sasquatch and bigfoot chasing you through the forest. Now they had only bigfoot left in the game. Why it was better with two of them was that it wasn't as easy to win as it is now. First time my friend and I tried the new patch we got really disappointed on how easy it was to win. Sure, everything looked great but it wasn't fun to play when it was so easy. Bigfoot made absolutely no damage compared to before and he was really just stupid as hell. I don't know for sure if they had made any new coding to the A.I but it sure felt like it. He would get supper passive after just a few attacks and he would just run around and do nothing for 10 minutes straight. It would come to the point where we would have to look throught the entire map to find him. After killing bigfoot the first time in the new patch we felt no satisfaction.  Later on they made a buff for bigfoot so that he could do more damage. What he would do was first knock a player out and later stomp on you like a bug -- which was good and all. But if you play with a team it's easy to just shoot a flair before he does this and he will run away instead and no harm will be done. After the buff patch the A.I had broke completely. Bigfoot would after some time just go to the edge of the map and swim for the rest of the game, which meant that we had to go look for him. And when we found him he would bug out, trying to get up and we could just shoot him until he was dead.  So, what needs to be fixed? They need to make the game a lot harder. They could add different difficulties. Maybe you could play against two again.  They need to fix the A.I. Right now it seems to be very bugged and it takes away the fun. The graphics are alright. It's not really a problem. Maybe fix the walking animation if anything.  I know this game is in early, but that is kind of the reason why I'm writing this. Maybe the devs will take note. Maybe it's just I who think the game is too easy. Feel free to comment what you think.  MVH Crypto, Joniz and hannerz
Date 2018-11-05 Playtime 9h 21m Rec Positive I like the game, i played it before but now its going apeshit for my computer and crashes on startup. Tried discussing on their discord and got nothing
Date 2018-11-05 Playtime 17h 19m Rec Positive BigFoot is a fun game to play with friends. If you are looking for a horror/ survival based experience, then you have found the right game. The devs put in come cool mechanics that really help with finding the bigfoot such as drones and cameras. The only issues i can really stress is the lack of encounters with bigfoot, which i think mainly is dependant on how many players you are playing with. Aside from that, a workshop option would be interesting so that maybe people could put in a mod where you are hunting Shrek or something. I have played this game since it was first in development last year, and im impressed with how it has changed over time. I will admit, i was a bit disappointed with the first few updates in the trailer map, but the game has dramatically improved since.
Date 2018-11-04 Playtime 39h 7m Rec Positive this is a good houer game but devs skyhuskey please add an AK 47 in to the game

Date 2018-11-04 Playtime 1h 0m Rec Negative almayın.
Date 2018-11-03 Playtime 4h 8m Rec Negative Not worth the time at the moment. The game is super buggy and for unreal engine is disappointing. The game unbearably slow, Bigfoot takes way to long to kill, reviving other players hardly works, no clue as to what I am doing when the game starts as there are very few hints, the game constantly drops connection, controls are awkward, and overall, no true immersion for a horror game. It's worth noting that they do try, and I can respect that, but after waiting so long for a content update, it's not overselling to say I was disappointed. Please don't buy this game until it goes on a sale for cheap, otherwise, you will have wasted $15. Hopefully, the game will prove it's worth in the future, and I truly hope it does because the concept is great, but delivery is unsatisfactory.
Date 2018-11-03 Playtime 0h 16m Rec Negative I know that I only have 0.3 hours on the game and that this is in early access but hear me out please.  When my friend hosts a game and I join I get instantly kicked when I do anything apart from moving forward (not sprinting) and the same thing happens to my friend when I host so I really can´t recommend this game at all if you´re planning on playing co-op.  I have not played any of the singleplayer but the reason I bought this is because it looked good at first glance and sounded like a fun game to play co-op on, I didn´t buy it for the singleplayer.  It´s a shame that co-op technically doesn´t work because the game looks amazing and probably would have been good and fun to play :/  Hopefully this will get fixed in the future before release on the 31st of December because this is a BIG problem atm  Pros (from 0.3 hours ;P): -Great Graphics -Fluid Gameplay (until I did anythig except moving ;) )  Cons (from 0.3 hours ;P): -co-op is broken -price is too high for a game with broken co-op imo  Conclusion: This is a nice game concept, the devs just have to fix the problem and then I´ll probably update this review if I feel like giving the game another chance   2/10 (atm)
Date 2018-11-02 Playtime 4h 43m Rec Positive Bigfoot is a sexy beast! Having a swamp map and Bigfoot look like Shrek would be amazing!!! Please do this!!!!
Date 2018-11-02 Playtime 17h 46m Rec Positive First encounter with Mr Bigfoot was the most scariest moment ever. He charged me and my friend straight through some pines and killed my friend, and then he went for me and I ran and ran and ran...but got stuck in a tree and died too.  we haven't screamed nor laughed that much ever!
Date 2018-11-01 Playtime 18h 59m Rec Negative This game could be so much better,but they never update it anymore,as if they abandoned it,I don't like the game for now,really hoping for an update to turn this game from crappy to great.
Date 2018-11-01 Playtime 7h 0m Rec Positive Excelente juego para pasar con amigos, muy inmersivo e interesante. Recomiendo comprarlo si estas buscando acción, terror y survivor. Recalco es un gran juego para disfrutar en coop.
Date 2018-11-01 Playtime 2h 12m Rec Negative This game is unenjoyable. The gameplay is painfully slowmoving, and the game looks like a PS1 title. If you do plan on buying it, at the very least wait for a sale. Don't waste your money like I did.
Date 2018-10-31 Playtime 1h 49m Rec Negative It was a slow game, not enough stuff, not enough places to visit.  I thought i'd be more like the forest.

Date 2018-10-29 Playtime 9h 19m Rec Positive I wasn't sure what to expect wether I'd enjoy it or not. First night playing the game and we had a blast! Definitely gave us some scares, bigfoot definitely gave no F's when he wanted that booty, because he'd come and collect. First night we thought hiding in the tent would work, perched up on rocks that were hard to get to, NOPE! He came right up and beat the brakes off of us. It was pretty hard to try and kill him, pretty much impossible with just the two of us. A couple weeks or so we played again with more recent updates and man it was a lot nicer, OH and no more hiding in the house and being safe, he tries to pull you out. Definitely a great update, and that's what I'm noticing is this dev cares and roles out updates that are needed. Honestly I'm so impressed with this game and the idea of it and the devs, that it'd be nice if they either took this game, changed the name and made it with more mythical creatures and made more maps that were dedicated to each creature. So like Bigfoot essentially but also The Loch ness Monster, Dracula, Chupacabra, banshee,  or any I mean the list goes on. Or if not then If they'd consider making other games like this in the future, I'm definitely into games like this!

Date 2018-10-26 Playtime 52h 14m Rec Positive I Love the new look and detail to the 2.1 update. It's incredible. Yep there are some bugs, but it is still a lot of fun to play and they actually seem to read and listen to those who let them know what the bugs are.  I will say that IO never knew that Bigfoot could swim as fast as Michael Phelps, I couldn't get close to him. But it is a lot of fun esspecially in multiplayer.  If the keep updating it and working on the bugs, I have no doubt this will be one fantastic game when it's done. It's really good now, so maybe a couple updates to go.  Would highly recommend!

Date 2018-10-19 Playtime 25h 28m Rec Positive Доброго времени суток, дамы и господа. Сегодня я хочу вам рассказать об этом недооцененном шедевре, у которого определенно есть будущее.  Пожалуй, начну с того яблока раздора, за которое и срут эту игру - оптимизация. Ребят, ну вы серьезно? Она находится в бете, и не надо относиться к ней так предвзято, будто это давно готовый проэкт, и вообще над ней работает целая компания профессионалов. Да, действительно, над ней работает студия...эээ...из двух парней. Всего лишь два студента занимаются абсолютно всем в игре. И сейчас хоть кто нибудь посмеет вякнуть " пачему моя гейм такая неоптимезированая и где маи абновления?!?! "?. Это всего лишь вопрос времени, ведь программирование - дело трепетное и сложное.  А дальше у нас по списку мое любимое - комменты про 1 фпс в игре. Комментарий в студию! "Почему так логает не могу понять у меня всего 9 фпс выдает а на гта 5, 90-150фпс?". Видишь ли, друг мой сердечный, прежде чем писать такое, может быть соизволил бы залезть в настройки графики? (в игре автоматом грфон на ультрах стоит). И уже потом с горящей попа орать "ПАЧЕМУ ЛОГАЕТ?!!?". Да и потом, игра на Unreal engine, а это весьма капризный  движок, и далеко не на всех ПЕКА она будет летать на ультрах в 500 fps.  В игре есть недоработки, которые присущи любой БЕТЕ. Как по мне, если Bigfoot будут продолжать заниматься, то она проявит себя на все 100. А ребятам респект, за то, что дарят нам такие проэкты.
Date 2018-10-19 Playtime 1h 13m Rec Negative It says I need an Uncooked version, and won't let me play. If you can fix this please tell me how. But until then, I have toe give this a bad review.
Date 2018-10-19 Playtime 3h 16m Rec Positive fix the bug,i cant run
Date 2018-10-19 Playtime 10h 26m Rec Positive i give this game a thumbs up because it,s so fun to play and when he attacks you he doesn,t  pussyfoot around he,s a mean s.o.b.   its also scary you can kill animals, make traps lure him in find items and unique caves shoot flares at him make him piss his pants lol jk :)   remember everyone this is just the beta it,s not a finished game !!!!! someone said the map is to big i actually think it,s to small remember u can play 4 at once it gets crowded. graphics are a ton better than before and night and day cycle works great because night actually looks like night thats when the sounds really scare the shit out of you ,  it takes almost everything you got to kill him but its a riot with friends. ok this is all my bug report: when looking at the map you can still shoot your gun off: bigfoot gets stuck on trees alot: when scaling mountains even the slightest dip or drop off takes damage from you and not just a little please fix that its a huge bug problem health is everything in this game : frozen water should affect you if you get in it : ok thats it for my in game bugs but i,m ok with it now because it is still beta guys and girls. ok i think also we need more animals,bigger maps ,more maps, maybe even more than 1 bigfoot maybe a child one or 2 :) more different traps like to setup up spring traps with spiked tree limbs just ideas , or even tranquillizer darts to slow him down also a crossbow would rock . alright for now it,s a go for me but things are limited for now but it still is fun to play and very scary btw the sound is great helps a ton on the scare factor. Peace to all Gamers hope to see you out there soon !!!

Date 2018-10-18 Playtime 9h 4m Rec Negative So, this game.  It looks really nice, I'll give it that. The concept is neat, but they screwed up what they were building.  The map is hilariously too big. And with the Bigfoot's "Smart AI", you'll never catch him. We've played sessions where we hunted him for hours without seeing him once outside of cameras on the other edge of the map. He'll outrun you and just plain avoid you all together, making the game really boring once you've played it for some time.  Really liked the original map, I actually saw the darn thing more than twice per game then.
Date 2018-10-15 Playtime 0h 20m Rec Positive Um incrível jogo, ótima qualidade com uma mecânica bem ampla, mas é necessário um computador com alta performance.

Date 2018-10-15 Playtime 2h 34m Rec Negative  no realism whatso ever shot big foot 22 times kept comming back hunter frezzez to death in a few minuets poor game needs work.
Date 2018-10-14 Playtime 6h 45m Rec Positive this game is really good. BIGFOOT lem up! 
Date 2018-10-14 Playtime 8h 26m Rec Positive i like the game but i'm confused on how to switch between maps. 
Date 2018-10-14 Playtime 16h 36m Rec Negative update update!   Nope game is still dreadful. Now with much better visuals I guess and you get to play as Bigfoot but gameplay is exactly the same and none of the update elements have saved it for me personally.
Date 2018-10-14 Playtime 6h 18m Rec Negative THIS GAME DOESNT WORK YOU FUCKING RETARDS 11/10
Date 2018-10-13 Playtime 22h 39m Rec Positive I'm close to beating Bigfoot for the first time as a lonewolf *Howlings at my computer like a weirdo*. The game looks fantastic, however the mountains are a bit glitchy and need a bit of fixing up. I do like that the cabin is a safe place (to my knowledge) and it's a good place to stay during the really really long nights. I get the whole night time is scary thing, but if I have a safe spot, I'm not leaving it until I see the sun (mostly). The fall damage is kind of petty, you fall 3 feet and loose about a quarter of your health, which Bigfoot can technically kill you when you're half health if he wanted to just like in one of my videos. This review kind of sounds negative, but I just want the game to improve. Appart from some frustrations, it really is fun and I'm sure even more fun with friends. I never played the first version, but I do like the idea of tracking bullets (I watched Markiplier). Good game, hope it makes some improvements and that'd be awesome. New locations aren't a bad idea either and it seems like that may be planned already. Anyway, bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Date 2018-10-13 Playtime 1h 6m Rec Negative This game looked good. In theroy. The gameplay I saw on youtube of this looked really fun, but the glitches in it make it impossible.  There is a temperature system, and you warm up by going inside or standing near a campfire. You get tents, and they count as going inside. You CANNOT go into tents, they're too glitchy. Sometimes you CANNOT get warmed up by a fire. There's loot inside tent camps, but the stuff is hard to get at because you cant go in the tents. (ONLY the green ones, for some reason)  When you get knocked down, your character goes completely limp noodle which looks hilarious, but continues to make the dead scream over and over, for about a minute before your teammate can heal you. The sound is annoying. When you both die and it tries to show the game over screen, that ALSO just keeps restarting itself and you can't actually look at what score or whatever you got, I dont know because I never saw it.  1.5/10, because the refund button works well.

Date 2018-10-12 Playtime 7h 40m Rec Positive เป็นเกมที่สนุกดีครับ
Date 2018-10-10 Playtime 6h 6m Rec Negative Die Grafik um ersteinmal mit etwas gutem anzufangen, ist wirklich wunderschön. Die Vegetation genauso wie das Wasser sehen wirklich sehr schön aus.   Jetzt das schlechte: Bugs, Bugs, Bugs noch und nöcher ob es nun beim Wiederbeleben oder beim festbuggen an irgendeiner Stelle die wirklich überhaupt keinen Sinn ergibt. Dazu der unglaubliche Bug den Big Foot auf einer Eisscholle fest gebuggt die ganze Zeit abzuschießen bis er stirbt. Dickes Minus.   Als nächstes: Direkt beim Spawnen vom Big Foot angegriffen zu werden. Oder random Bäume die einfach auf dein Haus fallen. Im Haus liegt eine Axt. Warum nicht einfach diese Axt nehmen und diesen Baum auseinander nehmen?  Übrigens warum warnen mich die Kameras vor meiner eigenen Drohne?  Und als letztes: Man findet einfach nichts. Wenn nicht gerade BigFoot festgebuggt ist hat man nicht auch nur ansatzweise die Zeit und die Möglichkeit genug Munition, Fallen oder ähnliches zu finden. Man könnte stundenlang suchen und würde nichts außer vielleicht vier Lager finden  Das ist in meinen Augen kein Survivalgame da die gewissen Dinge, eines Survivalgames, nun mal Sachen finden, und daraus etwas basteln, sind.

Date 2018-10-09 Playtime 17h 47m Rec Positive Bought this game not too long after it came out and played it a few times with a friend. 2.0 came out and we're loving it at the moment. It's a fun, goofy game to mess around in but it could use some polishing as it is at the moment.

Date 2018-10-08 Playtime 41h 7m Rec Positive Originally I bought this game because it looked like a fun f-tier game to play with friends, but I'm glad to say 4.0 has really surprised me and the game is unironically really good.  Everything has been remade from the ground up and it's a really fun time.

Date 2018-09-30 Playtime 12h 42m Rec Positive If you are a fan of horror games i would recommend this game. due the fact that big-foot has a very well done AI. the game may be a little game for the time being, and needs a bit more improvements. But overall its a great game.

Date 2018-09-23 Playtime 12h 4m Rec Positive Boy. It's a very beautiful game. IF you want a game to paly to pass time or want to paly with friends this is a very good candidate. There are a lot of bugs but that's what happens when you paly a BETA test.
Date 2018-09-23 Playtime 4h 33m Rec Positive For a man with a foot fetish this is not what I expected.
Date 2018-09-23 Playtime 12h 5m Rec Negative This game is having an identity crisis. I bought it in February 2017, not even a month after release. It was pretty good. All they had to do, to not fuck it up, was expand on what they had. But instead they went for completely rebuilding everything multiple times and now it's just a boring Dead by Daylight clone.   Not the game I paid for. Even detached from them ruining something I liked, this game is just not good. It's boring and tedious.   Do you know how bad you have to fuck up for me not to enjoy a game with Bigfoot trying to kill you in it? heartbreaking.
Date 2018-09-23 Playtime 9h 19m Rec Positive Fun game with friends. Needs more maps . I would include states ca, oh, fl. Maybe even have some maps in russia and asia. Overall I can't wait for more content.
Date 2018-09-23 Playtime 2h 1m Rec Positive Can we get the old one back please 
Date 2018-09-23 Playtime 2h 20m Rec Positive This game is alot of fun to play with friends. Bigfoot has a tendency to scare the crap out of you. When you hide out in the trailor, make sure to stay away from the windows.
Date 2018-09-22 Playtime 0h 37m Rec Positive This is a good game and has potential but it needs better optimization. Scary shit and would probably be fun with friends.
Date 2018-09-22 Playtime 0h 28m Rec Negative Bad game
Date 2018-09-22 Playtime 50h 58m Rec Positive It's a good game, good game. :-)
Date 2018-09-21 Playtime 24h 8m Rec Negative Horrible game, too much to list to describe what is wrong. Unplayable, pointless, buggy beyond belief.
Date 2018-09-19 Playtime 3h 56m Rec Negative Empfohlen (mit Einschränkungen)    Bigfoot zieht Spieler in eine atmosphärisch dichte Welt, die mit beeindruckenden Landschaften und vielseitigem Gameplay lockt. Die Möglichkeit, im Koop-Modus gemeinsam auf die Jagd nach Bigfoot zu gehen, schafft ein intensives Teamgefühl, und die KI sorgt durch unvorhersehbare Manöver für spannende Momente. Doch trotz dieser Pluspunkte gibt es auch einige Schwächen, die das Spielerlebnis trüben.  Positive Aspekte:   - Atmosphärische Grafik, die eine immersive Umgebung mit abwechslungsreichen Biomen schafft.   - Vielseitiges Gameplay mit Optionen wie Basisbau, Erkundung und Kämpfen, was das Spiel abwechslungsreich hält.   - Spannender Koop-Modus, der Teamarbeit und gemeinsames Erkunden fördert.   - Unvorhersehbare KI – Bigfoot agiert clever und stellt eine echte Bedrohung dar.    Negative Aspekte:   - Zahlreiche technische Probleme und Bugs, die teilweise das Spielerlebnis beeinträchtigen.   - Eingeschränkte Langzeitmotivation: Nach etwa 100 Stunden mangelt es an neuen Herausforderungen.   - Unzuverlässige Serverleistung – häufige Latenzprobleme und gelegentliche Serverausfälle stören den Spielfluss im Mehrspielermodus.   - Teure Mikrotransaktionen für kosmetische Gegenstände, die oft nur über teure Lootboxen erhältlich sind und Kritik hervorrufen.    Fazit:   „BIGFOOT“ bietet eine dichte Atmosphäre und macht im Koop-Modus richtig Spaß, vor allem durch die gut gestaltete KI und die variablen Spielaktivitäten. Allerdings müssen Interessierte mit technischen Problemen und eingeschränkter Langzeitmotivation rechnen. Wer das Piratenfeeling und die Jagd im Team liebt, findet hier einen besonderen Nervenkitzel, sollte jedoch die bekannten Schwächen im Hinterkopf behalten.  🔻🔻🔻   🦉Nebelbank.net   Multigaming-Community seit 1997   The Power of Perfection   Don’t flame without brain!

Date 2018-09-09 Playtime 6h 51m Rec Negative Ужастное обновления ,  Оброщаюсь к вам разработчикам - попробуйте поставиьб кастер на воде вот умора , у вас игру вообще не тестируют ?! Если у игрока на мини карте синие обозночението его вообще не видно ! не видно даже в какую сторону ты бежишь .
Date 2018-09-08 Playtime 19h 34m Rec Positive I waited pretty much a year for Update 2.0, Im pleased
Date 2018-09-06 Playtime 130h 52m Rec Positive A więc tak zmieniam recenzję ponieważ gra jest bardzo dobra lecz trzeba mieć dobry gamingowy komputer,a o samej grze,gerafika doskonała, dużo zwwierząt lecz jest zmiana.Teraz nie narzekam na to że nie można upolować niedzwiedzia lub wilka...bo gdy je słyszę to spier*@lam.A teraz o samej wielkiej Stopie, dosyć często atakuję lecz jest tici minus.Gdy wchodzisz do kopalni on za tobą biegnie i się automatycznie ma glitcha,jest to plus dla osub kture chcą dostać odznakę na steam lub gdzieś indziej,lecz nie polecam wchodzenie do kopalni ludziom kturzy poszukiwają wrarzeń w tą grę...Bo ten glitch psuję całą rozgrywkaę.do wyporu mamy dwie mapy zimową,oraz i zwykłą.W grze jest bardzo dużo easter eggów więc w tej grze BIGFOOT,na pewno nie będziecie się nudzić polecam.

Date 2018-09-04 Playtime 71h 18m Rec Positive I think Bigfoot is the best hunting Style game ever 
Date 2018-09-04 Playtime 5h 44m Rec Negative traps are buggy as hell I know this is an early access but cmon get the basics down
Date 2018-09-03 Playtime 23h 31m Rec Positive [h1]BIGFOOT Review[/h1]  [h1]Rating: 7/10[/h1] [b]BIGFOOT[/b] is all about Hunting Bigfoot. Use your knowledge and recourses to track him down. With a group, it can be easier, but the people playing together have to keep an eye and ear out. You can die of frostbite, so be careful. Bigfoot will only attack during nighttime, but will roam during the day. There are deer roaming around the Map that you can shoot to attract Bigfoot.  He will smell the meat, and come.  When Bigfoot is near, a red bar will appear at the top of the screen, letting you know he is near. This red bar is his health, if it hits 0, he will fall over unconscious, leaving you able to capture him. This is your main goal. Can you do it?  In my opinion, the game is very scary. Gives me the chills playing. The atmosphere is very good, along with the big map, and the background howls and calls of Bigfoot every now and then, adds to the buildup of tension.   Overall, the game needs some work, but it is very fun! Give it a chance!
Date 2018-09-02 Playtime 19h 35m Rec Negative Its good but still extremely rough.  Spent a couple hours playing only for my teammate and I to get stuck in a hole in the map (there are many places this can happen) and we could not get out.  The yeti's attack is also glitched and can hit you through rocks and even when not close to your hitbox.  Alot of the map is unfinished, especially on the eastern side. You can walk into the rocks.  The idea of the game is good but not enough work is done on it yet to make it truly playable. You can try it but prepare to get stuck in the map.    
Date 2018-09-02 Playtime 2h 25m Rec Negative Multiplayer funktioniert teilweise sehr schlecht
Date 2018-09-01 Playtime 35h 26m Rec Positive Es ist ein Sehr gutes Spiel meiner Meinung nach da es auch mit den fast wöchentlichen updates immer wieder besser wird. Auf der großen Map ist es zwar schwer bigfoot zu finden aber es macht dennoch viel Spaß ihn zu suchen und die Map zu erkunden da es auch sehr viele versteckte sachen z.B. Höhlen,Jägertürme und vieles mehr. Außerdem kann man auch noch bigfoots Spuren verfolgen um ihn besser zu finden. Leider gibt es trotzdem noch bugs und ein paar coole sachen aus der vorgängerversion wurden rausgenommen z.B. die Tracking-Munition abet im gesamten ist das spiel nur empfehlenswert.  
Date 2018-08-31 Playtime 13h 44m Rec Positive need more maps. need more guns. need more player slots.  but the game is fun as it is at the moment
Date 2018-08-31 Playtime 7h 53m Rec Positive i thought i was hunting bigfoot but a yeti is fine by me too.  9/10 would hunt albino bigfoot again.
Date 2018-08-31 Playtime 4h 30m Rec Positive Such a rad game to just have some simple fun in. Bigfoot gives you some genuine Jumpscares with the creature sometimes appearing out of nowhere. The environment and graphics are pretty and well done, you get alot of useful tools like drones and cameras to hunt bigfoot with. Its even more fun with friends, as you work together to hopefully take down the beast.
Date 2018-08-30 Playtime 129h 28m Rec Positive This game, for the longest time, went un-updated with extreme dev Delays and a lot of waiting. BUT! With the new update, the Devs have become a lot more responsive and new life is being pumped into it. If you like jumpscare horror games that also require thought, tactics, and stradegy with high stakes, completed with impressive graphics and awesome terrain, this is the game for you.  5/5 stars
Date 2018-08-30 Playtime 1h 29m Rec Positive Arkadaşlarla oynayınca sarıyor . Denilenebilir bir oyun şans vermek lazım .
Date 2018-08-30 Playtime 3h 58m Rec Positive До последнего обновления отлично игралась. После обновления постояннные фризы - оптимизация нулевая. Зачем выпускать сырой продукт хоть и на новом движке (ничего особенного я там не увидел даже на высоких настройках-текстуры слабенькие), оставили бы старый, новый оптимизировали и тогда только в продажу закинули. Идея интересная плюс кооператив роляет, но ребят - все таки деньги заплачены - хочется хороший работающий продукт. Допиливайте уж, потому что в текущей версии играть никакого желания из-за кучи багов. Но поставлю "рекомедовать" с надеждой на улучшение.

Date 2018-08-29 Playtime 7h 36m Rec Negative Fix your game   1. When you are knocked your body is bent in half   2. HOW TO WORK DRONE   3. Don't aytosave after each teamate dies   4. Lower his health cause damage wise its hard   5. Make BIGFOOT better
Date 2018-08-29 Playtime 6h 43m Rec Negative So. The first time my friends and I played this game they died within the first two hours and I played for another 2 forcing them to observe as I was slowly hunted and killed by bigfoot. I had no bullets left. This time, after the update, I made sure to save at a good time hoping things would be better. The game saved as soon as my friends died and each time we load in we see their corpses and big foot piledrivers me into the snow snapping my neck. Please.. Develepors, can the game at least not override my save as they die?
Date 2018-08-29 Playtime 17h 25m Rec Positive Was mich stört bei Bigfoot 2.0 ist die Drohne, weil ich den Sinn und Zweck nicht verstehe oder die Funktion. Denn ihr habt ein Spiel entwickelt in dem es die meiste Zeit dunkel ist. Was bringt einem eine Drohne mit der die Spieler nachts nichts sehen können? Ich verstehe zwar, dass es eine Menge arbeit war aber in dem Spiel bringt einem eine Drohne ohne Nachtsicht oder Infrarot überhaupt nichts. Bigfoot profitiert allein am meisten davon, während wir die Drohne suchend zurück fliegen wirft der einen durch die gegend. Sonst hab ich eigentlich an dem Spiel nichts zu bemängeln. Ist eh noch lange nicht fertig also ich hoffe dass sie da noch mehr hinzufügen. Das Spiel ist aus meiner Sicht eher für mehrere gedacht. Es macht zumindest mehr Spaß als dort alleine durchs Gestrüpp zu latschen.

Date 2018-08-27 Playtime 3h 49m Rec Negative Ce jeu manque beaucoup d'équilibrage, il reste très linéaire et manque donc de fun. J'entend bien qu'il s'agit d'une sorte de simulation de chasse, et donc qu'il faut être patient. CEPENDANT on se fais chier voila, merci de votre compréhension à jamais +
Date 2018-08-27 Playtime 9h 55m Rec Negative This was going to be a positive review. But after waiting over a year for the new update I was severely disapointed.  Going from a simple idea of some people going out looking for some missing people finding bigfoot, to fully armed people flown in by helicopter?  A lot of the features such as cold and that feel forced.  Basecamp feels empty and dead (Not dead in that way) but dead in the sense of well.. Gameplay.  Not to mention the shear scare factor or chill factor in the game having vanished completely in my opinion. It doesn't feel scary anymore because you're constantly "ear ra*ed" by the same wind sound over and over and over and over, giving you no quiete moments to be scared.  The game lacks the old terror feel it had.
Date 2018-08-27 Playtime 0h 37m Rec Negative DO NOT BUY  Game is completley broken.  Tryed spawning into several games only to not be able to move
Date 2018-08-26 Playtime 20h 11m Rec Positive This game ended up in my steam libary because the premise of the game sounded fun, I had never heard of the game despite playing the rake. I was nervous at first about buying the game but soon learned It was not a mistake.   The game generally delivers in what it promises, a large open map to explore that has locations specifically desgined to tie in with the gameplay. Bigfoot's AI is pretty decent actually sometimes it gets caught on the map's blocked areas but apart from that it's pretty smart at avoiding survivors and taking you by suprise when you least expect it.   I think one thing the game excells in is it's item management system, the very concept of having limited supplies is enough to make any comeptent player think about their actions especially when all items must be used carefully, mainly the weapons though.  Some other things that compliment this title is the inclusion of a body warmth mechanic which the less superior game the rake did not have, this creates another problem the player must consider, it also restricts and extreme agressive playstle wich in my opinion is a good thing. The ability the place cameras in any position is a great step up from the Rake and reallly offers a lot of creativity in how you track down the beast.   Finally the extra wildlife, this addition emerses the player in the game in the world and makes it a much more realistic and enjoyable experience.  Overall I would most likley recommend this game to most people as it really appeals to most audiences. For a small developer team this game is very impressive and im intrigued to see where this game goes in the future.  On thing I would appreciate the game to eventually implement is more maps but I do understand why this is a big ask as most people do not realise that creating an entire map is very difficult. However it would be very enjoyable to have a desert or jungle type map to play on

Date 2018-08-24 Playtime 31h 8m Rec Positive Ich finde das Spiel einfach super es gibt nur eine Sache die ich immer noch nich verstehen. Gibt es keine Möglichkeit einen Spieler der gestorben ist, wieder zu beleben. Muss man das Spiel dann immer von vorne anfangen auch wenn ich noch lebe. Ich habe bis jetzt keinen Hinweis gefunden wie ich meinen Spielkameraden wiederbeleben kann und wenn wir neu in die lobby gehen oder auch nur er das macht scheint es immer ab seinem tot gespeichert zu sein.

Date 2018-08-24 Playtime 4h 3m Rec Positive 빅풋잡는게임인데 최근에 마지막으로 플레이했을땐 한글 버그나서 네모네모버그뜸  그래도 친구랑할꺼면 재밌어요
Date 2018-08-24 Playtime 18h 45m Rec Positive nice game. lol
Date 2018-08-23 Playtime 59h 43m Rec Positive This game is scaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Date 2018-08-23 Playtime 0h 39m Rec Negative Also ich hatte mir schon Gameplays auf YouTube zu diesem Spiel angeschaut und war recht angetan vom Spielprinzip her. Man kann mit Kameras und Drohne coole Sachen machen und es macht auch Spass die Map zu erkunden. ABER bei dem Spiel ist für mich Bigfoot selbst das Problem er spawnt irgendwo auf der Map und wenn er euch sieht rennt er auf euch zu und haut euch um. Danach despawnt er auch gleich wieder. Und genau das ist für mich das Problem. Ich hätte es viel geiler gefunden wenn er nicht direkt despawnt sondern das man versuchen muss ihm zu entkommen oder zu verjagen. Das Bigfoot einfach stupide spawnt und despawnt finde ich recht ernüchternd. Das Spiel würde ich in dem Stadium noch nicht empfehlen und würde erst später wieder rein schauen. Es gibt momentan auch nicht so viel zu tun wenn man die Map einmal erkundet hat. Daher wünschte ich mir mehr Spielmotivation und ein überarbeitetes System für Bigfoot.
Date 2018-08-22 Playtime 0h 40m Rec Negative Game is incredibly buggy once you enter into a Co-Op lobby requested a refund and will purchase once the game is out of early access.
Date 2018-08-22 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive I got this game way back when it was first released, and I absolutely loved it! I'm so excited to see it continue and get updated! However, whenever someone joins my party, they are immediately disconnected from the server and are brought back to the main menu with the touch of any button other than W,A,S,D.  Please fix this!!!!
Date 2018-08-21 Playtime 46h 3m Rec Positive Since the update game is really cool, and we are still playing it with friend. The game doesnt need some tools updates, it needs more maps which can make bigfoot really popular. But... If devs add workshop this game would be more popular than fortnite!!
Date 2018-08-21 Playtime 9h 1m Rec Positive Very cool game. The new update turned it into something crazy (I bought the game when it came out so I have a huge change). The graphics are excellent and the map is relatively large before the update. Maybe Bigfoot looks a little less good but who cares. Good job! 
Date 2018-08-20 Playtime 11h 10m Rec Positive Great game but please optimize and add more maps and stuff!
Date 2018-08-20 Playtime 15h 42m Rec Positive He really hard to kill
Date 2018-08-20 Playtime 28h 17m Rec Positive GEIL
Date 2018-08-20 Playtime 0h 8m Rec Positive its fun for me it can use a new gun or 2 and i'd love a frag grunad
Date 2018-08-20 Playtime 21h 26m Rec Positive This game is good but still has room to improve. There is a spot near the Mystery stones where I fell in a small hole and could not get out.
Date 2018-08-20 Playtime 135h 25m Rec Positive I think the game got a little complex. Great game, don’t get me wrong, but I’d like to see the old map and old controls options. Other than that, 10/10
Date 2018-08-19 Playtime 10h 15m Rec Positive The best game ever!
Date 2018-08-19 Playtime 6h 50m Rec Positive this game is just very fun and with friends its even better
Date 2018-08-19 Playtime 0h 55m Rec Negative Very boring and lots of glitches and confusing game mechanics. You barely see bigfoot and the map is large and boring. Do not buy.
Date 2018-08-19 Playtime 4h 28m Rec Positive This is a Great game and has Loads of potential. I really hope they keep updating it and adding diffrent maps and secrets for people to enjoy but atm it's kind of just "Find Bigfoot" Shoot him and repeat for 2Hours. But still fun.  (V1 was scaryer than V2 tbh) The Game needs ways to get supplies. Maybe a Helicopter that you can call in after an amount of time for resupply etc? Anyways great game but hold off buying this until more content is added as $15 is not worth it at this moment.
Date 2018-08-18 Playtime 11h 20m Rec Positive Habe Bigfoot durch ein Let's Play kennengelernt. Sah ganz lustig aus. Heute zum ersten Mal selbst gespielt.  Die Spannung ist extrem nervenaufreibend. Ich hatte Bigfoot eine Weile nicht gehört und dachte es sei save eine Kamera hinter dem Haus platzieren zu gehen. 5Sekunden später hat dieser mich umgerannt.  Der Horror ist definitiv real. Es gab mehr als genug Schreie und Bigfoot ist ein wahrer Prankster.  Ich weiss nicht wie Leute ihn nicht sehen können. Uns griff er egal ob Nacht oder Tag alle paar minuten an. Noch schlugen die Cams beim Lager aus und schon war er bei unserem Zelt in den Bergen und wollte uns zerfetzen.  Sehr Unterhaltsam! Spannung pur! Nur Loot finden ist recht schwer und Bigfoot ist extrem schnell. Ansonsten hammer Spiel
Date 2018-08-18 Playtime 9h 23m Rec Negative The snow map was a visual upgrade but the mechanics are bad.  Especially the bigfoot itself, he tackles you to the ground then runs away. Rinse and repeat.   Then when you do shoot him it does very small amounts of damage and would take you 24 hours to kill him probably.
Date 2018-08-17 Playtime 60h 41m Rec Negative Wow, es tut sich etwas, leider mit dem Stellen von Fallen zum Nachteilhaften! Es war mir nicht möglich die Fallen zu Tarnen! Hier hat mir das klicken und halten bis der Kringel einmal Rum ist besser gefallen und hat auch besser Funktioniert.   Die neue Map kommt mir noch etwas leer vor! Vom Gestalterischen sonst ziemlich schön.  Weiter so!  Leider hat sich nichts geändert was das auslegen von Fallen angeht. Ein vorhandenes Lagerfeuer mit neuem Holz zu befeuern ist mir auch nicht gelungen. Obwohl ich genug Äste gesammelt habe und auf diese in meiner Liste Klicke kommt eine Meldung wie Inventar Leer oder so.   Da das Spiel so keinen Spaß macht werde ich es Negativ bewerten. Schade, aber die Entwickler hatte ja genug Zeit um solche Fehler zu beseitigen.  Wie schon oben erwähnt, manchmal ist es besser etwas zu belassen wenn es Funktioniert.
Date 2018-08-17 Playtime 1h 41m Rec Positive Криповая игра.Я рекомендую игру,если вы будете играть с другом,если в одиночку,то не стоит.В игре вам надо найти и убить бигфута,чтобы его поймать,ставить капканы с мясом.Если вы найдёте бигфута,то он испугается и убежит.Если вы найдёте трупы/улики то бигфут будет становиться опаснее и нападать уже будет он,а не вы. С другом будет весело и интересно.Может по началу будет скучно,но потом вам игра вкатит.7/10
Date 2018-08-17 Playtime 13h 22m Rec Positive Wie soll ich es sagen...ES ist soweit... Alles fing an in einem kalten winter im jahre 1974. Ich saß mit einem Kollegen mitten im wald irgendwo in utah. Wir waren gerade dabei unsere gefangenen Fische zu verspeisen als Thomas plötzlich etwas großes im Wald sah.Aufgrund der hohen Anzahl an Bärsichtungen in diesem Gebiet dachten wir uns nichts schlimmes und wir versteckten unsere Nahrung in der Nacht einige Meter weiter weg von unserem Lager. Wir rechneten also mit keinen Problemen in der Nacht doch plötzlich verspürte ich eine seltsame Präsenz neben dem Zelt.Ich fühlte mich beobachtet und ging mit der Taschenlampe raus um nachzuschauen. Es war nichts auffindbar also legte ich mich wieder schlafen. Am nächsten morgen jedoch erwartete uns das Übel bereits.Uns lief der schweiß den Kacken herunter. Riesige Fußspuren die in gleichmäßigen Abständen in den Boden gedrückt waren. sie sahen ähnlich aus wie die eines Menschen aber größer und mächtiger. Am selben Tag hörten wir viele woodknocks und einige pfiffe. Damals dachten wir uns nichts un versuchten möglichst schnell aus dem waldgebiet zu kommen. Thomas und ich erkundigten uns zu Hause über solche Vorfälle und wir erkannten schnell das wir nicht die einzigen waren die solche Begegnungen hatten. Damals schaute ich mir zahlreiche Videos über den so genannten BIGFOOT an und bis heute könnte ich anfangen zu heulen wenn ich ein bild von dem schwein sehe. Man fühlt sich so machtlos gegenüber diesem mistvieh. Thomas und ich fingen an weitere Forschungen in den Wäldern anzustellen und was wir auffanden war furchteinflößend. Wir erkannten das wir es nicht nur mit einem Exemplar zu tun haben können,da die Fußabdrücke unterschiedlich groß waren. Vorsichtig erkundeten wir das Gebiet,stellten kameras auf, rieben unsere Bäuche mit Bier ein und taten alles um das mistvieh zu gesicht zu bekommen. Irgendwann war es normal pro tour einen klumpen fell zu gesicht zu bekommen doch irgendwann kamen wir auf die idee auch mal einen den schädel wegzuknallen. Erstmals versuchten wir Böller in Äpfel zu stecken so dass Bigfoots jämmerlicher mistmagen zersprengt wenn er den dreck in sich reinschaufelt.Dann jagten wir sie mit schrotflinten und versuchten erstmals nur auf ihre Füße zu zielen. Schnell wurde uns klar das wir keine chancen mit solchen taktiken haben werden also sorgten wir dafür das einige Jets über das Gebiet fliegen und einen napalmangriff starten. Wir fanden viele tote Exemplare aber einer...einer von diesen arroganten mistviechern hat überlebt. Dieser alte dreckige egoistische ignorante drecksack wagte es wirklich uns zu entkommen. Sein Geruch war so schlimm das man im Umfeld von 4km sofort anfing zu kotzen wenn er sich näherte. Dieser stinkende Bastard wollte uns töten uns stürmte mit leichtgewicht und marathon auf uns drauf und schleuderte Thomas mit 40kmh gegen einen Mammutbaum aus amerika.... Bis heute habe ich das nicht verkraftet und höre seine schreie in der Nacht. Dies führte jedoch dazu das ich alleine auf die Jagd ging und den wichser abknallen wollte. Ich holte mir ein paar Fangeisen und stellte diese auf. Jedesmal wenn dieses dumme schwein darein lief schrie er wie ein kleines Baby... Er heulte so unglaublich weinerlich das ich teilweise 4 stunden lang lachanfälle hatte. Wie kann man so ein Weichei sein? Außerdem trümmerte ich jedesmal seinen schädel mit kugeln ein als er mir zu nah kam.Irgendwann war er so erschöpft das er einen meter vor mir kniete und rumheulte. Er hatte schmerzen und ich knallte weiter auf ihn ein.Dieser Saftsack war so hilflos und ich ließ nicht locker. Dieser Sack musste leiden und endlich war ich bei meinem Ziel angekommen. Ich trümmerte auf ihn ein und nutzte jede chance um ihn zu demütigen...Diesen alten fetten faulen aggresiven drecksaffen.Der äffiköner hatte einfach keine chance und wurde so gedemütigt das er bis zum ende seiner tage heulen und weinen wird. Letzendlich ist die moral der Geschicht: Den Fettaffen zu knallen lohnt sich nicht. Außer du bist ein sadist. Viel spaß beim erlegen des Mistviehs
Date 2018-08-16 Playtime 144h 17m Rec Positive We learned about what CyberLight is doing with their game after update 2.0 and its hotfixes. they're updating a lacking game that failed at start but now its clean original and fun people write bad reviews because of the Bigfoot glitch that got fixed where he wouldnt attack. If you want this game just watch a video or 2 and see if you like the way it looks. You cant give a game a bad rating if you dont like the way it is like skyrim I knew it was a good game but just was'nt the game for me. Bigfoot is focused on hunting a mythical beast either in Glacier National Park or the other map thats coming out soon. Devs please update this game until it is'nt relavant anymore.
Date 2018-08-16 Playtime 2h 5m Rec Positive j'ai pas compris pourquoi j'ai acheté la version beta test 2 , sur youtube on voit qu'il y a une caravane et moi je suis dans une cabane en bois ,est ce normal ou j'ai pas mis la derniere mise à jour ?
Date 2018-08-15 Playtime 57h 38m Rec Positive Dont Save. Bigfoot will Bug and wont Attack anymore he just keeps runing away like a lil Bitch. Also it's like Night all the Time. Day's last like 5 Min and the Night for like 15 Min. Oh and dont use the Traps, wait till his HP drop below 25% because thats when he starts to....You guessed it run away like a lil BITCH And even when you kill him the Game just Ends. Also you can fall through the Map almost anywhere  Befor the Update Good Game to have Fun with. Now with the new long waited update...Its more Like a Downgrade, It's just a Buggy Mess. 10h+ for the first Time killing Bigfoot... 6h+ sitting in the Cabin doing Nothing just to get killed by glitchy Falldamage.  3/10  Would NOT Play again.  __________ Update 4.4  ignore the above.  Games great.  7/10 Great Coop shooter for a few rounds of fun. Also with Max settings one round takes 1 1/2H.  Only thing missing is Gamepad support.
Date 2018-08-15 Playtime 730h 59m Rec Positive Great game for play with your friends but need more maps  2/17/23 UPDATE REVIEW: Fun to play with your friends or with random people online. You will love this game since they update this game ever since 4.0 came out the game feels much different compare of what i played on update 3.0. Can't believe this game want from so broken back in update 2.0 to now 4.0 it's been just so good but now the only thing I would hope to see the future of this game is to see them add a boat load of bigfoot skins maybe a skin drop of every time u level up in game since they have xp but it's only to just to show off thing they have as of right now. Another thing I hope they can can add if it's possible for them is add more guns to the game so this my 2023 Bigfoot review keep it up Bigfoot developers your on the right path for your game to be good to play.     Plz add skins
Date 2018-08-14 Playtime 20h 25m Rec Positive Das Spiel macht sehr viel spaß. Schon in den ersten zehn minuten wurde mein kolege entführt xD ich kann es nur weiter empfehlen für leute die bei gelegenheit abends mit ihren freunden spielen wollen. Die grafik ist sehr schön, die Atmosphäre in diesem spiel ist unfassbar gruselig (vorallem nachts) Ein paar bugs sind vorhanden aber das ist nicht soo schlimm. Mann könnte vlt noch ein paar mehr funktionen einbauen aber sonst kann ich es mit gutem gewissen weiterempfehlen. LG UNplayer
Date 2018-08-14 Playtime 23h 33m Rec Positive Macht mega spaß und hat viel abwechslung. An die Entwickler: Macht weiter so und ich freue mich auf mehr Updates und mehr Kontent !!!! :) 
Date 2018-08-14 Playtime 1h 3m Rec Positive is the winnter map here 
Date 2018-08-14 Playtime 6h 38m Rec Positive Son güncellemenin öncesi ve sonrası arasında uçurum var. Yapım ekibi çok büyük eksiklikleri gidermiş. Yeni güncellemeyle birlikte küçük sinematikler katılmış, çevreyle etkileşim sesleri çoğaltılmış. Zaten güzel olan grafiklere kuzey ışıkları, alev efekti gibi detaylar katılmış. Grafikler gerçekten sağlam. Daha çok ekipman getirilmiş, drone, keskin nişancı tüfeği, bıçak, çadır vs kullanabiliyorsunuz. Yalnız devamlı bir kar fırtınası durumu var, o biraz can sıkabiliyor.

Date 2018-08-14 Playtime 10h 28m Rec Positive Very realistic walking sim 11/10. Bigfoot is as common in this game as irl
Date 2018-08-13 Playtime 26h 37m Rec Positive Cooles game macht Spaß und ist bisschen gruselig.
Date 2018-08-13 Playtime 2h 56m Rec Negative It has many issues as to when you try to play with other friends connecting in a lobby. The game seems very stale trying to find this "yeti" and after he dies, the game ends and I didn't really enjoy it. I know it's in beta, but I expected more since playing the first beta version.
Date 2018-08-13 Playtime 12h 4m Rec Positive big beter bungus
Date 2018-08-13 Playtime 14h 32m Rec Positive this game is now one of my favorites, the yeti brings the game to life. So much fun with the bois. It felt as if buying the original game paid for the developer to go to college for graphic arts and make this version.
Date 2018-08-13 Playtime 3h 40m Rec Negative No Crafting, Less Loot, Map only 1. Not worth. Bigfoot die > Game ends. -_-
Date 2018-08-12 Playtime 0h 23m Rec Negative 白瞎了虚幻4引擎，垃圾游戏

Date 2018-08-12 Playtime 12h 20m Rec Positive It's enjoyable andf you an do some funny stuff, so it's hard to tell if this is meant to be a completley serious game. It's fun to play with friends and the controls are pretty good. Capturing Bigfoot is a worthy challenge.
Date 2018-08-11 Playtime 535h 18m Rec Positive I would love to play this game but it takes around 10 seconds to get 1 frame to load. With this new update it requires you to play with a friend on solo mode. My game keeps crashing for no apparent reason.
Date 2018-08-11 Playtime 14h 34m Rec Positive     XD                       
Date 2018-08-11 Playtime 11h 38m Rec Positive New update is like a whole new game!  10/10 would be turned into Thicc Toe's b*tch again.

Date 2018-08-10 Playtime 0h 6m Rec Positive [h1] Bigfoot è un gioco indie sviluppato da una piccola software house con poche risorse; per tale motivo mi sono veramente stupito per la qualità con cui è stato sviluppato, pur essendo ancora in Beta. [/h1]  Partendo dalla grafica, molto ben curata ed estremamente realistica (sembra di stare in un bosco vero), non ho riscontrato nè bug nè lag. Il gioco è molto fluido e riesce a far immergere il giocatore nell'atmosfera. L'interfaccia è molto spartana ma semplice e facile da usare, basta una partita di prova di 5-10 minuti per capire tutti i comandi e cosa bisogna fare nella partita.  Il gioco ha pochi contenuti, attualmente una sola mappa, ma riceve frequentemente degli aggiornamenti (nel momento in cui sto scrivendo questa recensione ha ricevuto degli aggiornamenti a distanza di qualche giorno). Ma riesce comunque a far immergere il giocatore in un ambiente ostile e cupo, nel quale si aggira una creatura misteriosa.  [u]Insomma, forse è uno dei pochi, se non l'unico che conosco, indie veramente riuscito.[/u]  Il mio consiglio è di prenderlo in promozione, perchè effettivamente il prezzo pieno è troppo alto in questa fase di sviluppo, ma è importante incoraggiare questi piccoli gruppi di programmatori e ricompensarli per il loro impegno.   [u]Lo consiglio sia agli amanti del genere (che non dovrebbe mancare in libreria) che a tutti gli altri (come il sottoscritto).[/u]
Date 2018-08-10 Playtime 6h 45m Rec Positive Would you like to run around trying to find a big ape, then this is the game for you. Also would you like to see your friends fly or go face first in a trap or burn in a campfire then this is it.  10/10.
Date 2018-08-09 Playtime 2h 47m Rec Positive It's good, better when you have friends.
Date 2018-08-09 Playtime 30h 36m Rec Positive .
Date 2018-08-09 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive In Alpha 1 this Game ran greatly even my 5 years old laptop was good enough thus this game could run.... BUT NOW its wrecked thus wrecked that i cant play thy game cyberlight, what a sad waste of my money, only for "good" computers now.
Date 2018-08-09 Playtime 0h 17m Rec Negative Crashes even when on Complete Potato Settings, wasted a whole day of my life trying to make a game work. Maybe, next time, try and make the bootup a little less laggy, because there are people out there who want to play your game, but not even the low settings are low quality. Usually that would be a good thing, but not today.  2/10 It looked okay, looked like it had a complete lack of content though.
Date 2018-08-09 Playtime 7h 9m Rec Positive Took the last shot from house balcony to across the lake. His body faceplanted into a tree and fell below the ice. Never ever had a shot as satisfying as that.
Date 2018-08-09 Playtime 7h 37m Rec Positive Price for game may be a little too much but i liked what it had to offer and that you couldnt find much of the same style of game anywhere else. May be a little short in playability as it only took me two days to beat the first map havent played the second one but looks awesome.
Date 2018-08-09 Playtime 10h 52m Rec Negative ok... So waited ages for this big updated and guess what it is? A large map with ambient noises. No bigfoot. Aparently bigfoot will be patched in over the course of another 18 months. When that arrives they are adding in his legs first, with no hit detection.
Date 2018-08-08 Playtime 51h 43m Rec Positive For being a beta and finally getting an update, the game is really good. I get a lot of frights from Bigfoot and just the atmosphere of the game itself. When my friends and I are playing the game together, I'm the only one who is brave enough to set up cameras and traps to track Bigfoot. The game is really well done for a beta. HOWEVER, there are still some bugs such as your G.U.I. will not display when starting up a game sometimes and there are some holes that you can get stuck in and not be able to get out of, along with some minor bugs that don't affect gameplay (like backwards walking animals). You do need a good computer to run it (not a beast computer), this is due to the graphics in the game.   Pros: Good Graphics Really good atmosphere Good jumpscare moments Intresting thinking moments when exploring around the world Bigfoot A.I. is really random and hard to predict Great Camera system  Cons: Holes that you cannot get out of Minor bugs in multiplayer The G.U.I. sometimes doesn't display leaving you to force quit the game
Date 2018-08-08 Playtime 3h 1m Rec Negative i sadly played this for 2 hours so cant refund kinda sad this shit suck
Date 2018-08-08 Playtime 34h 19m Rec Positive I've been playing this game with my friends since yesterday morning, and It's pretty damn great. It can be quite terrifying, the distant roars, the eery, second-long sights of bigfoot in the distance, the fact that you could get mauled at any second(and you can get mauled at any second), and the over-all atmosphere. it all just makes you jumpy, especially right after you, lets say, see bigfoot across the lake when you first drop in and he looks at you and then suddenly starts sprinting around the lake and in seconds he's 20 meters behind you. you know, that kind of totally hypothetical situation. you can adventure around the map and discover plenty of cool locations, you can set up cameras to try and locate the yeti, place traps to dent his massive health bar, and do all of this with up to 3 other friends. and, dont let the promotional video turn you off, because while the character animations(mainly the humans) arent the best, the graphics and environmental animations are gorgeous. overall, great game, 9/10
Date 2018-08-08 Playtime 19h 2m Rec Positive Been loving this game for years and now with the new update its spookier than ever! Great work devs, looking forward to anything else you can do :D
Date 2018-08-08 Playtime 17h 7m Rec Positive I have to give this game it's props. Horrendous Graphics... Few bugs and glitches but overall. This game has got to be one of the most fun meme/time killers I've played with my friends. We sat around laughing more at the fact of how big foot kicked our arses and screaming when he attacked than anything. It has a long way to go and needs alotta work but the game overall has alot of potential in my book.  TL;DR: This game is rough as hell but with friends and a good sense of huntin' it's a blast.  (Side note anyone know what the white meter is on the top left side of the screen?)
Date 2018-08-08 Playtime 50h 49m Rec Negative BIGFOOT IS BLATANTLY RACIST AND ANTI-SEMETIC!!!! Bigfoot is literally a basketball american simply vibing in his ghetto! The colonists then "pull up" on him. OFC when the Opps pull up bigshlong has to respond with violence. IT GOES SO FAR BEYOND THAT THOUGH. Bigfoot is seen with a yarmulke (pronounced ya-ma-kuh) while he stuffs his shmekles (to clarify its not his money, mostly gentile money) in the bank. THIS IS SO OBVIOUSLY ANTI SEMETIC!!!!! This promotes the dangerous rhetoric that jews are bank owners!! (jews only own 98% of all banks so this is obviously DEFAMING) I hope nobody supports this HORRIBLE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Date 2018-08-07 Playtime 7h 18m Rec Positive Mr bigFeet got stuck... me and my friend tried to save him but it was for nothing 10/10 ign
Date 2018-08-07 Playtime 5h 54m Rec Positive This Game is Tense . I personally love the game, but there is some issues like rocks and places you can get stuck (usuall in early accses games or just every game). I still really like the game but i think that the animations of when bigfoot walks can be inproved and that you could like craft like traps or drones with. Il rate the game 7/10 even tho the game have a really big feature!!!
Date 2018-08-07 Playtime 16h 53m Rec Positive Great game! Was waiting for the update since announcement. Worth the wait!
Date 2018-08-06 Playtime 14h 42m Rec Positive lol i got stuck and i killed myself with a campfire 
Date 2018-08-06 Playtime 12h 13m Rec Positive The game is fun to a point. It's scary enough and funny two. Although it gets boring after awhile.   You try to trap the same bigfoot in the same map the same ways.  Things that need to be added: Ability to have more bigfoot's in one map so 2 3 maybe up to 5. More maps. A forest map, maybe even some type of town map. Needs a campaign mode. More types of cameras and cameras you can have. Needs more traps and more weapons.  Be able to play with more people not just 4 but 6 or 7. Bigger maps.  More NPC'S such as more people and animals.  For solo mode it would be fun to have a option for Ai to help out. A mode were you can play as bigfoot and run from players in multiplayer and in solo mode.  Just some of the things I would like to see in the game, Just hope in the next few updates there is a lot more to do.
Date 2018-08-06 Playtime 32h 16m Rec Positive The new update is awesome. There is a few bugs, i think there should be 4 drones if 4 people in game, and please add batteries, its annoying to only have 1 that you cant replace. Bigfoot is worth the Price tag :)
Date 2018-08-06 Playtime 175h 37m Rec Positive its the best game iv ever played just need bug fixes little bit after new update but keep up the good work
Date 2018-08-06 Playtime 16h 36m Rec Positive Depuis la maj 2,0 le jeu est rendu beaucoup plus optimiser en terme de contenu et d'Amusemant. UNe nouvelle map enrichie et de nouvelle fonction d'établissement. LE jeu est beaucoup plus beau et cool. Je recommende ce jeu apres plusieurs heure de jeu un petit jeu fun entre amie.
Date 2018-08-06 Playtime 110h 32m Rec Positive Неплохо
Date 2018-08-06 Playtime 66h 14m Rec Positive with the new update, things are really looking good. Some glitches like map problems and some display issues (missing HUD and needed keys) but the game is looking much better. The potential is there and they are krackin on the updates pretty quick. Worth the sale price for sure and I am looking forward to getting picked up and hurled about the map! Cheers.
Date 2018-08-06 Playtime 9h 24m Rec Positive this is a awsome game to play with friends the only problems i have found with the game its self is the tab menu is little buggy , its a good game to get the spooks and goosebumps and also have a survival aspect
Date 2018-08-06 Playtime 0h 23m Rec Negative Do Not Buy This GAME!!!!!!!! heres some screenshots https://imgur.com/QAFUYLx https://i.imgur.com/Lqo978y.jpg the devs are assholes  
Date 2018-08-06 Playtime 23h 18m Rec Positive The game was fixed, and I am now able to play. The game is pretty fun ngl
Date 2018-08-06 Playtime 23h 56m Rec Positive This game is very fun Ireally enjoyed the last map. When the new map came out I was really excited to play and they said it would be new and improved. Today when me and my friend played, we found a camp but then rarely anything else. We couldn't find any sites to locate and we didn't even know what the objective of the game was. We went out to kill big foot and my screen was getting white around the edges and that was telling me i was getting cold but before i could pop dat campfire out, I DIED. I don't like that i can't respawn bc my teammate doesn't to continue on without me cuz we wouldn't do that to eachother. The game was very bugged and it was pushed out for release too early. PLZ FIX GAME and make it fun like it was before.
Date 2018-08-05 Playtime 31h 45m Rec Positive i dont often write reviews , but i have to say this game is great , yeah the devs are slow , yes it dose require more updates , keep in mind its not a triple A game its a small dev team , and to see how far this game has come since i picked it up a year ago im impressed going the right direction , new surivial element deployable camp sites , larger maps improved AI , its just good fun with a few mates , and im just excited for this game to grow more
Date 2018-08-05 Playtime 184h 38m Rec Positive Amazing game i think it has some things that should be fixed but its great i think maybe the map should be a little easier to use like able to open the map while your moving and clues to help you find outposts because ive found it a little difficult to find at least one also this is a bit of a stretch but could you bring back the tracking bullets and one more thing just wanted to say i outrunned Bigfoot it was the scariest thing that has happened so far when he chased me
Date 2018-08-05 Playtime 8h 30m Rec Positive Ich hab dieses Spiel erstmals in der Early-Acess phase 2016 gespielt. Der Fun-Faktor bei dem Spiel war sehr hoch (mit Freunden) und man hatte immer was zu tun. Die Sidequest alle Leichen zu finden war sehr spannend (LUL). Leider wurde mit dem Update (was 2016 angekündigt war) welches 2 Jahre brauchte alles schlechter. Es gibt viel zu wenig Features.. keine Sidequests mehr, Bigfoot schlägt einen jetzt mit 2 Hieben zu Boden, keine wirklichen Orte mehr (alles sehr eintönig auf der Map). Ich finde für ein Update welches 2 Jahre dauerte hat sich nicht viel getan und empfehle das Spiel aber trotzdem, weil es mit Freunden für 1-2 Stunden doch spaß machen (kann).  Allerdings für die, die auf ein spannendes Spiel hoffen wo man auf der Jagd nach Bigfoot ist, empfehle ich es nicht - da es leider so ist das Bigfoot die Spieler jagd und immer aus dem nichts random angreift. Das Spielprinzip besteht aus warten darauf das man von einem übergroßen Schneemonster zu Boden geworfen wird und dann noch bei jeder Begegnung 2 schüsse landen kann. Mehr ist das Spiel nicht. 
Date 2018-08-05 Playtime 26h 3m Rec Negative If this game worked, I think it would be awesome. However, we may never know because the game is unplayable; the developers have done too little for too long. DO NOT buy this game for $16. I wouldn't pay $5 knowing what I know now.
Date 2018-08-05 Playtime 2h 51m Rec Positive This is probably the best game that I have ever played. Not only are the visuals absolutely euporic to the eyes, but the gameplay is smooth and crisp, and constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat. Not a dull moment goes by, as with the new highly advanced AI, big foot is constantly on the prowl, hunting his prey, which in this instance is YOU. Honestly can't believe how good this game is and hats off to the developers for making, what I strongly believe to be, an instant classic.
Date 2018-08-05 Playtime 32h 47m Rec Positive I have no idea why a game can't have linux support. Please stop making me boot into windows whenever I want to play this game.  When I first started playing this game I thought it was at best okay. Now with the new update, 2.0, I really like the game. The new map is much larger and is in general much more fun to explore and get killed in. Before this update I had a lot of problems with the Bigfoot AI. It wasn't very good to say the least. In the previous version there were points where bigfoot would load in but would be frozen and unable to move. So you had to restart, this was very offputting. Now Bigfoot seems to have an AI that actually manuevers to attack you. He doesn't just come running straight at you he seems to attack much more randomly which is great. The tablets are great you can finally view cameras on the go. They are semi-useful now! The game isn't perfect it still has it's flaws. For example mountains hitboxes and textures aren't completed in all spots and it is very easy to accidentally clip through a mountain without realizing it.
Date 2018-08-05 Playtime 0h 45m Rec Negative So far I'm dissapointed,ive been wanting to play this game really badly and I just bought today but I just keeps freezing at the loading screen, but it could be my pc, if anybody has suggestions please help.

Date 2018-08-04 Playtime 7h 28m Rec Positive Мы играли с другом. Его схватил Йетти и поволок в сторону заката. Чтоб вы знали, метка друга двигалась со скоростью звука по карте рандомно. Преполагаю, так работаей передвижение Бигфута. Це баг номер раз.   Це баг номер два: у друга ни с того ни с сего начало отниматься здоровье при отсутствии обморожения. Когда я решила сжалиться нат беднягой и пристрелить, чтоб не учался, звук криков залагал, как я на математике лагала в школке: "А! А! А! А! А! А! А! А! А!...."   Я считаю, что мой друг неудачник, так как за два сеанса игры словил два бага. Всем спасибо, будем ждать новых багов и сообщать вам, друзья! :projectstarship_cthulhu:
Date 2018-08-04 Playtime 7h 39m Rec Negative 2 сеанса игры- 2 бага. 1.Орал после смерти без конца! 2. ВОШЁЛ В БИГФУТА И ВИДЕЛ ЕГО ПЕРЕМЕЩЕНИЯ ПО КАРТЕ (БЫСТРЕЕ СКОРОСТИ СВЕТА). Надеюсь этого больше не произойдёт. Пожалуйста, верните старую карту или добавьте летнюю.
Date 2018-08-04 Playtime 26h 54m Rec Negative Ganz klar: Keine Kaufempfehlung!!!  Das Spiel hat kürzlich den ersten großen Patch bekommen. Nach ca. 1 Jahr hinhalten musste ich feststellen, dass die Entwickler das Spiel downgepatcht haben. Es wurden regelmäßig die Erfolge angekündigt und das Großes erwartet wird.  Die Grafik ist ganz okay. Die Animationen sind jedoch lachhaft und die Gegend ist plump und fühlt sich immer gleich an. Es kommt für mich kein bisschen Horror-Feeling auf. Im Gegenteil: Nach ca. einer halben Stunde habe ich mich extrem gelangweilt.  Die KI von Bigfoot ist ganz nach Schema F. Man muss ihn erst einmal Schaden zufügen damit der sogesehen aggressiv wird. Es läuft jedoch immer nach dem gleichen Schema ab. Er schreit 1-2 mal und kommt dann einfach angerannt. Damit auch jeder unterbelichtete es versteht, dass Bigfoot nun direkt vor dir steht, kommt ein kurzer plumper Ton der wohl "erschreckend" wirken soll.  Für Leute, die sehr auf Bigfoot stehen ist es eine derbe Enttäuschung.
Date 2018-08-03 Playtime 111h 36m Rec Negative Well we're playing this game and some hacker comes on and just kick out my friend. I change the pw everytime.

Date 2018-08-03 Playtime 16h 32m Rec Positive Игра в BIGFOOT - это когда: * У бигфута слетают текстурки шерсти, и теперь вы охотитесь на грустного алкаша в лесу * Два ёбаных часа ищите волосатого ублюдка, а когда находите, падаете с камня высотой в метр и умираете * Пробегающий ночью олень вызывает у вас ненависть к животным * Ставите кучу капканов, но йети не попадает ни в один из них, зато красуется жопой перед камерами * В четвером еле как залазите в одноместную палатку, и вас сразу убивает бигфут * Катка длится 6 часов, за которые игра трансформируется из симулятора долбоёба, идушего по следам, до до усрачки пугающего хоррора, и в финальной стадии в догонялки, где ни вы, ни бигфут не можете друг друга убить В общем, игра 12 несработавших капканов/10. Всем советую купить, лучшее вложение денег если вы не битард и у вас есть друзья.

Legit though, this game is going places, and once they get the bugs ironed out it's going to be a masterpiece, highly recommend if you wanna have an amazing time with friends, or alone.  I hope after the full completion of BIGFOOT they do another with other cryptids such as, Skinwalker, Loch Ness Monster, (MAYBE) the Rake, Mothman, ect.  Overall though 9/10 near perfection, only major issue are bugs, but that's to be expected.

Date 2018-08-02 Playtime 5h 41m Rec Negative The game was decent until they updated it. Why take away the good map, good guns and good gameplay? I dont want to spend 4 hours hunting a yeti on a map the size of Canada.

Date 2018-08-02 Playtime 17h 21m Rec Positive The update is out and it's fantastic.  Low-spec people can get a good experience now and the game looks way better for high-spec players.  There's more-depth to bigfoot's AI  Map is larger  There's more features  Servers work fine.  Still a few early-access bugs to work out but overall definitely worth the price-tag.
Date 2018-08-02 Playtime 7h 36m Rec Positive Cool new big update now i cant play co-op gg
Date 2018-08-02 Playtime 15h 10m Rec Negative Promenons nous dans les bois, pendant que Bigfoot n'y est pas, si Bigfoot y était je l'embrasserais!  Maj remplie de promesses mais:  Bigfoot amélioré et au final pas de Bigfoot Carte déserte... 2 bestioles en 1h20 Mourir dans un rocher ou dans une aiguille de sapin Entendre les chants de la Bigfoutaise au loin, suivre ses traces, l'entrevoir, glisser sur votre fusil et vous empalez sur votre couteau., rebondir sur un rocher glissant et finir dans le lac (ok là j'exagère un peu mais avouez que ça aurait pu être fun après 2h de traque sans rien)...  Bref pour l'instant je déconseille clairement (sauf si vous aimez la randonnée)  Le jeu avait pourtant du potentiel avec sa première map et son Bigfoot sous stéroïde mais bon...
Date 2018-08-02 Playtime 15h 7m Rec Negative New update doesn't work properly in multiplayer.
Date 2018-08-02 Playtime 27h 43m Rec Positive Good job devs  :)
Date 2018-08-02 Playtime 1h 55m Rec Positive good there is no normal mode so im not so happy
Date 2018-08-01 Playtime 10h 10m Rec Negative This game was actually a lot more fun before they gave you the tents, now it just feels like you're hoping to run into him and following his tracks can sometimes lead you to nothing. I followed his tracks before and it went straight into a rock, and not footprints anywhere else around it.
Date 2018-08-01 Playtime 4h 15m Rec Positive For what it is, BIGFOOT is a fine game. If you want some tense, Sasquatch hunting fun with a few friends, I would recommend this game. I haven't had the chance to play the most recent update with friends yet, but the new map looks nice and additions like saving and the drone are great. It is a little expensive, but if you and some pals get it while it's on sale it is pretty fun. For an early access game, it's good.  Edit: one issue I would like to mention is that the game is just too dark at night. You are given a flaslight that does almost nothing and a night vision camera. The night vision camera makes it a lot easier to see, but you cannot use other items while using the camera and it has a limited battery. This problem could be fixed by making the flashlight much brighter.  When looking at this game it's important to consider that this is a small team that is most likely working on a small budget, I think they have done a good job with what they have.

Date 2018-08-01 Playtime 3h 56m Rec Negative I was honestly pretty excited for the big update. It added so many cool items to the game and I figured It'd be a lot of fun.  I soon came to the abrupt realization that this game is an absolute atrocity. I gave the new map about 5 attempts and It was easy to see this game has not been tested for easy to see bugs or anything. 2 of my 5 playthroughs I entered underneath a mountain (almost all mountains contain a large area where there is no mountain and your free to enter under the map) and I died of fall damage within 10 sec. On 1 of my plays I simply involuntarily rag-dolled down a hill and died. on my last 2 plays I attempted to jump on a rock, I got wedged in between the rock and a mountain and died almost instantly. Even if you manage to survive a while have fun finding big foot, Spoiler he's really hard to find.  The best part of this game is how deformed the player models look. How tf do you mess up that bad on models?
Date 2018-08-01 Playtime 10h 26m Rec Negative Ye waited 1 year for an update and got 20 minutes of running, hearing bigfoots orgasms and died by fall damage from a mountain where i glitched in.  10/10

Date 2018-08-01 Playtime 36h 6m Rec Positive Yes! Finnaly! It's out baby! 2.0 is here and ready to steal the cake!  I will admit, there are a few things that are now confusing about the game, but that just gives it a new charm. Even though my friends and I had beaten the game numerous times before, its almost like a new game. The atmosphere is spot on! From the sounds, to the amazing music. This game is by far one of my favorites.   And, like all Early Access Games, there's a few issues that would need attention. But as a whole as it sits right now? 10/10 will enjoy again and again.   Now please excuse me... *grabs rifle* There's Bigfoots to Hunt!

Date 2018-07-31 Playtime 69h 49m Rec Positive This game yes is very buggy. My friends and I have played the new map and we have everyone of the 4-5 times had bigfoot dead in under half an hour because he either got stuck somewhere or his AI stopped working. The glacier bay map doesn't work at all. You play for about 10 mins then you freeze to death because the fires that are supposed to heal you and warm you up for some reason now don't work at all so you die. Any how we mostly stick to the new map ross lake and its buggy of course but playable. This game is amazing. I don't care about the bugs because as long as you are having fun thats all that really matters. Thank you for making such a good game and in the future please possibly check into better bug fixs and adding even more maps.. like having 5 different maps to choose from would be nice! anyway this game is pretty great 9/10

Date 2018-07-29 Playtime 6h 15m Rec Negative Whilst the premise of the game is good, there really isn't any replayabillity once you have cleared the game (which will only take you a couple of hours). As you can see from other reviews on here, People have played between 1 to 6 hours and then stop.  The Devs lack of communication is not helping. We get a post on the store page every now and then promising new content, but no update on their progress.   My advice would be to stay away for now. You can check the discussion board to see how disgruntled the small playerbase is.
Date 2018-07-29 Playtime 104h 43m Rec Positive Ein lustiges Spiel mit guten Ansätzen und sehr viel Potenzial... In dem Zustand, indem sich das Spiel momentan befindet sorgt es vor allem, wenn man es mit Freunden spielt, gerade in den ersten Stunden für massig spannende aber hauptsächlich lustige Erlebinisse. Allerdings flachen diese recht schnell ab, da das Spiel nicht gerade an Möglichkeiten strotzt. Hat man Bigfoot ein paar mal gefangen, erlebt man eigentlich nichts neues mehr, außer man denkt sich mit Freunden speziellere Taktiken oder Challenges aus, oder man findet einige witzige Glitches. Da das Spiel aber von sich aus kaum Möglichkeiten in dieser Richtung bietet wird das Spiel schnell repetitiv. Das könnte sich allerdings mit dem nächsten Update drastisch ändern, in welchem neben einer neuen Map und einer verbesserten Bigfoot-KI auch neue Spielmechaniken verspricht. Dieses Update versprechen die Entwickler allerdings schon seit bald 1,5 Jahren, bis jetzt kam jedoch noch nichts, was schade ist, weil BIGFOOT im Moment in einem extrem unvollständigen Zustand ist. Wer sich für den Kauf von BIGFOOT entscheidet lässt sich auf ein Early-Access-Abenteuer ein, das seinesgleichen sucht und das man auf keinen Fall alleine bestreiten sollte. Wer dazu nicht bereit ist, sollte das nächste Update abwarten (das hoffentlich bald erscheint) und sich dann nocheinmal mit BIGFOOT befassen.

Pros: - Original idea - You can play it with your friends  Cons: - Graphics were so bad!  - There was literally nothing to do the whole time!  - Lightning in broad daylight .... incredible!
Date 2018-07-26 Playtime 57h 35m Rec Positive El juego está muy entretenido en coop :D, me cagué de miedo con un amigo al jugarlo. En un jugador da más miedo pero no es tan divertido.  Yo lo recomiendo jugarlo en Coop. Es divertido de jugar.  Una experiencia similar a Rake pero con mejores gráficos y mas jugabilidad, aunque le han quitado un poco de ambientación y por eso no da tanto miedo como Rake, pero sigue siendo un juego de terror perfecto y divertido para pasar un buen rato de terror con tus amigos :D  ----Editado----  Ahora con la actualización 2.0 la experiencia ha mejorado muchisimo, mejor calidad de sonidos, mas interacciones, ha recuperado el ambiete de terror extremo, sigue dando mas miedo en 1 jugador, pero ahora los lobbys, y en general el multijugador esta mucho mejor hecho.  Hecho de menos el anterior mapa, las montañas, el puente, en general el mapa, ya me lo habia aprendido. Tambien hecho de menos el camper, un lugar "seguro" donde poderte esconder y en el que poder cerrar las ventanas y estar a oscuras mirando las camaras, pero ahora esta mucho mejor hecho el sistema de camaras y los drones me encantan, el juego sigue siendo un juegazo, pero le han quitado una parte de historia, aunque las nuevas animaciones me encantan. Lo recomiendo muchisimo, vale mucho la pena, todo el mundo decia que los creadores nos decepcionaban con nuevas noticias de actualizaciones falsas, pero es cierto que siguen trabajando un moton en el juego, uno de los mejores de terror.

Date 2018-07-16 Playtime 1h 11m Rec Negative I was had massive hopes for this game as me and my friend @TommyWaaves wanted a scary game to play.  We dived in balls deep and thought we had balls of steel till we actually launched the game... I have never ever ever been so intimidated in my life on an intro screen, My heart was beating so hard I believed I caught Diabetes from being so paranoid.  Anyway going on into the game you spawn in a caravan and me being a greedy shit I decided to take as much supplies before my friend joined the game (15 seconds of pure gathering alone).  We was so scared that we put cameras all around the caravan as thats the furthest we thought we would go lol......I was wrong *FacePalm*  We decided to grow some hair on our bollocks and take a trip.....500 metres to the gate LMAO...  We set a camera down and knowing our dopey selves we heard the owls and that gave us an insight that they was telling us to GTFO and get to the caravan ASAP!.... so thats what we did ;)  We got to the caravan and legit waited for the beast to come and tickle our balls... we got impatient and set traps with meat inside it and legged it back to the van with extreme speed.  Long story short Tommy was looking at the cameras on the PC'S....I looked out the window and saw the massive hairy bastard running towards us and took Tommy by the balls and we alt F4 that mf.  Thats my experience and would love to hear anyone elses xD
Date 2018-07-16 Playtime 0h 23m Rec Positive Holy Smokes Where to start.. 10 mins in everything was lovely jumbly, runnig around with a friend on the hunt for bigfoot feeling safe with out pow pow rifles. But my dear friends, if you have a weak blader, heart or ass do not play this games. upon nightfall we took shelter in the base and looked threw the camereas planning how were gonna catch him, sweet jesus were we wrong. after hearing screams from my dear childhood friend over discord it was clear to to assumer the worst, backed out the camerea and boom face to face with the man himself. Never Hit Alt F4 in my life.  Safe to say i needed new desk chair pants and draws. All i can say to anyone interested in buying this, If your feeling constipated this is the solution for your problems. If you lack basketball sized bollocks then enjoy!!!

Date 2018-07-09 Playtime 1h 14m Rec Negative Игра хорошая, но вот оптимизация, частые вылеты. Непонятно где этот блядский бигфут два часа прячется. Лишь за пять часов я нашел его, и то он убежал к черту на пол-часа.
Date 2018-07-09 Playtime 7h 52m Rec Positive Как только наступает ночь в игре, напряжение не сходит до самого утра...  В целом игра неплохая для раннего доступа. Конечно видно что еще совсем не доработана: пока всего одна локация, нет никакой связи с напарниками в игре, я про голосовой или/и текстовый чат, что очень важно для подобных - командных игр. Не совсем понятно что делать после того, когда ты погиб, т.к. оживить или вылечить напарник тебя не может, остается только наблюдать за игрой друга. Очень мало инвентаря (аптечек, видеокамер, капканов...можно добавить что-то новое....что-то типа дефебрилятора, чтобы оживить напарника). Время отслеживания Йети с помощью пули-датчика можно сделать подольше...Самый большой вопрос у меня возник при создании сервера. Зачем обязательно нужно устанавливать пароль? Можно было сделать это на выбор. Если человек хочет только с друзьями поиграть, то пусть создает закрытую игру с паролем, а когда я один захожу и хочу чтобы со мной играли другие люди, почему у меня нет выбора сделать открытую игру?   Ну и еще этой игре явно не хватает достижений и карточек;)  С минусами, я думаю, разработчики разберутся в ближайшее время и игра станет полноценной, потому что цена слишком завышена именно для той версии, которая на данный момент актуальна.   Из плюсов я бы выделил, крутую, напряженную атмосферу, какая и должна быть в подобных играх. Сама задумка игры про Йети крутая, думаю в будущем, когда игру доработают, она будет пользоваться большим спросом. Чего я и желаю разработчикам!) ..................... После обновления 2.0:  Я так надеялся что хоть эту игру не испортят очередным недообновлением, но увы... Понапихали в игру всего, чего можно, только не того, что нужно. Нахуя, простите, этот дрон нужен? Нахуя нужно поддержание температуры?(Да, скажите мне что это для более реалистичной игры и я скажу вам что это пздц..) Нахуя нужен этот планшет? Так хоть какой-то азарт был, бегать туда обратно к трейлеру, а сейчас пздц.   Спасибо что добавили возможность передачи инвентаря, только это вообще никак не помогает, количество его не увеличилось и если ты отдашь свою аптечку, то потом хрен найдешь для себя. Возможности как-то воскресить так и нет. Отслеживание Йети так и не сделали дольше, куда там пуля-датчик пропадает в его зараслях непонятно...Больше скажу, теперь ты хуй найдешь вообще этого Йети, т.к. если в старом обновлении он хоть как-то на тебя натыкался, в этом обновлении...ну это пздц.  Да, спасибо что сделали создание сервера без пароля, спасибо что добавили текстовый чат, спасибо что добавили карточки. Но увы... Это один сплошной пздц. Забил на эту игру после пары запусков (на новом обновлении). Кстати после нового обноления у меня игра вообще зависала на загрузке в лобби и я вообще ничего не мог сделать, кроме как выключить комп. С чем это связано непонятно, системные в норме, драйвера в норме, пытался переустановить игру, перезагружал комп, стим, выключал брандмауэры, в общем делал все что можно, но ничего не помогло. До сих пор чаще у меня зависает она, чем получается сыграть, и ответов что это может быть не дают. Надеюсь вы хотя бы вернете все как было, а было намного лучше...

It's much much more fun to play with a group of friends or you can just play alone if you got balls of steel, unlike me. There is suppose to be an update where they add a new snow map and A LOT more cool features, but that won't be coming in a LONG time because their team is just like 2 guys in college(atleast from what I've heard). But if you want a good horror game with friends, get this.

Date 2018-07-03 Playtime 0h 56m Rec Positive I need some help with this game. I have enjoyed playing it but the game crashes almost instantly now when I open the application. I was hoping if I could get a refund for this and greatly appreciate help.
Date 2018-07-03 Playtime 6h 32m Rec Positive This is a fun game with big potential. However, this is what you need to know before you buy:  Cons (some of which will be adressed in the update that is hopefully about to be released): This is a small team, not a big studio like valve, and I beleive this is their first game- they overestimate themselves in there dev updates and are slow to devlop updates. And to top it all off it seems they bit off more than they could chew.  The game does have minor bugs at the moment  The game can get boring after a while because the bigfoot seemingly disappears for long periods of time.  The bigfoot model is pretty fake  Not a lot to do while not hunting bigfoot Pros: The game is pretty fun when stuff does happen  Bigfoot running out of the woods and growling is pretty terrifying  The map is big and well designed  There are landmarks on the map that spice things up a bit such as a hunting cabin and a bigfoot cave.  There is a sidequest to find 4 hikers that were killed by bigfoot- not much but the gameplay diversity is appreciated ____________________________________________ Overall i say i would give the current game a ~7/10, but something about this game makes me excited for the future updates and overall potential this game has. If you have little empathy or patience for devolopers, i would not advise you purchase this game.

Date 2018-06-22 Playtime 12h 59m Rec Negative It's OK. I realize it's only in the beta stage but come on. You can't even save your progress. My windows key doesn't work on the game, and i checked, it isn't the key, it's the game. And finally, I've noticed several smaller mistakes such as when you go to exit the game, after you hit exit, it asks you if you really want to exit as you would expect, but instead of the normal 'yes' or 'no' options, it has 'Yas' and 'No'. Overall the game is ok but i really wish you would make it so I'm able to actually save my progress.

Date 2018-06-19 Playtime 5h 59m Rec Negative Game has great potential and great concept but I can't recommend it in the state it's currently in. For starters, there's only 1 playable map and after a couple playthroughs it just gets boring and loses its glory. On top of that, game mechanics are highly limited to chase and shoot bigfoot. You can lay bear traps but they only are good for getting a bit extra damage on him, doesn't contribute to the actual mechanics much at all. Needs more weapons, gear mechanics, ammo types, traps, maps, etc.

Date 2018-06-14 Playtime 50h 45m Rec Positive Ein gutes Spiel für zwischendurch mit Freunden. leider ist vieles noch verbesserungswürdig und die deutsche übersetzung ist eine Katastrophe. das Kampfsystem ist auch relativ eintönig, Bigfoot kommt, du schießt ein paar mal auf ihn, er haut  dir eine rein und er rennt wieder weg.es gibt auch noch einige Bugs wie z.b das Hirsche nachdem sie getötet wurden immernoch Geräusche machen. Es ist kein Spiel womit ich jetzt Stunden verbringen würde, ich mach es Abends mit ein paar Freunden mal an und versuche ihn 2-3 Stunden zu jagen nicht mehr und nicht weniger

Date 2018-06-10 Playtime 0h 48m Rec Negative I played for not even an hour and this game could be so much better if it had a keybinding options more guns and the biggest problem with the game is it is 90 percent chasing and seeing the bigfoot for two seconds will missing your shots bc you cant ads and him run off again. It is fun however for the breif thirty to twenty seconds it decides to fight. But not worth 15 dolllars as of right now.

Date 2018-06-02 Playtime 0h 47m Rec Positive Best game ever!
Date 2018-06-01 Playtime 2h 12m Rec Negative This game is a pile of Hot garbage, they continuously make excues for not meeting their deadlines. It's been wayyy too long. If you're going to make us wait, atleast meet your promised deadline instead of getting our hopes up and disappointing us. The update is over a year late, we're all sick of getting dev news and no updates.  Update Fall 2018: I came back to this game a while later since I've been craving a horror based game during this time of year. I figured I would give this game another chance and maybe say something positive but BOY was I wrong. The physics are pitiful, it feels like I am jumping on the moon. Let's not forget when I jump off of a two foot ledge into soft snow my character looses most of his health and screams in agony like he just got stabbed and ragdolls to the ground. Textures look extremely flat, undetailed and bland and it doesn't support above 60hz. Bigfoot looks like a joke and isn't even remotely scary and is impossible to kill him. Still a bad game and is not worth nearly $16. (maybe 0.16 cents at best). I guess I'll come back to this game next year and maybe it won't be as big of a disappointment...But knowing these devs, it will probably still be absolute dogshit for the next 3 years. I will give them this much... It is a cool concept but needs ALOT of work and I wish you guys the best of luck and hope you prove me wrong one day and release a great game. But for now your game is shit.

You feel a rush of excitement and are never taxed for an adrenaline rush. The bad reviews should be ignored, the devs are working hard on updates and the game, as is, 5/29/2018, is very much playable  and extreemly enjoyable. 10/10 would reccomend.

Date 2018-05-27 Playtime 35h 15m Rec Positive EDIT: This review was made in 1.0. This may not hold up soon.  Don't take that much from me, as I haven't played alot of this game, but I do know a bit. Here we go.  [i] (TL;DR at the bottom) [/i]  Bigfoot is a game where you and up to 2 other people are on a mission to find and capture "Bigfoot." You and your buddies have an arsenal of a hunting rifle equiped with normal and tracking bullets, a flare gun, a trap with meat, and cameras. These weapons will help you capture Bigfoot.  From my expierence, I've never caught Bigfoot usually because I sucked. (lol) It was really fun chasing him around trying to kill him, especially with friends. Also, Bigfoot is mildly fun when played alone, but if you have 2 friends to play with, the experience becomes amazing! The joy of watching your friends getting eating by Bigfoot is pretty cool, but I'd rather keep my friends than kill them  Overall, Bigfoot is a pretty fun game, especially if you have friends to play with. It might get old playing alone, but if you have buddies it'll never get too old as the adrediline gets to you if you and your friends are getting chased in the woods.  [b] TL;DR / Bigfoot is fun with friends. [/b]  (Bigfoot recommended to me by DragonSlayer135)

I will say this now, every time I check this game(popped on the game now and then) they have been zero changes to the barely acceptable hunting game, the map is not random generated so there is no variation, there is no alternate map, you get 2 weapons(a rifle(very basic mechanics) and bear traps(bigfoot ignores half the time)) which are pretty naff compared to the "dev note reveal weapons"(which have been missing still till this day) 8 camera's to monitor on your PC(yes, not ipad, A Static PC which you can get attacked through the windows whilst watching them), A flare gun(for night time), Night vision(this item is basically your scope because they don't want you to have a weapon scope to help you shoot things :/ + its a bad nightvision quality), Rope(for tying up bigfoot when you slap him up) and last piece of equipment is Tracer rounds(these are the best thing in the game for achieving victory as they let you stalk bigfoot with your map). I will be willing to change this review from a negative to a positive if the devs actually come through with updates to the actual game or allow the general public to actually beta test the most recent content out there, else your going to have everyone claiming you screwed them over for the cost of the game(even EA is not safe from the community).

Date 2018-05-20 Playtime 1h 39m Rec Positive i want to play this game but it wont work on my cpu
Date 2018-05-20 Playtime 7h 38m Rec Positive This game was worth the money. This game still has a ways to go with the content and the new map.. However, getting a group of pals and hunting bigfoot together made for some good times.
Date 2018-05-19 Playtime 52h 38m Rec Positive Its fun even though the development is slow. The replay ability is only so much but it is alot of fun.
Date 2018-05-17 Playtime 7h 35m Rec Positive Very fun! I play this with two of my friends and we love it. This game can be very scary at times and I recommend playing it with someone and not going it alone. My one complaint with this game is that once you capture Bigfoot once there isn't really anything else to do in the game except for repeating the process. Regardless this is a great game and I recommend it.
Date 2018-05-17 Playtime 3h 7m Rec Negative It doesn't load
Date 2018-05-16 Playtime 30h 9m Rec Positive топ
Date 2018-05-14 Playtime 8h 54m Rec Positive Cool
Date 2018-05-13 Playtime 8h 55m Rec Positive Fun game, honestly! The game mechanics are fun and well designed, yet the game is obviously still in Early Access, you'll notice this in movement and hitboxing at times.   Furthermore, the english, for example, in the guide, needs a thorough spelling check. But you'll notice that there's a word like 'Raztsenit' snuck in there that obviously gives away that the devs aren't native English speakers. This doesn't take away the fun, even brings some light to the atmosphere ironically enough.  Anyway. I recommend this game to anyone that looks for a fun, simple, cooperative cryptid-shooter. Hopefully Glacier Bay will be released soon and maybe different cryptids will be added.   Keep up the good work!

С графикой прикола не понял. Но игра оставила вполне положительные эмоции, даже по началу было страшно от неизвестности. В общем цена ей не больше 150 рублей !  В стиме есть похожая игра как раз за 150) не помню названия(rake-рэйк вроде), но там почти одно и то же.

Date 2018-05-08 Playtime 16h 53m Rec Positive Tak se zase po pár měsících setkáváme u další recenze, kde si vybiju svou frustraci, do píči. Takže k recenzi, co bych o hře pověděl? Hlavním úkolem je ulovit chlupatou, bájnou, smradem po rybách nasáklou bestii, jen pro upřesnění, řeč není o tvé mámě, která se vás bude snažit zabít, ale taky bude utíkat. Jo zní to na hovno, ale je to sranda. Ve hře si užijete stovky skvělých chvil, kdy vám bez povšimnutí do zad vběhne dvoumetrová kunda a šlehne vás drápem přes nohy, ani se neotočíte a už vidíte jen rozmazaný flek, jak ten zmrd rychle utíká. Ale s přesným aimem a dobrým parťákem mu dáte jednu [Trekink Balt] přímo do krku a už se vám neztratí, pak ho jen ulovíte, svážete, zavřete do klece a můžete natáčet další pokračování 50 odstínů šedi. Druhým úkolem je najít nebohé oběti, které po lese zanechal již zmíněný bigfoot. Nebudu lhát, ale je to velmi obtížné, protože v trávě se kusy rozcupovaných mozků hledají opravdu složitě, ale na druhou stranu, nebyli chlupatí, takže si zasloužili umřít.. Takže žádné lenivění a koukejte tančit bigfoota se mnou.
Date 2018-05-07 Playtime 18h 48m Rec Positive Good game, but almost nevet gets updated
Date 2018-05-06 Playtime 4h 11m Rec Positive Good Gives you some good scares, I reccomend only playing this with friends. Right now not worth 16 bucks, but when new update comes out totally worth it!
Date 2018-05-05 Playtime 5h 39m Rec Positive Играл в автономном режиме 5 часов. Бигфута так и не поймал, хотя видел его достаточно. Купил игру, думал что все что написано в DEV NEWS уже есть в игре - оказалось ни дронов, ни расширенного меню, ни виз.эффектов , ни расширенного кол-ва животных нет.  Жаль.
Date 2018-05-05 Playtime 15h 7m Rec Negative It's not worth 15 dollars in its current state.  They've promised a new map with new feautures for a long, long time now and they're rarely giving out updates.
Date 2018-05-05 Playtime 14h 46m Rec Positive fun
Date 2018-05-02 Playtime 5h 39m Rec Positive This game is fun and scary as shit when playing with a friend or two, if you play this game alone you must need a wheelbarrel to carry your balls around. Once you kill bigfoot the game is boring though. Am excited for the new update so i can be walking through the forest and get totally fuckin earraped by lightning again and run away like pussies. Totally recommend the game. Just saying these developers are going to need a VERY good trailer to get people hype for this update. Definitely recommended just dont play all the time or you will get bored and the fun will be ruined. 10/10 from my experiences.
Date 2018-05-01 Playtime 1h 32m Rec Positive I can't actually play the game, and it seems as though I'm not the only one. I can open the game, click solo, click the map, but as soon as it starts to load, it freezes and crashes. Please fix this. I know it's an amazing game, but I can't play it! :( Other than that, I have played before on friends' accounts. Fantastic game, especially with friends. (If you play with friends, I highly recommend being in separate rooms or with sound cancelling headphones on a skype call. It's drop dead hilarious the stuff people say in a dark room with loud noises like thunder coming out of no where and nearly blowing your ear drums out.)

Date 2018-04-29 Playtime 6h 16m Rec Positive Это игра духовный наследник такой малоизвестной игры как rake. Тематика поимки чудовища с друзьями заходит на все 100%. Играть весело и приятно. Особенно радует тот факт, что разработчики продолжают разрабаывать игру. Если хотите с весельем провести несколько часов с дузьями, то эта игра именно то, что вам нужно!

Date 2018-04-23 Playtime 40h 24m Rec Positive Have had this game for over a year now! WOW...Ive got quite a few hours in this game. After I killed bigfoot for the first time I set goals for myself to keep the game interesting...one of them was to see how many games in a row I could kill bigfoot. I managed to get 5 games in a row where I eachived this goal! Yes, there are some bugs in this game, but overall it is definately worth the money and would recomend this to everyone! ENJOY!

Date 2018-04-11 Playtime 66h 33m Rec Positive it does not have the winter update
Date 2018-04-10 Playtime 16h 59m Rec Positive I have seen this problem all over the web today (4/9/18)  Today I decided to get the game. I have always seen gameplays and other YouTubers playing this game, so I thought I would give it a go. Its 15.99$, which is a fair price for a good game, but there is one problem...  After you have downloaded it on to your device, when you go to play a "New Game" it will load for approx. 1.2 seconds, then freeze, and then crash.  I have gone through all the requirements for this game (64bit,graphic display, etc.) and still cant figure it out. I realize Unreal Engine 4's website was down, so I will try again tomorrow.  Does anyone have any tips I should use or should I wait for the full game to be released?
Date 2018-04-09 Playtime 26h 10m Rec Positive Okay game, but found the maps slighly to small and the game to short lived.
Date 2018-04-08 Playtime 7h 15m Rec Positive i love it
Date 2018-04-08 Playtime 23h 12m Rec Positive EDIT: OOF, after the new update all my previous statements have gone invalid. The game has greatly improved and is closer to being worth it's price now. There are a few points of critisism, but I feel like the dev's will fix these minor things.   Fun and entertaining game, would recommend after the update.  *IGNORE PRE-UPDATE REVIEW* Would not recommend as it is right now.   While the game can be fun at times, the negatives outweigh the fun. The game is very glitchy, it doesn't have a lot of things to do and most things the developers prommised would be here a while ago, still aren't here.  All of this in combination with a very linear map makes for a very repetitive and boring game.   Once the developers add new things and work on the glitches this would be a great game with a lot of potential, but the game's current state makes me recommend all of you to wait for new features.
Date 2018-04-08 Playtime 1h 30m Rec Negative Needs some sort of direction, story modes, missions, some actual clue of how to play maybe a tutorial. This game has a long way to go before it is worth buying.
Date 2018-04-07 Playtime 2h 42m Rec Negative Waste of 16 dollars. Crashes before it starts. Dont even put it in full screen. lots of bugs!
Date 2018-04-06 Playtime 7h 22m Rec Positive Finding Bigfoot is such an awesome game. Along the lines of The Rake which is also a pretty rad game but Bigfoot has beautiful graphics and suspensful gameplay! If you are keen to see some gameplay here you go. PS I sh*t bricks in this game when he comes charging out of the darkness!  https://youtu.be/MO83bQdvbJk
Date 2018-04-06 Playtime 26h 39m Rec Positive ist gut
Date 2018-04-06 Playtime 20h 2m Rec Positive This game is fun for when you're bored with your friends. People say the game is dead and the dev's don't care, but they do. And the game isn't dead. The dev's have been busy with their own personal lives such as their education, computers breaking and what not. They do give us updates on their progress from time to time too.

Date 2018-04-03 Playtime 215h 30m Rec Positive Ok this review was made during the early release of the update that completly changed this game. First I like the new system of Bigfoot and how you play it. And the old game was scarier than new update is and I hope they change it to make it scarier. The game looks great you might  need a decent computer to run it. The game is difficult though so if you're up for a challenge get it. And over all the game's great my only complaints are that: they've made it less scary the Bigfoot himself is less scary than he used to be. There's a few other glitches that should get fixed soon enough so I won't mention them. Overall game's great but remember I reviewed this in early access so if I forget to update this review many things will have changed. (This is getting too long) Ok that's it. I definitly recommend the game. (Although it might not be worth 15.99 but I still think it's worth it)
Date 2018-04-02 Playtime 30h 35m Rec Positive GREAT GAME!

Date 2018-03-29 Playtime 7h 33m Rec Positive אני לא משחק בוא ולא נהנה 
Date 2018-03-29 Playtime 0h 44m Rec Positive its pretty damn great ☺
Date 2018-03-29 Playtime 21h 25m Rec Negative Honestly I dont recommend this game in its current state. Price is definetely way too high as for right now.  This game got quite an "overhaul" that took devs a long time to make and its pretty dissapointing, some problems have been fixed but other problems still remain, game is still very lackluster and IS NOT WHAT THEY SELL YOU ON THE TRAILER, GAME DOES NOT LOOK/ RUN LIKE THAT. In the newest 4.0 update game really only changed graphicly, when gamplay did not really improve. "game-loop" gets pretty boring, really fast. AI is still awful for now. It really depends what you are expecting from this game cause if you want an actual hunting bigfoot immersive expirience, than you are in for a bad expirience but If you are looking to play buggy game that is funny in its awfulness than go ahead. Although game IS in fact in early access so it all can change AND I will change my review if game actually gets content/ gets better. Devs are very lazy and I dont think they can really explain themselves out of that one, they are extremely lazy and game does not get frequent updates- when it does get an update, its usually not very good/ fixes some problems and adds things that just dont matter for the game. I hope they change their priorites with this game, it needs alot of work. I do not recommend you buy it in a current state, Its a bad, poorly executed product that feels/ plays nothing like the steam page could suggest. Its just a bad game for now.
Date 2018-03-29 Playtime 17h 7m Rec Positive Поставлю такую оценку из-за того, что игра реально крутая, но её надо развивать. Всем нам нужна мотивация, и поэтому я помогу разработчикам своим хорошим отзывом!
Date 2018-03-29 Playtime 11h 44m Rec Negative Я ждал от этой игры много,в описании в этой игре написано что она выйдет из раннего доступа через пол года такой пиздотни я еще не слышал ,игра в раннем доступе уже год ,нового контента никакого ,  отношение к игре просто ужасное , да разработчики может что-то и делают но это не заметно.На данный момент игра сырая и не затягивающая ,поэтому отзыв отрицательный .После выходы игры в полной версии я может пересмотрю свое отношении а пока только так  3/10 только потому ,что в начале игра заманивала и пугала .
Date 2018-03-29 Playtime 24h 7m Rec Positive Un buen juego. esta aun en fase beta pero se que en algun dia sera un muy buen juego.
Date 2018-03-28 Playtime 9h 41m Rec Positive НУ короче, купили мы с другом игрульку. СКачали. Очутились в  милипиздическом трейлере, где можно застрять двум персам. Далее. Расставили ловушки и ждем.  Прошло 3 минуты и этот хер уже смотрит на тебя в двери и  хреначит тебя огромной лапой как у мини-Кинг конга. НУ мы его начали преследовать, постреляли. Он убежал. И тут мы видим ущелье, а между скалами дерево. ну мы залезли туда. Я смотрел в даль 5  минут и думал, что это дерево такое. Нихера. Стоит этот бабуин и втыкает в дерево. Ну мы его конечно же начали кормить дробью, а втыкает  как обдолбыш. Ебнули его, связали и притащили. Все. Конец. Решили заново сыграть, а бигфут сломался. Т.е при загрузки карты получается снова концовка. Перезашрузили игру. Начали заново. Но в итоге его даже не встретили! Он то ли втыкал там в какое-то другое дерево и в капканы, то ли просто поумнел и решил избегать нас. В общем 10\10 втыкающих бабуинов

Date 2018-03-25 Playtime 13h 4m Rec Positive Pretty fun game, totally recommend it.
Date 2018-03-25 Playtime 3h 27m Rec Positive Ok so I'm "reviewing" this once more - probably 1-2 years later. The game seems to have received some major updates, like user interface wise and an additional level to play, also a character selection screen. However, this time around - the game crashed like 4 times within 30 minutes, which really sucks. I think I originally paid like $17 for this game when I first found it, and I still wouldn't recommend paying that much for it, maybe $10 tops.   It's still pretty fun to chase bigfoot, as I haven't noticed any real rhyme or reason to his movement patterns. My kids still enjoy it and I bet you/yours will too.
Date 2018-03-22 Playtime 5h 27m Rec Positive +CONS+ +Long game lenght, one round takes around an hour to end +Good controls +Up to 3 players co-op +Got some nice moments i got scared "a little" (read down below) +Was fun from the beginning to the very end with friends. +Replayability (with friends)  -PROS- -3 Players max for co-op -Games can take way too long sometimes -Everything outruns you in this game -Some item spawns are solid, you find them at the same spot everytime. -You can't play public matches with random people, lobbies MUST have password.  Best experienced with a pair of pants.  9/10 Would sh|t my pants twice in a row again.  Overall this game is 7/10 for its price. The rating above is for the scary ambiance and gameplay only.

Date 2018-03-18 Playtime 24h 37m Rec Positive Velmi dobrá hra, odporúčam
Date 2018-03-18 Playtime 12h 31m Rec Positive BIGFOOT has gone through several name changes, "Finding Bigfoot", "The Bigfoot Finders" (Not my favorite...) and "BIGFOOT: THE LEGEND"  Gameplay is simple, run around in a variety of maps looking for Bigfoot and kill him. Why? I don't know, he's eating people so I guess it has to be done.  The new player-controlled Bigfoot mode is fun, but has a few issues. Notably, the M14 needs to be toned down in terms of damage output for this gamemode specifically. It deals insane damage to the point where any group of hunters just rushes to get it and Bigfoot is powerless to stop that. Secondly the damage visual overlay makes seeing traps...or just targets in general, nearly impossible when you have four hunters shooting you all at once.  As for the base gamemode, it's alright, but I think the original version of Bigfoot was better in terms of behavior. Bigfoot 4.0, while graphically great, does not stalk you or take time to find you. He knows where you are all the time, will bum rush you at night without any build up and will always come back for more leaving no room for downtime, recovery or suspense building.  Sound-creating devices need to have a role to distract him more than just in the player-controlled Bigfoot gamemode, because Bigfoot having a GPS location on where you are ALWAYS is just poor game design.  The traps he sets up in trees need to be visible. It's both frustrating and stupid how you only know where one is until after you've stepped on it and are going to take a lot of damage.  There's gotta be a better way to juke Bigfoot, as if you jump out of a window to get away from him as he's breaking a door down, he will telepathically know you jumped out of the house (even if you don't produce any sound while doing so) and sprint over to the window you jumped out of, leading to the question of "What was the point of that?"  Stealth mechanics need to exist, lights, curtains etc. should all play a role, once again, it's rather stupid how Bigfoot ALWAYS knows where you are, there's no sense of dread while this 8-9 foot tall beast stalks or actively hunts you down, he just runs in, smacks you and all of your friends, runs away and comes back in less than 2 minutes.  One last thing before I go, Bigfoot should receive a minor upscaling. I understand why they did decrease his height - so he can fit in houses, which is a good idea. Though I think the sizes of houses and doors should be increased to accommodate for this increase in scale so you feel like you're hunting Bigfoot and not a guy in a suit.  For a side project made by two college kids, well done, I can say. Despite the glaring flaws Bigfoot 4.0 is fun for a few hours, but PLEASE try to do better.  6/10

I have to turn the graphics very low and play in windowed mode because my pc can't handle it. If the devs see this could they please turn the graphics down a little? Overall, great game!

Date 2018-03-13 Playtime 73h 47m Rec Positive Good game, lots of fun. Love playing PvP as bigfoot, so much fun! Enjoying the updates to it. 8.5/10
Date 2018-03-11 Playtime 13h 38m Rec Negative I would call this very early alpha, not worth the money to buy it. Dev has been promising updates and more to do, but in the end, just promises with no actual follow through. If I could go back and not buy this, i would.
Date 2018-03-11 Playtime 0h 25m Rec Positive Игра классная но она однообразная в неё раз поиграл и больше не хочется. Если будет обновление с ети то игроков будет больше , а сейчас серверов не много

Date 2018-03-10 Playtime 3h 41m Rec Positive its fun and kinda scary but only with friends if you're playing it alone i could understand if you say its boring
Date 2018-03-10 Playtime 8h 16m Rec Positive Ce jeu est très effrayant. Attention !  Etant l'un des rares jeu à proposant une traque au Bigfoot, il mériterait être plus complet et mieux fini.   Il n'est pas assez développé. Le cycle jour/nuit (de quelques minutes) est vraiment trop rapide !  Attention avant votre achat, sachez que les côtés "exploration scientifique", et "enquête paranormale sur le bigfoot" ne sont pas du tout mis en avant. Ce n'est pas le propos du jeu ! Et c'est bien dommage.  10/20

Date 2018-03-08 Playtime 10h 9m Rec Negative Le jeu semble chouette. En gros c'est du Rake en plus beau  Mais dans l'état actuel, on se fait chier, les partie c'est toujours les memes.En gros on le cherche, on tir dessus, il viens et frappe. Vous rechargez, il se barre   Vous pouvez placer un piege mais sa ma jamais servir Les cameras sert a rien   Le mode multi ba comme Rake on s'ennuie vite, vus que c'est la meme chose(au moins le multi marche mieux, comparé a Rake)  Bref, pour le moment , ne pas l'acheter, vus le prix c'est beaucoup trop chère Après il faut voir ce que vaut la prochaine mise a jour (qui est annoncé depuis plus de 6mois)
Date 2018-03-08 Playtime 96h 22m Rec Positive Nejlepší hra! Je tajemná, strašidelná ale i  velice zábavná.
Date 2018-03-08 Playtime 12h 43m Rec Positive Игра по типу Rake только с исправлением всех возможных недочетов и удаления самого рэйка и замены его на бигфута. В общем игра мне понравилась, поиграл я два часа с друзьями и в итоге : мне надоело, причем сильно. Короче еслибы игра стоила на сотан меньше можно было бы и купить.Это так называемая игра на пару часов.
Date 2018-03-08 Playtime 24h 55m Rec Positive I have some likes and dislikes about this game, but I'll start with the likes: First off, it's a really neat idea and it makes for a fun game. The fact that it's multiplayer makes it even better. I like the originality of it and the fact that there's a good amount of cool things you can do to help hunt bigfoot. It's hard to kill bigfoot, but that just makes it more fun (not to say they should make it too hard. I don't want impossible). Plus, I like the ability to lay down cameras and traps. It's fun, but does have some needed improvements.  Now the dislikes: First of all, I wish this game was controller compatible. I love playing games with a xbox controller so much more than a mouse and keyboard. Given, this is early release, but other early release games have given controller compatibility before. Second, this game can get a little laggy. I wish it flowed a bit more smoothly. I would like to see some optimization in this game. The times I've played, it started lagging and just made me enjoy it less. It didn't lag as hard as a lot of games, but it still lagged. Again, I realize this is early release, but proper feedback helps development.
Date 2018-03-08 Playtime 24h 20m Rec Positive Load game  "Wow its actually really pretty" "wow its getting dark" "what in the ever loving fuck was that noise"        *lightning strikes*        *I proceed to shit myself* "FUUCKIN DEVS WHY"        *Hears roar*        *Turns into tween girl* "FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK RUN AWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY"        *shit myself again*        *calm down after he leaves and chase him*        *proceed to die after he mcgregors my ass two more times*   10/10 ign  P.S. PLEASE add a remove motion blur option

Date 2018-03-06 Playtime 11h 9m Rec Positive The game looks really good, it is scary, fun, and I think this should be ported to consoles, but my only problem is the English in this game is unbearable, sometimes, it's hard to understand what it is saying, but you should still get it!

Date 2018-03-05 Playtime 5h 35m Rec Positive fun game,loved it kept me busy for a long time. alot of people team killed me but the game is great 
Date 2018-03-04 Playtime 22h 13m Rec Negative Trying to enjoy this game with my son. We are playing multi-player and on my sons machine the game runs rock solid, but on my machine the game crashes constantly. Both systems run windows 10, and have dedicated NVidia graphics cards and decent CPU power.   My son and I will be exploring the map hunting for bigfoot and then out of the blue, I will crash out of the game. I can rejoin our multiplayer game, but all my equipment is gone; guns, ammo, med-kits, flare-gun etc. It would be nice if the game detects a player drops out, that it leaves the equipment on the ground to be foraged for when I rejoin the game, or that the equipment gets respawned back at camp. As it stands, once I crash out of the game, our only recourse is to restart the server and try again so we can each get equipment again.  We have only gotten through one gaming session without a crash on my machine.  The developer really needs to focus on fixing all the crash bugs as soon as possible, or this game is dead in the water.   I really want to enjoy the game with my son, but the crashes are really curbing our enthusiasm for the game.

Date 2018-03-03 Playtime 14h 36m Rec Negative good job fucking all of us over
Date 2018-03-01 Playtime 0h 7m Rec Negative The only reason I bought this game is because my son keeps on about it so it was a surprise purchase for him and the game hasnt worked properly once.it would allow me to go the title screen and alter the options yet when i select the single player mode it consistently crashes. I havent even started 1 game yet. I have uninstalled and reinstalled yet the game wont work. I have asked for a refund
Date 2018-03-01 Playtime 20h 28m Rec Positive Bought this game for me and my friend and it was the funnest shit ever, i streamed it and everything it was so good. so fucking scary too. definetly cant wait for more updates, well done!!!    update on review as of recent update - this ♥♥♥♥ing game was so much better before you ♥♥♥♥ing updated it, there are moutains and rocks that you can walk right through and you get stuck. and the map is way to big and bigfoot is rarley seen the game now lacks content the previous map was smaller and bigfoot was scarier now bigfoot looks like a bad 3d rendered monkey give us the old bigfoot  edit as of 8/10/2021 i opened this game after this update to a huge surprise, the game actually looks professional !!!!  everything got super polished and bigfoot has a good model! im so glad you guys have not given up on this game. cant wait to play with friends.
Date 2018-03-01 Playtime 10h 10m Rec Negative This Game is a pile of bigfoot turd.  As of the writting of this review this will have been the third chance I have given the game almost a year later and nothing is new. The Dev talks about coming updates but I have yet to see them.  The Bigfoot AI is lacking it appears when it pleases and doesn't follow simple rules, standing in front of a trap? doesn't affecrt him but it does you. Im no coder nor game maker but I am pretty sure Big foot spawns in and isn't walking around.   I have 5 hours into this game and 90% of that was waiting for him to show up, being loud and careless doesn't even help him to come.   Did I mention that when you die you are done no respawn or help from the other surivers, do yourself a solid and go spend $15 on a pizza instead, because even a pizza is more playable than this heap of dung.

Date 2018-02-25 Playtime 5h 54m Rec Negative Really liked the game when it came out, but waiting on updates and bug fixes for way too long. Game gets boring after one playthrough. Tried to play it recently and looks like I have the same issue that many have, which is a black screen after the company logo. Shame really, was a cool game, but the devs seem to not care about the complaints of game currently and ignore a lot of it. I understand they are still in college, but don't ignore the public and at least attempt to give an update on what is going on with development. I would not purchase this until they fix the game and provide content.
Date 2018-02-24 Playtime 23h 20m Rec Positive BIGFOOT has it's best moments and the improvements do look impressive however I still very much prefer the older version of this game more but I still recommend this game.

Date 2018-02-24 Playtime 9h 51m Rec Positive Always dreamed of making a Bigfoot hunting game, and you guys made it!  It has some bugs, but they keep working on making it better :D Yeti-roar/10
Date 2018-02-24 Playtime 0h 19m Rec Positive This game is off a decent start.  The graphics are beautiful. The weather system seems great. There were a couple things thats that I found to need work. First was the grammar. Its horrible. It cheapens the game. Next, was the bullet interaction with the world. You never see the bullet hit anything. When I aim at a tree, I want to see the tree being hit. When I aim at the water, I want to see the water splash up. This is not case. You just see a small cloud of dust/smoke in the general direction.  Another element that would add to the realism of this game is sway and bounce. When you walk or run, your character basically glides. There is not wobble or swagger. Yuor head moves in a perfectly straight path. If they were to give this game a bit more feel while you moved, it would increase the submersion into the hunt for this legendary creature. All in all, I would give this game a 5 out 10.
Date 2018-02-22 Playtime 1h 22m Rec Negative It crash all the time for me and i am on a new PC this game looks good but its just a scam DO NOT BUY
Date 2018-02-22 Playtime 18h 29m Rec Negative um this game was fun but the devs put out a date of after 2 weeks the game came out they said 2 months for the new update and now 7-8 months have passed and the game it dead but please dont buy this game until the update comes out and buy something better
Date 2018-02-21 Playtime 0h 45m Rec Negative DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YET. AS OF 2/20/2018, IT STILL DOESN'T WORK. Check the forums and steam discussion threads about this game. There are MANY, MANY people who have purchased the game and only found disappointment.
Date 2018-02-20 Playtime 8h 35m Rec Positive I feel like this game is underated.  there are some issues with the game but I will get to that in a sec.  This game was fun to play with friends and scary to roam and hear his roar from accros the map                              improvements 1. make rooms able to not have a pasword on them so randoms can play together  2. mic system  3. bigfoot and the player amimations seem a bit clunky. 4. more items and tools to use 5. this one is tricky but add more replay value.  I find my self getting bored because there is not to much to do.                             over all this is a good game dont give up on it!

Date 2018-02-19 Playtime 12h 33m Rec Positive This game is a hard sell. It's pricey for a very limited beta and there has been an update pending for quite sometime, which makes it hard to convince your friends to purchase (but it is definitely more fun with friends, so it's worth the effort to convince them). The concept is really fun, and hasn't been pulled off well on PC yet, so there is the potential for this to be a hit. In the current EA state, the game is fun, but a bit of this fun can be attributed to the jank not being worked out yet. For example, [spoiler] standing on top of the truck is a safer place to wait for bigfoot then in the truck, because he will wait for you to jump down off of it before attacking. [/spoiler]   There are some very real jump scares and bigfoot is both terrifying and also hilarious to look at. Ideally, you would want to have one person manning the cameras and two players finding bigfoot. I thought the cameras would feel boring, but it is actually really fun. They are supposed to add a drone, and I really can't wait to see what that adds to the game. The map is beautiful and emmersive, but there are some bugs with water. Mainly, that rivers look weird, the lakes aren't very deep, and the waterfall looks like they forgot to add water to it - but this is to be expected since the game is still in early access.   I would love for the developers to add a save and continue button, because as of right now there are none. There are also some bugs with the catching of bigfoot, mainly that [spoiler] his tied up body sometimes spawns upside down and then gets stuck on things like bridges and small patches of dirt. [/spoiler]   I have some beef with the ending, but over all this is a really fun game. I can't wait to see where the developers take it.

Game need improvement for sure, like more dangerous animals to fight with too: big bears, wolves, and big wildcats or something...
Date 2018-02-16 Playtime 4h 9m Rec Positive The game keeps on crashing, can you fix that?
Date 2018-02-16 Playtime 52h 0m Rec Positive This game is actually amazing. ive had it for a few onths now and me and my friend play it every weekend, its really fun to get on and mess around on and also it can give you a nice jumpscare every once in a while. i would highly recomend getting this game as i can honestly say its one of the best games ive ever played (at least when youre playing with friends). it has a few glitches but they arent anyhting that actually affects gameplay that much. my only complaint is that the devs are taking forever to update it but then again their basically remaking the game. its definetly worth the money and a great casual game if you want a good scare every once in a while, it scares you alot when you first get it. 10/10

Date 2018-02-14 Playtime 2h 11m Rec Negative This game is inexpensive and you get what you pay for. I have exactly 1.1 hours played. It took me only 1 hour to learn the concept of the game, fundmentals of play, AND to find and kill Bigfoot. The monster is not smart. The map is tiny and linear. If you're a child, it might be a fun challenge for you but as for me, I see absolutely no appeal for replay. Uninstalled. Staying uninstalled. Whole thing feels like slowly rolling through a cheap, railed theme park attraction.   Wish I had spent the $15 on something else.
Date 2018-02-13 Playtime 16h 5m Rec Positive Ich habe Bigfoot schon einmal gefangen und bin daran 215 Minuten gesessen und man muss für dieses Spiel verdammt viel Zeit und Ruhe mitbringen. Ich empfehle dieses Spiel sehr weil es spannend ist und er immer wieder aus dem nichts kommt.  Also man sieht sich :)
Date 2018-02-13 Playtime 1h 2m Rec Negative Ist mehr als langweilig. Bigfoot ist zu leicht zum austricksen und außer ein paar Jumpscares gibt es leider nicht viel was das Spiel bietet. Es gibt auch keinen Fortschritt seit über einen Jahr darum bin Ich froh das ich es in einer Stunde durch hatte und zurück geben konnte.

Date 2018-02-10 Playtime 0h 23m Rec Negative This game has a big mistake. It seems to mainly focus on a single player base. It does not leave duplicate weapons for the other player in the game session. Thats just one of the issues. Please buy this game only if you need an extra game added to your library.

Can we buy an early DLC pass to test out the new stuff so A) we can get a glimpse of the long long long awaited hype B) bugs can be located and squashed, C) so I can record this game without crashing and D) its profit for the game :P   RIGHT NOW It’s fun for 5-10 hours and gets kinda boring after hours of playing.  Love it tho, scary af   (Damn lightning)

Date 2018-02-08 Playtime 38h 59m Rec Positive No mouse sensitivity
Date 2018-02-07 Playtime 29h 7m Rec Positive I had a lot of hope for this game, it is fun and the few times I played it with friends was even more fun. however i have been unable to play for about 4 mounths due to the game crashing on the load up screen. this is not an issue that is limited to me: seeing as many others have had the same issue. before this massive bug i highly recomended the game, but seeing as how it is currently unplayable i would advise caution, until the next update comes out.  this being said i am looking forward to the next update and hope it fixes the majors crashes and bugs that have gone unfixed for so long.    i still have lots of hope for this game and what it has to offer, it just needs some fine tunning and overhalls to make it work for everyones systems. although until the Devs fix the bugs or update the game it is not worth $15.99.  this video shows what happens to many people on the load up screen. this is not my video but one i found on youtube while trying to fix my game.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELeR-69384
Date 2018-02-07 Playtime 5h 1m Rec Positive Игра нормальная. Играл с другом в мультиплеере несколько раз пугал а так для смеха отлично)))
Date 2018-02-07 Playtime 20h 11m Rec Positive Рекомендую!
Date 2018-02-07 Playtime 2h 12m Rec Negative Honestly this game is terrible. It was fun for the first hour but after that it lost all its charm.
Date 2018-02-07 Playtime 2h 18m Rec Negative I feel honestly robbed for having purchased this for me and two of my friends, it has incredibly limited replayability value, it's quite buggy and for some reason my audio keeps cutting out.
Date 2018-02-06 Playtime 5h 23m Rec Negative 빅풋이. 없음
Date 2018-02-05 Playtime 8h 8m Rec Positive This game is so funny. Enjoyed the time with my friend it was to short but the feeling was amazing. Thumbs Up for BIGFOOT :D After some hours I still like it
Date 2018-02-05 Playtime 33h 26m Rec Positive This message is targeted towards the develpers in a kind way.  I purchased this game a while back and i'm inpressed with it, and excited to see where the new update takes it. But there's one issue that MUST be addressed, not only for Myself, but for other players as well. After playing the game for a few days I had recommended it to a friend, who at the time had a different computer that could barely run the game. He ended up getting a newer computer and now when he loads into the game, selects a co-op game, or goes into single player, the game acts like its going to load, and then the loading icon stops scrolling, then it crashes. He has tried re-installing the game, restarting the computer and tried looking online for a fix. My friend told Me that he found a page that said it had something to do with the shaders and the Unreal 4 engine. I've looked all over the place for a fix/ what the problem is and haven't found a single thing. This isn't the first time anybodys had this problem either, there's TONS of other complaints about people having this problem, videos showng the exact same problem my friend is dealing with, forms with people having the same problem...the list goes on. I would really like to see this be the FIRST problem, as well as any other bugs being adressed  with the new update, not only so my friend and I can enjoy a good co-op game, as well as the hundreds of other players  anxiously waiting to be able to play again.  Here is a link to a video that shows exactly was other players are dealing with.  DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT MY VIDEO! I found it on Youtube while attempting to look for a fix.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELeR-69384
Date 2018-02-05 Playtime 5h 19m Rec Positive Very fun game with a nice concept, I think the only downfall is the hands of your player but that's just being picky, the game looks great and it delivers exactly what it says,atmospheric and intense enough to have a good time! TRY IT OUT
Date 2018-02-05 Playtime 5h 54m Rec Positive i love this game becase i love hunting mosters they should add lots more mosters  After several years the game has had a big update that has almost changed the whole game but not changing the core game which has made it a lot better

From what the doctors discovered in your dreams you believe that I am some sort of fictional hero in an animated movie but I am actually your husband. Please baby, wake up.

Date 2018-02-03 Playtime 37h 23m Rec Positive Yeah its a pretty good and challenging game. Its pretty spooky chasing bigfoot and all. It will get old after a while but I think the new upcoming update will fix that
Date 2018-02-03 Playtime 2h 25m Rec Negative nothing works i can click menus and drop downs but after that it does nothing . I wont let me exit, it worked this morning but now it does not and rebooted, re downloaded everything and still NOTHING I want my money BACK!!!
Date 2018-02-03 Playtime 20h 1m Rec Positive Эта игра похожа очень на игру RAKE и по сравнению с рейком она небо и земля лучше графон, меньше багов, больше фич и т.д если эту игру оценивать, то я бы поставил 6.5 из 10 Почему? потому что в игре есть баги и деревяность гемплея но в это интересно играть не плохая атмосфера и графон с локациями я её вам рекомендую пройти с друзьями моё мнение вы услышали оценка 6.5 из 10  "12 из 10"
Date 2018-02-02 Playtime 31h 34m Rec Positive Hi Guys,   Love the game it's brilliant, very addictive and very well done. Having seen the proposed updates for the new game I would say I think you have most thing's covered that I would like to have seen in the original so the next update should be a blast!  Thanks again for all your hard work in making this one of the most exciting,addictive,intense,realistic and authentic games that I have ever played ;-)  I would recomend this game highly!!!  Many Thanks,  Benjani8726  
Date 2018-02-01 Playtime 55h 29m Rec Positive После обновления 4.0 графику значительно улучшили, добавили много всяких интересных штук, НО есть одно большое единственное но, которое портит впечатление. В ранних версиях игры бигфут воспринимался как какое то действительно мифическое существо, можно было минут 10 бродить по жуткому лесу расставляя камеры, смотреть их в фургоне и наконец находить бигфута. Что случилось после обновления? Теперь вы будете радоваться каждой секунде без бигфута, он найдет вас везде, он найдет вас и будет месить об землю со всей силы каждые несколько минут, в конце концов у вас просто кончатся аптечки и/или патроны.  Надеемся, что разработчики в скором времени доведут игру до ума, верните адекватного бигфута :(
Date 2018-02-01 Playtime 17h 45m Rec Positive this game is a brilliant open world horror survival 10/10 would shoot bigfoot in the arse again

Date 2018-01-28 Playtime 0h 54m Rec Negative Kucok говнa eбучeго Я решил в общем накормить своего друга ложкой говна на его др, ну и купил ему эту игру, и, соответственно, себе тоже. Ну сначала всё было не так уж и плохо, мы родились в небольшом трейлере в котором было всё необходимое для того, чтобы выдрать все волосы из жопы бигфута и тд. Ну значит взяли мы всё это и пошли на охоту. Звук в игре у меня был выставлен процентов на 10, не больше, и тут как EБАНЕТ!!!! Сyка молния в дерево ударяет с такой громкостью, что я чуть не умер от страха, срать разрабы хотели на ваши настройки громкости, если бы у меня были какие-либо болезни с сердцем я бы давно откинулся. Ну минут 10 мы бегали в поисках дохлых онимэшников и охотн.вышек, набрали аммуниции, расставили камеры, капканы (на которые бабуину по.xy.ю) и тд, и потом пошли ночью в трейлер обратно. Ну вот сидим мы значит, обсуждаем творчество 1GOG'a и тут волосатая рука как залезет в окно и как даст в щи, ну мы быстро приняли решение и начали кормить его патронами, прямо в рот ему. Выстрелили в жопу ему из датчика и бежали за ним. На самом деле дальше весь интерес заканчивается, вы просто бегаете по лесу и расстреливаете несчастного кингконга, что сделать достаточно просто, благодаря датчику вы видите его на карте и бегаете за ним, что не является сложной задачей. Ну завалили мы мохнатую задницу и связяли его, а дальше начинается какой-то бред, вы просто тащите его на тачанке до своего трейлера и садите в клетку, на этом весь этот понос заканчивается. -------------------------------------- В общем оценка игре 1/10 (1 за возможность выбрать OZON671GAMES в качестве игрового персонажа), а так это полный кусок rовна. Завалили и выследили бигфута мы за 40 минут и потом спокойно вернули деньги за эту блевотину. Советую поступить аналогичным образом. И еще, ЭТ0 стоит 349 рублей, сyка, на самом деле цена этой игре рублей 20-30, разрабы в край оxyели, все равно что demix продавать по цене GUCCI. Короче не покупайте эту хyйню, либо купите, убейте мохнатого и верните деньги, не поддерживайте разрабов этой игры, они сами говноеды и игра их полное говно _____________________________ ░░░░░░░░░░░█▀▀░░█░░░░░░ ░░░░░░▄▀▀▀▀░░░░░█▄▄░░░░ ░░░░░░█░█░░░░░░░░░░▐░░░ ░░░░░░▐▐░░░░░░░░░▄░▐░░░ ░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░▄▀▀░▐░░░ ░░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░▐░▄▄▀░░░░ ░░▄▀░░░▐░░░░░█▄▀░▐░░░░░ ░░█░░░▐░░░░░░░░▄░█░░░░░ ░░░█▄░░▀▄░░░░▄▀▐░█░░░░░ ░░░█▐▀▀▀░▀▀▀▀░░▐░█░░░░░ ░░▐█▐▄░░▀░░░░░░▐░█▄▄░░░ ░░░▀▀░░░▀░░░░░░▐▄▄▄▀░░░ ░░░░░░░░▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ ░░░░▄ BIGFOOT▄░░░░░░░░░░ ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Date 2018-01-28 Playtime 9h 31m Rec Negative So its a fun game and all but there isnt enough ammo to play with 2 people together online and the ending isnt as cool as you would hope. Game needs lots of work still needs a lot added to it. and honestly its not worth the $15.99. Also you should be able to save and come back in with all the stuff you had previosly.

Date 2018-01-20 Playtime 43h 27m Rec Positive Get your nearest friend and get out his credit card to get the game and spend countless hours just to get some ape in the age. It is greatly fun to play.

Date 2018-01-18 Playtime 6h 13m Rec Positive Cool Horror
Date 2018-01-17 Playtime 1h 12m Rec Negative I cannot recommend this game until they implement some way to communicate with other people.
Date 2018-01-17 Playtime 2h 22m Rec Positive ok heres the deal. Ive seen gameplay,it LOOKS REALLY FUN but, stupid glitch is preventing me from playing,when i enter a new game,it just completely doesnt load,idk if anyone else has this bug,but it sucks Anyone know a way to fix this?
Date 2018-01-17 Playtime 48h 22m Rec Negative Beware. It is fun in the first hours but ends up collecting dust shortly after because it is far too simple and the novelty of seeing Bigfoot wears off. As of this moment it is an abandon ware cash grab. Wait until the long promised update before you buy.
Date 2018-01-17 Playtime 3h 11m Rec Positive After we downed bigfoot and put him on the sled, my friend jumps on top. Suddenly, he's launched into the trees while bigfoot does a fuckin' 180 and lands face down. Two hours later we managed to drag bigfoots broken dong a mere 100ft to the truck, 11/10.
Date 2018-01-17 Playtime 54h 20m Rec Positive this is a great game is so fun the graphics are decent there not COD level but its ok it is a very creative game the only bad part is the mouse sensitivity there is no control for that also its really high i would recomend this for pretty much every one 4.5/5 stars

Date 2018-01-15 Playtime 2h 6m Rec Positive Tämä peli on erittäin hyvä jos luokkalaisesi jahtaa sinua kuuhun ja puuhun. Jo sei jahtaa niin osta silti hyvä peli
Date 2018-01-15 Playtime 32h 11m Rec Positive @Developers This game is very fun but it needs to be 4 player or more 3 is a ver low and inconsistant number and the game would be alot more fun
Date 2018-01-15 Playtime 8h 43m Rec Positive the game is fun but it would be a lot better as a 4 player game
Date 2018-01-15 Playtime 36h 36m Rec Positive make 4 player i will kill all the white people in the world.
Date 2018-01-14 Playtime 38h 56m Rec Positive pretty good
Date 2018-01-13 Playtime 23h 44m Rec Positive Don't get this unless you have 1-2 other people to play with, still a great game, but takes forever to update
Date 2018-01-11 Playtime 1h 25m Rec Positive After wetting my pants like the pussy I am I refunded this game. But before I did that I played it a bit and honestly its not too shabby! A lot of people don't like it because of how simple the game is...... well that's the point. Theres not much to it besides laying traps, exploring, getting the shit scared outta you, and watching cameras. But if you play with even just one other person than this game can be a ton of fun!
Date 2018-01-11 Playtime 25h 17m Rec Negative It would be better off for free.
Date 2018-01-11 Playtime 19h 33m Rec Positive its a good cool game but we need more bug fixes and we need less lag my pc is a very strong gaming pc and bigfoot goes all laggy pls fix if the devs are reading this

Date 2018-01-09 Playtime 2h 20m Rec Positive This game is like $5. It's a cash grab but getting beaten by a forest monster is always pretty fun. Get it with a friend if you intend to buy it. Not bad. Maybe a 7?
Date 2018-01-09 Playtime 0h 57m Rec Positive BRUH I PLAYED 7 MINUTES OF THIS GAME NO LIE AND ALL BIGFOOTS SCART HAIRY ASS HAD TO DO WAS MAKE AN NOISE AND I RAN MY BITCH ASS BACK INTO MY CAMPER AND QUITE THE GAME SO I DONT HAVE TO PLAY IT AT NIGHT. 10/10 tho

Date 2018-01-04 Playtime 10h 53m Rec Positive Pretty fun to play with friends and catch bigfoot, it'll take time teamwork, and exploration. If you have fun best friends you're unlikely to do it quickly : P.
Date 2018-01-03 Playtime 4h 58m Rec Negative I had so much fun streaming this game with friends. I would say for a single playthrough this game is great.   But im giving it a negative review because the Dev's are basically stringing their community a long with broken promises and screenshots that are months old most likely.   I cannot support a "company" that does this to their fans.
Date 2018-01-03 Playtime 0h 16m Rec Positive 就是 模式 地图少了一点喜欢放开世界的
Date 2018-01-02 Playtime 16h 8m Rec Positive I absolutely adore this game.  Although I'm PRAYING that the developers do infact continue to update the game, regardless of how long they take, I would happily replay it over and over. I record gameplay and Bigfoot is a perfect game to really experiment with additions of atmospheric sounds, and different sorts of production to the gameplay. Like creating your very own low budget Predator like movie,  
Date 2018-01-02 Playtime 28h 51m Rec Positive После обновы все конкретно поменялось, деревья не падают, грозы нет, графон стал поприятнее и вся игра не такой деревянной, в принципе неплохо, можно хорошенько обосраца с вылетающей на тебя из снега и темноты лохматой туши огромного павиана и у*бать дрон об дерево так чтобы он больше не работал, но карта еще немного пустовата и сыровата. 8 гавкающих зайцев из 10

Date 2018-01-01 Playtime 18h 59m Rec Positive Very enjoyable with friends, we just camped up in the tower until bigfoot ran up the stairs and beat the crap out of us. But there is NO respawn, so ifyou die, you are dead.
Date 2018-01-01 Playtime 6h 21m Rec Negative Will not start. It's not because of my pc, i met the requirements for the game.
Date 2017-12-31 Playtime 13h 57m Rec Positive Can be a bit slow but a great game nonetheless.
Date 2017-12-31 Playtime 9h 56m Rec Positive This game was a life changing experience. The night we played this game was the night  the tWO gAY bOIS was created. In the three hours we battled bigfoot in the forest was the night  the masterpiece of videos was created. The game was amazing so go check  out the tWO gAY bOIS on YouTube!   
Date 2017-12-30 Playtime 20h 24m Rec Positive After you beat the Bigfoot, there is really nothing else to do...I know there is an update coming soon...but its been delyed so many times now...Im starting to lose hope. right now... i would give this game a mixed review...(But im giving it a recommended anyways)
Date 2017-12-30 Playtime 20h 37m Rec Positive honestly probably the best horror game i've played. sure i have'nt played alot of horror games but we need more games in gerneral like this. 10/10 for sure.

Date 2017-12-28 Playtime 25h 55m Rec Positive I was going to buy this game with my steam card that I got for christmas but my friend was too eager for me to get it so he bought it for me. After playing 30 minutes of this masterpiece, I came to a realization that it would be a crime to refund such a game. I am well aware that the game was not made for prophit anyway and I want it to stay alive. I was given an intense nightmare the same night that I first played the game and it felt awesome. Both thumbs up.                 I am Spherical_Cheese and I approve of this game.  
Date 2017-12-28 Playtime 0h 54m Rec Positive Walk around for an hour... roleplayed, deer ran from me into my trap >:D rip bambi
Date 2017-12-27 Playtime 11h 38m Rec Positive its a very fun game i just hope they add a save feature in the future and more things to do
Date 2017-12-27 Playtime 5h 14m Rec Positive Its really great to see small devs putting a lot of work in a small title like this.  i came back to see what has changed and was impressed by the new map and lots of other small details. Me and a friend hat a lot of fun hunting and running away from bigfoot for a few hours. Ofc there is still room for improvement, lots of room! But as i said, to see devs putting so much energy into this is great. Can recommend.
Date 2017-12-27 Playtime 7h 39m Rec Positive Very nice game worth the money and is pretty fun to play. I reccomend it because of the quaity of the graphics and the AI, so if you are lokking to get this game it's worth it.
Date 2017-12-26 Playtime 3h 26m Rec Positive I quite like Bigfoot i like the concept of the game, but is alittle expensive for what you're getting.
Date 2017-12-26 Playtime 1h 49m Rec Negative dont support this game and waste your money! developers dont care about update anything in this game. since nearly a year this game doesnt get any update and doesnt even have a save function wich make no much fun to play this game. on the other side are the developers that are posting tons of new content like drones, snow world, new weapons and so on... and NOTHING of what the developers promise in there posts was released yet!! this game is much to expensive for that minimal kind of gameplay stuff and very low support! why the developers post more and more possible content instead of finish and release one thing - as important easy things like save-button! THIS UPDATE-NEWS PAGE IS A HOLE LIE!!!
Date 2017-12-26 Playtime 5h 51m Rec Negative this gameccrashes too much 
Date 2017-12-25 Playtime 29h 21m Rec Positive This game is great. I love how you incorporated tree knocks which in turn allows us to determine Bigfoot's exact location. A couple of weapons that I would love to see in the game are a Franchi SPAS 12 shotgun and a Winchester Model 1892 rifle. Also, I hope the Yeti for the Winter National park map will be more aggressive than Bigfoot. Because the Yeti will literally attack anything that moves, and he does not like visitors. In fact, legend has it that anyone who ventures into the Yeti's territory never lived long enough to leave and tell the tale. I also have an idea for a new game that maybe the developers could create. A game that is very similar to this one, but instead of Bigfoot, the players are going after a variety of other kinds of monsters such as vampires, the Wendigo, and even a werewolf
Date 2017-12-25 Playtime 5h 38m Rec Positive very good needs minor inprovements and bug fixes and bigfoot needs to be a little less strong and add more ammo theres not enough for three players barely enough for 2 besides that the best game ive played so far on my pc  
Date 2017-12-24 Playtime 16h 56m Rec Positive We want that update
Date 2017-12-24 Playtime 133h 41m Rec Positive Hunting simulator with the objective set to hunt and catch the elusive sasquatch. Allows for up to 3 people multiplayer in its current state. Recommend checking the controls section of the menus to at least learn how to check the map.  Edit: August 1, 2018...  The 2.0 Update just got released and it made the animals and bigfoot more elusive, which is realistic in my opinion. They added a whole bunch of cool new features like the drone, the ability to harvest meat from animals you've killed to use as bait, and saving and loading your progress. They also removed the original map you used to play on altogether instead of upgrading it. (Though I imagine if an upgraded version would've delayed the update by a few more months.) Also the game will glitch if you try to join a co-op game when it's not in the lobby and you won't be able to do anything. But this is mostly an okay update.
Date 2017-12-24 Playtime 15h 15m Rec Positive I love the suspense and sound affects of the hunt. I highly recommend this game. I like the challenge of limited supplies. I would suggest the ability to zoom out on the map as an improvement; also, a compass would be nice to have as well.
Date 2017-12-24 Playtime 50h 1m Rec Positive well you know you can always write a review on some big game life WoW or Lego Universe. but bigfoot is another story. this game is awesome and i play it weekly. 'tis neat. why do homework or study when you can find dead people murdered by bigfoot and find bigfoot himself. incredible.

Date 2017-12-18 Playtime 4h 26m Rec Negative I mean its quite scary at times...Not enough content for its price and has been in EA for quite some time now too.  Definitely regret buying this and giving the devs money, to be honest it really is NOT worth it's price. Pretty rubbish game.  Find something else to buy as this is NOT what you want.
Date 2017-12-16 Playtime 1h 43m Rec Positive Really cool concept and well executed. There are some minor bugs I have encountered but for the most part this game is quite the sp00kfest especially with a friend.

Date 2017-12-16 Playtime 9h 14m Rec Positive sdcfsdfsdf
Date 2017-12-16 Playtime 52h 12m Rec Negative Years ago, I reviewed this game and gave it a positive rating, but years down the line, with minimal changes to the game and overall not a whole lot of difference from its original early access build I felt like I needed to edit my response.  tl;dr: Bigfoot OP pls nerf  The game CAN be scary sometimes, and I understand that it's being developed by a very small team. To give them credit, they've done solid work for the game. With this review I'm not trying to be toxic or downplay the dev's work, this is just how I see things. I'm also aware of my exceedingly large hours, but that's due to everything I'm talking about below.  Bigfoot is extremely scarce. I understand he's an elusive creature, but when your encounters with him are so minimalistic it's just very time consuming and frustrating. Furthermore, his health bar is huge and he hits like a truck. You can have about two encounters with him before needing to heal. The healing system is incredibly unbalanced as well, as there aren't many health packs around the map and even if you can find one, you need to find a notable location such as a cave or a tower, let me tell you, there aren't many. If you have four players, then your health is basically gonna be teetering between half and semi-full until you just can't heal anymore. It also doesn't help that you can encounter wolves and bears which can cut your health down even more.  The map is huge, which only aids Bigfoot's elusiveness and lack of items for the player. You can shoot him with a tracking dart, but that only lasts for so long and ultimately feels like a wild goose chase rather than a tactical "track him down" sort of thing.  I'm not sure if this is still the same as it used to be, but I'll include it in here anyways, take it with a grain of salt. To actually trigger Bigfoot's aggression, you've gotta set a trap and bait it, he will only start attacking you if he has stepped in the trap, which can sometimes take a while and can be incredibly frustrating. Not to mention your bait is limited unless you kill wild animals, and from what I remember Bigfoot can actually break your traps rendering them useless. The traps are a major part in taking Bigfoot's health down but honestly they do such little damage to him in the long run that you'll still be playing for a long time with little no events occurring.  The movement is extremely... static, if that makes sense? It doesn't feel fluent or natural. For the grand scale of the map it feels incredible tedious as well. This is probably a game that you'll enjoy if you're in for a good scare for an hour or two, but if you're here to complete it then you've gotta dedicate some serious hours into it. You can save progress which is a very good feature.  For what it's worth, they've nailed the atmosphere of hunting down Bigfoot and the scenery really is beautiful. There are definitely pros to this game that I haven't mentioned.  However, despite the few highlights that I HAVE mentioned, in my opinion it simply cannot disregard the numerous amount of cons this game has, which is why It's just not something that I can recommend under the current circumstances.  In conclusion, the game is an extremely time consuming experience that really doesn't feel worth it. You'd think killing Bigfoot would give you a sense of pleasure and accomplishment, but all it really does is make you glad that it's over. The game has been in early access for a long time and I can't see it picking up speed any time soon.  I think one of the main problems is that the expectation for the game skyrocketed after various YouTubers made videos on it, which of course is only going to breed popularity and excitement around it. That's an overwhelming amount of pressure for a few indie devs to live up to, especially since so much was expected out of this game. I hope the devs continue to work on games and I wish them luck for the future, there is a lot of potential here but I feel like this game has just fallen short of any conceivable thought of giving it a positive rating.
Date 2017-12-15 Playtime 4h 59m Rec Positive THIS GAME IS GOOD
Date 2017-12-15 Playtime 0h 5m Rec Positive Great horror game, think it's good the way it is, and almost gave me a heart attack the first 4 minutes of gameplay.
Date 2017-12-14 Playtime 3h 59m Rec Negative The main problem I have with the game is that you can't use Steam chat while playing the game, at least for my friends and myself we're unable to speak to each other over steam chat, other than that most of the reviews are true, It's scary for an hour then the only thing that scares you is the random and incredibly loud lightning strikes which does get a few jump scares in the beginning but eventually gets irritating. I hope they fix the chat problem eventually, but it will probably take the same amount of time to fix that as they have taken with putting out the Glacier Bay area
Date 2017-12-13 Playtime 30h 51m Rec Positive Good fun game but the new map and drones are taking forever to come out.

The new map update is coming soon, so I am excited for that. Might get boring after a bit of gameplay. 2 hours should be enjoyable but once it's not as scary (Like you get a tracker into the bigfoot) it loses its "fun mojo".

Date 2017-12-11 Playtime 4h 25m Rec Positive Играли с другом.  Поставили все камеры. Залетели домой-смотреть, что они снимают. В итоге просрали момент, когда он накрыл нас на хате. 11 сгоревших стульев из 10
Date 2017-12-11 Playtime 7h 33m Rec Positive I recieved this as a gift and let me tell you, I haven't laughed so hard from a game in years, I had so much fun. Especially when Bigfoot glitched and got stuck on a log and my friend and I went gangster on his hairy ass.  This game has a lot of potential and I REALLY want to see this game thrive. So as an artist and avid horror fan, I really want to write a contrustive critique on this and I hope the devs will get something out of this.  As of right now, this teeny tiny little game is like a sprout that needs a lot of growing before it becomes something unique. I honestly don't think it has enough content to carry itself, and DEFINITELY doesn't have enough content to carry solo play, and it needs a lot more than just "improved graphics."  The story has a promising start, but there isn't enough of it to carry itself and raises a lot of questions.  Why did the police give up so fast, despite the bodies being so easy to find?  (Maybe they knew about Bigfoot and covered it up)  Is our main characters even looking for these bodies in the first place? Why? From my impression they were looking for Bigfoot only, but the posters in the camper hint that they want to find the bodies as well.  (Maybe they found out about the police covering up this accident somehow, and they wanted to see if it had something to do with Bigfoot)  I noticed Bigfoot might have something to do with aliens, BUILD ON THIS!! This right here was really what intrigued me about the story. It doesn't need little green men in the game, but it is a great explanation for "paranormal" things happening. Think about how far you can push "unexplainable" things happening (without making it too obvious)  As for the horror aspect.  It's got a nice creepy vibe to it, but right now its only got the cliche horror things that probably have been inspired by other games. Keep asking yourselves how you can make this more creepy? Well, the simple answer is unpredictability and inconsistency. Right now, everything is a bit too predictable and consistent.   For example, lets start with the bodies. I love the creepy sound that plays when a body is discovered, but I don't think it's being used the correct way. Only one time did I ever SEE a body first, and THEN hear the sound. When that sound came up, my friends and I would go "Oh! Body near by somewhere!" So the sound became more of a cue (I definitely don't think that was it's purpose though)   As a fix, I suggest the sound to play only after the camera LOOKS at the body, and to add to that creepiness, I think it would be fun if the camera stayed locked on it for a second or two. (a bit like a gruesome sight that you can't seem to look away from) Any players nearby, maybe the game forces them to look at the body as well for a couple of seconds. Finding a corpse would be unsettling for anyone, so think about how to show it in the most unsettling way.  The bodies right now just feel like objects that the player stumbles upon in the forest. Why keep the bodies all in the same pose and only on the ground?  Why not randomize them, make them harder to find, maybe they are in a tree, or stuffed between huge rocks, in one of those houses or something? Maybe Bigfoot hid the bodies and the player finds clues to hint at where they are? If you really want to go the extra mile, maybe one of the lost tourests kept a diary and wrote about strange things happening while they were camping. Maybe they even called the police or forest rangers for help and the authorities told them they were on their own.   The cameras, the cameras are such a great idea and you can do so much with this!! Now, when my friend and I returned to the camper, one of the cameras showed a figure that looked an awful lot like one of the players standing in front of it and I honestly couldn't tell if it was a glitch or not which amused me greatly. If it wasn't intended to be a glitch, I think making the figure move around and maybe even examining the camera would really show that something weird was going on out there. As I mentioned before, if aliens are going to be a factor in this, you can push the weirdness that happens with the cameras. Have more than just figures stand in front of them, maybe animals come to check out the cameras and weird stuff happens to the animals. Maybe the cameras inform the camper's computer when it picks up movement, so you can really take advantage of drawing in the player's attention to show something creepy.  I've read in one of the recent updates that you might add aggresive animals. Be ready to answer the question of why animals are being aggressive and not "because it makes the game more difficult". To be honest, I didn't really think it needed aggresive animals, since realistically if I went out into the forest like that, I probably wouldn't of run into aggresive animals. However maybe aliens/paranormal factors could make them aggressive. Maybe these animals have some crazed look about them, and even better, what if they were branded and possibly have evidence that aliens messed around with them, kinda like what may have happened to bigfoot?  I hope this really encourages some creative thinking, especially about this game's lore and story and I am definitely staying tuned to watch this game develop.

Date 2017-12-05 Playtime 1h 18m Rec Negative i dont recommend this game cause u cant even play it without it crashing and it wont even load a new game  it juss stops and freezes so dont waste your money on this piece of crap. the only reason it is a peice of crap is when i bought it last night i wanted to play it not have to deal with it crashing and not loading my game. if u got to actually play the game then i would reccomend the game. tho dont buy it cause it isnt gonna let u play it untill the people that fix this type of stuff fixes it cause if u buy it. then it will be a waste of money cause u cant even be able to play  the game.

Date 2017-11-27 Playtime 48h 6m Rec Positive FINALLY A WAY TO CHANGE FOV
Date 2017-11-27 Playtime 56h 35m Rec Positive Fun game but falls short on any replay value (as of right now) just like any of the Slenderman games.  Single player is fun for the first 2 or 3 times but quickly loses its "scary" factor when after playing a few times, you find out how predictable Bigfoot is.  Bigfoot seems to always follow the same path, which makes setting up the cameras and traps really easy, even if Bigfoot only goes for the meat on a trap once but most of the time the elks end up being killed by the traps.  Encountering Bigfoot is scary at first but you quickly find out it's very easy to not take any damage from Bigfoot since shooting a flare at him will cause him to instantly run away and you again quickly find out Bigfoot only attacks you once before running away. Shooting a tracking bullet into Bigfoot over a few games and watching his movements will show you how predictable he really is. On top of that you will find out when you do encounter Bigfoot, he isn't that dangerous since he will always attacks you from the same distance instead of waiting until you are right on top of him. This makes the encounters with Bigfoot lackluster since you can shot at him a few times before firing a flare at him causing him to run away or fire a flare at him then shoot him as he runs away. Keep repeating this and you won. Also don't bother looking for the 4 missing campers because if you find all 4 of their bodies, when you capture Bigfoot there is nothing special waiting for you at the end (as of now, which hopefully there will be in the future).  Multiplayer is were the game shines since it cuts your supplies in half if not more since everyone is trying to get and horde supplies for themselves.  My only advice to the developers is keep working on Bigfoot's AI and make him more unpredictable. Make the map(s) larger with more obstacles and make "finding" and capturing Bigfoot involve more strategy than just walking around until he charges you, attacks you once, then runs away.
Date 2017-11-27 Playtime 8h 18m Rec Positive Fun and scary game to play with friends. I recommend playing at 1 in the morning with your friends where every little jump scare makes it more enjoyable.

Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 21h 1m Rec Positive Bigfoot is an exhilarating multiplayer survival game where you and a group of players take on the role of hunters tracking down the elusive creature in the deep wilderness. Armed with various tools, you’ll explore dense forests, set traps, and gather evidence in an attempt to capture or kill Bigfoot. The game mixes survival mechanics with a thrilling hunt, as you must manage your resources and defend yourself from the beast’s attacks. The ever-present sense of dread and the dark atmosphere create a tense experience, especially as night falls and Bigfoot becomes more aggressive. If you enjoy co-op gameplay, hunting challenges, and a dose of horror, Bigfoot offers a thrilling chase in the great outdoors.

Date 2017-11-25 Playtime 3h 11m Rec Negative So I bought this game for my friends and I and so my friend sand I got into the game and so we were going to do a group expedtion.So he created the game I joined his game and it sent me to the loading screen.So it loaded for like 10 seconds and then stoped. Even though I could hear sounds of the game and my friend could see me in the game. It then went out of the game and went to crash report screen and I have sent many help request and nothing so far. I went to answer hub and no answer so far and the 0.8 hours of me playing was trying to figure out what was wrong with the game so I really hope they are able to fix this so im able to play the game because i bought it for two of my others and so it would be just a waist of money.

Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 7h 27m Rec Positive BIGFOOT delivers an exciting and immersive adventure into the realm of cryptozoology, fueled by the passion and dedication of CyberLight Game Studio. The game's atmospheric environments, intense encounters, and commitment to player feedback make it a captivating experience. While there is room for growth and improvement, particularly in the AI and world design, the foundation laid by the developers creates a solid framework for future updates and expansions. BIGFOOT is a thrilling journey that leaves players hungry for more encounters with the legendary creature.

Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 20h 1m Rec Positive For online its fun however, to make online games you need to put a password even if you want it public so you have to name your game what the password is. Bigfoot has to much hp , is to fast and the guns do little damage. there are barely enough supplies for 2 people even though online mode allows 3 max people. The game is fun but untill better updates i dont know if its worth 15$ maby 10 to 12 but hey thats just my thought. there are a few other problems but thats to be expected since this is a early release itll get better later on.

Date 2017-11-12 Playtime 9h 57m Rec Negative C'est un jeu en accès anticipé... Le principe semble chouette. Vous etes dans les bois, à la recherche du bigfoot avec une arme et une torche. Le jeu pourrait être stressant, et intéressant.  Malheureusement dans l'état actuel, on passe de longs quarts-d'heure à la recherche de quelque chose... Par chance je l'ai croisé ! Il a l'air un peu simplet : vous lui tirez dessus, il approche et vous frappe. Vous rechargez, il s'enfuit ... A se demander comment il a pu rester cacher et survivre autant de siècles ;)  Vous pouvez placer un piege, je ne sais pas si il sert ? Et aussi de la viande... qui attire.. personne  a première vue ? Des cameras... qui vous permettront de passer des heures à surveiller les feuilles bouger !  [ SPOILER le plus important du jeu ] Son sang est vert xD  Il y a un mode multi qui pourrait etre bien. Sauf qu'on s'ennuie très très vite. On ne sait pas ou sont nos amis... Si on est a plus de 50/100m ou derrière un rocher, on les perd... dans les bois... la nuit :p  Bref, dans l'état actuel, je vous dirais de ne pas l'acheter, sauf si il est à <5€. J'espère que les DEVS s'occuperont de ce jeu et l'amélioreront... car il a du bon potentiel !

Date 2017-11-06 Playtime 3h 23m Rec Negative Знаете, поймать бигфута легко, а вот тащить его по мосту...... В игре до**я багов хоть и бета и оч не понравилось его тащить, ибо умер пока тащил его.
Date 2017-11-06 Playtime 1h 12m Rec Negative Pretty disappointed in Steam that they are now Greenlighting these 'games' where the developers can't even be bothered to spell the text in english properly. The in-game text reads like someone google translated something from another language, and then didn't take any further steps to find out if it was correct or not. On quitting the message "Do you want to quit? Yas / No is an unacceptably low level of quality for submission of even a 'Beta' product in my opinion. Not since Big Rigs have I seen such laughably poor language implementation. However, this is not the least of the problems of the (university tech demo),sorry,"game". Let's list all the others. 1) You can't turn off the ghastly motion sickness blur effect. 2) The main shotgun and the hand that hold it look ridiculous. 3) The collision is rubbish. You clip through most of the rocks on the outer edge of the map 4) Everything feels like the standard assets that come with UE4. I'm not familiar with that engine, but i`m certain it comes with trees and grass. 5) There is only one map to play on. 6) THERE IS ONLY ONE MAP TO PLAY ON. 7) Assuming you can tolerate the boredom of waiting for the single enemy in the game to arrive to your location, and manage to defeat him using your vast array of 2 different weapons, there is literally nothing else to do in the game. 8) There's no jump sound effect, or landing for that matter. 9) There's no map in the game.
Date 2017-11-05 Playtime 152h 47m Rec Positive This game has unparallelled potential. Even now in Beta, no other game in my opinion has this muh suspense and excitement. Scenery is breathtaking. I wish a company would pick this game up and run with it. Let's add maps, let's add dimension. Totally worth it. No session is 100% the same. I would totally recommend this game. Change of underwear is highly suggested. "Wait... What was that?! Ahh!"

Date 2017-11-02 Playtime 1h 33m Rec Negative Finding Big Foot – кооперативная бродилка, с выслеживанием и постоянными набегами большого и мохнатого существа.   Мы с братом решили сыграть в эту игру, но, к сожалению, она оказалась слишком сырой. Нельзя присесть, подобрать оружие с мертвого игрока, мы никогда не выдыхаемся и т.д. После полутора часов нам надоело охотиться на Бигфута, ибо он редко приходит, а мы уже начинали бежать 3 круг по лесу. Вообще задумка хороша, это нас и сподвигло купить эту игру. Анимация игрока без оружия ужасна, хоть и понятно, что игра в BETA, но это даже не тянет на ALPHA. Модельки персонажей и оружия убогие, а так же хромает оптимизация.  Плюсы:  + Интересная задумка + Всё просто, не надо ни в чём разбираться  Минусы:  - Плохая оптимизация - Слишком мало экипировки и предметов для слежки за Бигфутом.  Пока что игру не рекомендую.  3/10
Date 2017-11-02 Playtime 1h 39m Rec Negative The Devs pretty much paid a couple big streamers to play this game when it was released so they could get some hype around a cool idea, but a complete shit-fest.  The game is trash, the devs promised updates and they obviously haven't kept those promises.  Don't buy this game for anything more than $2.99.  That's how bad it is.  Oh btw.  Release your game with more than one map next time, lmfao.
Date 2017-10-31 Playtime 10h 7m Rec Negative 	Здравствуйте, уважаемые. Что хочется сказать про игру, которую к настоящему времени уже практически все забыли? Много чего. Постараюсь по порядку.  	+ Идея игры. Она очень хороша, охотиться на бигфута в тёмном лесу с другом очень занимательно. Атмосфера, озвучка, всё это даёт должный результат. Очень понравилось, что разработчики добавили такой интересный функционал как отслеживающие дротики. Проку конечно с них не так много, поскольку метка на карте пропадает по моему мнению слишком быстро. Тем не менее, наблюдать за передвижением бигфута на карте определённо приятно, эдакий элемент охоты на зверя.  	- И всё было бы замечательно, если бы разработчики игру обновляли, но нет, так просто у них не получилось. Первым делом отмечу, что игра находится в раннем доступе до сих пор и разработчики нам много чего обещали. Напомню, было заявлено, что игра будет «активно дорабатываться и обновляться». На самом же деле, за всё время, что я владею игрой, мною не было замечено ни одного существенного обновления. Справедливости ради отмечу, что игру я всё ж таки заполучил не совсем сразу после её выхода в Steam. Возможно поначалу и были какие-то обновления... На волне хайпа так сказать.  	— Сколько? Сколько разрабы обещали нам нахождение игры в раннем доступе? Заходим на страницу игры и видим чёткое обещание — полгода. Игра выпущена в конце января 2017 года, на данный момент прошло уже 9 месяцев! Это уже больше, чем обещали. Уже потянуло запашком, вам так не кажется? Более того, с апреля как минимум не было ни единого обновления! Что делали разработчики всё это время? Обещали... Обещали обещать. Об этом далее.  	— Я отлично помню тот солнечный, замечательный майский или какой там день, когда разрабы бигфута выкатили в Steam очередное обещание, что вот мол, учимся мы денно и нощно, времени на разработку игры совсем не хватает. Но не печальтесь, гарни хлопцы, скоро наступит жаркое лето, а вместе с ним и каникулы, будем продвигать разработку игры.  	— Месяц пролетел незаметно, для меня уж точно, думаю и для разрабов аналогично. Наступило долгожданное лето — время, когда должны были быть выполнены обещания. Но нет. Вместо выполнения заявленного нам вывесили очередные обещания: всё будет, уж к концу лета то точно. Отлично, отмахнулись надолго, сразу на всё лето. И оно тоже быстро пролетело.  	— Казалось бы, уж за три то летних месяца можно успеть сделать хоть что-то. Да? Нет! Всё что нам предоставили разработчики — это видео на Youtube с летающим дроном. Да, дрон выглядит очень шикарно, но это всего лишь видео, в игре его нет! Было ещё видео с самим бигфутом, где демонстрировалась новая анимация того, как он будет рвать и метать игроков. На деле же, в самой игре, не появилось ни-че-го!  	— И вновь обещания, теперь уже расплывчатые, без чётких сроков. Что-то будет, когда-то. Вот вам ещё немного скриншотов животных, которые когда-нибудь возможно будут в игре. Вчера вышло очередное обещание. Теперь уже вместо скриншотов нас развлекают ажно gif-анимацией. Где обновления в самой игре? Реализуйте уже хотя бы 1% того, что вы всё это время показываете.  	— Хочется задать разработчикам следующие вопросы. Вам не кажется, что все ваши обещания стали похожи на попытку обмана игроков, купивших игру? Складывается впечатление, что всё это время вы занимались только клепанием видеороликов и скриншотов. Если вы действительно продолжаете заниматься разработкой игры, то неужели не очевидно, что вместо того, чтобы вывешивать скриншоты, видео и пустые обещания, гораздо лучше было бы хотя бы по чуть-чуть, но делать обновления. Пусть хоть мелочные, но всё же это было бы лучше, чем ничего, мы бы видели, что работа действительно идёт и вы нас не кинули.  	— В качестве завершения хочу вспомнить ещё один немаловажный нюанс. Разработчики несколько раз меняли название игры, не могли определиться какое лучше. Мой вердикт: правильное название игры БИГТУФТА.

Vaším úkolem je chytit bájného Bigfoota a nalézt mrtvoly lidí kteří takové štěstí neměly nebo s ním přišly do kontaktu. K dispozici máte trackovací pistoly , pušku, kamery , pasti a další vymoženosti které vám dávají aspoň trošku navrh než na vás Bigfoot v plné síle naběhne. Rozhodně tuhle hru doporučuji na vyzkoušení :)   GAMEPLAY ZE HRY :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDk0EWsDaBQ  + ATMOSFÉRA + ZPRACOVÁNÍ + SCARY SCÉNY + CO-OP MP  CELKOVÉ HODNOCENÍ : 90%

Date 2017-10-28 Playtime 19h 12m Rec Positive This is quite possibly the dopest game i have ever played in my entire life. I dont even know where to begin. It has bigfoot, which is like my favorite mythical being. It puts you smack dab into a fucking bigfoot battle royal. Not only will he beat the shit out of you in cold blood and run away after he does it for some odd reason, But then he will come back and beatup one of your close friends in Co op mode. Dont even get me started on the lightning strikes. Picture this with me for a second. There you are, peacefully setting up a digital camera. Then all of a sudden you get suprised with 700 dB's of pure unadulterated realistic lightning noises. In that moment not only have you deafened yourself, but you have become immersed in a world that reminds you that anything can happen. Its quite the rush let me tell you. I basically feel like every other company should stop making video games after this masterpiece. This truly sets a new industry standard for all survival games out there.   I give Cyberlight's triple AAA hit thriller video game, a 3/5.

The developers stopped communicating with the community and haven't updated this game in a looooooong time.  They mentioned a "delay" due to university studies - so, we can take that to mean we helped fund their education and now they feel no obligation to continue working on the game.  Seriously - just don't purchase this game.

Date 2017-10-16 Playtime 57h 24m Rec Positive ilke this game and sure i may be a little basic at first   but later it get intense and  with MULTIPLAYER it is  very fun and with a new update coming very soon it will be all the not recommed people will  be stunded
Date 2017-10-15 Playtime 0h 31m Rec Negative Идея хорошая, но разработчики жадность ваш порок. 350р когда The Forest стоит 349р и он еще с 21 версии был более играбельный, поугарать, порубить лес в коопе на 8х, пожарить аборигена. У вас в игре я провел 31 минуту ожидал реально что то близкое по графике, по факту модельки похоже взяли бесплатные, руки и оруже как картон, мышка ненастраиваеться и дико летает даже на низкой сенсе а крутить настройки в винде лень. Скудноватый набор вещей, был бы магазин для закупки возмоджность как то фармит деньги с мяса оленей, или фото бигфута, и тратить их на амуницию. На карте потерять союзника раз плюнуть, нужна отметка, 20 шагов и все хз где он. Требования пока высокие, если запилите "плотные" модели, добавите магазин подтянете графон и реально уложитесь в обещенное время я возмодно куплю игру но пока что расмотребы иные варианты тот же зелондарк.  Вообще действий очень мало в игре, в раннем доступе хотя бы цену сделали бы 150р, я бы просто купил независимо от результата. Удачи вам в ваших начинаниях.

Date 2017-10-12 Playtime 3h 27m Rec Positive I received this game as a gift from a friend. It's a fun game for the first play through with your friend. Completely boring when playing solo.  If the game were updated more often, and had good updates, this game would be fantastic. However, the devs are two college students who can't update this consistently. When it's on sale, and if you have friends who would play it with you, get it. If not, wait until it's updated more. The game gets really repetitive and not much changes throughout different playthroughs. Still fun though. I reccommend if it's on sale.
Date 2017-10-12 Playtime 2h 57m Rec Positive As once a real life researcher of BIGFOOT, scrounging through the Pacific Northwest just above Humboldt county on through Oregon to Washington state in search of the magic beast, this game captures that essence that I found past Nor Cal...   This game may not be for everyone, but its definitely for me and the avid woodsman/wanderer... And with up coming updates, I really recommend the game in short bursts even if the base game is lacking content, for some reason, I really enjoy just lingering with the atmosphere of the game, even with lacking content, I can just turn on the game and fall asleep with the realistic atmosphere on my big screen monitor, its just a relaxing concept for a game.
Date 2017-10-11 Playtime 24h 52m Rec Positive The New Update is INSANELY nice, Shoutout to the Publisher!!!  BUy Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt

Date 2017-10-10 Playtime 9h 17m Rec Positive this game is simple fun. nothing too complex. but at the same time that simplicity makes this game run out of replayabilty quick. so buy beware on that front. and that second map would add great playability if bigfoot acted different in the second map, maybe cus its the yeti/sasquanch instead of bigfoot.
Date 2017-10-09 Playtime 0h 46m Rec Negative Expected something good... For something that is Mostly Positive I'm dissapointed... Not to sure how people thought this game was good or fun. Graphics were good other then the weapons and stuff but it's very boring... Do not recommend this game to anyone. Take my advice and don't make the same mistake.

Date 2017-10-06 Playtime 1h 46m Rec Positive so dam fun get ittttttttttttt
Date 2017-10-05 Playtime 43h 24m Rec Negative Dieses Spiel ist in meinen Augen ein "Blender" und viele Leute bekommen das gar nicht mit oder ich frage mich, warum??? Das Spiel kam 2017 raus und es war am Anfang grossartig von der Gruselatmosphäre und sogar der Grafikstil hatte etwas für sich gehabt. Dazu gab es noch ein paar Bücher, die man über Bigfoot bei sich im Gepäck hatte und man etwas über das Wesen erfahren konnte. Sozusagen eine kleine Geschichte hinter dem Wesen. Auch die Musik war minimal eingesetzt und war sehr Mystisch und Gruselig. Bigfoot hatte den Spieler sogar aus der Ferne beobachtet und man hat nur einen Schattenumriss von dem Wesen gesehen und es stand einfach nur da und hat hat dich angestarrt, mega Gruselig und leider gibt es das so nicht mehr :(. Das Spiel war von Anfang an mehr Mystisch und Gruselig gewesen und hat sich im laufe der Jahre immer mehr zu  einer "Trashgranate" entwickelt.  Wir haben mittlerweile 2023 und was wir bis dahin bekommen haben ist nicht viel, sozusagen immer eine Wiederholung: -Neues Grafikupdate... -Ein Jahr später neues Grafikupdate....  -Wir bauen das komplette Spiel um, neues Hauptmenü, neue KI, vorhandene Maps wurden   wieder auf 1 reduziert, da das komplette Spiel ja umgebaut wurde und es wurde dadurch   wieder weniger. -Irgendwann gab es dann mal wieder die 2 Map, die sogenannte "Schneemap".   Hatten wir aber eigentlich schon in den vorherigen Versionen gehabt, egal, man freut sich auf eine Verbesserung.... -Ganz toll war, das dass Spiel dann minimal einen "Survivalaspekt" bekam, was bei einer Schneemap ja durchaus Sinn macht: So musste man sich dann ein Lagerfeuer errichten und kann sogar ein Zelt aufbauen, was echt cool war. -In den nächsten Updates, wurde dieses Feature wieder entfernt das Spiel wurde wieder reduziert. -Auch wurde das Feature entfernt, das man Bigfoot mit dem Seil gefangen nehmen konnte und zum Wohnwagen schleppte. Es ist bis heute nicht mehr vorhanden. (Ausser man spielt wieder die vorherigen Versionen von früher, aber ist ja kein Sinn und Zweck) -Mal wurde in den ganzen Updates sogar die Trackermunition ausgelassen, die es am Anfang des Spiels bereits gab und wurde irgendwann auch wieder eingefügt. -Die langweiligen Kameras ganz zu schweigen, hatten wir schon 2017 gehabt und haben sich nicht wirklich verändert. -Es wurden auch immer Bugs behoben, die in der vorherigen Version NICHT aufgetreten waren...  (Mir waren sie jedenfalls nicht aufgefallen) Das Spiel hat sich im laufe der Jahre nur sehr minimal entwickelt und rennt im Kreis, es wird ewig so bleiben. Die Entwickler lieben Grafikmodifikationen und Dekoration im Spiel, das sieht man. Aber Technisch, ist noch so viel Luft nach oben und wurde nicht grossartig verändert.  In den Anfangsversionen des Spiels, kam man sich noch wie ein richtiger Jäger vor, da man professionelle Waffen bei sich hatte:  Eine Pistole, Messer, Scharfschützengewehr mit Trackermunition, paar Kameras und Bärenfallen.  Am Ende, wenn man Bigfoot erlegt hatte, musste man ihn sogar Fesseln und zu seinem Käfig zum Wohnwagen bringen, wie bereits erwähnt. Das war richtiges Jagdfeeling.  Warum um alles in der Welt gibt es jetzt als "Jäger": Schlachtermesser, Baseballschläger, Schrotgewehr, Maschinengewehr, Eisenstange, Autobatterie, Dynamit etc.... habe ich noch einen Quatsch vergessen? Kann sein, achso, ich würde noch einen Raketenwerfer im Camp legen, damit man das Vieh in die Luft jagen kann, das wäre doch toll.....(Ironiemodus aus). Das hat doch nichts mehr mit einem Jäger zu tun Leute, ich bitte euch, habt Ihr ganz vergessen wie das Spiel am Anfang war?  Ist schon sehr Trashig, was man mittlerweile für Waffen gegen Bigfoot einsetzt. Die Hauptmenü Musik, ist auch durch mehr Action Musik ersetzt worden, vorher war die Musik sehr Mystisch und etwas Gruselig.   Und jetzt Leute...... Am 24.07.2023 ist es endlich soweit, ich kann das Spiel nicht mehr Spielen, da ich ab jetzt einen Epic Account eröffnen muss, um das Spiel zu Spielen :( Ein Spiel, das von Anfang an auf Steam erworben wurde, ist jetzt auf einmal ein Epic Spiel geworden. Achso: Und es wurde wieder ein Grafikupdate veröffentlicht aber keinesfalls mehr Spiel Inhalt :(  Dann wurde das Update wieder entfernt, weil sich viele Spieler beklagt haben, das aus einem Steam Spiel, ein Epic Spiel geworden ist, da man zum spielen, einen Epic Account eröffnen muss. Ich kann es nachvollziehen, da es mich das ebenfalls aufgeregt hat.  Dann wurde von ein paar Leuten schon vor Ewigkeiten gesagt (nur ein paar, nicht genug, da ich mir im stillen die Kommentare durchlese) das man das Spiel doch auch mal  erweitern soll, mit neuen Mechaniken, statt nur Grafik und neue Maps hinzufügen (ganz meiner Meinung). Darauf haben die Entwickler dann geantwortet und gesagt: Wir Arbeiten bereits an einer neuen Map ;(.  Merkt ihr was?  Ganz ehrlich: Euer ernst, wollt Ihr mich auf den Arm nehmen, merkt das Irgendwie keiner?  Die meisten Leute sind auch ziemlich verblendet von dem Spiel und es kommen dann so Aussagen wie:   Es arbeiten nur 2 Entwickler an dem Spiel, es ist Krieg in der Ukraine, das Spiel ist so perfekt wie es ist, man ist zu unverschämt was man sich vorstellt und man will ja viel zu viel etc... Also man darf keine Kritik üben an dem Spiel, sonst bekommt man solche Aussagen. Daran merkt man halt nur, das für die meisten Menschen nur Grafik wichtig ist und nicht mehr Gameplay ;(.  Also kann man sagen, dass ich von 2017-2023 kein Anspruch habe, auf mehr Spielinhalt oder Erweiterungen, für die ich Bezahlt habe? Achso, bevor wieder einer dieser Kommentare kommt, das ich keine Ahnung vom Spiel Entwickeln hätte dann sage ich: Die habe ich auch nicht , ich Heule nur aus Frust und ich bin unverschämt.  Danke für Eure Aufmerksamkeit und trotzdem wünsche ich dem Spiel für die Zukunft alles Gute   Ich bin raus.

Date 2017-10-03 Playtime 71h 33m Rec Positive Превосходная игра для того, чтобы скоротать ночь. Неплохая атмосфера вкупе с приемлемой графикой дополняются колоссальным количеством эмоций ,которые вы можете получить от её прохождения. Играть рекомендую в компании одного (можно и двух) человека, дабы полностью проникнуться процессом.  Краткий гайд по ловле Бигфута. Как только вы сделали дневной обход близлежащих территорий и расставили капканы и камеры, бегите в трейлер. Как только вы пришли в безопасное (нет) место, вы открываете дневник (G) и читаете данные вам записи вслух.  Важно! В первую ночь текст должен быть на украинском, а в последующую - на немецком , тогда вы надолго запомните эту и игру и полученные от неё впечатления.
Date 2017-10-03 Playtime 66h 16m Rec Positive Если вы хотите найти Бигфута, вам достаточно прочитать записки охотника (открываются нажатием "G") на украинском , а затем на немецком языках (строго соблюдая последовательность), и Бигфут сам вас найдёт.

Date 2017-07-27 Playtime 1h 6m Rec Negative Clearly a Rake knockoff with limited map and little game concept. You run from your trailer and put cameras in a forest only to be permakilled in a safe zone while your team is taunted and bludgened by a grey overgrown wookie with green eyes. Sound effects were clearly recorded from an AM radio with a tape recorder in mono then dubbed into the game.

Date 2017-07-27 Playtime 0h 23m Rec Positive BIGFOOT, так же Finding Bigfoot - хоррор на выживание, в котором нам предстоит устроить охоту на гипотетическое существо, Бигфута или по-другому Сасквоч.   Узнав из газет о пропаже туристов, мы уверены что это не несчастный случай, а что во всем этом виноват Бигфут. Игра начинается с того, что мы появляемся фургоне. Нам дается 8 камер, которые нужно расставить по периметру карты. Наблюдать за камерами можно в фургоне (после летнего обновления, это можно будет сделать с планшета). Так же дается мясо и капканы, мясо привлекает Бигфута, а капкан не много наносит дамаг. Есть ружье и патроны. Обычные патроны и патроны с датчиком, выстрелив в Бигфута, мы можем некоторое время за ним следить, открыв карту. Так же нам доступен сигнальный пистолет и ракеты, веревка для связывания Бигфута, камера ночного видения с батарейками. Ружье как и капканы, у бигфута снимает мало хп. Так что запасайтесь патронами. Когда Бигфут попадает в капкан, он издает громкий звук. Обращайте внимание на полоску хп, так как Бигфут может кричать просто так, не из-за капкана.  По мимо охоты на бигфута, у нас есть еще 2 задания, это связать бигфута, довезти его до фургона и посадить в клетку. И дополнительное задание, нужно найти 4 трупа.  Есть как одиночный режим, так и кооп на 3 человека.  Сюжета здесь нет.   Сейчас готовится обновление, которое выйдет в конце лета. Изменены модели и текстуры предметов, добавлен планшет, квадрокоптер, нож, так же новая зимняя карта.  Обзор составлен из моего мнения, если с чем то не согласны, то в комментариях пишите адекватно. У каждого свое мнение!

Date 2017-07-26 Playtime 0h 11m Rec Negative This game is rough. I've seen alpha's that were in better shape, but it is still playable.   Quick summary:  Has great graphics and a story line.  The goal is obvious, capture Bigfoot. English is very poorly written, but mostly understandable. Customization is not possible with regards to gameplay. You can't change or adjust the controls. Some of the sounds are very strange, but if you're not into great sound, it shouldn't bother you. I had no problem with frame rate. All settings are on max and it ran smoothly. Bigfoot can kill you through walls. Yes, really.  If you can get this on sale, it's acceptable. If you can't, wait until it's had a good coat of polish.  In it's current state, I can't recommend this game. I'd keep it on your watchlist for now. Hopefully, it will get better.
Date 2017-07-26 Playtime 49h 40m Rec Positive Thrilling, and adventures is how I describe Finding Bigfoot. I haven't caught the hairy creature yet, but the game is still a thrill to play. It's filled with horror, suspicion, along with a little comedy to it. I give Finding Bigfoot a 10/10, I enjoy and love the game very much and can't wait for the Glacier Bay National Park Yeti game that is soon to come.
Date 2017-07-26 Playtime 1h 2m Rec Negative Shoot bigfoot. Run after bigfoot. Shoot bigfoot.  Not worth your time unless you and your friends can make eachother laugh while shouting in the woods long enough for this game to become unrefundable.

Date 2017-07-25 Playtime 0h 56m Rec Positive Scariest game I've ever played. Bigfoot wasn't that scary, but the lightning that striked directly down on my head made me scream out loud and brown sweat trickle down my leg at 4.00am. If you like that kind of thing then this games for you.
Date 2017-07-25 Playtime 3h 47m Rec Positive Oyun basınında olduğumda bana ücretsiz keyler gönderden yapımcılara öncelikle teşekkürlerimi iletiyorum.  Oyun klasik bir Amerikan efsanesi olan kocaayak ile ilgilidir. Bir milli parkta kano yapmaya çıkan bir turist grubu kaybolur ve kocaayak gizemini çözmek için bizi çağırırlar. Bizde kameralar, yemler, tuzaklar, tüfeğimiz ve izlenilebilir kurşunlarımız ile kocaayağın peşinden gidiyoruz.  Oyun Ukrayna'lı bir ekip tarafından geliştirildi. İlk maceraları için tatmin edici, basit bir oyun olmuş. Umarım buradan gelicek gelir ile daha iyi projeler üzerinde çalışırlar.

Date 2017-07-17 Playtime 4h 8m Rec Negative **WARNING**: According to the "general" user-base for this game, this review may contain a few spoilers, (I can't seem to find them, and I wrote the damn thing). But be warned that it does speak about several key-points of the game.   Where do I even start here:   I wanted to like this game, I bought it for my girlfriend and I just to see how it was, and actually a 3rd friend bought it because he saw we were playing. So $45.00 worth in this game from guys on my network; here's what I've noticed / seen:  - Initially when I attempted to connect / host a server, I kept getting `No online sub system steam found` -- which was resolved by restarting my computer. A bunch of others received this error and have submitted in the discussions section of the game, and no developer has replied with a solution. So if you do get it, try completely closing steam and re-opening it OR restart your computer completely and re-sign into steam.  - Once I finally got in, it took two loads to actually get into a server we were hosting (I crashed twice, and my 3rd friend crashed once as well).   - After actually getting into the game, we noticed the game is NOT optimized. I run an R9 390X 8GB video card, and very poor frames, and sometimes huge spikes where I would freeze for a few seconds. Same thing happened to my girlfriend and my other friend.  [spoiler]The game itself as very anticlimactic. You pretty much hunt down Bigfoot, and continue to shoot him until he falls, and then you tie him up and drag him back to camp; and OH BOY, THAT part was FUN. [/spoiler]  I should add that we managed to kill him because he got STUCK in the river, under a tree that goes across the river. His body was underneath the tree, and he was stuck there for almost 15 minutes, all he would do is just growl and scream. So we just stood and shot him.  [spoiler]Walking while you're dragging bigfoot is next to impossible. The little bed that you're dragging him on glitches out so bad, it was morphing in front of me, to the side, and it even would flip up into the air and keep spiking to and from its location. Then it somehow flipped me into the air when I stopped walking, and I lost half my health when I finally came down. [/spoiler]  Screenshots: http://i.imgur.com/sWnnaoT.jpg http://i.imgur.com/DaF45jH.jpg (The smudge to the right is bigfoot) http://i.imgur.com/kJUxp4U.jpg (The black smudge to the left is bigfoot flying around)  Here is a screenshot of dragging him back and my friend "floating through the air with his legs crossed like he's sitting" -- http://i.imgur.com/42cPg3p.jpg  A few of the screenshots show a blurry bigfoot because he was literally glitching so fast through the air / into the ground, we couldn't take the shot to show him clear enough. This happened the entire time from where we caught him -> bringing him back to base.  [spoiler]Once we got him back, dragging him near the cage was a difficult task. He would glitch into things, and then fly into the air and come back down. You had to do pretty wide turns around certain objects in order for him to not glitch and come into contact with them. After finally getting him in, the ending was very... I can't even think of a word, maybe non-existent? I won't go into detail because that'll ruin it for anyone who hasn't played, but be prepared. If you blink, it's over. [/spoiler]  From a development stand-point, the game was developed in Unreal Engine, which I also use for games I develop with my team; and it seems like the game was rushed. My BIGGEST trigger; is when I actually went into the server browser, I instantly recognized the server list layout. It's taken from a tutorial available on youtube with a provided download link. It's basically a pre-existing template which allows you to connect your game to steam and have browsable servers.   Why does this trigger me? Because any developer serious about their game, should actually take the time to re-design the LAYOUT AT LEAST, and put some care into it. The layout is exactly the same, down to the red error messages that appear when you get the sub session issue. So this was a major let down, because I could never imagine releasing a game that used stock templates from Unreal Engine tutorials.  Finally, the price of $15.00? No way. I've bought games before that I've disliked, but never asked for a refund from steam, as it wasn't worth the hassle of doing, however, I can say that this is the ONLY game I've ever wanted to refund, because it just disappointed all of us that bad.   All three of us are requesting refunds for the game. Sadly, I have 4 hours because I kept trying to give it a chance, but as I got deeper into the game, it got worse and worse. But the other two friends have under what the refund requirements are. It's sad, because I've never wanted to refund a game in my life, and I'm pretty understanding of Early Access games and them containing bugs, but this one, I find the bugs that exist as just carelessness in development, and could have been resolved with just a few days of bug fixing.  As I said, I wanted to like this, but there's just too much here that is wrong, and I'm actually shocked it's a purchasable game. I'd never in a million years allow a game in this condition to be something attached to my name that I am selling. Not to directly hit at the developer, because I'm sure he's put a lot of work into this, but an extra few weeks of just focusing on these issues would have made it a great game.  Regards, Richard
Date 2017-07-16 Playtime 48h 20m Rec Positive Oyun en az 3 farklı evre geçirip tipten tipe farklı grafikler, dünya tasarımı, modeller, eşyalar ile Koca Ayak oyununu bize tekrar ve tekrar hatırlattı.   Son gelen güncellemede Tek veya Çok oyunculu olarak kendilerine ait yetenekleri bulunan karakterlerden birini seçip Koca Ayağı avlamak üzere ormanın ortasında Karavanın içerisinde başlıyorsunuz.  Ama dikkat! Kurabildiğiniz tuzakların farklında olan Koca Ayağımız'da tuzak yerleştirebiliyor, attığınız adımlara daha tedbirli atmanızı ve ormanda bulunan vahşi hayvanlara dikkat etmenizi öneririm. Haritada sınırlı patlayıcılar, cephaneler ve ilk yardım kiti bulunduğundan dolayı yaptığınız her adımın, hatanın size koca ayağı alt etme konusunda önemli bir etkisi bulunuyor.  En fazla dört koca ayak avcısı olarak çok oyunculu girmek eğer size yetmiyor ise iyi haberlerim var artık koca ayağı yapay zekanın kontrol etmesi zorunlu değil.  Stratejik koca ayak avlamak isteyenlerin almasını öneririm.
Date 2017-07-16 Playtime 0h 24m Rec Negative Ugh!, I wished I had actually watched videos of this game first, it is extreamly boring, it's like you really are looking for bigfoot cause you never find em, but whats just as bad is that objects scalling is way off and looks goofy and the game just doesn't look good maxed out, very poor assets.
Date 2017-07-15 Playtime 11h 26m Rec Positive haha get this game if you like messing with your friends and to explore the world of Big Feet = Big Dick dont listen to the dislikes most of them are from there own hardware problems and for myself i havent had any game braking problems  as of now everyone is just waiting on more content  great game
Date 2017-07-15 Playtime 4h 16m Rec Positive Ho acquistato Bigfoot per curiosità, essendo amante dei giochi di sopravvivenza.Già dalla prima ora di gioco si capisce che è ben strutturato, con un occhio (menomale) di riguardo per il Singleplayer. Naturalmente sarebbe molto divertente giocarlo in gruppo con gli amici me badate bene (da non credere) non giocatelo con estranei perchè troveranno il modo di rovinarvi (come al solito) la partita.La grafica è discreta tenendo conto che è in accesso anticipato, quindi magari ci saranno dei miglioramenti in futuro ma già così non è male. Il gameplay mi sembra veramente buono, personalmente lo trovo divertente e capace di creare una bella tensione, grazie anche a un reparto audio di tutto rispetto. La mappa (per ora una ma in futuro saranno almeno due,di cui una con la neve)non è grande ma sicuramente sufficente al fine del gioco.Non c'è possibilità di salvare la partita e questo vi fà capire che le tempistiche non sono lunghe ma si presta ad essere rigiocato molte volte.Tutto sommato un gioco( ne giocone e ne giochetto) valido e senza intoppi. Il prezzo...ma...credo che in fin dei conti li valga tutti i 15,00 € che vi vengono chiesti ma se non avete furia e resistete...chissà, forse prima o poi lo troverete in saldo. Ciao a tutti e buon divertimento.

Date 2017-07-13 Playtime 1h 46m Rec Positive I had some decent fun with this game honestly just waiting on updates. Still haven't caught bigfoot yet he's very strong and runs like hell. Will catch him and put him on display at a circus for profit.
Date 2017-07-13 Playtime 10h 7m Rec Positive This is a new game, but a fun one. If your looking for a good thrilling game to play on your own or with your friends, check it out.
Date 2017-07-12 Playtime 26h 26m Rec Positive BIGFOOT, так  же Finding Bigfoot - хоррор на выживание, в котором нам предстоит устроить охоту на гипотетическое существо, Бигфута или по-другому Сасквоч.   Узнав из газет о пропаже туристов, мы уверены что это не несчастный случай, а что во всем этом виноват Бигфут. Игра начинается с того, что мы появляемся фургоне. Нам дается 8 камер, которые нужно расставить по периметру карты. Наблюдать за камерами можно в фургоне (после летнего обновления, это можно будет сделать с планшета). Так же дается мясо и капканы, мясо привлекает Бигфута, а капкан не много наносит дамаг. Есть ружье и патроны. Обычные патроны и патроны с датчиком, выстрелив в Бигфута, мы можем некоторое время за ним следить, открыв карту. Так же нам доступен сигнальный пистолет и ракеты, веревка для связывания Бигфута, камера ночного видения с батарейками. Ружье как и капканы, у бигфута снимает мало хп. Так что запасайтесь патронами. Когда Бигфут попадает в капкан, он издает громкий звук. Обращайте внимание на полоску хп, так как Бигфут может кричать просто так, не из-за капкана.  По мимо охоты на бигфута, у нас есть еще 2 задания, это связать бигфута, довезти его до фургона и посадить в клетку. И дополнительное задание, нужно найти 4 трупа.  Есть как одиночный режим, так и кооп на 3 человека.  Сюжета здесь нет.   Сейчас готовится обновление, которое выйдет в конце лета. Изменены модели и текстуры предметов, добавлен планшет, квадрокоптер, нож, так же новая зимняя карта.

Date 2017-07-12 Playtime 2h 39m Rec Positive Great game, however, it needs additional content to get it to that current price tag of; $15.99. Right now at its current state (7/12/17), I would say it worth anywhere between $6-$10. The game can easily be worth $15-$20 with additional content. As of current build, I would give this game a solid 3/5. The game can definitely get a 4 with added equipment and possible 4-player co-op.  I myself have thought of a few ideas I would love to see in the game;  An Ipad type device in which we are able to access cameras on the go. The pad will, of course, be powered by batteries making it both useful and balanced.   I would also love to see a vs mode where a 4th friend can play as Bigfoot. This allows a, needed, 4 player game. This allows unique objectives making hunters have to capture Bigfoot before it either; kills all hunters or disables the hunters' vehicles and equipment.   [h1] Pros:    [/h1] + Live CCTV camera footage + Team building qualities + Easy/Decent objectives + Cool Weather + Unique areas (Swamp, cave, trench, house, small towers.) + Traps (Being able to cover traps in leaves)   [h1] Cons:    [/h1] -As the rain starts to pick up, you are greeted with the loudest lightning/thunder sounds. (So loud that lightning was much scarier than finding Bigfoot) - Night vision is blindingly bright during all times of use. (Much easier to just stick with your eyes) - 3-player Co-op (Frustrating to either leave out one friend or have to split up into two groups of two.)  [h1] InBetweens?:    [/h1] : Bigfoot's neon green blood (I liked it as a cool tracking ability, It just killed its chances of being immersive.) : Bigfoot's bleeding in general (Cool for tracking yet also annoying since Bigfoot doesn't bleed out, only just drops a drop when shot.) : Camper size (Realistic, but too small to house 3 players let alone 2.)

Date 2017-07-12 Playtime 7h 24m Rec Positive After several hours of game I managed to shoot bigfoot down, I tied it BDSM style with my hard rope, then, walking back to the camp with my pet I stepped on a trap and died. Good game though, will give it a solid 5/7 !
Date 2017-07-11 Playtime 2h 25m Rec Negative That was the worst game experience in my life. The game is fucking boring and not scary at all. Also it has a lot of bugs. Yes, i understand that this is early access BUT IF THIS FUCKER KILLS U THROUGH THE WALL WHAT I SHOULD DO THEN?
Date 2017-07-11 Playtime 0h 40m Rec Negative Preparing first time setup........ [spoiler] FOREVER! HAHAHAHAH! [/spoiler]
Date 2017-07-10 Playtime 10h 21m Rec Positive This game has been a lot of fun. It's essentially a hunting game with a very dangerous Bigfoot as the hunted animal. This game actually scared me, made me laugh, made me mad and made me want more. I have played almost 8 hours in two sessions. It's a lot of fun to play with friends.  I would love to see custom tree stands in the game and more characters, skins and even some perks would be cool. I'm looking forward to seeing what they add. You should check this game out!

Date 2017-07-08 Playtime 22h 11m Rec Positive This game is pretty hard when me & my friend play it, although I really don't understand how people find this game extremely easy. I think this game is pretty damn fun if you had a friend or two (max 3 players) playing with you. For me it's quite difficult and probably is for other people. I think this makes the game better though, it means you are going to play it more and not get that bored. I think bigfoot can be annoying because most of the time he never comes to the caravan (when me & a friend play anyway lol) This game is fun though, and I do recommend this.
Date 2017-07-08 Playtime 8h 16m Rec Positive this game is very good and is so fun to play and give you a good scare

Date 2017-07-04 Playtime 35h 46m Rec Negative 이겜 얼핏 보기엔 허접해 보여도, 은근 사냥하는 재미가 있습니다. 그것도 빅풋이란 미스테리한 괴물을 사냥하는 맛. 이볼브가 생각나기도 하는 사냥 게임입니다. 앞으로 계속 업데이트 해나갈 앞서 해보기 게임이고, 다음 업뎃 내역만 봐도 점점 괜찮은 게임이 될 조짐이 보입니다.  아직 한국에 이 게임을 아는 분이 거의 없어서 저도 추천함. 친구와 함께하기에 참 좋은 게임입니다.    ------------------------------------------------------------------   음 근데 요새 개발자들이 좀 게으른게 느껴집니다. 업뎃 예정날짜를 2번인가 올려놓고 말없이 무한 딜레이 중이네요. 그래서 허브 가보니까 개발자들이 도타나 스타워즈 겜하면서 개발중... 아무리 쉬는시간에 한다지만 좀 무책임한듯 싶습니다. 개발자놈들 말이 자기들은 개발 천천히 하고 있고, 데드라인 같은거 없다고 하더군요. 자기들이 업데이트 날짜 말 해놓고는 ㅡ,.ㅡ 몇몇 유저들이 그래서 따지는군요.  점점 개발자들이 맘에 안 들기 시작하네요.  인디게임 답구만...           When you see this game for the first time, maybe you think this game looks not that good. But this game is pretty fun for hunt. Of course not a normal animal, it's Bigfoot, a mysterious monster. This hunting game makes me to remember the Evolve.  This is early access game, and I think it has some great potential. I wish this game getting better, and be a good game in the future.  Still not much players know about this game.  But I recommend this game for playing togather with your friends. :D   -------------------------------------------------------------------------   Well, nowadays, Devs looks little lazy. They said certain update date twice, but they broke their update deadline. Already past the date. So I checked hub, and devs playing Dota, or Star wars during develop the game. Even though they playing games in free time, but I think they are irresponsible. They said they developing slowly. and they don't have deadline. (But they wrote their some exact update date.) Some players are angry now and they abuse devs.  I'm starting hate Devs. =_=  That's why this is just Indie game.

Date 2017-07-04 Playtime 69h 43m Rec Positive This game is hella fun and much better with friends. The game is mostly well made and the objective is clear. All that I want is more content and features. I also want the ability to change my mouse sensitivity. I also really want the ability to crouch. I would say buy this game on a sale. I am not sure if its worth full price.
Date 2017-07-03 Playtime 56h 54m Rec Positive its hard playing solo but its fun when you scream like a little girl. also i dont reccomend getting this game until they release new update! it will make this game a better horror game for sur!

For now it was fun, but the replay factor is sorely missing now that we've done it once. Maybe with other people it would live up to the initial hype, but I am worried that I won't revist until the next update.

Date 2017-07-02 Playtime 4h 24m Rec Positive Bigfoot is a Survival Explore game that lets you team with friends or randoms to find the greatest threat to nature..BIGFOOT! The Devolper of this indie title starts you off in a van in the woods with gear to get your shot of the great beast.  You're given a gun, cameras, traps and your survival instincts to find and capture the beast. Be careful though, when spotten by IT; It'll charge at you and you'll need to try your best to track it down back at the RV and bring it back.  The only CONS I have for this game are:   - The Map Size - Little Ammo Cache - Not a good varity of maps  At the end of it all, the game at it's state is fun enough to play by yourself to get a good scare, Or play with friends to make it to the end!

Date 2017-07-02 Playtime 11h 47m Rec Positive Great game, 9/10, Gets boring after a while but they're adding new items to make the game more fun and oh, a new map! If you are looking at buying the game I'd recommend asking friends if they can buy and play it with you, it's much more fun to play  with friends.  In multiplayer you can only play with 2 other friends but it is still fun

Date 2017-07-01 Playtime 12h 34m Rec Positive Okay so heres my review:   Pros: - It's a really fun game with Co-0p - Theres multiple objects such as traps, cameras and meat which give a good hunting style - Great obvience within the eviorment   Cons: - Map is to small for my liking - Not enough things to do in the map - Hurt, Find, Hurt, Find I wish there was more to the story then finding a dead character and giving you a medkit - Once you kill him its all over and yes I understand thats the objective of the game though it should have more things to do Overall:  Amazing game and I reccomende anyone to get it CO-OP is the way  to go solo is borning and laughing with your friends is fun.

Das ist echt ein Geiles und Gruseliges Spiel aber muss das sein??? Ich check es nicht... kann man nicht einfach Neustarten wie in Jedem spiel?! Es Lohnt sich soweit es sich ändert, aber schon so ist es echt geil!

Date 2017-06-30 Playtime 0h 26m Rec Negative short game
Date 2017-06-30 Playtime 0h 23m Rec Negative poor
Date 2017-06-30 Playtime 0h 55m Rec Positive *REFUNDED*   However, if they fix the performance issues then I will gladly buy this game at full price or more.  I was getting 20-38fps no matter the settings.  1080p & 1440p were peforming the same which was weird as well.  Only played 55 minutes but definitely got a feel for the game and the gameplay itself is super fun.  Pros: -Awesome SUSPENSE.  I only encountered the Squatch when I least expected it and had to change my shorts after. -The tools/items used such as the CCTV and flare gun are really neat at look really good. -Will be amazing in COOP  CONS: -Ran very poorly for me.  -The running needs to be limited and not feel so arcady. -First Person Model needs to be completely revamped as it does no match the quality of the enviroment.  -Can't bind keys yet.  So basically the gameplay itself is really good except for the running and first person model as i mentioned.  And again I will be following this game to see if they improve the overall performance.  My advice is to wait for now because gambling $10-$30 for every game with promise adds up and there are just way too many games that never come through performance wise.  Good luck to the DEVS as you may have found an awesome niche market, I hope it all works out!  TL;DR: Giving Positive review due to gameplay.  Bad performance.
Date 2017-06-30 Playtime 4h 14m Rec Positive Sooo fun! The erie feeling when you are in the forest alone and you hear bigfoot let out a blood cudleing roar is prieceless. Although the game needs a little optimisation because i have above the requirements but can play on max :(. Great game!
Date 2017-06-29 Playtime 12h 18m Rec Positive This game is fairly well put together it really captures a creepy vibe and requires you to always watch your back. Being in early access this game does come with it's flaws, while not many. It'd be cool to see them add and improve features such as different maps, improved sounds, weapon mechanics and add new weapons. The other major thing is replayability, it seems that this game lacks it. Overall I would thing this game is pretty enjoyable and i'm interested to see where the developers take this game. Overall rating: 7.4/10
Date 2017-06-29 Playtime 3h 54m Rec Positive one the best game i think have his story and hiw unique and isnt easy you have to play hours but i love it
Date 2017-06-29 Playtime 17h 12m Rec Positive I bought Bigfoot after seeing a few videos on Youtube that appeared to show a solid game with interesting mechanics and a large world to explore in. After the first hour I played on my own however I found that without other players this game just does not deliver a fun experiance because of several reasons. The first issue I noted is that the day cycle is far too short for a single player to accomplish any exploring since most of your time has to be spent setting up traps and cameras which I felt took away one of this games strongest assets. Another issue that I found as a single player is that actually hunting bigfoot once you spot him is just plain annoying because his model isn't representitive of his range or hitbox and he can easily kill you in two hits. Other than this I noted that there was just a general lack of interesting events on my own and after finding extra guns, traps, and ammo scattered around the map I reached the conclusion that this game just is not designed for single player. I guess in a way this makes sense because if bigfoot was real and you were alone in the woods with him he would probably kick your a$$ and it wouldn't be very fun at all.  Fortunately I had some money to burn and I gifted a copy of this game to a friend, and once I had another player with me the experiance I had with this game vastly improved. This game was incredibly fun with a friend because exploration felt more possible, traps and cameras were less tedious, and bigfoot was no longer a death machine but he still felt powerful.  Multiplayer is definately what this game excels at but I am disappointed that it delivers a subpar single player experiance.  Pros: -Good gameplay -Full and interesting map -Bigfoot is real -Graphics  -CCTV system is very well done -Amazing atmosphere  Cons: -Only one map so far -Animations could use some work -Bad single player experiance -Hitboxes are buggy -Traps feel tedious and almost require multiple players to efficiently set up -Frequent crashes -NEEDS to be optimized -Underdeveloped tutorial -***EARLY ACCESS***
Date 2017-06-29 Playtime 55h 12m Rec Positive Just a blast with friends. Great game although the devs need to add more weaponry to kill bigfoot with as the traps are literally useless and the cameras don't help either.

Date 2017-06-27 Playtime 14h 14m Rec Positive Sehr sehr schlecht übersetztes Deutsch... ^^
Date 2017-06-27 Playtime 8h 31m Rec Positive This game is only for the most discerning of video game connoisseurs and the price at which the developers of this masterpiece are asking is an absolute steal. From the moment I opened the game and was unable to put it into fullscreen mode due to the game completely crashing I saw it as a moment where the game displayed its pure brilliance. Mere hours after I solved the fullscreen issue I was seemlessly able to connect with my dear friend Palpt. Palpt proceeded to shoot me in the face with a gun, killed me, and I was unable to respawn. The inability to respawn was a genius move by the developers to display the hardships that come with a great undertaking such as hunting Bigfoot. Obviously the developers were going for artistic realism when they made the design choice to make the flares fired from a flare gun have the brightness of the sun and light up the entire map with a sound effect equally tremendous. The task which you set out to do in this game ultimately culminates with Bigfoot himself sliding across the ground toward you, like a speedy snail, and attacking you. Without a doubt, I would highly recommend this game as it gives hours of multiplayer survival horror fun with complete realism. I love it.
Date 2017-06-27 Playtime 28h 2m Rec Positive This game is incredibly fun with a cooperating team of players. Taking up roles, and working out strategies put a lot of emphasis on the tiniest detail such as who should stay and man the cameras, and which two should seek out the Squatch.   Survival: There is a finite amount of resources to distribute amongst your party. Between the hunters, you need to quickly establish who is preparing traps/cameras, looking for lost campers, and finding resources. There are plenty of flares, but ammo for your rifles can be quickly depleted. Unfortunately there is no looting, or trade aspect in the game. While in a way I like this for encouraging the team to work together, so everyone can defend themselves, on the other-hand it's easy for another player to horde all the ammo for themselves. Since there is no loot system, if that player dies, there is no way to retrieve anything off their corpse.  Horror: Bigfoot does provide for a good jump scare. There is no safe place, and if you think you can just lock the door and hide in the camper, think again. I find the green blood out of place, but it does help when trying to track him down at night. Lighting strikes are sudden and random, so headphone users be prepared.   Communication/multilayer: The fun factor is much greater amongst a group of friends than the single player can offer. The role playing, and teamwork add a real nice extra layer of depth. If you lack friends that play the game you're missing out on a good portion of the fun. Thankfully you can just set an obvious password for anyone can join your match, however this creates a whole new problem; no communication. There is no way to chat with your fellow hunters, and you're left to communicating with your tools like you're some sort of caveman. Trying to tell someone how to track the tagged Bigfoot, or help a new player find ammo is very frustrating that can be solved with a text chat system. Adding more public match support is essential for those who have trouble getting a group of friends together.   Bigfoot: Again, I'm not much of a fan of the green blood, but overall I was impressed with the creatures AI. Hearing his calling roar in the distance, for the first time got me quite nervous of what was awaiting me out in the woods. Possibly adding more distant grunts, or having the squatch maybe throw something at you can help increase the early game tension imo. From the impression I got though, I'm greatly looking forward to the expansion, and I hope the team is willing to explore other North American Cryptids!
Date 2017-06-26 Playtime 18h 36m Rec Positive i said id change my review when i felt it deserved it and that day has come.. worth the buy   new update sucks so far in that i cant even find a game... just auto sort ppl into games.. not that hard... your making it so half of your player base cant even play because they dont have other friends who also play..... ive been trying to join someone elses game for about an hr now with no luck.. not once
Date 2017-06-26 Playtime 0h 57m Rec Negative This game is awful. Its sitting around waiting for him to show up so you can shoot him. You can try and track him but he is faster than you so you cant catch him. No redeeming qualitys. since he is impossible to see at night or catch the cameras are basicly useless with your best bet placing bait on your door and shooting him before he runs away, 4 nights in a row, and thats it. Awful game. I had to refund it because of the lack of gameplay since there is hardly any, the graphics and sound are B list at best. I must say there is very little bugs.
Date 2017-06-26 Playtime 2h 25m Rec Positive So far I am enjoying it.  Had my heart racing a few times throughout the game.  I would definitely recommend this game.
Date 2017-06-26 Playtime 17h 17m Rec Positive This game is hard to get used to at first, but after me and my friend looked up some tutorials it became pretty fun. Wouldn't recomend it if its just you playing as it can get a little stresful and scary but with a friend it's a fun experience. Sadly because it is in beta, some things are glitchy and or just annoying like crashing and its a little laggy, but overall i would recomend it.

Date 2017-06-24 Playtime 20h 15m Rec Positive This game has so much potential, between the small development company that is growing here (they currently just hired a animator) and there overwhelmingly great hard work, I believe this to be a glimpse into a great game. The developers over a samll time prepared this game as a test run almost, as a way to see how the community would react. The game got great feed back. With this feedback the developers are currently working hard on the game, if you look at the Dev News you can see they post screenshots of there work as well as little gifs and updates on there progress which is more than what most big developers do for there 5 star IGN 10/10 games. This game may be short but it is evident that the game is being completely overhauled and reworked to add a lore, more gameplay, and a intense expierence. I highly suggest the game.

Date 2017-06-23 Playtime 17h 20m Rec Positive Seit Jahren habe ich dieses Spiel in meiner Bibliothek liegen und habe bisher immer mal nur kurz reingespielt, und ein jedes mal fande ich ein völlig neues Spiel vor. Es waren nicht nur Updates die mal hier und da etwas geändert haben, nein! Es waren nahezu immer wieder komplett neue Spiel Versionen gewesen. Mal besser, mal schlechter, dieses Spiel hat glaube bereits schon alles hinter sich. Doch vielmehr geht es nun darum wie es heute ist.   Als ich das Spiel in einem meiner Stream angespielt habe hätte ich vieles erwartet aber ganz sicher nicht DAS! Ich dachte ich könnte meinen Augen nicht trauen als ich sah wie EXTREM sich Bigfoot seit dem letzten mal als ich es gespielt hatte nun verändert hat, und dies ausschließlich im POSITIVEN Sinne. Ich glaube einfach kaum das dieses Spiel von einem ganz kleinen (ich glaube 4 Mann) Team gemacht wurde und wie stark sie sich mit dem Spiel auseinandergesetzt und es verbessert haben.  Das Gameplay, die Grafik, Die Mechaniken und alles das dazugehört ist einfach meines Erachtens an sehr gut geworden. Es macht mega Spaß dieses Spiel zu spielen und nach 6 STD am STK wurde mir nicht 1sek langweilig.   Die einzige Sache die ich zu bemängeln habe und die schnell zur Frustration führen könnte bei so manchen ist der Schwierigkeitsgrad, Bigfoot ist echt sehr sehr schwer ganz gleich in welch einer Einstellung du es auch spielst. Es gibt nur sehr wenig Items zu finden die überall verstreut und auch versteckt in der Welt vorzufinden sind. Mit dem was man findet muss man bis zum Schluss dann auch auskommen. Bigfoot selbst ist extrem stark und nicht all zu dumm, verarschen und austricksten lässt sich dieser nur sehr bedingt. Er ist uns Spielern meist einen Schritt voraus als wir ihm!   Nacht für Nacht wird Bigfoot agressiver und auch stärker und ab Nacht 6 bis 8 wird es absolut knüppel hart. Stellen Weise empfand ich es dann schon als wirklich zu unfair da man bis dorthin kaum noch Möglichkeiten hat sich zu wehren geschweige sich zu heilen oder zu fliehen. Hat Bigfoot einmal die Jagd aufgenommen wird man ihn ab einen gewissen Punkt im Spiel auch nicht mehr los! Selbst Leuchtpistolen halten Ihn nicht mehr davon ab dich komplett zu Brei zu hauen. Den DMG den man selbst als Spieler verursacht ist teilweise so mikrig das man das Gefühl bekommt absolut Usless zu sein :D   Doch beschäftigt man sich erst einmal eine Weile mit dem Spiel und dessen Mechaniken und spielt auch selbst mal als Bigfoot gegen andere Spieler sieht das ganze schon wieder ganz anders aus. Wenn man lernt findet man viele Wege sich das Leben hier einfacher zu machen ^^ Deshalb behaupte ich das Bigfoot nicht zu OP oder Unfair ist, man muss lediglich sehr viel lernen und ausprobieren um Bigfoot erfolgreich die Stirn zu bieten.   Ich zu meinem Teil finde das Spiel wie es heute ist absolut Klasse und es macht mir meeeeega Spaß. Ich empfehle es jedem weiter ohne die geringsten bedenken dabei zu haben.

Date 2017-06-21 Playtime 15h 39m Rec Negative This game has potential, but at its current state its quite lacking. Its poor on content and the devs dont seem to be adding anything anytime soon. The gameplay gets  repetitive quite fast. Killing/capturing the bigfoot is almost impossible because the ammunition is scarce, so are the other items you will need to survive and defeat him.    3/10  
Date 2017-06-21 Playtime 1h 32m Rec Negative The game is short and doesn't consist of enough complex gameplay worthy to be $15.  This game is worth at most $5. Maybe in the future there will be more but for now wait for it to go on sale.
Date 2017-06-20 Playtime 0h 37m Rec Positive I've watched gameplay videos of this game and it is absolutely amazing. The sound and video quality is top notch and it is really well made. The only gripe I have with it is that it crashes so often. As I said, I've watched gameplay videos, but whenever I try to run it myself, I get to the introduction screen, and then the game closes down automatically. I've set the graphics options the lowest they can be but it doesn't fix the problem. Other than that, great game, I strongly reccomend you play it, if you can run it.

Date 2017-06-17 Playtime 6h 37m Rec Positive когда там обновят игру ?хотелось бы больше животных,также зимнюю карту и т.д
Date 2017-06-17 Playtime 26h 19m Rec Positive *note: all the people complaining about it crashing, I have a possible explaination at the bottom*  Though I have yet to play the game myself (due to the game crashing on the menu screen) I can't properly review it the way I'd like to. BUT from what I've seen by many youtubers, the game looks very interesting and seems to be a lot of fun, unlike 'The Rake' which was cancelled in a very un-polished state.  The game looks visually appealing and rather nice, the lighting is extremely well done, as well as the models and textures, with high poly models with proper hair physics and high-res textures giving off a somewhat realistic feel to the game.  Some downsides about the current state (in my opinion) are:  1: the game's menus are uninteresting in it's released state, with no real representation of what the game is like, I mean sure, there's a forest in t he background, but even 'The Rake' had an interesting, nice looking menu. But the devs appear to be changing the menu right now anyway.  2: current character models are all the same, with 'interesting' walking animations that look rather odd, they look like some of my very first walk cycles right now. The character models are well done, but need more variation for multiplayer games, so the players aren't all clones of each other. This is also being fixed.  3: the current price for the game $15.99 USD, around $16. For the quality of the game so far, I don't believe this price is low enough for the state of the game, yes there is lots of stuff being added as we speak, but at least $10.00 at the most, I've told my friends (who also have seen the game, but haven't bought it) about the game and what is being added, I then told them the price and most of them thought it was too much money right now. Like I said, $10 at least, it would probably get more customers if it had a lower price.  Overall I think it's a nice game, and there's soo much to be added in the next version. But I'd wait until more content is added (when the next update is released). There'll be a nicer menu, revamped Bigfoot AI, another level, remote control drones, other animals like wolves and deers (even racoons) and probably much more, and Nvidia hairworks is getting dumped so more people can play the game at a more consistant framerate. Once I can play the game I'll be updating my review.  Now for all you people who can't get the game to run past the loading screen (me included) I think I have some idea of why. Nvidia hairworks is an advanced software.. A REALLY advanced software, it was even used in games like Witcher 3. However, it is not well optimized for low-quality PCs and/or laptops. When the loading screen is done loading the game shows up, and instantly loads in Bigfoot, then applies Nvidia hairworks to him, causing lower end PCs to crash, due to the almost zero optimization of hairworks, your laptop can't handle Bigfoot being loaded in along with the hair he uses, so it crashes. This also explains why you can hear the game sounds before it crashes: it loads the game, then Bigfoot, then crashes because it can't handle it.  I have emailed the Devs (cyberlight) about this and am awaiting a reply. Until then, I'd recommend not downvoting the game constantly because it crashes for you, the next update is removing Nvidia hairworks, due to poor optimization ok?
Date 2017-06-17 Playtime 4h 50m Rec Negative I like the idea of this game but every time I join a game, I am in it for like 2 minutes then my monitors go black. I know it's just this game because this is the only game I have that does that. I want to see them fix this because I really want to play this game
Date 2017-06-17 Playtime 10h 11m Rec Positive FUN LITTLE GAME STABLE IN BETA BUT STILL NEEDS ALOT OF WORK !!!  cons ! not to much content yet i have only played single player but i imagine would be fun with freinds! graphics are buggy textures missing etc etc bigfoot ai and things it can do are hit and run its very basic  no sound options and some sfx are wow to loud like your breathing etc  pros its got great atmosphere! some nice use of traps and camera tools to make you feel like a real hunter :) it works i never once crashed or had any issues updates seem to roll out quickly and new content is already planed a new map soon !   hopes for the future! more things to hunt this should be monster hunters not bigfoot hunters! it would be nice to see some diffrent mechanics from bigfoot like drags a player off to his home for the night to eat freinds have to save and such and if new monsters are made too hunt they could do diffrent things!  do i reccomend buying hmmm not just yet maybe if new content is luanched or you have 2 freinds that want to play then yes get it but for now wait for a cheap sale :)

Date 2017-06-14 Playtime 19h 46m Rec Positive Die Macher zeigen hervorragend ,wie gut Googleübersetzer arbeitet.

Date 2017-06-13 Playtime 30h 17m Rec Positive BIGFOOT is a very well made and creative but realistic game. With only 2 people, this much progress is an achievement. 10/10
Date 2017-06-12 Playtime 18h 0m Rec Positive Ist ein gutes Spiel, auch wenn es noch in einem sehr frühem Entwicklungsstadium ist. Es macht auch nachdem man geschafft hat Bigfoot zu fangen noch Spaß. Allerrings fine ich es ein wenig doof, dass man nichht speichern kann. Freue mich aber sher auf das neue Update.
Date 2017-06-12 Playtime 38h 42m Rec Positive You should make the game a little bit cheaper i mean its a great game and i really like it but it is pretty expensive

Date 2017-06-10 Playtime 4h 29m Rec Negative Wow! Steam is losing value allowing games in this state to be bought and published. Complete trash from the loading of the game multiple exceptions while launching. If it comes up horrible unresponsive UI. Cant say much for any game play as it has actually failed to play at all. Shame on all for the state of this crap.

Date 2017-06-08 Playtime 0h 55m Rec Negative It took me 55 minutes to beat this game, so it's got little when it comes to content as of now. I'd say wait until they at least have a 3rd level in the game and more weapons and traps.

Date 2017-06-04 Playtime 11h 57m Rec Positive Довольно скучно,через 3 часа надоело,надеюсь с обновлениями добавят что нибуть интересного 7/10
Date 2017-06-04 Playtime 6h 31m Rec Positive I highly advise buying this game. bigfoot really puts a scare in your heart. It is very fun and scary.
Date 2017-06-04 Playtime 9h 24m Rec Positive I played this game with my horror-buddy. I was streaming the whole game and i have to say, it is quite fun to play it coop. While we continued throughout the game we came along a few bugs and glitches. These bugs and glitches did not impact our game and were only about some textures. To keep this rather short for people who are not sure if they want to buy it or not:   We only played this game coop. That means we can not tell the difference between coop and singleplayer. But i assume singleplayer is by far scarier than playing with friends, but also not as much fun.  First of all: Would i recommend buying it? - If you have a friend to play it with, definitely yes. If you are going to play it alone, better look at some video footage first or play with strangers online (there are quite a few people mostly at all time).   Ratings:  Horror: 6/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Bigfoot: 8/10 Lightning and thunder: 11/10 Controls: 6/10  Horror: It was very scary at the beginning. Not only the Bigfoot, but also, and I would not call this a spoiler because it happens randomly in the game, lightning strikes and thunder sounds. The atmosphere was very scary as we started to play. But it gets more comfortable when you know all the mechanics in the game and how to use them.  Atmosphere: Scary atmosphere even at daytime. The nighttime can be horrifying with all the sounds you hear while walking through the woods.  Bigfoot: Good model, fitting sounds. Only the AI is something to work on.  Lightning and thunder: Yes...  Controls: The controls are simple, but also the usage. What bothers me the most is the missing crouch function.    Overall:  My rating: 7/10 My friend: 8/10  Playtime until we beat the game for the first time: ~4 hours. Replayable: Worth playing after you finished it, but probably not as much fun.

Date 2017-06-03 Playtime 1h 1m Rec Positive Its a fine game for now, but imo after some few minutes of playing it gets bored, all you do is trying to find a big guy and shoot the crap out of him, find ammo, find bigfoot again and repeat the shit, lacking reall intresting things.  buy in sale will be recommended

Date 2017-06-02 Playtime 14h 23m Rec Positive Eh. There's not much to do right now except catch Bigfoot in a variety of different ways and just mess around online, for the moment it's not really worth the buy. Wait until more content for this is out to get it, it's still fun to play for me though. The graphics is probably the best part of the game tbh though.  I do like the game though, so yes I do recommend it. Just have to be patient for future updates.
Date 2017-06-02 Playtime 0h 35m Rec Negative Mouse inversion isn't an option and every single game menu is riddled with typos.  Feels like a pre-alpha title that shouldn't even be available to play yet.  1/10
Date 2017-06-02 Playtime 3h 18m Rec Positive awesome game definately play in a group teamwork helps
Date 2017-06-01 Playtime 41h 7m Rec Positive This game has so much potential! even if you dont have hope you can start to picture its futcher if someone big sees something in it, like new maps, new creatures and animals and other things that will wow us when the time comes we will all look back on this day and remember we didnt like it and then we look at the progress.

Date 2017-05-29 Playtime 0h 13m Rec Negative Listed features: Local Co-op. Game: Only online Co-op.  And the game is so buggy.
Date 2017-05-29 Playtime 5h 12m Rec Negative El juego corre super bien, el problema es que ya en dos horas el juego se convierte aburrido. Ahora mismo son 4 personas contra bigfoot que es la maquina. Los dev deben hacer un modo en el cual una persona pueda utilizar al bigfoot, ya que es mucho mejor que jugar con una máquina. Han pasado ya tres meses y los dev todavía no han tirado el update que prometieron. Esta muy lento tirando update, muchas de las personas han dejado de jugar. Lo más que puedo aconsejar es no comprar el juego ahora y esperar a ver si el juego alcanza el éxito, que lo puedo hacer ya que tiene un bien concepto
Date 2017-05-29 Playtime 5h 16m Rec Positive This game is and will be great and unique. It takes aspects of "Rake" and turn them to 100x. The graphics and sound quality are excellent. This game has a great atmosphere with a mix of creepy and adventurous. When playing this game, it is best to play with friends as that is where the game shines. It encourages teamwork and cooperation. Overall, this game is well worth the $15. I can't wait to see where it goes!
Date 2017-05-28 Playtime 1h 15m Rec Negative Очень сырой продукт (преальфа я так думаю), я и не думал, что можно на хорошем движке сделать так плохо......

Date 2017-05-25 Playtime 0h 24m Rec Negative For some reason when ever i start a game it kicks me out of the whole game in general. I have tried all kinds of things but i cant get it to work.
Date 2017-05-25 Playtime 48h 13m Rec Positive love it.great game to past the time and mess about in 
Date 2017-05-24 Playtime 36h 17m Rec Positive Really fun, good ambiance, i hope developpers will add some stuff like the blood who continue to flow after a bullet for help to hunting, maybe some craft (not a lot). Bigger map, a count down for the (i dont know how it called) GPS bullet But good work continue it's really fun
Date 2017-05-23 Playtime 5h 9m Rec Positive Pretty good game, needs improvements, but It's a very fun game to play with friends totally!

Date 2017-05-20 Playtime 20h 31m Rec Positive THIS GAME IS FUN AS SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT HELL YEAHHHHHH  
Date 2017-05-19 Playtime 2h 41m Rec Positive Bought this game with some friends to have some fun. This game was pretty damn fun. Running and screaming while bigfoot was chasing us and then turning on him and pumping him full of shotgun lead and a tracking bullet. Absolutely amazing fun for a few hours worth the money especially if they keep pumping out content for the game!!
Date 2017-05-19 Playtime 4h 30m Rec Positive Amazing.  Tons of humor in the game.  Some pretty good jump scares. Bigfoot went down fairly quick on our second attempt. When is the next map?! 8.5/10
Date 2017-05-19 Playtime 7h 47m Rec Positive despite being early access, this game is really solid, I've only noticed a few bugs, nothing game breaking, and the gamplay is actually really fun, though it is kind of scary. try it out if you don't mind a few jumpscares!
Date 2017-05-17 Playtime 2h 41m Rec Negative Every video on youtube is positive about this game but its just lacking a punch.  Its not honky dorie you know what i mean??  Your with a friend the first 10 minutes are nice but then after the bigfoot has scared the living shit out of you.  You will wander around for hours finding 4 bodies while walking really slow getting cramp in your pinky finger because you have to hold your shift for 3 hours straight.  Waiting for bigfoot to go in your trap but he just running around with that beeping red dot on the map so you decide to go towards him land a few shots and he sonic mode reall quick.    So this game is fine it just needs some good updates and maby just maby little more story because i felt like only going after bigfoot was fine exept when my pinky finger got injured xd.
Date 2017-05-17 Playtime 3h 25m Rec Negative Soo my friend told me to buy this game. I trusted him, and he trusted you guys. but its a shit game. Shout out to my boi Delta Code. Now he needs to buy Elite Dangerous. DONT BUY THIS GAME
Date 2017-05-17 Playtime 58h 22m Rec Positive I love the concept of this game and the graphics are top notch.  I can't wait for the update and i would highly recommend this game.

Date 2017-05-15 Playtime 103h 51m Rec Positive Ok so this Bigfoot game has been in development (and still is majorly) for a number of years now,. I first played this about three years ago. 2018 i think it was.... it was good in concept. A big wide open gorgeous map, Bigfoot runs at you and takes one swipe at you then runs off.... Few weapons to choose from but to be expected...  Fastforward to 2021 Bigfoot 4.0 is where the real mayhem ensues. When he attacks you now he attacks you on an epic scale he doesn't just hit you and go tearing off into the bushes. when he attacks you now it's literally like armageddon is raining down on you.... he hits you fast and hard multiple times, he throws sign posts at you and WWE choke slams you it's unreal how much more frightening he is in the 4.0 update. not to mention his howls are terrifying.  Also has another 3 maps on the way which is great i cant wait to see this game in all its glory in the future... People are constantly complaining about there being only one map but be patient guys, they're coming. Devs will have their hands full with this one making it an awe inspiring co-op shooter. i'm a huge fan of this game and of the bigfoot legend in general and can't wait for the next major update for this game =P The only thing i'm disappointed about the fact that they took away tracking bullets from the original game. The tracking bullets were such a cool feature and I'm really not sure why they took them out. I only hope they put them back in.   BIGFOOT is a great co-op game, and it will only keep getting better and better in future updates. Can't wait =P
Date 2017-05-14 Playtime 60h 4m Rec Negative Я был в игре ещё ДО обновления 1.1.7! И вы даже не представляете, насколько я скучаю по той игре, которая была раньше... Другое название (Finding Bigfoot), другая графика, другая карта, другое поведение Бигфута. Всё было другим! Сейчас же... Я могу с неплохой-такой уверенностью сказать, что раньше РЕАЛЬНО было лучше играть в игру. Про название могу сказать, что предыдущее сейчас больше годно данной игре, преподнесённой нам, так как Бигфут нападает намного реже и его нужно самому искать в 75% случаев. Графика была, конечно, хуже, но она была довольно приемлемой. Карта была меньше, что делало поиски Бигфута намного быстрее. Поведение Бигфута было более нормальным, да и нападений было гораздо больше... А что же сейчас происходит в игре? Графика на неплохом уровне, с этим не поспоришь, карты огромные, что делает передвижение немного более затруднительным, лута с патронами неимоверно мало, а большая его часть - сигнальные факелы, которые НУ НАФИГ ненужны, Бигфут, как я уже сказал, нападает довольно редко. Плюсом хочу отметить, что в игре на данный момент больше багов, чем было в версиях 1. ...! Я недавно зашёл в игру, после выхода Hotfix'а 3 для версии 3.0 и увидел, что у меня левитирует ложка на столе, что у меня мёртвые животные под камни падают, что у меня Бигфут резко подобрел и не хочет бить меня, когда я стою под деревом, да и сам он, похоже, стал вегетарианцем, так как он прошёл раз 5 рядом с замаскированным капканом с мясом... И самое главное, У МЕНЯ С*КА НЕ РАБОТАЕТ КНОПКА ESCAPE! И все эти баги были найдены мной за двухчасовую сессию игры в одиночный режим. Я до сих пор вспоминаю времена, когда 17 марта 2017 года я увидел новости от разработчиков, что игра получит обновление 2.0 и что в этом обновлении будет, и я до сих пор помню, как ждал это обновление, которое, по словам разработчиков, должно было выйти ТОЧНО ДО КОНЦА ЛЕТА 2017! Я ждал и ждал, как хренов Хатико ждал этого обновления, но, вроде как, где-то зимой 2017, я забил на эти ожидания. И что-же? Это всё было напрасно? Как мы видим, к моему большому сожалению, да! Игра УЖЕ на стадии 3.0 и в ней куча багов, вместе с усратым геймплеем, по скуке не уступающим даже предыдущим версиям игры, когда в начале каждого обновления стояла циферка 1! Я до сих пор помню, как вместе с моим другом мы помогли разработчикам пофиксить баг, который позволял получать сколько угодно мяса из одной ловушки и двух его кусков... Но это я так, ностальгирую по былым временам, ведь теперь, похоже, разработчики уже забили на баги, которые находятся в игре, ведь, например, баг с кнопкой Escape разрабам отправили уже множество человек, но им хоть-бы хны! (В момент написания обзора, игра находилась на стадии 3.0, Hotfix 3)

Date 2017-05-13 Playtime 17h 39m Rec Positive My Experience Of BigFoot > Start game with Girlfriend after having months of issues with not being able to see eachother servers. > She declares ownership of the Red Cup. > I claim the Yellow Cup. > We split up. She goes out to places and I go out to others. > I try to find more ammo. > Nighttime aproached. [SKIP A FEW DAYS] > I had next to no health. > Girlfriend shoots at BigFoot. > I run out the trailer and chase BigFoot. > I say "I think we can do this, you know!" > No reply. > Look behind me. > She died. > No bullets left. > Check the entire map for ammo. > Didn't find ammo. > Went back to trailer. > Hear BigFoot. > Hide in the trailer. > See BigFoot collapsed on the ground. > Run outside screaming "I GOT HIM! OH MY GOD I GOT HIM!" > Drag him into cage. > Think of all the fame I could have. > Realize Girlfriend is dead. > Have existential crisis.  Pretty fun game.
Date 2017-05-13 Playtime 6h 15m Rec Negative bought the game because it says local coop and its only online coop!!
Date 2017-05-12 Playtime 43h 31m Rec Positive fun with friends
Date 2017-05-12 Playtime 7h 23m Rec Positive I would like this game more if there were more ammo and if there was a way to get more things to heal yourself with. Also maybe adding in a tracking system (instead of just the tracking bullets) like with bigfoot tracks, or if you could hear the footsteps better. Also it would be fun to have it where if you are attacked in the RV it would flip or something. Other than that the game is pretty fun and scary.
Date 2017-05-11 Playtime 1h 28m Rec Negative Le seul but de ce jeu est de courir après un bigfoot fuyard  Vous avez un fusil, des balles normals et pisteuses Une trousse de soin 4 pièges à ours  Les graphismes au max, le jeu pas fou du tout (grosse config) Pas d'animation quand on blesse le Bigfoot à par une légère giclée de sang vert  J'ai trouvé la map très vide à part des arbres  Je m'attendais à beaucoup mieux, je n'ai toujours pas compris comment les gens peuvent aimer, je verrai avec les prochaines maj's  Vaut dans les 2e voir 3euros (pour la coop) dans l'état actuel, et encore je suis gentil, ils auraient du lancer la "beta" gratuite puis faire payer le jeu un peu plus tard voir après une bonne maj..  J'appelle ça une pré-alpha.. Même pas
Date 2017-05-11 Playtime 0h 47m Rec Negative Near copy of Rake and not the $5 price tag of rake, Maybe if it had more content or was priced at $8 i could see keeping it but as a result it became very boring in the short time i played it with my friend, maybe in the future it will have more things to do and be much more enjoyable overall
Date 2017-05-11 Playtime 10h 33m Rec Positive I figured out the password to a server and terrorized the players in the dark.  10/10 Best Deliverance game available List of kills: 1st hunt, 6/20/17, 1 kill, was shot by friend in trailer 2nd 'hunt', 9/9/17, 1 kill, idiot went afk in the shack while I spent a night hunting bigfoot. Shot him in the head and left the session.  EDIT: Can't hunt people anymore :(
Date 2017-05-11 Playtime 0h 36m Rec Negative This game seems like a lot of fun, my friends and I were really excited to play this game together but everytime I try to launch the game it would crash. can't play singleplayer, can't join a multiplayer game always crashing.  I tried to reinstall the game even verifying the games files but nothing has worked so far.

Date 2017-05-10 Playtime 23h 29m Rec Positive Awesome game, Watched my kids play it and they were scared to go anywhere. It was fun to watch them, Graphics are really good and ambient noise is great. If ya want some good scares, get it!
Date 2017-05-09 Playtime 1h 48m Rec Positive I refunded it because I'm going to wait until there's more features, but for now it really is fun, I recommend it to anyone who likes rake and games like that.

Date 2017-05-08 Playtime 3h 25m Rec Positive Bigfoot is a great game still in development. It's even more fun if you have friends to play it with!  What I liked about the game:  Jumpscares (**** the lightning) Limited resources. If you run out, you have to find more! Exploration to find missing persons The only area you go to right now is pretty nice! The tension when it comes night time is pretty great! I do like that you can lose your friends during an online session and have to communicate. The camera system is really neat! Especially when you can use those cameras in your camper.  What I didn't like about the game:  Some of the animations are awkward but hilarious (still in beta but I know will most likely be fixed)  Sometimes Bigfoot shows up really early in the search. It would be great for the tension to build up more when finding him. Like maybe not have him charge at you in the first few nights. It would really hype up the search if you see him in the distance or on the cameras and you're chasing him and he's running away. As the game goes on, he starts to get aggressive. This was also something a couple friends pointed out. We found Bigfoot in one session literally in 10min and already attacked us. It didn't really build up much tension but was still scary!  I wouldn't mind more spooky things to happen while playing. More so with nature. Friends and I had a blast getting scared from trees falling, lightning strikes, etc.  It would be neat to see more evidence of bigfoot in spots. Like hair stuck to a tree or bush, a trail of trees torn down. Then that would be spots you would maybe set up a trap. Idk I'm just throwing out ideas :p  There wasn't much I didn't like...but I did throw in some suggestions I hope the developers look over! Do like the game so far and can't wait to see the future changes :)
Date 2017-05-08 Playtime 1h 29m Rec Negative Верните деньги  я заплатил за ярлык ? игра совершено не запускается начинает скачивать настройки потом движок в итоге не чего не происходит компьютер по характеристикам подходит по уши что делать либо возврашяйте деньги либо подскажите что делать ?
Date 2017-05-08 Playtime 36h 18m Rec Positive This game is a perfect match between Hunting, and Scary.. it has jumpscares and the whole package.. You go out.. set your traps. and shoots with your rifle.. Its AWESOME! i cant wait to se more maps! tho.. i would like to give some ideas ;)... (1) i think they should make a crouch botton.. so that when u crouch maybe the Bigfoot wont se you that easy ;) (2) More guns.. more houses to loot.. and yeah MORE DEFFERENT GUNS! :D (3) Make Nightvision at an other button.. and then make right click to "Aim down sight" Could be cool!... Well that was it... Thx for this Epic game.. Cant wait to se more ;)
Date 2017-05-08 Playtime 1h 22m Rec Positive THIS IS BEFORE THE MAY 1st UPDATE!  Please see my video here for a review, as it'll show what time to go to for the review; talking allowed me to elaborate on my thoughts:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQhA6nGujJw&feature=youtu.be
Date 2017-05-08 Playtime 8h 1m Rec Positive Fun with friends. HUGE downside, you can't drop items your friends might need and you cannot get any of their items if they die. Bigfoot should run away from you if you put enough damage into him. He wont stop till he gets a hit off on you, which kinda sucks. That or add about 3 more medkits into the map. Four players would also be a huge improvement. Also the jumping animation is super silly. Keep it.
Date 2017-05-07 Playtime 1h 47m Rec Negative this game is probably not fixed so we cant play this game  
Date 2017-05-07 Playtime 56h 59m Rec Positive i hopw it will come a character maker in this game
Date 2017-05-07 Playtime 8h 11m Rec Positive Amazing Game, very spooky
Date 2017-05-06 Playtime 11h 25m Rec Negative Really fun in the start but it gets boring and repetetive after a while, i know it's early acces but don't pay 16 euros for this
Date 2017-05-06 Playtime 187h 33m Rec Positive This is a very cool game.  I am going to play the game this weekend and keep playing it until I get bigfoot in the cage,  I do not know how easy it will be just me playing but I will find out.   I made a mistake in my earlier review, I thought I killed bigfoot and the game ended before I could do anything, when in fact I was the one who died  in the game.  I thought I saw bigfoot go down on the ground.  So I will keep plugging away at bigfoot until he goes down.
Date 2017-05-06 Playtime 6h 51m Rec Positive Jeez where do I start with this game. Well, I guess start on my experience.  The game is great and brilliant. Very unique and isn't one of those indie titles that runs like pure shit. This game actually runs rather well - being in beta and all. The developers are also very friendly. (if that matters lol)  So the game is really fun with another player and it's even more fun with 3 players.    I really hope this game gains more traction and gets more publicity - I can see a bright future for this game already.
Date 2017-05-05 Playtime 6h 23m Rec Positive >launched bigfoot >started playing with a friend >walking around >lightning strikes >shit myself  in all seriousness the £11 or whatever seemed too much but after playing it was so worth it, seeing that theyre looking to add more stuff to it makes me happy that i didnt refund it, and its totally worth it, play it at night with lights off an with friends for the best experience.
Date 2017-05-05 Playtime 7h 31m Rec Positive It is a very good game ! I recommend it to all of you guys it is very enjoyfull when you play with your friends !
Date 2017-05-05 Playtime 7h 35m Rec Positive fun game to play with friends, cant wait for it be a full release.

Date 2017-05-05 Playtime 139h 46m Rec Positive BIGFOOT ....  Big Wandering MANIAC MONKEY   That wants to eat all your Banana Looking Friends !!!
Date 2017-05-05 Playtime 8h 39m Rec Positive Whell what can I say about this game it defo feels like an indie game it is unique and fun.  I got to give it to the devs that they did not pull a Ubisoft you get what you see. I played the game straight for 8 hours and yet still want to play more defo worth £12  It do get a bit boring after playing all day as long as you have friends to play with you can come up with new ideas to enjoy the game like hiding seek or deathmatch but you will end up going hunting bigfoot again.  There really is not any game braking bugs for what I have seen even tho it is in baeta.  What I would like to see change.  More ammo for the flare gun just love using that thing. Able to make a room with no password. Able to pick up dead teammate items. In game chat

Date 2017-05-03 Playtime 8h 28m Rec Positive Игра крутяк
Date 2017-05-03 Playtime 23h 57m Rec Positive 挺好玩的游戏只是内容比较少
Date 2017-05-02 Playtime 9h 25m Rec Positive I love this game. I genuinely don't know what separates it in my mind from many other games like it on Steam, but it's one I keep finding myself coming back to. Maybe it's the Developers frequent communication and updates, maybe it's the sheer terror I feel from finding Bigfoot when I'm running low on flares and health. But this is a great game that manages to still terrify time and time again.  If you want to see some of these terrifying moments for yourself feel free to watch my Highlight video below! https://youtu.be/YZRBqhUIcs8
Date 2017-05-02 Playtime 17h 18m Rec Positive Très bon jeu avec un fort potentiel. Vivement la prochaine MAJ ! Bravo à vous !
Date 2017-05-01 Playtime 13h 36m Rec Positive vraiment un très bon jeu
Date 2017-05-01 Playtime 10h 19m Rec Positive First off, i would like say that I love this game! Now that I got that off my chest there are two things  I want to talk about in my review: My overall impression of the game, and what i think should be added to the game.  I enjoyed this game so much that I felt it was neccesary to write a review, which I dont oftenly do.        I supose the biggest reason I enjoy this game so much has to do with the fact that ever since I was a young boy, I was fascinated with cryptids, and bigfoot. So, naturally it hits pretty close to home. This game is deffinetly something you should buy if you're into the following: hunting, shooting, tom clancy style survalinece, mythical creatures, something to play with the friends. Then I highly suggest buying this game. The price is too high for early access, but with the way the game is going, its well worth the price.      As for what I think should be added to the game.    Here is a indepth list:  -the ability to hunt deer for meat -more places to find ammo and health -new maps and challenges  -a variety of new guns and equipment -differnet types of said bigfoot -more deer/animals around the map -challenges for replayibilty -possibly tone down bigfoot's strength  With all these things said in mind, I hope the devs. can bring more to the gameplay.      Keep up the great work on this wonderful game!
Date 2017-05-01 Playtime 8h 31m Rec Positive If you're wondering whether to purchase this game then read on! I have 5.5 hours or so in Bigfoot all in all and it definitely does not feel like a beta to me. This game is well and truly optimised and if you're considering playing alone then i would think again. This is designed for co-op + 1. A maximum of 3 players and multiplayer will make the game much more interesting to play. many jump scares are to be had and a few objectives are set into place for you to find/achieve.   Ultimately the goal here is to catch and kill bigfoot then capture him and put him the cage attached to your trailer. I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who likes horrors etc. The game has great replay value and some what addictive.  You start off in the caravan and have all of your essentials to take before heading out, weapons, traps, cameras, flares etc. It's very easy to get used too and doesn't take long to understand the game mechanics. IFyou want to see what this game is truly about then check out the link below. Thanks for Checking out this review.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHbVCtR_ggE
Date 2017-05-01 Playtime 0h 29m Rec Negative My game crashes upon starting single player. I can hear noise but i cant play and then it crashes and gives me a error message. I am running on Bootcamp windows 10 on a macbook air Any suggestion will be greatly apreciated 
Date 2017-04-30 Playtime 10h 14m Rec Positive Ganz nice!  Am Anfang ist es auch zielmich gruselig, wenn man Bigfoot zum ersten mal begegnet. Dieser Gruselfaktor verfliegt allerdings leider recht schnell. Es wäre also ganz schön, wenn man weitere Elemente einbauen würde oder noch eine größere Story hinzufügen würde. Außerdem ist es schade, dass man seinen Spielstand nicht speichern kann, jedenfalls jetzt noch nicht.
Date 2017-04-30 Playtime 0h 44m Rec Negative This game seemed appealing almost as if it was calling out my name. I am a big coop and horror fan (when done correctly) and I think this game lacks in both the entertainment factor and the horror portion. I bought this with a friend and believed we might have a blast and ATLEAST play for 10 hours. What we discovered within the entrails of this game was truly terrifying. The first thing we discerned was the poor framerate, I have a GTX 1080Ti and I was struggling to get a stable 60 frames. After lowering our settings to get this game look like rubbish we got onto playing. We noticed so many options on what to do; install cameras, traps, and baits to capture bigfoot and bring him home. We placed some of these around the area and faster than you can say WAAAAAA it was night time. We devised a strategy to kill that monstrosity, one would check the camera and the other would stand watch. I was the one standing watch and I did so with bravery and honor, midway through my patrol, I heard a loud growl and I saw this great and ominous creature run towards me. I, of course, shot at him and when both of my shots landed he ran away like a coward! I instantly stopped being afraid as I knew how easy it would be to scare him off. When it turned into the day the fool came back and my friend shot him with a tracking dart as we thought how much of a neat feature that was and we ran after him. We spent near thirty minutes going after him and it was just a dull game of cat and mouse. After he stopped he would get spooked by our near presence and we kept rushing after him. To conclude this long review off I will just say this; The game looks pretty extensive but it's actually really linear and monotonous. If we got bored in 40 minutes imagine the boredom of playing for hours trying to chip at his high health bar. The game is really bad and you should wait to get out of early access before buying this sad excuse of a game that is cowering behind games such as slender and the rake.  5/10
Date 2017-04-30 Playtime 16h 31m Rec Positive This game nearly gave me and my friend a heart attack after playing for 30 minutes. This game has a very, very cool and fun atmostphere. While still scary in the "This is a horrible monster that can kill me before I even yell" sense, its also extremely fun to venture out into the woods, check the cameras at night, hear yells and growls from far across the map then proceed to make a mad dash towards it to try to find the elusive bigfoot.   15$ is a fair pricepoint and after nearly 3 hours me and my friend hadn't even taken bigfoots health to the halfway point. Its a tense game, especially in singleplayer, but multiplayer is where it shines. Such a fun game. Cant wait for the new map to release.
Date 2017-04-29 Playtime 3h 42m Rec Positive this game doesnt work on my computer it is worthless they need to fix the bugs for the game keeps crashing but otherwise it is a good game
Date 2017-04-29 Playtime 1h 1m Rec Positive Me, my mate and my brother.  Took to the wilderness in search of such a beast. What we encountered was horrific. I wet my knickers almost instantly.
Date 2017-04-29 Playtime 24h 14m Rec Positive Fun game to play with 2 other friends. setup traps and cams wait till your about to get pillaged and chase this big monkey down. needs acheivments though
Date 2017-04-29 Playtime 13h 55m Rec Positive Echt een heel leuk spel, een goede combinatie van overleven en jagen
Date 2017-04-29 Playtime 6h 21m Rec Positive El juego está estupendo, le faltaría otro modo de 4vs1 en el que cambie la ia por un jugador, además de añadir más armas o algo q personalice el juego.  Aún así es un buen juego.
Date 2017-04-28 Playtime 13h 42m Rec Positive This game is absolutely AMAZING (taking for granted that you have at least 1-2 friends xd) It's loads of fun, packs some nice jumpscares, condones and requires teamwork and feels very rewarding when you make progress (skill wise, compared to previous expeditions) this game was recommended to me by one of my teammates. I have to admit i enjoyed every second of this game (hey just a tip, don't bitch about who won't get a gun, you'll find more soon)
Date 2017-04-28 Playtime 19h 49m Rec Positive Depois de horas e mais horas assustando com raios e trovões nesse jogo tenho que dizer: QUE JOGO MARAVILHOSO!
Date 2017-04-28 Playtime 16h 36m Rec Positive I swear this is what Evolve should have been. It still needs alot of work and, but I guess thats what early access is (supposed) to be for. I rate this game PRIMO/10. GET HER DONE BRO!  UPDATE: Finally solo caught Bigfoot. This game is the best. I guess the only problem I can come up with is that some parts of the game are quite unpolished(the rifle , for example). Would like to some sort of melee weapon, as well. Other than that, this game is awsome.
Date 2017-04-28 Playtime 6h 40m Rec Positive Great fun to play with friends but the game loses its scariness after a while, hopefully future updates will change this
Date 2017-04-28 Playtime 4h 37m Rec Positive it looks like fun from what ive seen but i cant load into a game without it crashing. fix it so that game doesnt crash when your on the loading screen
Date 2017-04-27 Playtime 23h 11m Rec Positive Klar es ist Early Access aber es macht sehr viel Spaß! Es hat definitv noch eine Menge Potenzial die sie ausschöpfen können! Ich empfehle es vor allem für Streamer da es echt ein Hammer Erlebniss ist mit 3 Leute durch die Büsche du Sprinten um nicht als Futter des Bigfoots zu landen! :D Kauft es euch!
Date 2017-04-27 Playtime 0h 10m Rec Negative I really like the idea of this game so I purchased it... Started it and played with the controls that are unchangable and made from a right handed gamer. Perhaps when they fix that I will buy it again and retry but for now it goes on the refund block.
Date 2017-04-27 Playtime 48h 39m Rec Negative Bigfoot è un titolo promettente che ci mette nei panni di cercatori della famosa creatura. Carina la possibilità di piazzare telecamere per visionare i movimenti del Bigfoot, anche se inevitabilmente si useranno esclusivamente in combine con le trappole per capire su quale di queste è capitata la bestia. Lo shooting è migliorabile, non hai la sensazione effettiva di sparare a qualcosa. Il gioco inoltre deve essere ancora ben ottimizzato, presenti molti cali di frame improvvisi, collisioni rivedibili e così via. Al momento non mi sento di consigliarlo, il prezzo è troppo alto per lo stato attuale del gioco.
Date 2017-04-27 Playtime 17h 12m Rec Positive wont let me play keeps crashing
Date 2017-04-26 Playtime 4h 45m Rec Negative i bought the game but it will crash every time i try to play
Date 2017-04-26 Playtime 1h 12m Rec Negative Fun game but definitely not worth more than 5 bucks.
Date 2017-04-26 Playtime 4h 46m Rec Positive Played for a little bit and it's pretty scary! Pretty decent graphics and gameplay for current asking price of only $15.99. I like the options of setting up cameras and traps throughout the map.
Date 2017-04-25 Playtime 0h 17m Rec Negative shit game
Date 2017-04-25 Playtime 22h 32m Rec Positive fantastic game but with that said i think it could use some improvment. One thing i would like to see is the ability to revive a  downed player. I would also like to see friendly fire turned off, not being able to shoot and kill other players in your group. And for last i would like to see it being a smidge easier to kill bigfoot. But over all the game is fantastic, the graphics are superb and i just cant seem to quit playing it. I am looking forward to future updates, keep up the good work!
Date 2017-04-25 Playtime 3h 42m Rec Positive Bigfoot is a pussy.
Date 2017-04-25 Playtime 0h 44m Rec Negative jaimerait etre rembourcer car il ne marche pas
Date 2017-04-24 Playtime 61h 13m Rec Positive J'ai un bug qui fait que je peut pas utilisé le fusil ou le pistoler de détresse ni passer d'une caméra a l'autre sur le pc mais sinon se qui serait bien sa serait de rajouter le fait que quand on tire dans la ou les jambes du bigfoot il court moins vite ou que quand on lui tire dans la tete il pert plus de vie et aussi qu'il perd du sang en continu pour pouvoir le suivre et le traquer sa serait vraiment bien mais sinon le jeu est deja super.

Date 2017-04-18 Playtime 10h 37m Rec Positive This game is a great game. Not only are the grafics great but the gameplay always keeps you on edge wich alows a very good expireience of the game. If you want a game that is difficult play this one .    (P.S. Get the copywrites for the game to change it back to finding bigfoot)
Date 2017-04-18 Playtime 6h 59m Rec Positive Игра хорошая, го Ее потянет только хороший компьютер
Date 2017-04-18 Playtime 0h 23m Rec Negative i cant get onto the game because it syas this c++ thing and i download it and still doesnt work
Date 2017-04-18 Playtime 1h 21m Rec Negative [edit 16.08.2018]  nach den update anfang august ist es immer noch der selbe crap wie vorher was auch nicht anders zu erwarten war falls denn mal überhaupt ein update erscheint.. der sound ist richtig mieß und die atmosphäre ist absolut billig.  [edit 19.01.2018]  es wurden mal wieder ein paar lächerliche screenshots veröffentlicht, darunter schreibte ich das das game tot ist und man es sich nicht kaufen soll... wegen diesen kommentar wurde ich aus den forum verbannt.. zahlende kundschaft wird scheinbar bei jeglicher kritik von euch kleinen lichtern mundtot gemacht.. auch hier nochmals kauft euch dieses game nicht, kauft euch ne kiste bier davon. das game ist tot  [edit 13.11.2017]  kauft euch diesen datenmüll NICHT!!! das spiel ist TOT!! das einzigste regelmäßige was kommt sind keine updates sondern terminverschiebungen und leere versprechen vom release.. diesen screenshots sollte man besser keinen glauben schenken ich zumindest zweifel stark an der echtheit.. das spiel wird in den nächsten jahren nicht fertig werden falls überhaupt noch daran gearbeitet wird.. nehmt das geld und kauft euch ne kiste bier aber bitte nicht diesen von toilettenfachkräften entwickelten datenabfall!!    _____________________ also ich muss sagen das das spiel im aktuellen zustand nicht wirklich was mit horror/survival zutun hat aber was nicht ist wird mit sicherheit noch werden. bin von ständigen rumlaufen fast eingeschlafen und wo ich dann bigfoot sah fande ich es ehr lustig als spannend bzw gruselig. 16 euro für dieses spiel (im jetzigen stadium) sind meiner meinung nach maßlos übertrieben. aber ich hoffe mal das die entwickler noch zahlreiche updates nachliefern in den nächsten monaten/jahren. ich denke das wird mal ein richtig geiles game werden. ich würde gerne einen neutralen daumen geben dies geht aber nicht also gibts nen daumen nach unten wegen den viel zu hohen preis! als alternative würde ich the forest empfehlen das ist auch early acces und man bekommt wesentlich mehr fürs geld geboten.
Date 2017-04-18 Playtime 1h 40m Rec Negative this game never downloads, it keeps saying it needs to download C++2015, it does. when i openit agian, it says uninstall.WHAT DO I DO?!!?!!?!?!?!?!
Date 2017-04-17 Playtime 26h 47m Rec Positive this game was very ver nice  1. you can play onilne 2. is monster fighting you and thats was good 3. you can tack some gun and items 4. you can make a youtuber bigfoot 5. and you can kill bigfoot and you done the game i like like this game.
Date 2017-04-17 Playtime 8h 32m Rec Positive I'v always wanted a bigfoot game,  great graphics, looks like an awesome update is underway, love it! <3
Date 2017-04-17 Playtime 20h 55m Rec Positive great game , worth the money
Date 2017-04-17 Playtime 16h 50m Rec Positive Bigfoot molested me in his cave. 10/10 would enjoy this again.
Date 2017-04-17 Playtime 1h 38m Rec Negative This game is just too simplistic in its current state. The graphics are decent, optimization is pretty good for me, but the gameplay is lacking. The idea of cameras is cool until you find that there is literally zero use for using them. The traps are useless, and it just comes down to chasing him everywhere doing nothing. I can see how down the line it could be more fun, but right now I do not recommend.
Date 2017-04-17 Playtime 6h 24m Rec Negative just no, this game makes no sense and is boring. dont buy it save your money
Date 2017-04-17 Playtime 24h 19m Rec Positive They just had to change their name, I think Finding Bigfeet would have been a better idea, just saying. Fun game though and scary too. Fukn lighting will get you hehheh.
Date 2017-04-17 Playtime 107h 20m Rec Positive Smooth Game, Fun to play and mess around in. One thing i think should be switched is that if you create a game you should not have to have a password on it. There should be more variety as guns aswell.
Date 2017-04-16 Playtime 12h 15m Rec Positive Love the game! It's scary and really cool! I'm really hyped for the new update to hopefully come out next month!
Date 2017-04-16 Playtime 3h 28m Rec Positive my game keeps crashing whenever i start it i heard this was a good game but i cant even play it i hope this can be fixed soon because right now i feel as if i just wasted my money on nothing
Date 2017-04-16 Playtime 1h 39m Rec Negative Now first of all i have to say that the price is too much compared to the current state of the game. But other than that i enjoyed it, this game keeps you on edge all the time!   I also have to say that i wouldn't recommend buying this game at it's current state until the devs. release the upcoming major update which will bring alot of new and exciting stuff, and of course performance optimisation.  Just wait until the developers release the new patch.
Date 2017-04-16 Playtime 3h 5m Rec Positive 現在の時点では何度もプレイしているとパターン化され、だんだんと飽きてきます。 しかし、１ヶ月以内に大型アップデートが来ます。 その内容は、 ・セーブができるようになる ・ゲームメニューが変わる・ゲーム内でチャットが出来るようになる ・最大４人でプレイできるようになる ・新しい動物が来る（狼） ・新しい武器 ・装備をソーラー充電できるようになる ・プレーヤーはテントを建てれる様になり、夜になったら眠ることが出来る ・狼が追加されるが、特に夜になると危険となる ・タブレットが追加され、マップが見れる。また、カメラとドローンを操作できる ・新しいエンジンを取り込むことで、グラフィックス、パフォーマンスが向上する ビッグフットの変化 ・ビッグフットの新型 ・ビッグフットのアニメーションが４０個追加される ・洞窟で眠ることにより、体力を回復させる ・鹿を狩るようになる ・木からプレーヤーを攻撃するようになる ・こそこそ待ち伏せして攻撃してくる ・活発的に二人以上のプレイヤーを相手に戦う ・プレーヤーを２、３メートル投げる ・プレーヤーの１人をさらう 冬のマップ ・豪雪 ・広い領域 ・深い洞穴 ・ランダムなイベント  というように、あと１ヶ月以内に追加されるアップデートでかなり内容が濃くなり絶対に面白くなると思います。 迷っている人はアップデートがくるまで待つというのもありでしょうが、アップデートで人気が出ると商品の値上げ、という可能性が無いわけではないので、是非今のうちに買ってはどうでしょうか！会社の資金にもなり、より多くのアップデートも来ると思います。 いづれにせよ１ヶ月も経たないうちにアップデートがくるので、今から始めて慣れておくというのも有りではないでしょうか！ 今後の期待も兼ねて高評価です！！  もし宜しければ動画を出しているので見て下さい！↓ https://youtu.be/WTLNKm9t-LY
Date 2017-04-16 Playtime 48h 54m Rec Positive Is it fun? Yeah, both singleplayer and multiplayer Is it scary? Yes it is, singleplayer is really scary but multiplayer is mostly fun I can't wait for future updates for this game, it's going to be really awesome when the new map comes out
Date 2017-04-16 Playtime 62h 47m Rec Positive Très bon jeu le concept est génial ! Pour ceux qui ne peuvent pas saisir le fusil (touche "2"), il suffit d'ajouter l'Anglais en langue supplémentaire dans votre windows et de faire Alt + Maj pour basculer sur le clavier Anglais.
Date 2017-04-16 Playtime 0h 15m Rec Negative I can't play the game. I've got an azerty keyboard and you van't change controls. It doesn't work with a controller...  Please do something, I've lost 16€ for nothing!!!!
Date 2017-04-15 Playtime 2h 36m Rec Positive I am completely redoing my review of this game, Oh boy has this game changed. When this game first released it was clunky bugged game that for a bit looked like it was going to be abandoned by it's developers. Bigfoot was not looking good for a bit with all these issues. Finally, after a long wait the finally had a huge update for the game and they worked on so much. I see now why it took so long to make all these updates, they fixed all lot of bugs and completely fixed Bigfoot. I haven't played that much, but the little bit I have were fun, they fixed this game up so much and i'm glad the developers didn't ditch the game like I thought they would. I totally recommend this game for anyone that likes to have fun and it's way better if you have a friend to play with.
Date 2017-04-15 Playtime 10h 56m Rec Positive What to say about BigFoot.......This game is great....for about an hour. The Jump scares in this thrilling tail about finding, killing bigfoot are just AMAZING! the fact that He hunts you at night is great as well, becasue you sure as heck can't find that dude in the the daylight, EVEN tho the game says you can. BUTTTTTT after you injure him He just stops attacking the camper at night. THAN if because great. NO not really. It is really off puttng and I shot my teammate and ran over a bear trap untill I was dead......  
Date 2017-04-15 Playtime 5h 28m Rec Positive I like the idea but u cant change the key binds or the mouse sensitivity but it does work well in game
Date 2017-04-14 Playtime 14h 37m Rec Positive Great game! Can't wait for update. Designed very well. Low supplies are a good thing because it balances out multiplayer and means you have to use them wisely. Every night I shake and quiver in the caravan, see him running from the swamp, think I am safe, but then he leans in and bloody mauls me to death. He also eats deer heads. When you think you are safe, thunder strikes and scares you to death, or a deer waves his behind at you in the camera, or makes orgasmic sounds, distracting you so u get slaughtered by bigfoot.   10/10 would get distracted by deer and then slaughtered by bigfoot again!
Date 2017-04-14 Playtime 9h 41m Rec Positive This is a great game, i could tell even though i only have 54 minuted of play time. The beast (bigfoot) is pretty scary, its not like one of those plush toys walmart thinks is going to scare you. The story is nice aswell and can be played mnay ways, theres no one way of catching bigfoot and even if you do manage to catch him you can play again and try a different stratedgy. Overall i would highly reccommend this game!
Date 2017-04-13 Playtime 1h 14m Rec Positive it will not let me play the game because i have to install something ive already installed
Date 2017-04-13 Playtime 1h 8m Rec Positive crashes as soon as you start to load map
Date 2017-04-13 Playtime 1h 28m Rec Positive crashes whenever i start a new game or load a game plz fix
Date 2017-04-12 Playtime 6h 9m Rec Positive It's definitely an early access game, some avatar movement looks a little weird, a little glitchy sometimes, but overall concept and execution is great. Played it for a couple hours straight and it's pretty easy to lose track of time in pursuit. I'd definitely recommend playing this as co-op
Date 2017-04-12 Playtime 3h 33m Rec Positive Sympa... j'attends de me plonger dedans réellement... très beau jeu pour l'instant un peu vide mais bon... c'est qu'un Early Access. Et le défi d'aller chasser le Sasquatch... :)  Edit numéro 1: un peu de variation au niveau des armes ce serait sympa. SVP pourquoi pas aussi un pistolet ou encore un gros magnum avec des balles lourdes. Ou encore la possibilité d'avoir un sniper... Parce qu'une carabine c'est bien mais ça suffit pas pour massacrer un de ces grands chimpanzés mutants! :) Mais l'ambiance du jeu est vachement sympa. Une musique un peu plus élaborée serait sympa. Il y a de grosses mises à jour. Pour l'instant, je recommande car pas trop gourmand sur le prix (22 dolls c'est ok). Mais si c'est la version définitive là ça va changer...
Date 2017-04-12 Playtime 2h 40m Rec Positive 值得发展的游戏，50多虽说有点贵，但是就当支持一下作者吧
Date 2017-04-12 Playtime 51h 31m Rec Positive THIS GAME IS SO SCAREY AND I LOVE IT
Date 2017-04-11 Playtime 4h 5m Rec Negative sehr schlecht  
Date 2017-04-11 Playtime 65h 23m Rec Positive I am giving this game a second review. I previously gave this a game a thumbs down mainly for the lack of replayability and game breaking bugs. But with this new update they rolled out..? Bigfoot is back, and better than ever! This game has the potential to be incredibly fun, especially with friends now that you can play as bigfoot.  Hats off to the developers, this update is incredible.
Date 2017-04-11 Playtime 0h 45m Rec Negative I downloaded it, launched it and then crashed. over and over and over again
Date 2017-04-10 Playtime 14h 8m Rec Positive Il faut impérativement changer les commandes! je n'arrive pas à les moddifier
Date 2017-04-10 Playtime 18h 41m Rec Negative Good game overall, definitely worth playing. But ...and there's a huge but.. I almost gave a thumbs up straight away, until this: to the devs, PLEASE add invert Y axis . Some of us have played that way since birth and are pilots. Its very hard for me to adequately play and immerse when there are literally no control options. Good work so far...but come on guys, its 2017, I know you can do better than this ;). (Control wise). I also totally understand that there are only 2 of you, my brother and I have solo'd stuff together before as well.  I love the atmosphere of this game, I WANT to continue playing it . The music is inviting to horror lovers and the like. Albeit , my first run felt irrationally challenging, as bigfoot attacked me nearly dead about 30 seconds after night fall from my trailer (whilst still aquainting with controls).  I would love to recommed this to EVERYONE, and I honestly am still spreading the word to an extent, but with extreme caution. Many of us do not play cookie cutter basic controls like everyone else. For example, I use F for action instead of E, as a standard. But I don't care about the buttons NEARLY as much as the invert Y axis ability.  Regardless of this disappointing control problem, I am still playing your game and programming my brain to play standard look temporarily.   In any event, I will not be buying another set of copies until controls are added to the game. Give me a reason to thumbs up, I want to! :)  Update : Controls fixed . Lots of cool stuff added to game. DC is a problem. But promising game overall! People often leave the game when they die after hours of commitment . You need to add penatlies for leaving the game.  OK...i hate to do this...but the multplayer I SO UNSTABLE YOU CANNOT PLAY AT ALL!!!! Devs like this should be sued and fined to the point of oblivion. I have not completed ONE GAME SINCE REINSTALLIING AND PLAYING ALL NIGHT BECAUSE YOU ARE THIS BAD.  The disconnect is AWFUL. fix it. Or I'll demand a refund.
Date 2017-04-10 Playtime 6h 48m Rec Positive not too bad the few jumpscares were good but the damn lightning striking the tree with my headphones turned up scared me more then anything.  Coming from me this is and was better then the rake hopefully the devs will continue work to improve this one

Date 2017-04-09 Playtime 0h 17m Rec Negative I wanna play this game, but every time I open it. The game crashes and closes out to send you an error report. please fix this.
Date 2017-04-09 Playtime 0h 36m Rec Negative 16€ nur für die Early Ecess ausgeben und dann funktioniert es nicht mal richtig.Ich komm nur bis zum Ladescreen,manchmal kommen auch Sounds,aber dann stürzt das Spiel wieder ab.Ich hab auch schon versucht,alles auf Medium oder LOw bzw. Off zu stellen,aber dennoch.Muss ich noch irgendwas anderes machen oder vielleicht sogar ein bestimmtes Programm installieren,damit es funktioniert?
Date 2017-04-09 Playtime 10h 43m Rec Negative game play boring cant save and crashes
Date 2017-04-09 Playtime 36h 2m Rec Positive 6/5 giant ape chasing would play again
Date 2017-04-09 Playtime 2h 58m Rec Positive A friend of mine wanted this as a birthday present, and because of the multiplayer, I bought myself a copy as well. I could not have been more surprised. From the outside it seems like annother steam early access game that was made in Unity in just a few hours, however, it's actually a quite absorbing and puzzling game. My freinds and I spent an fternoon trying out different combonations of cameras and traps, and different places to hunt and spend the night on the map. It's clear that real care has gone into making the map interesting to explore with all kinds of secrets to discover. I cannot wait to see what else the developers have planned for this game. Please make the snowy map have a yeti.
Date 2017-04-09 Playtime 2h 41m Rec Negative This game blows. I literally played this game for HOURS and didn't even catch the fckr. This was a complete waste of my time and money. If you are considering buying this game please don't, unless you are completely brian dead :D
Date 2017-04-08 Playtime 0h 30m Rec Negative for some reason it wouldn't load at all. 
Date 2017-04-08 Playtime 17h 2m Rec Positive Fun and addictive game would recommend to paly with friends though

Date 2017-04-07 Playtime 8h 23m Rec Negative kinda like the rake game wait till the full game is released to buy/check it out.
Date 2017-04-07 Playtime 6h 0m Rec Positive p
Date 2017-04-07 Playtime 23h 46m Rec Negative I have previously made a review saying this game is one of the best games i have played all year. while this is true the joy was short lived. The problem with this game is not the game itself however it is the developers. Since releasing this game they have added little to no content to the game. In my honest opinion they have released this game too soon because they are not adding thing. I know this game is early acess but it does not mean they should wait 6-8 months to add content. What they should do is roll updates out periodically. Instead they are trying to COMPLETELY change the visuals and gameplay. Since this game is going to be completely different why was it released in the first place. Now don't get me wrong i am deeply excited for the update (which should of came out this month) but i'm and tired of the wait. What happens if they release this "MASSIVE" update and there end up being huge amount of bugs? will they wait another 6 months to fix them? From the pictures they have posted the new map and game togethor look AMAZING. they say they have added wolves and 40 new animations for bigfoot. Yet they dont want to release all of it yet cause they have more to add. Now i Believe this updated may even be worth the wait, but i think that the amount of changes mean they werent as pleased with the original game and in fact should have never released it this early. some people can't even get on the gamed and i dont even know if they have fixed that. I payed 15 dollars for a game that is currently worth 5 (however i didnt nor do i now really mind spending it) and they are trying to turn it into one worth 45. With NO content added in 3-6 months, don't really remember when this game came out tbh just remember waiting for the INFAMOUS update, who is to say they wont finish what they are doing now and have another idea for the game and postpone the update another 4 months. This is worse than delaying the game itself because we are stuck with an unfinished game that was played a total of 5 hours for most people and is gathering dust in our steam librarys. Stop making promises and just do whjat you are gonna do. im gonna have to thumbs down because even though the game is fun people will soon realise the developers are spewing out false flags.
Date 2017-04-07 Playtime 69h 37m Rec Positive por favor saquen bigfoot mode (Please take out bigfoot mode) y la camara fantasma (And the ghost camera) y que podamos ver el bigfoot cuando morimos(And that we can see the bigfoot when we die) esto lo más importante que la cámara fantasma que vaya en cualquier parte donde queramos 👇 (This is more important than the phantom camera that goes wherever you want 👆)
Date 2017-04-07 Playtime 10h 13m Rec Negative It was fun when i first bought it, but when you play it more often, it just gets boring, i spent ages waiting for Bigfoot to show up and I'm suprised the game has Friendly Fire in it, which is going to be abused by trolls in the game.
Date 2017-04-06 Playtime 14h 48m Rec Positive Very fun with friends on the Group Expedition mode. On Solo Expedition its kinda creepy but once you start to make jokes to yourself you wont be as scared.
Date 2017-04-06 Playtime 0h 26m Rec Negative wouldn"t suggest....     this game crashes when you try to play. it say"s that it crashed and told me to let it install some stuff. but if i got to play this game i would probably give it top marks.
Date 2017-04-06 Playtime 1h 30m Rec Positive 【气氛】 恐怖的气氛烘托的还不错，无论是从突发性还是那种阴森的感觉都还可以，就是怪物出现的方式比较单一，多来几次感觉有点傻。  【节奏】 就一个字，慢！虽然怪物的叫声会吓你一下，但是玩多了也就那样，最重要的怪物根本不会出现，隔很久才会出来一次，而且很快就会跑掉，然后你怎么找都找不到，很麻烦，而且大部分的时候，你都是在漫无目的散步，不知道该干嘛，特别是你把所有道具都拾取之后，你就完全可以挂机等怪物上门了。  【道具】 监视器很不错，可以让你有一种窥视的感觉，但是更多的却是只能用来窥视队友在干嘛，基本上看不到怪物。 信号弹贼耀眼，除了闪瞎你的氪金狗眼以外，基本没有任何卵用，[spoiler]或许你可以用来召唤直升飞机？[/spoiler] 至于生肉，恕我完全无法理解这个道具，虽然我觉得可能用来勾引怪物的，但问题是，还有什么比玩家自己更能勾引怪物？ 还有那个夜视仪，我想说，那一片绿油油的视角，我真的宁愿开手电。 结果最后最有用的居然是那个手电，还有那个医疗包，果然传统恐怖游戏道具才是王道。 [spoiler]差点忘了还有绳子这个道具，但是我确实一次都没有用到它，所以我也不得而知有什么用。[/spoiler]  最后的最后我还是退款了，只是因为我和我朋友挂机了将近一个小时都没有打掉这个怪物，我们真的是很尽力了，但是不是我们输出不够，而是怪物基本上就不出来，找都找不到，所以我放弃了。如果游戏后期能添加更多的元素，让节奏变得更加紧凑，不至于让玩家茫然漫无目的，或许我会考虑重新游戏。
Date 2017-04-06 Playtime 24h 26m Rec Positive with the new update it made my game run at 3 to 15fps on lowest settings please fix this.
Date 2017-04-06 Playtime 11h 5m Rec Positive Gameplay is Awesome. Ingore all the haters who complain that they can not run the game. For those who says it gets boring. Play with friend over internet. If you get bored doing that find some new friends to play with. Then if THAT bores you, you need to rethink playing ANY games. LOVE THIS GAME!!!
Date 2017-04-06 Playtime 9h 36m Rec Positive this is really very good
Date 2017-04-06 Playtime 4h 16m Rec Positive this game wont even load it just crshes before i can play but it probably just needs some work
Date 2017-04-06 Playtime 0h 49m Rec Negative Does not work as soon as you try to play a game it crashes
Date 2017-04-05 Playtime 8h 17m Rec Positive Improvement Possibilities: 1: Add a mode for there to be 2 bigfoots. (Bigfeet?) And extra traps/ammo to compensate. The game would be much scarier if while you were tracking one bigfoot, the looming threat of another nearby kept you weary. 2: More wildlife (I know you already have this in the works) Deer are one thing, but birds that give away bigfoot, or aligators in the swamp would be interesting. 3: An unlockable map (later on in production) that has you hunting a mythical creature other than bigfoot, perhaps the chupacabra. 4: Make it to where we have the option of uping the difficulty. (2 hits then dead, bigfoot hunts you at night instead of runs away after one swing.)  Overall im excited to play the final product and the new map. wolves will be fun to dodge and kill.

Date 2017-04-05 Playtime 0h 47m Rec Negative Not as expected. Game was boring 20 mins in to be honest.
Date 2017-04-05 Playtime 3h 39m Rec Positive This is a really nice game for my first 2 and a half hours playing this, I can't wait for the next update and this is a really great game for Finding Bigfoot, Mountain Monsters and Alaska Monsters Fans!! 5 stars
Date 2017-04-05 Playtime 0h 24m Rec Negative This game is basically the rake but with Bigfoot it's kind of boring
Date 2017-04-05 Playtime 1h 38m Rec Positive Very Good Game!! I trust the up and coming updates that they will make to the game and I can't wait to see what they do with the game because it is so good! The whole out look of the game and finding the mysterious BigFoot is awesome and creepy at the same time! It is a must buy!!
Date 2017-04-05 Playtime 5h 3m Rec Positive In this game you do exactly as the title says.
Date 2017-04-05 Playtime 17h 50m Rec Positive Overall, this game has an absolute ton of potential.  Two other buddies and I have had a blast screwing around and gettting scared by this game.  It's got a funny theme that can really be brought out with a good group of friends.    Pros: -Creative New Ideas -Cool In game elements  -Funny Jump Scares -Great ideas coming -Tons of room to expand  Cons: -Not a ton of replay value -Some mechanics feel completely useless -Quite repetitive -Long games (2-3 hours for a successful first hunt)  I've played about 2 full games now where a group of two others and myself have successfully captured Bigfoot.  The first time through was quite fun.  The experience was new and we had no idea what to expect.  The second time through took a bit of the fun out of it for me.  There was a lot less stress or worry as the main mechanics were figured out from the first session.  I truly do have high hopes for this game as I could easily name off countless features and additions that I'd love to see added.  Currently the game is fun for a few hunts, then a bit boring.       The Cameras seem completely useless.  They are a really cool idea, but there's simply too few of them to actually make them useful.  The map is pretty large and Bigfoot gets around so quickly that by the time you see him on one camera there's no way to find him again.       Traps seem like a cool idea but again don't seem to work all that well.  In the two hunts, we've only been able to get Bigfoot to run into a trap one time and it was just by coincidence that he ran right over it.        Flares are kinda cool but not really necessary either.  Conclusion: As a fun party type game to play with two others give the game a go.  It's fun and will keep everyone on edge for the first game or two.  Don't expect to get a ton of the game in terms of countless hours of gameplay.  In its current state, it is just simply not that game.  I got what I wanted out of it and as I said, the next patch looks extremely promising!   
Date 2017-04-04 Playtime 1h 14m Rec Positive I just bought the game but it crashes every time I press "New Game". But it is still in beta so it's understandable. Hopefully it won't take long to fix this. Other than that I can't say anything else about it.
Date 2017-04-04 Playtime 2h 3m Rec Negative This game is shit and doesn't work.

Date 2017-04-04 Playtime 9h 55m Rec Negative My game keeps crashing I've uninstalled it about a thousand times i've restarted my computer about a hundred times and done everything I could think of. My friend even helped and couldn't find a solution.This game sucks. Update the game or something to help everyone that has this game crash.
Date 2017-04-03 Playtime 20h 22m Rec Positive In my opinion a very good game, its not an over the top jumpscare fest, cosidering you can see and hear Bigfoot before he attacks you, and it still has a feeling of dread, because while you may think you're hunting Bigfoot, for all you know, he's hunting you.
Date 2017-04-03 Playtime 7h 14m Rec Positive -Strarted the game -Played for some time -Night comes -Lightning strikes -Esc -Quit game 10/10 would play again Great game, it still does need some improvements but otherwise great!

Date 2017-04-03 Playtime 15h 0m Rec Positive Get this beta! For a very early release, this one has a great amount of potential. Make sure you have friends who have this game because public servers do not exist as of right now. 3 player coop max, or solo games are available as of right now. Get this game, play it, test it, and provide feedback!

Date 2017-04-01 Playtime 1h 1m Rec Positive Great game that will scare the hell out of you. bigfoot comes out of nowhere. very fun to play. Guess trying to see bigfoot killing him or traping him in cage is the point of games def recommend if u wanna be scared haha
Date 2017-04-01 Playtime 0h 36m Rec Positive My Game used to crash but is know better
Date 2017-03-31 Playtime 55h 12m Rec Positive Ich liebe den Bigfoot Mythos, demnach entschied ich mich auch ganz spontan zum Kauf des Titels, der so plötzich auf einmal auf meinen Steam - Empfehlungen stand.  Runtergeladen, angeschmissen und nach 5 Minuten zocken total begeistert.  Ziel des spiels ist es, sowohl die auf der ( Riesigen ) Spielwelt verteilten 4 Leichen zu finden, als auch nebenbei, wie sollte es auch anders sein, Bigfoot zu fangen.  Beides hört sich leichter an, als es eigentlich ist.  Die 4 Leichen, sind in jeder neuen Runde anders verteilt, sodass man nie geziehlt die Map nach Spawns ''abgrasen'' kann. Bigfoot selber lässt sich entweder deffensiv bei einem Angriff anschießen, oder offensiv mit Fallen, die der Spieler in der Spielwelt verteilt jagen.  Mit einer ''Bärenfalle'' fügen wir dem haarigen Monster mehr Schaden zu, es ist aber schon sehr schwer, dass Tier in eine Falle zu locken ( soll nicht negativ klingen, ist gut umgesetzt).  Tagsüber hat man Zeit die Fallen zu setzen, sowie Kameras, die man vom Wohnwagen aus steuern und somit die Gegend beobachten kann und Nachts wirds dann richtig heftig .... Mehr möchte ich nicht sagen ...  ;)  Kurz vorab sei gesagt, dass man kein Stundenlanges Gameplay erwarten darf, eine Runde Bigfoot Jagen, hält sich meist für 2 - 3 Stunden.  Loben möchte ich an dieser Stelle den Multiplayer.  Es ist richtig einfach, dass Spiel mit einem Freund zu spielen, die Verbindung läuft ohne Probleme.  Bei dem, was die Entwickler uns noch verprechen, ist da noch viel Luft nach oben, aber für den Preis für das was man geboten bekommt, mehr als Zufrieden.  
Date 2017-03-31 Playtime 0h 59m Rec Negative I don't like this game, it's way too buggy, spelling is all incorrect, my RX480 8GB & Intel Core i5 6600K can't run this game. 
Date 2017-03-31 Playtime 12h 34m Rec Negative Friend pretended to shoot me. I shot him in the head.  I shot bigfoot. Bullet went through bigfoot. Into Friends head. He died.  10/10 Would shoot friend again.  used to think this game was fun......8 months ago. wish it would get updated
Date 2017-03-31 Playtime 7h 34m Rec Positive I pretended to shoot friend. Friend shot me in head. I died.  Friend shot bigfoot. Bullet went through bigfoot, Into my head. I died.  10/10 Would get shot by friend again.

Date 2017-03-30 Playtime 1h 11m Rec Negative It's garbage. Don't support developers who fill the steam store with trash.
Date 2017-03-30 Playtime 6h 47m Rec Positive A good game for early access, needs more content.
Date 2017-03-30 Playtime 12h 25m Rec Positive Lightning is scarier than bigfoot. :'(
Date 2017-03-30 Playtime 27h 21m Rec Positive Been waiting for a game like this for ages, Too fucking good!  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BIGFOOT 2.0 Review Worth the long wait, Been playing it with mates heaps, Loving every second of it, Some real proper spooks from the time you finally get some damage on Bigfoot to the time you die. Here's to more development! <3
Date 2017-03-30 Playtime 8h 35m Rec Positive Good Game, really fun to play alone or with friends, and the graphics for the enviroment are pretty damn good. Everything about this game is good except for two things, your game shouldnt reset whenever you leave it should be a save file, and You cant adjust mouse sensetivity or change controls. Otherwise its a reccomended buy :)
Date 2017-03-29 Playtime 4h 46m Rec Positive Oyun efsane bir oyun ve de BigFoot' un gelip de arabamızı sallaması... oyuna gerçekten gerilim katıyor. Bir anda yükselen bir anırma tarzı bağırış :D Geyiklerin anırmasını hiç söylemiyorum bile. İlk oynadığımda arkadaşıma sormuştum bu KocaAyak mıydı diye. Sonra dan geyik olduğunu öğrendim. (Bu da böyle bir anımdı :D )
Date 2017-03-29 Playtime 39h 52m Rec Positive I've heard that bigfoot/sasquatch bangs rocks against trees to communicate with "other" sasquatches, they are also known to throw logs or rocks if they feel threatended, also they leave foot prints, could set an objective to cast a print as evidence alongside as catching him/her, he's known to sometimes stalk people from a distance due to curisosity but if threatend he will retreat or grow violent. whether in time the hunters can craft anything by using natural material? weapons, traps, camoflauge? just suggestions, but overall i love the game, to say it hasn't been out long, its brilliant.
Date 2017-03-29 Playtime 0h 39m Rec Negative Игра пока ещё сыровата и не стоит своих денег
Date 2017-03-29 Playtime 38h 40m Rec Positive Игра очень отмосферная даже на минимум настройках графики,но требовательна к компу.Своих денег стоит.Всем советую поиграть. Отдельная строка разработчикам: на фургоне есть лестница пожалуйста, сделайте чтобы по ней можно было залазить на фургон.
Date 2017-03-29 Playtime 34h 45m Rec Positive LOT OF FUN AND GREAT PRICE
Date 2017-03-29 Playtime 0h 21m Rec Negative it wont start when i try to loud the game to play it crashes 
Date 2017-03-28 Playtime 0h 34m Rec Negative VERY LAGGY!! 
Date 2017-03-28 Playtime 1h 44m Rec Positive Fucking lightning struck a tree and my party and I about died IRL.
Date 2017-03-28 Playtime 4h 57m Rec Negative Not that great of a game... just my opinion.
Date 2017-03-28 Playtime 33h 39m Rec Positive Well the (ONLY 2 AND I MEAN ONLY 2) I don't like about this game is how my mouse worked while paused and in the main menu, and how you can't ADS (Aim down sights) but from seeing other Youtubers play it I would HIGHLY recommend it.
Date 2017-03-28 Playtime 134h 25m Rec Positive This game is honestly so great and has so much potential. Something wrong with it It's hard to run mate. The graphics have to be all low and still only 10 - 15 fps. 
Date 2017-03-28 Playtime 2h 56m Rec Positive fucking annoyung glitches i would buy and wait for them to fix their shit
Date 2017-03-28 Playtime 14h 38m Rec Positive great game but needs work
Date 2017-03-27 Playtime 1h 49m Rec Positive I really recommend this game even though I can't even play it. It may be completed within an hour but even so, it packs a great punch. The aspect of it is quite scary considering you never know when Bigfoot is gonna show up. However with these pros, come cons. I have tried so much to play this game. I reinstalled it twice which did nothing, I reinstalled my C++ from the Microsoft website, I have even put all my settings to the lowest in the menu to see if that would help. Nothg worked. I have looked in the discussions and many people have this problem. So for the developers, please find a solution to this so I can actually play this game. I am considering returning it if I wont be able to play it since it would be a waste of money. Anyway, if you don't have the same problems as me then you are bound to have a fun time!
Date 2017-03-27 Playtime 12h 0m Rec Positive Was pretty fun after I found out how to run the game
Date 2017-03-27 Playtime 76h 33m Rec Positive Nagyon jó játék csak ajánlani tudom, még fog bőven fejlődni a játék. Multiplayer része még vicces is, ahogy mások játszanak. 10/10 3-4 óra játék időt tesz ki, de lehet több is.
Date 2017-03-27 Playtime 1h 32m Rec Positive Hallo,  ich hatte leider noch nicht das Vergnügen dieses Spiel auszuprobieren, da sich die Bildschirmeinstellungen nicht rückgängig machen lassen, also muss ich jetzt bis zum nächsten Update warten. Schade
Date 2017-03-27 Playtime 125h 19m Rec Positive [h1][b]Yas! 大自然に潜むUMAビッグフットを捕まえろ！[/b][/h1]  [h1]ストーリー[/h1]  イントロダクション  It all started in the spring of 2016. In the Jasper newspapers was the announcement of the loss of a group of tourists in the national park. In the police report, it was just an accident, because the band went to raft on the river. But you sure that there definitely inplicated one of the most elusive creatures, know as Bigfoot or Sasquatch. You and your team of reserchers decide to get to the truth...  それは2016年春におきた出来事だった。Jasper新聞はツーリストグループがJasper国立公園内で行方不明になったと報じた。地元警察の発表ではグループは川を筏（いかだ）で下って起きた事故であるとのこと。しかしFinding Bigfootチームはビッグフットかサスクワッチの仕業ではないかと考えあなたとチームは真実を見つけるために調査をすることに決めた。（適当訳）  ※ビッグフット（英:bigfoot）は、アメリカ合衆国・カナダのロッキー山脈一帯で目撃されるUMA（未確認動物）、または同種のUMAの総称である。先住民（インディアン）の間に伝わるサスクワッチ、サスカッチ（英:Sasquatch）と同一視される場合もある。　[url=https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%93%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0%E3%83%95%E3%83%83%E3%83%88]Wikipediaより[/url]  [h1]ゲーム概要[/h1]  本作はファーストパーソンビュータイプのアドベンチャーゲーム。  スタート時にキャラクター選択ができ男性2タイプ女性1タイプの計3種類から選ぶことができる。  ゲームタイプはソロかグループのいずれかでプレイ可能でグループの場合は第三者のゲームに参加するか、もしくは自らゲームを作成することができる。グループ人数はキャラクター選択できる数から推測するならおそらく最大三人？  制限時間等はない、ゲーム内に時計が存在しない為ゲーム内の一日が実時間のどの程度か分からないがかなり早いテンポで昼夜が巡る。  プレイヤーがビッグフットに倒されるか、プレイヤーがビッグフットを捕獲するまで続く。現時点ではセーブ機能はなく途中終了すればそれまでのプロセスは消滅し、スタートする都度ニューゲームとなる。  スタート地点となる調査チームのキャンピングカー http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=890668885 [h1]ゲームの目的（タスク）[/h1]  ・ビッグフットを見つけ捕える ・捕えたビッグフットをケージに入れる ・行方不明のツーリストたちを探す。  ビッグフット参考画像 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=890855588 [h1]使用できる銃およびアイテム[/h1]  チームキャンピングカー内および森林内で手に入るのは以下  ライフル銃、ライフルの弾、追跡用のライフル用トラッカー弾、照明弾用ピストル、照明弾、監視用赤外線カメラ、トラばさみ、生肉、ナイトビジョンスコープ、ナイトビジョンスコープ用の電池、救急箱、拘束用ロープ  キャンピングカー内に設置した監視カメラの映像を見るためのPCがある。  トラップ参考画像 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=890726137 [h1]ゲームオーバー[/h1]  ・ビッグフットを捕まえケージに入れた場合はハッピーエンド ・ビッグフットに殺された場合はバッドエンド  [h1]個人的感想[/h1]  木々が生い茂り、鹿が往来する美しい[url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/ab/jasper/index.aspx]Japser国立公園[/url]、舞台となるJasper国立公園はカナダに実在する国立公園である。グラフィックは自然の植生がよくできており濃霧や様々な天候の雰囲気が出ててよかった。特に深夜の森や様々な天候イベントの雰囲気・臨場感は◎。 ゲームの内容はとてもシンプルだがプレイヤーが工夫して罠を張り、恐怖しながら夜の森を散策するところにこのゲームをプレイする価値がある。UMAを追い続けるドキュメンタリーが好きな方、オープンワールド、アドベンチャー系が好きな人は是非一度プレイしてほしい。  注意してほしいのは現時点でセーブ機能が実装されてないため途中中断はできない。なのでゲームをプレイする場合は十分な時間が必要になる。（私がソロでビッグフットを捕えた時は6日目の夜、一日昼夜巡るのにそれ相応に時間がかかるため）  息の合った仲間とグループでプレイすれば時間もソロでやるよりコンパクトに収まり一味違った楽しい経験になるかもしれない。  現時点でマップはJasper国立公園一択だがスタート画面にはGlacier Bay National Parkという冬の国立公園も表示されておりComing Soonとなっている。[url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/75839063718798425]公式アップデート予告[/url]では新しい武器、狼や別のUMA（新しいビッグフット）、より豊かなUMAのアクションバリエーション、セーブ機能の実装、新しいマップを予定しているとのこと。とても楽しみです。  ※タイトルでも書いた「Yas」とは綴り間違いなのか意図的なのかは定かではないがゲーム内でYesもしくはNoを選択する際にYesではなくYasと書かれている。
Date 2017-03-27 Playtime 8h 17m Rec Positive This is a really good game. Even though this game, makes your hair at the back of you neck  stand up and makes you jump out of you seat....its still worth it. I rate this 10/10
Date 2017-03-27 Playtime 8h 24m Rec Negative This game is complete trash cant even play multiplayer cause it crashes and cant even play solo CAUSE IT CRASHES
Date 2017-03-27 Playtime 1h 58m Rec Positive So far Iv played like 2 hours and i must admit it was not what I was really expecting. I was expecting cheap game quality like the Rake but when the game started the graphics were beautiful good solid frames and the game itself pretty fleshed out really made me feel like a hunter during the day setting up traps and cameras then at night hiding waiting and stalking feeling like I was game but when you get that first sight of him GAME ON.....this game has good hunting quality and has good Co Op possibilities if you are like me and have good patience and a good eye then I highly recommend this title just as long as you don't compare this to the Rake you should have fun.  Finding Bigfoot is still early access and future game dlc and updates will really make this game feel worthy of a $15 tittle :thumb:
Date 2017-03-27 Playtime 46h 39m Rec Positive Absolutley Amazing.  I was brousing youtube one day, and found something involving a game called finding bigfoot. after i watched vanoss's game play, i thought it would be wise if i convinced my friend to get it. we instantley fell in love. the scares are perfect, the game is just so simple, and the sights are amazing! This is a great game for a resonable price, and i would recomend it to people who are into games that wont scare them to much, yet are terrifying. ( p.s, amazing video camera effects! i love the small details thought the game.)
Date 2017-03-27 Playtime 0h 16m Rec Negative I love how it seems form youtube, But im going to give it a NO until they fix a problem MANY people are having. Many people whether its solo or multi, hosting or joining. They crash as soon as teh finish loading. This is also happenign to me. Untill this is fixed im not going to reccomend it.
Date 2017-03-26 Playtime 3h 23m Rec Positive [h1][b]          Explore uma floresta perigosa cheia de segredos[/b][/h1]  [i]          Finding Bigfoot[/i] é um game de terror e aventura com foco na exploração, tudo se passa após um grupo de turistas desaparecerem em um floresta, a polícia não investigou muito e reportou o desaparecimento como um acidente qualquer, é aí que o game começa. Um grupo de pesquisadores composto por três pessoas acredita que o desaparecimento está relacionado ao grande "mito" Pé Grande e então resolvem partir para o local em busca da verdade.            Ao começar o game, o jogador pode escolher entre três personagens, o objetivo é explorar a floresta para encontrar respostas, capturar o Pé Grande e provar que não é apenas uma lenda. Para isso, contamos com armadilhas, câmeras, uma arma e alguns acessórios para facilitar a busca e captura. O mapa é grande mas não é tão vivo, durante a jogatina foi possível notar apenas a presença de um cervo na floresta, além do Pé Grande.            Os gráficos do são belíssimos, o ciclo do dia é sutil e realístico, há belos efeitos de iluminação e a vegetação reage bem ao vento. A trilha sonora é bastante ausente, não há muito o que dizer sobre ela, a sonorização é simples e não chama atenção. A jogabilidade é simples e fluída, responde muito bem aos comandos, as vezes o jogador irá se deparar com algumas partes do solo "bugadas" onde é possível entrar e ver todo o mapa.            Por se tratar de um [b]game em desenvolvimento[/b], ainda há muitos bugs e pouco conteúdo, o jogo está em constante mudança e muita coisa nova será implementada, por enquanto ele cumpre bem o que promete, há um clima de terror e com certeza consegue deixar o jogador assustado em alguns momentos, [b]talvez o preço esteja um pouco alto se comparado a outros games do gênero com mais conteúdo e um estágio de desenvolvimento mais avançado.[/b] Otimização não é um problema como na maioria dos jogos em acesso antecipado, [i]Finding Bigfoot[/i] está muito bem otimizado.  [*][h1][b]Prós:[/b][/h1] [*]Belos gráficos [*]Boa jogabilidade [*]Ótima ambientação [*]Muito bem otimizado [*]Modo Coop [*]Cartas colecionáveis  [*][h1][b]Contras:[/b][/h1] [*]Pouco conteúdo (ainda em desenvolvimento) [*]Bugs de colisão (ainda em desenvolvimento)

Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 90h 38m Rec Positive pretty good game   nothing scares me one time the tree made me jump some cuz i was like 1 ft from it  need more animals abel to drive the truck  we need that stuff  Pros: -Graphics are really sweet, with a decent level design to support it. -Camera system, traps and being able to hide traps with branches. -Good progression, it takes a while to kill bigfoot but you can also find 4 lost tourists for exploration sake.  cons   -not enough day light time -not enough traping health bullets etc -cant drive truck alot more  cant save game  
Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 12h 49m Rec Positive Spiel hat sich nach den updates echt gut gemacht
Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 7h 22m Rec Positive Ein schönes Spiel, ist aber leider recht schnell zu Ende. Ich habe solo gezockt, aber ich empfehle zu zweit zu spielen.  Der Kaufpreis ist jedoch nicht angemessen, muß aber jeder für sich entscheiden. Wer mit dem Geld knapp ist sollte noch warten.  Eine Langzeitmotivation erkenne ich jedoch nicht, auch wenn noch ein neuer Park hinzu kommt. Die Spannung ist dann raus, auch wenn vielleicht noch  einige Effekte dazu kommen.  Die Grafik ist prima, die Geräusche ganz OK und die Steuerung ist gut.

Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 0h 8m Rec Negative Honestly not worth it, I know its in beta but hell, It does NOT deserve it's spot on the steam store.  4/10
Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 0h 12m Rec Negative The game crashes every time i start it up and my mouse doesn`t show up on my screen.
Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 19h 52m Rec Positive найс
Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 33h 44m Rec Negative So.. I have a very mixed relationship with this game, the graphics of the enviroment are amazing, and the sounds are great. But that's everything that is positive about this game, everything else is just laughable. The models are shitty as hell, the animations look like they've been made by someone who just began to learn how to animate. so is the game worth the 16 Euros at this state? NO IT IS NOT, unless those 16 euros is worth 2-5 hours of fun with your friends, then go for it.  Also, if the gamemakers read this, then let me tell you this. Go back to school and learn some English, because I think I got litteral brain cancer, an aneurysm and permanent autism from reading English this broken. You might aswell just use Google translate, or at least get someone to translate the game for you.
Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 35h 13m Rec Positive Wow , If you want to play a game where you can be walking through the forrest and a sudden bigfoot walks across a cliff infront of you and dosn't spot you. This is the game XD   It is really fun , but supplies are a problem as they are scarce , It is to scary for me to play alone but with friends It is amazing , I loved playing it with others as you feel like a real team. Definatly recommend this game , IT IS the best!  Good Luck.
Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 0h 24m Rec Positive this game is very good, but you need a good powerful computer to run it.  Y ou need al laest a 2.5 Ghz CPU at least 8 gigs ram and a 1.5 gig video RAM card and please god turn all stting to off or medium (there is no low settings).  All and all this is a good to kill  a couple hours on
Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 0h 55m Rec Positive I would say a lot of the gameplay is just walking, but the game has a very unique feel to it and is just a cool game.
Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 7h 46m Rec Positive This game looks like one i would pass by and not enjoy. I have to warn you that this game is amazing! Even in it's beta form it is brilliant and a game that i would buy again.
Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 5h 41m Rec Positive This game is amazing! i recommend this game highly its fun addictive and scary until you learn the mechanics i think they should add more creatures maps andmaybe a gamemode where there are hunters and a person is the bigfoot it would be amazing to see it and i think this game has ALOT of potentiol 
Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 15h 11m Rec Positive this game is great cant wate fir the new map i hope they add in a feater were u can make noises like wood nocks and howls instwead of it trying to attack u u lur it in but sadly unless u got fiends with the game it kinda gets like a bit stale when u beat it the first time but i would recamend.    How and ima actually a sasquatch hunter my self ;)

Date 2017-03-24 Playtime 19h 21m Rec Positive Das Spiel ist richtig cool.Aber es ist schade das man das Equipment nicht aufsammeln/droppen kann. Sonst ist es Klasse
Date 2017-03-24 Playtime 25h 29m Rec Negative good game for 8 play hours but then its geting boring and you dont want to play it anymore .The update that should be so big is wasn´t realesed yet and its one year later so good game for 8 hours but you guys shoudn´t buy it
Date 2017-03-24 Playtime 2h 30m Rec Negative I Never Got to play this game because every time I tryied it would Crash so be Careful is you want to buy it be careful and know what your geting I think it would be a fun game but one again I never got to play it so I guess I want know
Date 2017-03-24 Playtime 2h 57m Rec Positive [h1]Horror Game[/h1] https://youtu.be/sH7tuzvYpN0  + The gameplay is pretty fun. You journey out looking for missing people while also hunting BigFoot. You place traps and security cameras while searching the area trying to get a glimpse of the legendary beast. + A few good jumpscares especially when BigFoot jumps you in the middle of the night. The creature itself is pretty terrifying as well.  + The concept is great, and feels somewhat like a simulator. You go out in the woods looking for BigFoot, just like those crazy redneck TV shows or Youtube videos. + The environment is huge with a lot of ground to explore.  [b]This game is in early access, and these are subject to change[/b] - It takes a considerable amount of time for BigFoot to appear. Someitmes you'll spend over 10mins just wondering around the woods or checking cameras waiting for it to come out which is fairly boring. - BigFoot has a ton of health and moves extremely fast. You have to shoot it like 20 times to take it down which is a bit much in singleplayer since it's constantly running away from you. - BigFoot doesn't do enough to really be a threat. I believe you can get hit 4 times before dying, and BigFoot only attacks once before running off making him less "scary".  ~ I felt like there should be more ways to take out Bigfoot. More traps, tranquilizers, different types of weapons, more ways to lure it out, being able to track his footprints, etc.

Date 2017-03-24 Playtime 12h 52m Rec Negative Neschopný tím vývojárov, pochoval túto hru. Jediné čo robia je že odkladajú vôbec prvý patch tejto hry. Považujem to za SCAM. Zbytočné peniaze
Date 2017-03-24 Playtime 0h 34m Rec Positive This is dope AF
Date 2017-03-23 Playtime 24h 7m Rec Positive Really fun game, have beat it around 6-7 times now! I really think you can make a top-class game if you add objectives, game-modes and expand the map adding more tasks and random spawns like ammo and medkits (also traps). Once your out it's hard and basically you have to restart. Love the game and keep working on it!!
Date 2017-03-23 Playtime 6h 44m Rec Negative this game is hard, and if you exit the game you have to do all stuff again you cant save, and it takes forever to kill bigfoot, buy rake instead!
Date 2017-03-23 Playtime 4h 42m Rec Positive OYUN MANYAK!! Ama tek kişi mümkünse girmeyiniz çünkü pek zevki yok. !!!!SPOİLER!!!! Map de arka tarayfta gate gibi birşey var genellikle oralarda ve galiba yıldırım çarpdırabiliyo çünkü onu ne zaman kovalasak yıldırım çarpıyor ve merminizi 2 kutu harcayın (2 kişi iseniz) flare atarsanız gelir dikkatli olun ve kameraları saklayarak kurun.  İYİ OYUNLAR:D 
Date 2017-03-23 Playtime 40h 4m Rec Positive Jeu Excellent en solo et en coop le seul problème pour le coop c'est qu'on ne peut pas sauvegarder mais vu leur prochaine mise à jour ça va envoyer du lourd . Dans ce jeu vous allez stresser et avoir peur , même en coop. Et vous allez devenir parano à chaque fois que vous allez entendre un arbre qui tombe,des bruits de cerfs, les bruits des marécages et de la nature. Et quand le Big foot vous attaquera le première fois  je vous jure que vous allez geuler.Je classe ce jeu meilleur jeu d'horreur que j'ai testé.Et ce n'est pas parceque vous êtes en coop que le Big foot sera plus facile à tuer , votre ami aura autant peur que vous (surtout si il vous perd de vue dans la nuit).Ce jeu est énorme alors testez le et bonne chasse ;).

Date 2017-03-23 Playtime 43h 56m Rec Positive Okay. This game is FUN!!!  Very early in the making but playing it is like living in a terrifying B movie.  Not much content and limited options but I expect that will soon change. I am VERY happy I bought it. Would be great for a parent to play with a kid or friends to play together...At night.  Gave me nightmares! *Thumbs up*
Date 2017-03-22 Playtime 23h 47m Rec Positive Game makes you feel like you're really in the game.
Date 2017-03-22 Playtime 8h 27m Rec Negative cuando boy entrar a la partida se traba por al guien que me ayude
Date 2017-03-22 Playtime 1h 26m Rec Negative I would not recomoend this game for laptop users as all of the other people who have laptops i've seen them post the game keeps crashing. I have encountered some crshing problems as well and can't even play the game. There is an ubdate coming up soon, so eventually I think it will get fixed. As of right now I do not recomend it but once the update is realeasd I think it will run better. If anybody else is having this crashing problem please contact me.  I dont know how to fix this. Im just a chimp who likes his games and doesn't want to have his money wasted.  note: the game is also in a very early beta
Date 2017-03-22 Playtime 32h 26m Rec Positive A really fun and exciting Hunter game. In this case you are chasing BIGFOOT! The game is a lot of fun in single or multiplayer mode. Every real hunter will find his joy here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0dgeWCnIPg
Date 2017-03-22 Playtime 19h 49m Rec Positive Lightning bolt jumpscare 2K17!
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 5h 3m Rec Positive This game was great fun to play with friends online. We literally screamed like little girls when coming across bigfoot. Is harder than it looks but once you know what to do its not too bad. Really can't wait for more updates and if more monsters are added (Trolls, mothman, Aliens etc.) This will be a keeper. Usually don't write reviews but had alot of fun with this one.   
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 27h 51m Rec Positive once the new update comes out next month its going to be well worth the money
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 22h 13m Rec Positive Really great game. The best game in this genre i think. It is very creepy and scary. The ****** lightnings are very scary. I cried very often when a lighting came throuhgt. I recommend to turn out the lights. Then it is a better atmosphere. The atmosphere of the game ist very very very good. You feel with the Characters and you feel like you are in the forest. It is really realistic and ripe for an early access game. I like it very much. The announced Update in 1 or 2 month promise really cool new features. Very nice. Thanks to the CyberLight Team for this really great game. Hope you update it really more.
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 38h 28m Rec Positive Fun, scary, and challenging. its RAKE done right. im excited to see what new maps and items will be added into the game. EDIT: just replayed the game and we encountered a glitch where bigfoot stood still out in the woods and we kept shooting him until he died. This only happened once but I still recommend this game and if a developer reads this i just wanted to let you know. P.S. Also there are quite a few grammar errors in the in-game guide and you guys spelled yes "yas" in the menu.
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 13h 50m Rec Positive 初版还有捆猴子环节 现在直接击毙就结束了 游戏重心跑去弄PVP了 PVE故事内容没有什么变化  猴子AI简单除暴 所以存在过多的无效互动和道具  道具生效时间太短 时间过得太快 出生房车是唯一猴子进不去的建组
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 5h 36m Rec Positive This game has a Rake-like feel to it, but the graphics and gameplay are much improved. After playing this game by myself, and with others for a while, it was easy to figure out, yet people still jumped every time we got charged at. I also like the randomly generated locations for the bodies, the sounds (damn lightning trees), etc. Overall, this is a pretty fun game for not being complete yet.
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 2h 42m Rec Positive I need some help guys. Im getting this error code after trying to join or create a server as well as play a solo game: UE4-FBProject. Does anyone have any Knowledge on this code?
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 2h 1m Rec Positive This game is amazing. I freaking caught Bigfoot. It does get repetitive as he hits you and runs away. Learning the basic mechanics of the game will easily let you catch Bigfoot yourself. Can't wait for the new update. 
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 22h 20m Rec Positive Played this game, only complaint is that i would like to get killed by bigfoot more often.
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 4h 5m Rec Positive Good time, lots to come in the updates that has me excited.
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 1h 4m Rec Negative I do not recommend this game for anyone. If your looking for a horror game to play with your friends this is not the games, after playing the with my friends for a hour BIGFOOT show up one time only WTF. PLEASE DON"T GET THIS GAME get something eles that good.
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 0h 59m Rec Negative Me and my friend recorded this game for an hour. We covered the map at least twice and only bumped into bigfoot once. We even found all the dead bodies, but the expirience was a let down. At the end we asked for a refund (which at the momment is being reviewed) regardless if your looking for a horror night to enjoy with your friends this is not the game your looking for. Please fix the issues regarding bigfoot only showing up once in a period of an hour...    
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 0h 54m Rec Positive Not really sure on this game, me and 1 freind played 54 mins straight yesterday, while dont get me wong we had some fun, but bigfoot him self barely even came and attaked us at all, another freind of mine bought it also and he is unable to play due to crahses every time he launches into a lobby. if you have you heart set on this game id wait for atleast for the devs to patch the bugs regarding crashes, i wont be taking a refund because i have faith in the devs will sort the games main issues and make bigfoot a bit more aggressive, if both them are addressed then it defiantly has the potential to be a great game and a very fun and scary one at that.
Date 2017-03-20 Playtime 9h 32m Rec Positive The game as it stands (20/03/17) is pretty basic but is fun, looks amazing and has bags of the Pacific Northwest (aka bigfoot country) atmosphere. There isn't that much to do, other than set up cameras and traps and then either walk around with a gun or watch the cameras for signs of bigfoot. There are also deer, which you can shoot and leave traps by. So, it's fairly basic, but it's already great for just switching on when you want to switch off. The woodland (and lake) setting is simply beautiful to explore (the effects are perfect) and it has a full night and day cycle.  Like the rest of the game, the Bigfoot is fairly basic at present. He looks great and is well animated. There seems to be little strategy involved, though, other than that he turns up randomly (mainly at night) and tries to attack you. A hit from your gun sends him running away again and even if he gets you it doesn't do much damage, he hits you once then legs it, so it is actually fairly easy to win.   One thing the game could definitley improve on is the sound (IMO). At present, bigfoot has a limited series of roars that sound wrong somehow (muffled?) and make it easy to tell when he is about to attack. After an initial 20 mins, till he first attacked, I was fairly nervous but once I realised he wasn't much of a threat (and I'd get ample warning before he attacked) the fear factor vanished. I'd love it if there were sounds like in the film Willow Creek (twigs snapping, distant log beating--getting closer, those weird chirping sounds and rocks being thrown at you etc. In addition, it would be better if Bigfoot were much stealthier and stalked you, attacking suddenly making the whole experience much more intense.  So, as it stands, a little like walking around a beautiful set with the occasional shootout. I hope it continues developing as it does as it has the potential to be perfect. It's already worth buying if you like the Bigfoot myth, with a little more strategy and more intense gameplay it will be very good indeed.
Date 2017-03-20 Playtime 15h 36m Rec Positive This game is amazing and really spooky, the graphics i find are really well done! I bought this for my friend and gave this a thumbs up!
Date 2017-03-20 Playtime 5h 52m Rec Positive Scary game, made me act like a little bitch.. 10/10 would play again and I can't wait for the DLC ;w;  <3 Cha because she is my sugar mommy and bought me this game.
Date 2017-03-20 Playtime 1h 3m Rec Negative Мне не понравилось!Совершенно не страшно и очень легко
Date 2017-03-20 Playtime 7h 49m Rec Positive i like it
Date 2017-03-20 Playtime 18h 59m Rec Positive The Game is AWESOME. But, please make, that the sounds of you (your steps), don't sound like 10 Feet behind you. Nothing else AWESOME GAME
Date 2017-03-20 Playtime 20h 6m Rec Positive Сделайте так чтобы можно-было ставить своё управление! И оптимизацию подправте и будет 10 из 10.
Date 2017-03-20 Playtime 13h 28m Rec Positive I played it with a fellow friend of mine. We live streamed the game and the viewers were loving it. The "jump scares" were pretty fun. The side quest was definitely something extra to do when Big foot wasn't around. It took a while to capture big foot. The visuals were stunning as were the ambiance. The models could have been enhanced a little more. The game has slight replay ablilty after beating it once but overall was a good time.
Date 2017-03-20 Playtime 59h 52m Rec Positive Im liking it so far but there is still work to be done to this game of course, i believe different kinds of weapons should be added to the game, would be cool if u could add more random places like small shacks, caves, able to build like tree stands, more tracking devices, of course bigger areas,  etc...., more cameras with better night vison, Big foot should not be about to reach in the camper if the door is shut, Love it when the camper does move when he runs into it. If big foot is wounded he should move slower. Traps should be able to hold big foot for at least 5 sec after going off. Able to change the style of the camper and the truck. Different Levels of how strong and Smart bigfoot gets that would be awesome!!! maybe a lil bit more random Animals would be cool. Maybe some body armor would be nice, protecting you from those bigfoot blows. More Medic supplies. Different seasons would be cool, i saw the snow one coming soon that looks awesome.  Sounds are great but the thunder in the game doesnt sound long enough when it goes off, it sounds like it get cut off towards the end needs work. Different "monsters" would be awesome to hunt down, and the tools on how to defeat them.   This game is scary, but yet its really fun too. i love how bigfoot chases u down and then runs away. that is pretty sweet.  Overall this game is pretty awesome Keep up the good work just hope this game gets the attention it deserves.
Date 2017-03-20 Playtime 0h 59m Rec Negative Good looking and fun for the first few minutes. The first jump scare was good, however like Rake once you fiqured out how the Bigfoot works you can just jump after him shooting. Multiplayer makes this game very enjoyable, however lack of content does not make this game worth 15$.
Date 2017-03-20 Playtime 2h 58m Rec Positive Awesome fun and pretty scary and atmospheric for the first 15-20 minutes, than you get used to it and it's a bit boring after that. Great idea on the side of the developer and can't wait to see if it develops further!
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 32h 31m Rec Negative full of bugs and crashes, the devs are  0 help. now that ive fixed all the issues everytime i go into multiplayer some faggoot decides to kill me. i asked for a refund and was denied. now the devs are revoking the game rfom people who bought it and saying its not early access. i was also banned from the forum for voicing my opinion of the game and promised updates
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 13h 46m Rec Negative every time you start a server it crashes before letting you in.DOESNT WORK
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 9h 6m Rec Positive Review Date: 19/03/17 Some spoilers: This game is acctually good. Yes, it does need new features which the developer has already planned out but this game really does have promis. I'm excited to see what new features will be added as the game is currently in beta. The surprise attacks that bigfoot can do really get you at times. Also when lightening strikes a tree it is like a jumpscare... and a good one too.
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 7h 8m Rec Positive Finding Bigfoot is a very good,funny and scary experience. The map is huge and gameplay is pretty basic. In this game it is better if you play with a friend or two, as you will be able to be in different areas and it will be more fun. A few bugs here and there but the game is in beta, so for what it is at the moment it is a very good game. 8/10
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 2h 58m Rec Negative it's a fun game, very slow and in despret need of an update.
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 6h 13m Rec Negative There's "early access" and then there's "way-too-early access", and this game is the latter. The first BF encounter happened within 5-10 minutes which was way too soon. Gameplay is very limited. Graphics are all foggy and look nothing like the screen shots from the dev's which look much brighter and much clearer. I'm using max. settings with high end rig so it's not my PC! Frame rate is great @ 100hz but there's not much to challenge the hardware.  Recommend folks save their $$ until it's much further along.  Oh for the Dev's: the game is worth - at best - $9.99 when it is finished as it's so basic; $15.99 is really a rip off right now sorry to say. (Am trying to get a refund...)  Edit 9/29/2019: yikes this is still in early access 2.5 years later!!!
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 0h 13m Rec Positive Un joc cu o grafica as zice perfecta unde trebuie sa supravietuiesti singur sau alaturi de prietenii tai. Ai la dispozitie o harta destul de mare, deci ai ce explora. Ai grija deaorece poti da de asa numitul "BIGFOOT"... Dintre minusuri: - Lobby-urile prea mici, de la 1-3 persoane - Faptul ca jocul contine continut audio cu drept de autor, am primit notificare de copyrights de la youtube pentru o anumita secventa din joc, care am fost nevoit sa o inlocuiesc rapid   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnglIOvp57E  Dar in general jocul e destul de ok, 7.5/10
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 5h 52m Rec Positive Played this game with a friend  Day time: Put traps, meat and cameras around the place.  explored for a bit ran back to caravan Night time: Laugh at how we would screw bigfoot *hears roar* We start to be silent Friend watches cameras  I look out windows See's something running out from the bushes *Screams* Shoots bigfoot  Bigfoot runs away Pedro cries inside Friend says get it the cage to protect ourselves DO NOT GET IN THE CAGE 10/10 Would stay in a tree and hide from Bigfoot Again
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 84h 43m Rec Positive го все на охоту на бигфута
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 2h 13m Rec Positive Fun with friends, co-op up to 3 players. I shitted my pants when I ran into bushes at night :)   There more that game developer can do to this game. Another mode? Would be great if there was an option to change mouse sensitivity.  No friends, no pay
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 3h 11m Rec Positive Pretty fun, a few things need to be improved on, like the campers lights cause me to lag for some reason, I have an RX 480 and get 50 fps around the camper but 60-70 everywhere else. Also it would be cool if someone could play as bigfoot and kill the players.
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 9h 1m Rec Positive this is the story of my gameplay. I put traps all around the map put some camaras in front of them and i waited. ten minutes later i hear this horrible scream so i check my camaras. The first i see is some skinny black thing's ass right at the camara. Of course it was bigfoot then he looked at my camara and sprinted away. Like in reasonble person I want to follow him, so I went to the scene of the scream. When i got there the meat was gone and the trap triggered, but bigfoot was no where in sight. In frustration I set back up the trap and headed back to my camper. Then i heard another scream, so i turned straight towards the sound. When I arrived at the scene he was gone again same with the meat, so i reset the trap, I decided that i should go look for him. i was walking around for about 5 minutes when i found a mangled corpse on the ground and later another one. Then there was the scream again but closer than before. I rushed towards the scream but was once again met with the same results. I then decided it was time to give up, i hadn't seen bigfoot for about 45 mins. Then out from the bushes he leaped past me I pulled out my gun and shot him in the back. I followed him until i heard another scream and thats where i found him pasted out from pain. Digging into his leg was my trap. ( so to sum this all up i only saw him twice once on camara and once in person and he lost most of his health to traps, all in all its a good game i just never really saw him)
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 22h 48m Rec Positive Actually scary eno.ugh it made me jump. I will say that daylight hours can be a bit boring, but night time is creepy
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 1h 31m Rec Positive Can someone Please help me.? My friend (who lives in the U.K) and me (I live in oregon) want to play together. However, we are not able to connect to the same session or even see the same ones. Is there a way for us to play with eachother?   Thank you for the help.!!
Date 2017-03-18 Playtime 76h 21m Rec Positive BigFootJobs
Date 2017-03-18 Playtime 5h 0m Rec Positive Terrifying. Nothing like strolling through the woods when a random ass lightning bolt smites the ground beside you, then once you have calmed down you get rushed by a 9 foot harry beast of fury, who bitch slaps the fuck out of you, runs away, ambushes you, then begins to fuck up your buddies/camper/everything else you could think of.
Date 2017-03-18 Playtime 20h 13m Rec Negative I want my money back rlly. Whenever i try to play it It crashes at the Loading screen right before you spawn in the game. anyone know how to fix it? It looks like a fun game i watch Vanoss Gaming play it. 
Date 2017-03-18 Playtime 20h 57m Rec Positive Me and my forgotten friend bought this game today to try it out and what we both experienced was amazing forest day map and terrified night time.  We put the cameras around the forest and watched if the bigfoot will come but we didnt know that he can come to your trailer and almost grab you inside of the trailer. That made our heart fell off. The night time is really really like REALLY scary especially when me and my forgotten friend walked in the forest when suddently a lightning striked into the tree few meters away. We were so scared that we just went back to the trailer as soon as possible. Best Lightning Simulator 2017.  One thing we didnt knew yet was that the bigfoot actually came to ous in the tree bridge high up at the river at night time while we were waiting because we thought it was safe but I guess it was not. The traps are good bait for bigfooy because each time he comes or activates it he will scream loud meaning that you can quickly find him where he is if you put camera and trap together. Sometimes you can caught a deer into a trap which is again the bait for bigfoot.  While others are saying that they completed the game in 2 hours. Guess what? Me and my friend havent managed to kill bigfoot in 5 hours of gameplay xD  Overrall its the best good looking graphics game. The day is mostly safe but you can still find bigfoot but he will not kill you or attack but run off. At night time hes more agressive and scary with those green eyes, jezus christ :D  It is worth those 16€. Now go, buy it and experience the horror with or without friend. You wont regret it. Keep it up developers! You did an amazing job and cant wait for the new update :)  UPDATE: After 7 hours of play with my forgotten friend, we finally managed to capture bigfoot, we almost had no bullets and had low health and found all missing passengers. Now bigfoot is famous in cage.
Date 2017-03-18 Playtime 674h 48m Rec Positive best game ever
Date 2017-03-18 Playtime 24h 28m Rec Positive This game seems very fun, but after I bought it and attempted to play it with my friend, the game appeared to crash. I am disappointed with this. Especially because I have handled large games and worked fine. I hope this gets fixed in the near future. Until then, I am very iffy for recommending this game, and say to remain cautious because your PC may not be able to handle it, even if it meets all the specs.
Date 2017-03-18 Playtime 7h 21m Rec Negative Decent game på 15€ for this is just utter bs. 3 hours gameplay I think I'll just buy Witcher 3 Blood and wine
Date 2017-03-18 Playtime 15h 7m Rec Positive i like it! i like it alot ! it got alot of potential, and alot of grammar to improve :P maybe more players per map than just 3? and respawning of loot ? but all in all a cool game, witch i hope get all the attention it needs to become a great game! i love it that the yeti is AI, so its more random than if a player was it, like dead by deadligt ect. so yeah, continue the excellent work !!!

Date 2017-03-18 Playtime 11h 24m Rec Positive pretty good if you have a time for it.my friend and I caught bigfoot but it lagged and we have to do the thing over again.not really we just died by our own beartraps.lucky for us:)

Date 2017-03-17 Playtime 3h 5m Rec Positive This game is very fun! Your in pins and needles trying to find him. I look forward to trying this out in Co-Op mode. I really hope they expand this game.
Date 2017-03-17 Playtime 129h 24m Rec Positive I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this game. The graphics are really good considering it's still in Beta.  It's definitely creepy and the day/night/weather is good. I wish there was clock or some form of telling time, other than in cameras (like when you're out roaming around).   The atmospheric sound is excellent, however, as many others have noted, the player's footsteps seem to be a few paces behind you. There are a few jumpscares [spoiler] like trees or noisy wildlife that come out of nowhere [/spoiler] that always get me. Love it!   Currently there is no way to re-map the keys, but after a little trial and error, I found there is a "controls" help screen when you hit ESC (Pause menu). The item/map keys are not logical as you would think, and mouse wheel does not cycle between weapons either.  Keys are: WSAD for movement, E is use/activate, Q is map, R is reload, T is place trap, X is place meat, V is place foliage, Z is cycle ammo types, H is health, F is flashlight, Right-click is night vision, and Number keys for the weapons/cameras. Also, the mouse wheel zooms in cameras, which is nice.  There is no save mechanic yet, so it's an all-or-nothing challenge so far.   The AI of Bigfoot seems to be really good so far. And he's always angry!
Date 2017-03-17 Playtime 16h 23m Rec Positive Hey guys it's Jeff Kaplan from the overwatch team. I think overwatch could use a map like this, thx guys. hope you enjoy the next update, bastion is getting a buff again and we are removing anas other eye.

Date 2017-03-14 Playtime 67h 20m Rec Positive Its A fun game but gets borring when you first kill big foot. I would love to see a hunted forest to make it even more creepy and a new feture where you can park the trail where ever you want!

Date 2017-03-14 Playtime 1h 43m Rec Positive Very scary game and really good for being early access i cant wait to see what they do with this game in the future
Date 2017-03-14 Playtime 1h 6m Rec Negative it was to glitchy 4 me and i could not play online :/ 
Date 2017-03-14 Playtime 1h 30m Rec Negative Hello bigfoot hunters! Don't buy this game because it get really boring after 1 hour. It is the same as the tv series with the same name. The only difference is that there actually are a bigfoot in the game.
Date 2017-03-14 Playtime 12h 10m Rec Positive First session with friends. We cowered in fear in the trailer and got hurt a lot. Friend screamed a lot, I yelled angrily at bigfoot and cursed a lot at the lightning strikes. Third friend was silent...because no skype. Came very close to capturing bigfoot but ended it early. Second session, Cops: Bigfoot Edition. Started as undercover cops, turned into police footchase in the forest, ended as Predator "COME ON DO IT, IM OVER HERE! KILL ME NOW" moment. 10/10 would go on another long footchase for a large grey male with hair all over.   One of the top reviews mentioned how the scariness goes away after a while. Yeah, it wasn't scary the second time around. It was exciting getting into a footchase though :D  On a more serious note, when you're completely dry on ammo, you're pretty much stuck using traps to incapacitate bigfoot. So distribute ammo carefully, aim gud, don't jump like a pansy when bigfoot comes to give you a big slap. Take that slap like a man and unload those rounds into him. Plan things out? Its pretty easy once you get the hang of it.
Date 2017-03-14 Playtime 13h 6m Rec Positive Awsome plain awsome
Date 2017-03-14 Playtime 7h 4m Rec Negative THIS GAME MAKES ME WANT TO KILL MYSELF! IT WONT EVEN WORK EVERYTIME I GET ON A GAME IT CRASHES! YOU CANT PLAY IT UNLESS YOU HAVE A GOOD COMPUTER! THIS GAME IS COMPLETE SHIT AND I WANT TO SHIT ON THE FACES OF ALL OF THE DEVELOPERS FACES FOR MAKING THIS STUPID TRASH! JUST GET RAKE! THIS GAME IS THAT GAME BUT, INSTEAD OF THE RAKE YOU HAVE A GIANT HAIRY BITCH TO CUM ALL OVER YOU AFTER YOU START WALKING IN THE WOODS HE JUST POPS UP BITCH SLAPS YOU ONE TIME AND RUNS AWAY LIKE A 6 YEAR OLD PLAYING A DING DONG DITCH PRANK IN HIS TEACHER! FUCK YOU MISS JOHNSON! I WANT THIS GAME TO DESTROY ITSELF IN THE HOTTEST FIRES OF OBLIVION! I HAVE EVER BEEN SO PISSED OFF IN MY LIFE! OMG! I DONT WANT THIS GAME TO EXIST! IT COST TO MUCH FOR WHAT IT IS EVEN IF IT IS IN BETA! JUST BUY RAKE. FINDING BIGFOOT IS THE WORST PEICE OF TRASH I HAVE EVER RECIEVED AND I WANT TO PISS ON THE FACES OF ALL OF THE DEVS FACES WHILE THEY SLEEP OMFG!
Date 2017-03-14 Playtime 1h 42m Rec Positive It crashes occasionally but when you get into a game it is really good.

Date 2017-03-13 Playtime 0h 21m Rec Negative I was reading about this game on the storefront and read:  "Features: - The game is developed on Unreal Engine 4. - Local Co-op is designed for up to 3 people."  Desperate to find a cool game that had local coop I immediately bought it without looking at any additinal info(my mistake)  I quickly realized this game is Online coop only.   1.WHY do you have local coop listed as a feature of your game when your game is online co op only?  2.why does steam keep letting games be sold with false advertising.  
Date 2017-03-13 Playtime 18h 0m Rec Positive What a great start to a game.  The name says it all.  You're set in a rather large area of a remote forest looking for and trying to capture Bigfoot using tools such as flare guns, rifles, cameras and bear traps.  The graphics are decent for an indie game and on my pc (AMD 8320 , 16 GB ram, Gforce GTX 1060 6GB) runs very well.   The developers have done a great job setting the atmosphere and generating some good scares.  It takes a bit of patience and luck to defeat the bigfoot but overall isn't that hard even solo.  The devs are promising a big update to increase replay and add some complexity.  Given what they've accomplished so far there is a lot of promise.  Worth your $16.  Pros Large open map Great immersion (Scare/Suspense factor)   Cons Need more creativity options for hunting big foot  
Date 2017-03-13 Playtime 31h 18m Rec Positive Love the game so far, however, more creatures to hunt would be great ! e.g  Yeti, Skin walker, rake, etc
Date 2017-03-13 Playtime 1h 6m Rec Negative Game will not work for me.... Unreal Engine kept crashing when I went to start Group or Solo Expedition. Very disappointed. Will be requestiong refund.
Date 2017-03-13 Playtime 4h 52m Rec Positive I had my first adventure while being alone and I was SH*T MY PANTS! Then I played when my friend along and WE BOTH SH*T OUR PANTS!   But then that FEAR was no longer after you get use to it. Instead of bigfoot chasing us, we're chasing them back lol.  This is pretty fun for an early access. We really want more maps and different campaign!  
Date 2017-03-13 Playtime 34h 21m Rec Positive I love Binding Figboot.
Date 2017-03-13 Playtime 8h 43m Rec Positive A fun game with friends.  In its current state it is lacking in content and that lack of content quickly diminishes the scare factors. When, or if, there's further updates that add in more scare factors the game will be solid. The atmosphere is dense and spooky, especially at night.  I'd recommend it only if you have friends to game with. If you have patience to wait, I'd also recommend waiting for some more updates that add in more features. The game does lack a good amount of content.   Naturally there's some bugs and minor things that should change for better gameplay experience. Biggest thing that should be added is various admin options for sessions. Especially a friendly fire toggle or at least make it so it isn't an insta-kill.  Bigfoot's AI isn't the best and may bug out at times.  There's moderate replay value to the game. However the scares will likely be gone and it'd be more-or-less just to do stuff you hadn't before.  Be sure to turn up your volume for full effect!
Date 2017-03-13 Playtime 1h 11m Rec Negative Gets boring within the first 10 minutes.

Date 2017-03-13 Playtime 13h 44m Rec Positive Had lots of fun with friends and shit my self a lot but the most scary thing in the game would be the fucking tree that gets struck by lighting.  I see lots of potential in this game and can't wait to see what comes out in the future!  10/10 boi
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 2h 12m Rec Positive I dont know why but when my game tries to start game it crashes when its about to go in  
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 0h 43m Rec Negative Soo bought the game for me and a friend. It worked pretty well for me but unfortunatly not for my friend. Who had multiple problems with the game including controls and sound not working. However the game worked okay for me, which is nice.  Regardless of the technical problems the game was boring in the sense that Bigfoot was a real big coward, he walks up to you bitch slaps you across the face and u take maybe 20% damage. Then he runs away in shame like how am I not strong enough to kill a little pathetic man. Anyways game wasn't really good but had potential, like really it had soo maybe wait for it to get playable.
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 0h 40m Rec Negative Crashes your audio not working controls crashes everything on your pc. only hard restart works  1/10 You tried. only positive thing is graphics ITS FUCKING SHIT! DONT BUY IT
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 6h 18m Rec Negative The idea of the game is great and watching other people play it is very entertaining. But whenever I open up the game, it goes through all the intro bits, goes full screen, blacks out, and closes. Therefore, this isn't a particular fully functional game. There are many bits and pieces that need to be worked on, prior to the gameplay. I refunded it for now, but maybe I'll purchase it once the game is updated much more.
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 4h 2m Rec Negative emmm.... there should be a voice chat mode, plus no password servers. If you play with friends or alone, this game is for you. tho the creature itself is quite retarded... its a little broken.
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 1h 4m Rec Negative now i wanted to play this game because I saw it on youtube But it wont load can you fix that? It just freezed, then crashes.
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 1h 32m Rec Negative This game is trash. It crashes when I try to play and when I open it. This game is a wast of money dont buy. And for the DEVELOPERS , PLEASE FIX THIS BUG BECAUSE THE GAME LOOKS GOOD BUT IT DOSENT PLAY AT ALL.
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 20h 5m Rec Positive this game is fun, sure there is some things that need to change but overall it is fun. i do not recommend it if you don't have any friends to play this game with but if you and your friends want to play this game i recommend it because it is real fun.
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 14h 37m Rec Positive Wir haben im Coop Bigfoot versucht zu fangen. Mit Erfolg.   Das Spiel hat eine sehr gute Grafik ( für eine Early Access echt geil & flüssig ). Wir haben uns taktisch zusammen getan und haben erstmal geschaut wo Bigfoot lang kommt.  Bei uns hat er ( vlt ein Bug? Oder er ist so Intelligent ) jedesmal die selbe Route genommen. Sprich vom Wohnwagen zurück in das Sumpfgebiet und dann wieder zum Wohnwagen. So konnten wir die Route verfolgen und Kameras platzieren & hatten ihn dadurch jedesmal im Blick. Nach einer halben Stunde ca. haben wir ihn dann auch im Käfig gehabt.  Mein Fazit :   Sehr gutes Horror Survival Game für nicht allzu schwache Nerven. Ich selber habe mir in die Hose gemacht haha :D  Grafik ist echt TOP!  Die Map ist wunderschön aufgebaut!  Ich freue mich auf die Neue Map & Bereue es nicht das Spiel gekauft zu haben!   Danke liebe Entwickler! <3
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 3h 35m Rec Negative 2021年9月現在  アップデートが入って色々な部分がかなり改善したっぽい。     大型アップデートを目前に逃亡か  当初目指していた大型アップデートがくるまで買わない方が吉    怪物BigFootを見つけて捕まえるゲーム。 購入する場合あくまでもEAだということを念頭に置いてほしい。 現在マルチプレイは最大３人でマップは１種類（近く２個目のマップが配信予定の模様）  人間の装備はトラッカー弾と通常弾を使い分けられるライフルとベアトラップやナイトビジョンゴーグルに設置型カメラ。 ゲーム全体は簡素な作りでかなり硬派な印象。 EAでリリースされたばかりなのでボリュームは少いものの、 一週間に一度程の頻繁なアップデートを行っている。 今後ゲームボリュームがどんどん増えて、 マップやアイテム等の新機能追加されたら大化けするゲーム。 今後の期待値が高いので高評価。
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 0h 37m Rec Negative Too basic.  Literally a Run, kill or die simulator. Got very boring.
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 9h 32m Rec Positive Ein sehr gelungenes Spiel gefällt mir sehr gut. Vorallem im Multiplayer macht es einfach spaß ich bin sowieso ein Fan von sowas und einfach top das Spiel.

Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 9h 35m Rec Positive Dear god this game scaried the pee pee out of me
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 16h 26m Rec Positive I am usually a person who doesn't jump scare easily, I can sit through horror movies and games without a problem. My friend introduced me to this game, at first I thought I wouldn't get scared. The moment lightning struck a tree right next to me, I literally shit my pants until no tomorrow, I knew I was going to be in for some fun. After I calmed down, night struck, and we headed into the camper for the night, one of us watching the windows, one of us watching the cameras. Right as my friend said he saw something on camera 5, the roar came. My eyes became dialated and there was a chill up my spine, then the next moment I saw two green eyes run at me and try to grab at me through a window, roaring and shouting. I know now what real fear is like.   If you enjoy a good horror game, I recommend this one highly!
Date 2017-03-12 Playtime 1h 4m Rec Negative Interesting game but my friend couln't play with me because the game would crash everytime. 0/10 It needs updated to be enjoyble
Date 2017-03-11 Playtime 11h 58m Rec Positive Finding Bigfoot is a game that is much like Rake; if not almost identical. The same things are there: cameras, traps, bait, watch towers, dead bodies, and even a terrifying monster! Let me get on with this review.  The game begins like Rake. You start out in a trailer where all your equipment is. After this, you go out and set up your cameras; or traps. The cameras are like Rake but they have something new: you can put them anywhere! This adds a lot more freedom to the game with the ability to place a camera anywhere.   When night comes, prepare for the worst. If you are lucky, Bigfoot may come to your trailer once during the night. If you're like me, however, then he will visit about three or four times during the night. You have a bit of choice here. There are only two options: 1. Go out and be a man by catching Bigfoot 2. Cower in your trailer all night.  This game has some pretty good jumpscares in it. I'm not spoiling them but they are the scariest jumpscares in awhile. They actually made me scream(which if you saw my Rake review, you would know I don't scream that often)!   Overall(there's actually more to this game but I'm not spoiling anything), the game is fun to play either alone or with friends(which is something I haven't done yet). The only issue with the game is the price.  I do recommend this game to anyone who wants a game that can be either a hunting simulator or a scary game where hunt down Bigfoot.  My score: 8.7/10 Much better than Rake.
Date 2017-03-11 Playtime 3h 19m Rec Positive Что у нас тут новое повыходило? Ооооо, охота на легендарную обезьяну, должно быть страшно. Куплено, скачано, друзья созваны.  Как зашёл в игру, не выходил из трейлера мин 10, пока ждал друга и привыкал (неизвестность пугает). После поиграли в кс в трейлере, труп друга "орёт" после смерти. Собрались, вооружились, выходим. Первые вопросы "куда идти?", "есть ли карта?", "он сразу нам навешает или сначала оповестит, что рядом?". Зашли за близлежащие камни, поставили капкан. Поняли, что мы тоже получаем дамаг от капкана)  Пошли к озеру. Навыки в шутанах не подвели, увидел эту зверюгу. Со словами "Вот он, вот он!", стали подбираться ближе. Увидел и дропанул от нас. Нашли лагерь, а следом и трупы. Расставили ловушки и камеры.  И тут просто ор на всю карту, и появилась строка с хп его. Видно попался в тот самый первый капкан.  Путешествуем дальше, нашли пещеру, уже идём домой, смотреть в камеры, как вдруг, за нами хвост по дороге. Эта гадина бежит тихо-тихо на нас с зелёными глазами.  Его удары заскрипчены, он обязательно должен подбежать и ударить, ток потом драпает. Стреляем дротиком с маяком и начинаются побегушки по всему лесу, попутно давая и получая люлей. Очень жирная скотина, больше 40 пуль надо всадить. Аим тут 100%, куда навёлся, туда и попал, хоть за километр, если видишь его. Сначала пугает игра, но как только понимаешь, кто он и как себя ведёт, становится не страшно. Больше опасности, кроме него, нет. Тупо носишься и стреляешь.  Советую играть с друзьями, треш и веселье обеспеченно)
Date 2017-03-11 Playtime 7h 20m Rec Positive This is a great game to play with your friends for a few rounds... but i feel that after you beat the game once it is kinda pointless to play it again.
Date 2017-03-11 Playtime 3h 25m Rec Positive Весело, забавно и нифига не страшно.(Но это не точно) Игра стоит своих денег, это даже не осуждается. И когда это чудо бежит именно на тебя, не остаётся выхода, только получать люлей от него. 10/10
Date 2017-03-11 Playtime 120h 28m Rec Positive Very great start for a game that is in beta. It took ne about 3 hours to finish it but in the 3 hours i was playing this game it kept me very very  busy and at the edge of my seat. If you have played the RAKE and enjoyed it i highly reccomend this game. I am so excited to see what the future holds for this game.
Date 2017-03-11 Playtime 1h 23m Rec Negative keeps crashing pls fix it
Date 2017-03-11 Playtime 31h 38m Rec Positive Ich werde hier jetzt einfach alle + und - Punkte aufzählen und am ende noch ein paar Ideen für die Entwickler einbringen. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Pros: +Die Atmosphäre ist super und man kommt sich direkt wie in einem Nordamerikanischen Wald vor. +Die Grafik ist zwar nicht mit der eines Vollpreistitels vergleichbar aber das zusammenspiel aus Gestrüpp, Bäumen und   der hervorragenden Lichteinstrahlung ist sehr, sehr hübsch. Außerdem läuft alles sehr flüssig, hatte bisher keine Framedrops. +Die Steuerung ist sehr angenehm. + Bigfoots schrei jagt einem einen schönen schauer über den rücken + Die Map ist detailreich und schön ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Contras: - Sounds wie ein blitzeinschlag oder der einer leuchtpistole sind noch nicht gut abgemischt und einfach VIEL zu laut. - Bigfoot hat teilweise keine Haare und rennt als hätte er es nicht mehr rechtzeitig zur Toilette geschafft. - Gameplay gelegentlich etwas langatmig. - Wenig andere Tiere - Die übersetzung ins deutsche ist wirklich schlecht, ich würde empfehlen auf englisch zu spielen ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Tipps an die Entwickler: *Bigfoot sollte Kameras zerstören können so das man neue aufstellen muss. *Kameras sollten Bewegungssensoren haben die bei jedem Tier anspringen. *Es sollte eine größere Tiervielfalt geben wie zum Beispiel Haasen, Pumas oder etwas in der art. *Ihr solltet die Sprintanimation von bigfoot überarbeiten. *Bigfoot sollte mehr beobachten. *Überarbeitet die Soundabmischung nochmal. *Weniger Nebel am Tag wäre schön. *Die übersetzungen in andere Sprachen überarbeiten. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FAZIT: Finding Bigfoot ist ein tolles spiel was besonders in der Gruppe seine Stärken entfalltet. Es hat noch ein paar kleine Macken an denen noch gearbeitet werden muss aber was das Spiel bereits jetzt einen Monat nach EA release kann ist einfach toll. Man erschreckt sich wirklich gut aber auch nicht zu häufig weshalb ich das Spiel auch so klasse finde. Aber am besten is es wohl wenn man es selber ausprobiert. Ich verspreche euch das sich die 16€ lohnen werden. 
Date 2017-03-11 Playtime 5h 26m Rec Negative Right now, I would not recommend this game. Maybe I would after it's full release but there is only one map and the game gets repetitive after the first half hour.

Date 2017-03-11 Playtime 12h 51m Rec Positive Both me and a buddy bought the game.  Loaded it up, started learning how it all works.  1.) We explored a bit, checking out the woods.  Found guns in the base so we felt confident. 2.) Heard an extremely loud and disturbing roar, shit our pants and ran back to the base at the speed of light. 3.) Cried in the base. 4.) Shit our pants again and screamed as Big Foot attacked out base out of no where. 5.) Fired bullets all over the place, 1 hit Big Foot and he ran away. 6.) Went back to crying in the base.  (9/10) Would shit pants and cry again.

Date 2017-03-09 Playtime 6h 32m Rec Positive Great game.  Especially if you're a Bigfoot fan.
Date 2017-03-08 Playtime 7h 39m Rec Positive 实际上除了内容少以外   游戏还是挺有意思的    比较还在测试阶段    就看未来游戏更新如何了   总之我玩得还是挺开心的【除了狗屎一样的打雷声。

Date 2017-03-08 Playtime 8h 40m Rec Positive Играли мы с друзьями в это говно, шли по лесу и шли. получили пиздюлей от бигфута и пошли в трейлер. на 3 день, я решил прогуляться, а мой друг по-палить камеры. Было туманно. Я бля иду, получаю на пол-кабины от бигфута, строю новый кирпичный трейлер, бегу за этим уебком. И ТУТ В ДЕРЕВО ЕБНУЛА МОЛНИЯ, ЭТО ПИЗДЕЦ, Я ОБОСРАЛСЯ И СПРЫГНУЛ С ДЕРЕВА. А мой друг получил психическую травму. Бле  12/10 ЕБАНЫХ УДАРОВ МОЛНИЙ В ДЕРЕВО

Date 2017-03-08 Playtime 10h 59m Rec Negative 2/10  Don't waste your time. You won't be able to finish a game without it crashing or losing connection.  My cousin and I played this game. There really aren't many coop horror games out there, so I was very excited to finally be able to share the horror burden with someone else. But what did I think about the game?  This game was good! It's a bit rough around the edges, and it's not exactly polished but it's still a pretty game! There were misspellings EVERYWHERE but that's no big deal. I'll try not to ruin too much for you, but there were a few times we were absolutely scared. I hope they keep working on it, and maybe adding a bit more creep factor. After a while, you start to recognize the patterns and it gets a bit boring at that point. That being said, we still enjoyed it.  I do have gameplay of it on youtube. Feel free to check it out!   (Spoilers) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4j9UEMVG0U
Date 2017-03-08 Playtime 2h 41m Rec Positive 如果你对这个游戏感兴趣，不妨先看看我的视频(video): http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjYxMjA1MjI3Mg==.html  和好基友一期联机玩的实况，体验下来之后感觉找一只怪不容易啊。 但是找到大脚怪的山洞和按了G看了日志以后才明白 原来大脚怪特别喜欢吃鹿肉！这就解释了为什么森林里还有些游荡的鹿了 我们在一条河边杀了鹿，就经常在这附近遇到大脚怪！ 记的切换跟踪弹药，这样可以在地图显示，能更好的知道逃跑方向 地图上还有4个失踪人口要找，算是有一点点额外的的内容吧 如果你是一个人玩，袭击的音效一出，先给他一发来福， 然后切换信号枪往大脚怪身上打一发，就可以吓跑他 经过多次测试，这招是单人最有效的抓捕方法 当然，偶尔还会遇上大脚怪卡树的BUG- - 一个人玩的时候白白被我杀了。。。 总的来说52有些贵，因为内容太少，毕竟还在抢先体验 也希望能够多出一些玩法和内容吧 
Date 2017-03-08 Playtime 11h 38m Rec Positive I'd for sure give this game a thumbs up. The only thing that does bother me is the player limit. Three players kinda blows honestly. What about four or maybe six? Of course this is still in development so changes are to be expected. But yeah I'd recommend this game.
Date 2017-03-08 Playtime 7h 58m Rec Positive Good game tho has a few issues i noticed. 1)Bigfoot derps out sometimes and can hit you through walls. 2 and by far the worst) You can pretty much end the game first night by going ontop of the tree branch on the water and siiting towards the first down branch and then move to the higher one and he will be stuck and you have free reign to kill him. Over all the game IS still in early access but has very high potential so I would reccomend this to others

Date 2017-03-07 Playtime 10h 35m Rec Positive US ( ENG IS DOWN HERE) ну чтож игра с задачей поймать бигфута начнём с + (учитывая что игра в раннем доступе) 1)отлично проработанный кооператив( кооперативная игра сделана на высшем уровне) 2)отлично проработана система бигфута (НПС, в данном случае бигфут проработан на высоте, что модель что и его действия) 3) оптимизация ( для ранней версии она отличная) теперь перейдем к - , их я выделил тоже 3 (так как на ранней стадии мне не хочется выделять много всего) 1)это слабый герой (я конечно понимаю что бигфут это очень сильное создание, но не настолько что бы убивать игрока с 3 ударов) 2)не отмечается партнер на карте ( твоя команда не отмечается на карте, поэтому сложно встретиться) 3)всем приевшиеся баги ( я знаю что это ранний доступ, но их даже для него много) Итог: игра очень даже неплоха, конечно же для своей версии\ Ставлю 9/10, всем советую покупать. Удачи! ENG well, the game task is to catch Bigfoot let's start with the + (given that the game is in early access) 1)well-designed cooperative( co-op game made at the highest level) 2)well designed system Bigfoot (NPC in this case, Bigfoot-developed at the height of the model and its validity) 3) optimization ( for earlier versions it is great) now for the - , they I have identified is also 3 (since early on I don't want to allocate a lot) 1)is a weak hero (and I certainly understand that Bigfoot is a very strong creature, but not enough to kill a player with 3 strikes) 2)partner is not marked on the map ( your team is not marked on the map, so it is difficult to meet) 3)everyone is bored of the bugs ( I know it's early access, but even for him a lot) Summary: the game is very good, of course for your version of\ Put 9/10, I advise everyone to buy. Good luck!
Date 2017-03-07 Playtime 7h 36m Rec Positive Pretty fun game, and fairly thrilling for the first while. Can wait for the next map!
Date 2017-03-07 Playtime 12h 9m Rec Positive Fun game, especially when you stop filling the trailer with flare guns and actually catch bigfoot.
Date 2017-03-07 Playtime 3h 8m Rec Positive I saw some folks playing this on Youtube and i thought it looked awesome, i laughed when they jumped and shat themselves and giggled when they got stuck in their own traps....... Well, i thought it would be a great idea to buy it... 1st i am happy to pay for this game as it is a wonderful piece of work, there are still some bugs to be ironed out but thats what early access is all about. now, 2nd what the actual fuck was i thinking! i started playing on my own in a silent house with a severe anxiety disorder... [b]WORST IDEA EVER!!![/b] I look forward to watching people play and eventually playing with friends but not again by myself... fully recommend this game, solid 5/7... ;-)

Date 2017-03-07 Playtime 6h 48m Rec Positive Just got this game tonight looking for a new fun multiplayer game to add to my YT channel.  3 of us had the best time in the world playing this together.  The Graphics are beautful and the world is large.  The game play is intense.  We have not finished it yet but its a fun ride!  Looking forward to much more game time!
Date 2017-03-07 Playtime 14h 48m Rec Positive My friend and I went on a hunt. We laughed, we cried, we scream. We also died. 10 out of 10 would make final stand in bigfoot's cave again.
Date 2017-03-07 Playtime 3h 41m Rec Positive This is the worst fucking game on steam  10/10
Date 2017-03-07 Playtime 2h 22m Rec Positive With little direction aside from "Find bigfoot and put him in a cage", it took some trial and error before I finally felt confident in how to play this game (I never played Rake). I did some co-op with a buddy and had a blast, although for a $16 pricetag I expected a little more. I understand this is early access, and look forward to what they have in store for the future... but at this time I'd only comfortably pay $4.99 for this title.  The gameplay was smooth and UE4 looks great; Bigfoot definately scared the everliving sh*t out of me during our first encounter... but after you gather an understanding of the mechanics, the fear level plummets. I was however pleasantly surprised to see there were some other opportunities for pants sh*tting other than just sasquatch. But I'll leave those for the player to discover.   Overall I had a great time playing with friends, but if I were solo I'd probably shy away from this. If you ever played Rake, you'll feel right at home. It should be noted that the "matchmaking/invite friend" system was much easier than I expected. You DO NOT have to use any kind of 3rd party application or anything of that nature to host a server and invite a friend. MP supports up to 3 players as well. For the most part it's all plug and play.  I'd reccommend this game for some quick scares with a friend if you're both online with a day off.   For those interested, there's a 13 minute clip of gameplay below. This DOES reveal Bigfoot AND the end of the game, so keep that in mind if you proceed. It took me about an hour and 45 minutes to complete. Of course there is also plenty of replay value, and the devs are currently working on alternate locations. One of which looks to be a winter climate. Abominable snowman, anyone?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvATYXd15h4
Date 2017-03-07 Playtime 36h 12m Rec Positive Very good game thus far, Single player is superb and im looking forward to more maps and maybe creatures, only issue is the multiplayer can be buggy at times, currently having frame rate issues in multiplayer: Singleplayer- 100+ FPS Hosting an empty server- 20FPS Server with players on it(Hosting or not)- under 10FPS, as bad as 2 FPS
Date 2017-03-07 Playtime 0h 23m Rec Negative I can't really play the game, I start the game up and it works fine but when I press New Game it freezes and closes tha game out, I thought, mabye its my anti-virus software interfering but I disabled it and didn't change it, So I changed the resolution  to low on everything thinking that my computer just couldn't run it but the same thing. Its a shame I was looking so forward to this and sadly I can't play it. Would Give it a rate up but can't play.

Date 2017-03-07 Playtime 0h 18m Rec Negative Im going to start this review off by saying that im not reviewing the gameplay, because I cant play. The game looked pretty fun from what I saw so me and my amigo got the game and... it didnt work. It just crashed everytime I tried playing. So until this gets fixed, I would reccomend buying another game.
Date 2017-03-07 Playtime 38h 22m Rec Positive This is a really goood game I played it With Friends.
Date 2017-03-06 Playtime 5h 21m Rec Positive amazing game. i love wrangling up big hairy black men in the woods  and puting them in cages.

Date 2017-03-06 Playtime 30h 24m Rec Positive You Should really fix this: Every time I go into the game I move my mouse and I canot look around. It's not my mouse because Ive changed the baterries multible times. You Should really fix this.
Date 2017-03-06 Playtime 6h 57m Rec Positive Maaaaan i played this game with my friend. We loaded up with some guns and set out some cameras in the forest. First night we were to scared too go out so we just camped watching these cameras for that big hairy fucker. Then suddenly my friend wanted to go out and desided we were not going to be some pussies no more. So we walked on the path that lead us to a small water. THEN BAM THE BIGFOOT STRIKED MY FACE AND WE FUKING SCREAMED SO LOUD XD XD XD XD. THEN WE JUST LAUGHED OUR ASS OFF AND WATCHED HIM DISSAPEAR TROUGH THE NIGHT LOL!

Date 2017-03-06 Playtime 22h 26m Rec Positive 此游戏可以三人联机一起寻找大脚怪！（没朋友你也可以选择服务器加入）其次游戏画面和氛围都是不错的，只是感觉有些单调的地方，比如探索的惊喜并不是很多，不是尸体就是亭子，希望多一些建筑物或者什么现象，会很有趣的（其次这个游戏英语理解并不难，玩着玩着就懂了~  已经成功捕捉一次大脚怪，感觉目前阶段摄像头意义并不大，晚上大脚怪会来袭击房车，所以大家三把枪都集中火力在房车等就行，地图上有失踪人员X4需要去寻找，一些建筑里面也会有少量弹药和医疗补给，弹药很珍贵，尽量保证枪枪命中，信号弹是用来吓跑大脚怪的（需要打在身上）尽量不要浪费，夜晚也不要乱跑，白天去寻找尸体就行。  ---------------------------制作组有更新企划！！------------------------------------- 制作组师徒在未来两个月左右更新一些这个游戏的玩法，并且添加更多的随机事件和模型，以及物品！期待！                 打个雷把老子吓的跳起来了...
Date 2017-03-06 Playtime 13h 40m Rec Positive best gam 9/11 rekomend
Date 2017-03-06 Playtime 3h 37m Rec Positive This game looks like its constantly being updated, but Bigfoot himself and dealing with the scares here and there like when a tree gets struck by lightning adds an awesome intensity to the already great atmostphere. I wouldnt have even found this game if it wasn't an avid player of it though. Definitely a good source to check out video-wise before committing to buying this game!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qU2JvxL824
Date 2017-03-06 Playtime 13h 42m Rec Positive very good game, could use with a better english translator and some more trap options, would recommend IGN 10/10
Date 2017-03-06 Playtime 0h 37m Rec Negative This is by far the worst game I have ever played.  The graphics look like crap, fingers clip through guns and there was zero effort put into making it look nice.  The gameplay is worse. You do nothing but wander around taking pot shots. The mechanics are garbage and conceptuallly awful. It is not going to get better.   I wish I could say it was written using Google Translate, but it wasn't. It's somehow worse than that. The dev misspells simple words like "yes", just goes to show you how much they care about this game.   Awful, terrible, do not waste your money.
Date 2017-03-06 Playtime 9h 49m Rec Positive This game scared me really bad when i first played it. But, one problem is you can't save. If any developers could add this to the game it would be more enjoyable to play
Date 2017-03-06 Playtime 17h 18m Rec Positive Ok first off this is a fun game. Yea I have not spent much time on it but fun game. I managaed to hunt that hairy B@#$%*! in the daylight and he ran like a sally. All the while catching rounds in his back. Since it is beta I know there is going to be some issues. The biggest is the Co/Op. If your going to have Co/Op have more and a couple dozen servers show up, or better yet a search function. I tried to get into one of my freinds game and never seen them, only the same same servers over and over. I mean come on this is steam and we know almost all of us play these Co/Ops with steam friends. I mean you can't even invite someone. How lame is that? Still it's a beta game so "hopefully" there will be some improvments. As a hunter I can not downplay the lever action. But, i would like something with more knockdown power, like say a 458 Socom or a 458 Win Mag. Also why no 4 player???? Kinda off being a 3 player when almost all games in Co/Op are 2 or 4. Supplies are finite and yea that  makes since. But if Bigfoot is killing people I would imagaing ammo would be in greater supply. Also if there are 3 hunters should be 3 guns and supplies for 3 people. Will I keep playing it yes, and if it gets better then all the better. If the Co/Op dose not improve then I will have to drop it.
Date 2017-03-06 Playtime 8h 3m Rec Positive OK. I dont know how people are playing this. It keeps crashing on ME at the loading screen. I have no idea what the heck is going on but I know I didnt pay $16 dolars for nothing. I bought this to find Sasquatch. Not a crash sign. Please someone help me with this or developer, please fix. Overall, it looks like a really fun game from gameplays I've seen.
Date 2017-03-06 Playtime 2h 0m Rec Positive Great game love it. Also looking for someone to play with add me(only if u have mic)!! 
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 6h 31m Rec Positive Keeps crashing and for some reason in the menus the mouse doesnt line up with where its actually clicking..... But when I did get to play it was pretty fun..... 
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 0h 31m Rec Negative over priced but good
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 2h 32m Rec Negative not my cup of tea.  needs more weapons bigfoot ony attacked when we stand still and not when we look for him.  spent hours looking and only shopwed up a handful of times.  the most fun we had was killing each other.  refunded.
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 12h 35m Rec Positive I bought this for my cousin and I and we shat our pants within one encounter of bigfoot breaking the fucking door down 10/10
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 5h 58m Rec Positive This game is beautifully made but i believe there is one problem: you cannot change the sensitivity or controls.  Some people which i am use different controls I use the arrow keys I know most people use wasd  but i prefer the arrow keys. i hope the maker of this game notices my comment and puts this in the game.
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 5h 48m Rec Positive Lots of fun. Worth 16 bucks
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 10h 8m Rec Positive Good game but the glitches were bad need better glitches
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 15h 32m Rec Positive Very cool game had me jump a few times. Just a couple of things I think it needs binoculars and the abillity to crouch.
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 4h 1m Rec Positive Pls fix this crash with the loading screen it`s awful i don´t want to deinstall this game and i´ve seen that many others have the same problem so pls fix it as quick as posible. thx
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 7h 53m Rec Positive Plenty of promise and almost complete game play for just being a beta (As of right now). That $16 isn't bad for the fun I had with friends. You might want to wait a bit since some important features are yet to be implemented but the price is not set to change and you will definitely know it was money well spent.
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 9h 25m Rec Positive For what i have seen so far it fun atm but there are some tings missing like chat or voice chat and to join random servers and not with all pasword protected servers   as far as now it is scary as you dont know when it will come  also with the gun could there at least be a gun animation with shooting or reloading ?  
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 14h 9m Rec Negative Needs more content for the price.
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 12h 15m Rec Positive I bought this for the memes
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 13h 52m Rec Positive THE NEXT CALL OF DUTY!  That's right folks it is here, the game that will put the CoD series to shame. This game, Call of Bigfoot: Modern Squatchfare, is some next level gameplay. The models are better than Fallout 4, the gunplay is better than Battlefield 1. If you don't own this game you literally have never experienced true happiness and joy. You sad bigfoot-less cuck. BUY IT.
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 2h 43m Rec Negative Needs to attack more played for 2 hours and he came 3 and i was walking around the map the whole game and resourses go too quick
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 0h 47m Rec Positive Very laggy
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 8h 13m Rec Positive GG 11/10 IGN Best part was when friend shot me in the face
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 7h 2m Rec Positive I had a BLAST playing this game, and that's really what counts right?  Yeah this game leaves something to be desired and it has its big issues.  All that aside it's just a fun game to play.  Stalking bigfoot through the woods, or being stalked rather, is a tension filled experience that had me on edge...the first couple of times.  The sound and ambience perfectly compliments the atmosphere of the hunt and the first few times you hear the bigfoot roar is unsettling.  A tree falling in the woods and lightning strikes can provide a jumpscare...the first few times they happen. The triumph of capturing the elusive beast is a significant achievement...again the first couple times.   And that's my biggest complaint with the game.  It really offers no replayability.  And once you've played it once or twice you've played it and seen all it has to offer.  I'm hoping the dev(s) can add some varied Bigfoot behavior or some other creatures to hunt that have different AIs.  A new map is in the works and that's great and all but if it offers the same exact type of gameplay then it really doesn't add much.  I hope that the new map forces you to approach the hunt a little differently or adds some new scares, as that's what will sell more copies of the game.  It has the groundworks to be a great game.  More traps, more varied Bigfoot behavior, and some more scares would be a huge plus.  
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 10h 34m Rec Positive The game is fine as it is, it could easily be expanded and improved in many areas. Either way it's a very good game for being this early in development. Didn't experience a single game breaking bug or crash in my 4 hours playing. Not worth 16 dollars IMO but if it's updated and expanded it will be well worth it.

Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 15h 58m Rec Positive Good game to play with friends, provides a lot of laughs. Got scared shitless by a tree getting struck by lightning, 10/10 would scream like a bitch again.
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 18h 25m Rec Positive -Had cameras and traps all over my camp. -Was inside 95% of the game. -Thought I was safe inside, bigfoot opened my door scareing the absolute crap out of me.  10/10 will never walk in the forest again.
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 25h 50m Rec Positive I barely played this game already and holy shit!   It's scary shit at night because it gets pretty dark and you don't know where he could be at . Until it's to late as he charges at you with his glowing green eyes.   It'd be more fun if more maps and such were added .  I'll surely recommend this game to others! Add more maps and  different legends then you got yourself a perfect game for myth hunters :)   TO ADD :  Downside is that when he shakes your trailer it does too much damage when your inside .  Maybe just decrease how much damage you take by a lot because no way that much health should be lost. Great game so far though. Decrease the amount of HP you get taken when the trailer gets shoke.

Date 2017-03-04 Playtime 7h 6m Rec Positive I love this game. It has a whole lot of potential of becoming a great survival horror game. Somethings I would change would be the lightning sounds start kind of nice and end very suddenly which kind of ruined the mood.  Typos made it funny but I'm pretty sure that will be better later. the graphics (of course) should be better which It will I think. The dear and elk are a good part of this game so I would leave that in. The breathing from the person your playing as kind of bothered me (whether you leave it in or not I don't care) and the growling from bigfoot was more funny then scary, like someone stole a lions growl and pasted it onto this creature. I don't know I would change it to be frank.  another thing that majorly pissed me off was the sudden lightning god that destroyed a nearby tree. it was good and bad at the same time cuz I felt that happened for a reason but it wasn't explained and it gave me a heart attack and had to stop playing until my bearings were gathered, I just felt that could be left out. Last but not least... fall damage was so sensitive in this game that it pissed me off how I kept getting hurt. Besides that I do really like this game and ill review it again in the future...  PS Also take off friendly fire it was stupid how friends kept killing me, or at least make a toggle option.

Date 2017-03-03 Playtime 7h 24m Rec Positive Ну что могу сказать, задумка хоть и не нова [i](на моей памяти как минимум rake)[/i], но все же интересна. Для меня самый главный плюс - это [b]фан и ужас[/b], который я получил играя с другом и в одиночку. Давно ждал игру, которая реально будет меня пугать, и не только скримерами, но и давящей атмосферой. Звуки молнии и грозы, звуки оленей, нападения бигфута - 10 кирпичей из 10. Лес, да и в целом карта мне тоже очень нравятся.  Минусы также имеются, в основном технические: Буду выделять более значимые лично для меня.  на 04.03.2017 -анимация [i](выстрелы выглядят деревянными, совсем не ощущается ружье)[/i] -то, что мы видим от первого лица, а именно модельки рук и оружия [i](я,конечно, не разбираюсь в моделировании, но разве сложно сделать более вменяемые модельки)[/i]. Ружье не выглядит внушительно (пистолет переросток), а положение корявых рук на ружье говорит нам о том, что он держит кусок экскрементов. -звуки дыхания [i](мб я что то упустил и это реально так, но складывается ощущение, что он, персонаж, в противогазе)[/i] -то что этот большеног бьет меня через окна трейлера, хотя они закрыты. -ИИ [i](получать удовольствие от игры не мешает, но хотелось бы более продвинутый уровень в будущем)[/i] -меню настроек, а именно мне не хватает хотя бы банального структурирования на "звук", "графику", "управление", отмечу - настраеваемого управления! Особенно сенсы мыши. -Кол-во контента и оптимизация [i](это скорее вопрос времени)[/i].  [b]Разрабы, не забрасывайте свое детище! Желаю вам расти и вашему проекту вместе с вами![/b]  Посоветую ли эту игру? [b]Да, конечно![/b]
Date 2017-03-03 Playtime 10h 34m Rec Positive This is a great game so far and the developers are doing a great job of adding things into the game. I love the concept and have been waiting for a game like this for a long time. There are a few suggestions I would like to make concerning when you die, I think that you should be able to respond but you make it difficult to do so. For example ether make it to where you respond after every night cycle, or make it to where you can find the lost people alive before bigfoot gets to them and after one character dies one of the lost people take over, and ether way you have to find your first body to get your equipment back. That is my suggestion otherwise the only problem I have with the game is that the volume in the options menu doesn't work. Thanks for making the game.
Date 2017-03-03 Playtime 14h 7m Rec Positive Игра супер,особенно было круто,когда Бигфут напал первый раз!

Date 2017-03-03 Playtime 1h 50m Rec Positive This was only the second time since 1976 that I was scared during a video game or simulator. I was in the camper looking at the cameras outside. The sudden roar scared me. Hats off to you for that. This is not even finished and it is well worth the price of admission. The ambiance, the day-night cycle, deer, it's all so immersive. This is going to be a classic. I recommend this to all of you who are tired of waiting for the reality shows to catch a squatch.

Date 2017-03-02 Playtime 13h 27m Rec Positive I really like the game so far but there is room for alot of improvment, such as not enough health I think your health should regenerate after a bit.  Add more traps such as ditch traps, bigfoot calls like they do in the show Finding Bigfoot, maybe add a 4 wheeler, shotgun or rifle with a scope.  Also for the online co-op maybe if you could play as bigfoot that would be a plus.

Date 2017-03-01 Playtime 0h 33m Rec Negative bought this game with hopes of playing with my friends. We could not find each other at all in servers or do "invite to game" with each other. After 30mins of trying to 'fix' this we gave up.
Date 2017-03-01 Playtime 1h 19m Rec Positive Genießt die wunderschöne Landschaft solange ihr könnt. Wenn Bigfoot nämlich ersteinmal eure Witterung aufgenommen hat, ist es vorbei mit der Idylle. Ein weiterer Vertreter aus dem Genre Horror/Survival, dieses mal gegen den legndären Bewohner der nordamerikanischen Wälder. Bekannt als Bigfoot oder Sasquatch. Ihr seid der Jäger, am Besten gemeinsam mit ein paar Kollegen, dort entfaltet das Spiel seine Stärken. Ein interessanter Titel mit Potential, der sogar mich überzeugt hat, obwohl ich Spiele dieser Art normalerweise links liegen lasse.  https://youtu.be/ZES9-OrjugI
Date 2017-03-01 Playtime 29h 13m Rec Positive I just got this game yeterday and beat it, and I must say I loved the game it was really scary but then my friend and I went to play it today and it didn't feel like a survival game it just felt like we were chasing bigfoot the entire time. I would like it to be different then that because with the tracker bullet you hit him once and you can then see him for like 5 minutes no matter were he goes it just doesn't make it feel as scary. We thought the game should be more about trapping bigfoot for a ending or just trying to survive as long as you can and have bigfoot be something you should try and avoid not something you chase after to win. Other then that it is a really fun game and it has some good scares.
Date 2017-03-01 Playtime 28h 3m Rec Positive Really fun and interesting game, however seems as though it loses it's scariness after about the 3rd playthrough and has many bugs, but the devs put good work into it.

Date 2017-02-26 Playtime 5h 3m Rec Positive Really fun brick factory!  +Soundwork: okay, this game is full of screamers - bigfoot screams, thunderbolt (OH GOD! WOW), and music is nice too.  +Visuals: Unreal Engine 4 is really great, and you can see it in-game - grass, light trees, everything looks nice xcept maybe playable characters and Bigfoot - maybe it's their ragdolls, but they look funny when they move around  +Gameplay: Fits both single and multi-player, in multi you can team up to3 people vs Bigfoot (players can't play as bigfoot) so single player is more scary than multi cus you are all alone in the huge forest, and multi is a bit harder cus you have not enough guns for all the people so you need to find one for you out there.   +Night and day change +Holy crap those thunders are scary AF http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=873154880 +Great if you plan to open your brick factory -You can't drink beer from the fridge :\ -Singleplayer mode is not paused when you press ESC or ALT-TAB +Steam cards  Nice PvE horror game.
Date 2017-02-26 Playtime 13h 22m Rec Positive Firstly, this game is stunning, with beautiful forests and realistic sounds it really sets you in that environment adding to a surreal and foreboding sense of realism.   I then spent the next 20 minutes setting up traps and a ring of cameras around my camper before I realised the map is a lot bigger than I expected. When waiting proved cowardly and arduous I set out walking while it was still light, found nothing and came back. When the sun set the shit went down...  I would say the initial buildup is the scariest part of this game, whereas the bigfoot itself is just a cuddly death machine, in all serious though I love this game. Its just really damn hard solo, so may need to get some friends to try again.  For the small price that this game offers I fully recommend it, even in Early Access and I cannot wait to see more content.  If I had one thing I did not like it would be the fact that the english isn't translated well, but thats nothing to do with the game mechanics itself.  3/5 stars!
Date 2017-02-26 Playtime 17h 11m Rec Positive A fun and fresh concept on the horror genre and I can't wait to get some co-op going! Too scared to leave the RV so baby steps!
Date 2017-02-26 Playtime 13h 12m Rec Positive Игра не плохая , но мы с другом похоже нашли баг - Есле бигфут нападает на нас с другом , при этом 1 игрок будет  наблюдать камеры а , другой будет ходить около трейлера , то бигфут будит бить не того кто с наружи ,а того кто в трейлере . Хоть упрись в него . Такая ситуация у нас с другом была 3,4  раза за период пока мы его ловили !
Date 2017-02-26 Playtime 87h 16m Rec Positive Pacth ใหม่ 4.0 (9/8/2021) ถ้ากำลังลังเลที่จะซื้อเกมนี้ บอกเลยว่า "ซื่้อซะ! Patch 4.0 ดีมากกกก" (แต่ถ้าไม่ไหว รอลดราคาก็ได้นะครับ แต่มันดีมากจริงๆ)  . กับเวลารอคอยกว่า 1ปี 7เดือน (บังเอิญมาก ตอน Patch 2.0 กว่าจะมาก็ 1ปี 7เดือน) ไม่ได้รีวิว Patch 3.0 เพราะ มันไม่ต่างกับ 2.0 มาก แต่ 4.0 นี่คือสุดยอดดดดด . Patch 4.0 หลังปล่อยอัพเดตวันแรก ก็มีคนเข้าเกมถึง 700+ นับว่าเป็นปรากฏการณ์มากๆ สำหรับผมถือว่าการอัพเดตครั้งนี้เกินคาดมาก แสดงถึงว่าผู้พัฒนาเขาตั้งใจทำจริงๆ และเขาก็ตั้งใจที่จะทำให้เกมนี้สามารถเข้าสู่คนหมู่มากได้ ไม่ใช่แค่เฉพาะกลุ่ม . Patch 4.0 มีอะไรบ้าง ? - เกมรีการฟิกใหม่ทั้งหมด (สวยขึ้นมากๆ) - เพิ่มระบบเลเวลและอาชีพเมนต์ผู้เล่น ผู้เล่นสามารถเล่นเพื่อนอัพเลเวลได้ (แต่เลเวลมีอะไรไหม ในตอนนี้ยังไม่มี เหมือนมีไว้ประดับเฉยๆ) - มีโหมดใหม่เพิ่มมา คือ 4 VS 1 (1คน เล่นเป็น Bigfoot อีก4คนเป็นนักล่า) ซึ่งผมก็ไปลองมาแล้ว Bigfoot ก็ไม่ได้โกงเท่าไหร่ เผลอๆเล่นยากด้วย แต่ช่วงต้นเกมถ้า Bigfoot รีบ นักล่าอาจจะเสียเปรียบได้ - มีแมพใหม่ 1แมพ ส่วนแมพเก่าๆโดนเอาออก (น่าจะทำกราฟิกใหม่ รออัพเดตในอนาคต) - มีตัวละครนักล่าเพิ่มเข้ามา 4ตัว และแต่ละตัวละครมีความสามารถติดตัวไม่เหมือนกัน (อันนี้ดีมาก เหมือนเป็นอาชีพเลย) - โมเดลบิ๊กฟุตอันใหม่ที่ดูดีขึ้น (แต่ส่วนตัว น้องน่ารักไปนิด 55555) หมายถึงโมเดลนะที่ดูน่ารัก แต่ตัวแม่งโหด - บิ๊กฟุตฉลาดขึ้นมากๆ ฉลาดในระดับที่วางกับดักจับนักล่าได้ 5555 / บิ๊กฟุตสามารถหยิบป้ายข้างถนน หรืออุปกรณ์ต่างๆมาใช่้เป็นอาวุธตีได้ แล้วโยนใส่ได้ การโจมตีมีหลากหลายขึึ้น - (อันนี้ค่อนข้างชอบ) ใน Patch เก่ามันจะมีวิธีโกงเกมอยู่คือ ปรับภาพ Low แล้วเกมจะสว่างมาก ความน่ากลัวจะลดลง ตอนนี้ต่อให้ปรับภาพต่ำแค่ไหนก็มืด ยกเว้นปรับผ่านหน้าจอ หรือการ์ดจออะนะ - อันนี้เป็นข้อเสียเล็กๆคือ ช่วงต้นเกมจะมีปืนให้เก็บแค่ 2กระบอก คือ ไรเฟิล กับ ปืนพก / ถ้าเล่นหลายคนอาจจะต้องแบ่งกันเก็บปืนไปก่อน ถ้าคนใดคนหนึ่งงกเก็บหมด อีก3คนที่เหลือก็มีดจ้า 5555 / นั่นแหละผมถึงได้บอกว่า ถ้าเล่นแบบ 5 VS 1 แล้วต้นเกมคนที่เล่นบิ๊กฟุตเขารีบบวก นักล่าจะสู้แทบไม่ได้ เพราะ ไม่มีอาวุธ อาวุธอื่นๆ ต้องตามหาเอาเองมันจะดรอปอยู่ตามแมพ - อาวุธในเกมตอนนี้ที่หาได้ในแมพจะมี ไรเฟิลเล็ก ปืนพก ลูกซอง / และยังมี M16 (ปืนกล) กับ ไรเฟิลใหญ่ ซึ่งต้องหารหัสมาเปิดเซฟ เพื่อเอาออกมาก (ในแต่ละเกม รหัสจะเปลี่ยนที่ดรอป และเปลี่ยนเลข) - เกมมีระบบ Lobby ที่สเถียรขึ้น เมื่อก่อน Patch 1.0 - 3.0 Lobby ล้างมาก ตอนนี้คนกลับมาเล่นเยอะมาก ถ้าจะนัดเพื่อนมาเล่น หรือลังเลที่จะซื้อ ตอนนี้เหมาะที่จะซื้อมากๆ เพราะระบบเกมดีขึ้นมาก สนุกมาก แต่ถ้าไม่ไหวกับราคา369 รอลดก็ได้ครับ ไม่เป็นไร . เป็นอีกเกมที่ผมนับถือใจผู้สร้างมาก กว่าจะอัพ Patch นึงใช้เวลาหลักปี จากผู้พัฒนาไม่กี่คน แต่ตอนนี้ผมได้เห็นความตั้งใจของเขาแล้วครับ ว่าเขาตั้งใจกับเกมนี้จริงๆ ไม่ใช่ทำมาขายเฉยๆ แล้วเท

Date 2017-02-26 Playtime 3h 42m Rec Positive [code][h1]Полноценный обзор со скриншотами вы можете прочитать здесь: [url=https://doggamingsite.wordpress.com/2017/02/26/finding-bigfoot/] Обзоры от Mad4Cookie[/url][/h1][/code]  Finding Bigfoot - приключенческий хоррор от молодой и довольно перспективной студии разработчиков CyberLight. Сразу жирнейший плюс ребятам из Киева за честность. Они сказали, что не хотели изначально выпускать продукт, а только лишь "баловались" с возможностями движка, но получилось уж очень хорошо и ребята решились на выпуск продукта в магазине Steam.  Выходя из названия можно догадаться, что главным монстром этого хоррора является Bigfoot (или по нашему снежный человек). Сюжета в игре как такового нет, мы переживаем одну и ту же ночь снова и снова, пока не поймаем "большую ногу". Вот чего игре и действительно не отнимать так это атмосферности. Глубокая ночь... страшные и странные звуки повсюду... зверь рычит, что есть силы, но на самом деле не это пугает игрока, а гребенная молния. Да, ребятам из CyberLight удалось сделать нереально пугающую молнию. Играли мы с другом обзорщиком, тишина, ночь, ляпота... и тут как хирак в двух метров от нас молния.... я думал, что на месте построю двухэтажную дачу. Нереально атмосферная ночь, это то, чем действительно может похвастаться игра.  Советую играть в Finding Bigfoot только в компании друзей, так как одному очень скоро наскучивает. Первые минуты вы реально боитесь этого монстра, а после это становится смыслом всей вашей жизни, просто взять и найти этого монстра. К сожалению, после того как вы поймаете его в игре попросту ничего не остается делать. Я конечно понимаю, что игра называется в поисках снежного человека, но если бы разработчики включили охоту на других загадочных монстров и даже на пришельца, вот это действительно было бы круто. Арсенал оружия тоже не так уж и велик: ружье, капканы, сигнальная ракета. В кругу друзей очень здорово играть, когда один бродит по лесу, а второй следит за камерами и говорит где сейчас монстр находится. Самое главное не забывайте про Friendly Fire, ведь именно с этого вопроса и была первая смерть в игре, скажу честно с Shepherd мы ржали как кони после моего выстрела в притык, после чего дальнейшая игра как то не задалась.  Графически игра очень красива, прорисовка окружающей среды и ночного неба просто впечатляет. Про молнию я уже говорил, но хочется заметить, что внешне она также довольно хорошо прорисована.Монстр выглядит также довольно колоритно, но к сожалению не настолько пугающе, как гроза;) Огромная работа над звуковой составляющей видна не вооруженным глазом, вы только посмотрите сколько комментариев по поводу грозы, как в моем, так и в обзорах других людей. Давящая атмосфера, непонятные крики, а иногда и довольно напряженная тишина - все это и делает игру чрезмерно атмосферной и довольно пугающей.  Под конец обзора хотелось бы перечислить плюсы и минусы проекта.  Плюсы: + Кооперативный режим до 3-х человек + Давящая атмосфера неизведанного + До усирачки страшная гроза (звуковая сопровождающая) + Хорошая графическая составляющая  Минусы: - Всего один монстр - Довольно мало контента (после того как поймаете бигфута, в игре больше нечем заниматься)  Finding Bigfoot - довольно хороший старт для молодой и амбициозной студии разработчиков. Повторно прошу разработчиков включить в проект других монстров, а так проект на твердые 7,5 из 10.

Date 2017-02-25 Playtime 0h 30m Rec Positive Bought the game yesterday played for about 30 mins and won the game didn't seem to difficult but it has the makings for a very good game.
Date 2017-02-25 Playtime 31h 24m Rec Positive Игра интересная,хотя ценник на неё завышен.Вылетает из кооперативного режима. И добавили в кооператив хоть чат какой нибудь чтобы с другими игроками контактировать. Ещё проблема в многопользовательском режиме когда заходит больше 3 человек,а ружей на карте всего 3. Для меня минусы которые следует исправить,в остальном все хорошо.
Date 2017-02-25 Playtime 3h 13m Rec Positive Laggy for me but very fun Iif you could add a graphics option that would be great ld be great
Date 2017-02-25 Playtime 13h 56m Rec Positive First time playing this game felt scary cause of the unknown but with my girlfriend things weren't as bad as I thought. Wasted all my tracking bullets first time using them Cause he came through the front door of the RV. The game is very slow at first but  once get the basics it moves pretty fast and chasing him all around map was when the game hits it's high point. everything seems well balanced. Recommend not staying in RV the hole time as you lose ammo fast. It takes allot of bullets to take him down. Playing with friends is the best way to go. Playing alone might get boring. I have to say this game is pretty amazing, Would highly recommend playing this with a group of buddy's the game worth 15 bucks. Enjoy Hunting him down, The AI is very smart and well made. Cant wait for the new map.
Date 2017-02-25 Playtime 13h 20m Rec Positive Awesome game! I like how it is diffcult to catch bigfoot. I am excited to see what else the developer will do with this game!   It was a good game to play with my  boyfriend and not do it alone haha! I can't wait for the new map coming out. I hope that there will be many maps and different types of monsters soon. I can see a successful game here. Fun to play with others.     I highly recommend this game.
Date 2017-02-24 Playtime 2h 46m Rec Positive Finnished it in 2 hours, but it was great fun. But the scaryness factor dissapeared early when you figured out the mechanics.  I would love to see more maps and different "monsters" like the south american chupacabra and maybe skandinavian trolls? with different ways to defeat them. as a easly scared person this was shitbreaking, but i think for most people its no quite there yet. Great potential and i will play again when its been updated more. Keep on working on it please!  Edit: I played 1.2.1. I haven't played since
Date 2017-02-24 Playtime 0h 50m Rec Positive Just wow :D. Amazing game,little scary ^^. Its cool adventure/survival game.Maybe is good to add options to change sensitivity and to change control keys ( idk like from  w,a,s,d to arrows ). Its interesting but little boring playing alone. Its great game :).
Date 2017-02-24 Playtime 74h 46m Rec Positive Ого! Переименовали в "The Bigfoot Finders". Раньше игра была "Finding Bigfoot". В новом обновление вообще жесть, но это ведь хорошо, так и стараются продолжать нас радовать с новым обновлением :), очень годную игру сделали, и только можно было немного цену уменьшить на 300 или 250 рублей, чтоб успевать всем купить эту игру, или со скидочкой купить :D Годная игра, страшная игра, и можно сделать из "VR", вот точно в виртуальной реальности личинку отложить :D, советую вам играть, и ловить с друзьями этого бигфута, и пугаться как еб*нуло молний в дерево :D

Date 2017-02-24 Playtime 1h 12m Rec Positive Finding Bigfoot really resonates with me, I can honestly say that on first purchasing this game I was concerned that it would fall way short of what I was hoping for, but I was more than pleasantly surprised.    They have captured what bigfoot country looks like, and for anyone who has seen the 1972 documentary 'the legend of boggy creek', then one area will instantly draw you to the opening scene with the sights and sounds that causes the hairs on the back of my neck to stand.  With the new day to night cycle they have flooded the forest with some amazing light visuals, colour saturations that beg you to admire even with the looming threat roaming the country side.  The mechanics are simplistic yet fun, I am continually drawn back to this game to see if I can take down this legendary creature.    This title won't be for everyone, but there's a good chance that you'll love this game if you have a genuine interest in Bigfoot.  There are growing pains with it, but the devs continually update and I can't wait to see how it progresses over time.
Date 2017-02-24 Playtime 1h 19m Rec Positive I love the game but make it so that it dosen't keep crashing all the time.
Date 2017-02-23 Playtime 14h 6m Rec Positive Круто,успехов вам!Рекомендую)))
Date 2017-02-23 Playtime 28h 13m Rec Positive Finding Bigfoot Nix für Schwache Nerven, ich traue es mir nur im MP mit Freunden oder mit Fremden.  Was ist Finding Bigfoot ?  Wie es der Name schon sagt: Finde Bigfoot  Wir machen uns auf die Pirsch um die 4 Vermissten nicht wieder gekommenen Menschen zu finden.  Doch einses soll im Wald vom tiefen Kanada herumlaufen... BIGFOOT   Deine Aufgabe ist es mit einer Schusswaffe und einem Nachtsichtgerät Bigfoot zu finden. Dazu hast du noch ein oder zwei Kameras eine Flare und Baterien für den Fall der Fälle ;)  Du hast nur wenig Zeit bis es Abend wird stelle schnell die Kameras im Wald auf und gehe zurück zum Camp um den Wald mit einem Computer zu beobachten. Siehst du ein großes und schweres Tier, so beobachte es weiter und schaue nach wohin es geht, ob es von dir weg oder zu dir hin geht.  Falls es zu dir geht mach dich bereit lade deine Waffe nach und halte Erste Hilfe bereit. Sobald es da ist Zielen und abfeuern...  Er wird nicht gleich beim erstenmal liegen du brauchst schon um die 30 Schüsse um ihn zum liegen zu bringen.   Bewertung:  Ich bewerte wie jedes Spiel in Schulnoten von 1 (Sehr gut) bis 6 (Sehr schlecht)   Grafik:  2  Sound:  3 (Nachladegeräusche sind schrecklich)  KI (BIGFOOT)  3  Welt  2  Items;Gameplay  3- (Beweisfotos machen können und Videos vom Tier machen können wäre schön)   Ich finde das Game ist echt nicht schlecht einiges fehlt mir echt:  -Das Bigfoot nicht nach einem Jagd sondern wir nach ihm Jagen, in real ist es ja so er haut ab (So Doku oder Film)  -Das er schwerer zu finden ist  -Mehr Items  -Lageroptionen wäre schön; das man sein Zelt z.B aufstellen kann, schlafen bis zum nächsten Tag    Sonst bedanke ich mich fürs lesen und wir sehen uns ;)   Max

Date 2017-02-22 Playtime 6h 58m Rec Positive Recommending from other posts. Game doesnt work for me. Just stays on the splash screen , but wont allow to select anything on menu. Windows 10
Date 2017-02-22 Playtime 6h 51m Rec Positive i like this game, my only problem with this is that i can never find a Co-op match, and there's no in game mic option or a chat thing so that if i do find one, how will we be able to talk to one another
Date 2017-02-22 Playtime 19h 48m Rec Positive Кто в бигфута?
Date 2017-02-22 Playtime 4h 40m Rec Positive Nothing but hilarius to play with your friends! I would recommend around 2 people tho or 3... looking forward to see new maps!
Date 2017-02-22 Playtime 18h 46m Rec Positive this game is one of thy best horror's i ever played, this is like the rake but better graphics not abandoned and better equipment this game tells you not to just survive the enemy but instead says you have to hunt it

Date 2017-02-22 Playtime 0h 21m Rec Positive SCARY AS SHIT! MUST A GET GAME!
Date 2017-02-21 Playtime 4h 46m Rec Positive A good game,i just wish You add the possibility to change key bindings.
Date 2017-02-21 Playtime 0h 45m Rec Positive only complaint I have so far is the spelling and grammer. but thats an easy fix.
Date 2017-02-21 Playtime 16h 37m Rec Negative game was better before update... flashlight is pointless, fall damage is a joke, ai is bad, low fps, map is baron, you get stuck in alot of the rocks, gun does no damage, cant camo traps for some reason, can go on and on.... just pass on this one, or maybe buy and play less then 2 hours then refund if you must, you have been warned, cool idea just done in a bad way
Date 2017-02-21 Playtime 2h 37m Rec Negative Контента в этой игре нет! Бигфут убивается за полчаса. Больше в игре делать НЕ-ЧЕ-ГО! Сетевой режим работает плохо. Своих денег игра однозначно не стоит.  Но как много положительных отзывов... Однако, никто из "фанбоев" и 10 часов в неё не наиграл!
Date 2017-02-21 Playtime 4h 28m Rec Positive This game is incredibly fun co-op. One minute you are ok then the next lightning strikes a tree and makes the toughest man pee his pants. Great buy! Look forward to future dlc.
Date 2017-02-21 Playtime 57h 27m Rec Positive I don't normally write reviews but I had to on this. WOW!! This is a crazy game and for being early access, it is worth it. It didn't take me long to be chased and attacked by Bigfoot and scared the cr4p out of me. You can set cameras up and go explore. there are many options. I found a bloodied campsite where people got murdered. It's near the lake. It's very open and spooky. I've played many games and this one is very good for being new. I'm hoping that it keeps expanding.   The only Con is that the programmer misspelled a few words but who cares!!  I'll update when things improve  Update 5 May 2020: It's gotten better although it was a slow start. Soon the update will be here with a better looking Bigfoot.. Still scares the piss out of you.
Date 2017-02-21 Playtime 10h 25m Rec Positive Nice horror
Date 2017-02-21 Playtime 5h 48m Rec Positive Extremely fun game and very challenging! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time I played it. Killer graphics and AI. This game has a lot of potential and look forward to seeing the finished product!
Date 2017-02-20 Playtime 3h 32m Rec Positive Игра хорошая ищю Русских людей играть в эту игру по скайпу рк или тим спику от 13 лет жду в скайпе len21312313 или в вк https://vk.com/id275497122
Date 2017-02-20 Playtime 0h 37m Rec Positive [u]Positive Merkmale:[/u] [list]     	[*] Gute gruselige Atmosphäre     	[*] Grafik sieht toll aus und läuft flüssig 	[*] Steuerung guter PC-Standard 	[*] Paranoia-Garantie wenn man den Bigfoot hört, aber nicht sieht 	[*] Interessantes Kamera-System [/list]  [u]Negative Merkmale:[/u] [list] 	[*] Langzeitmotivation? [/list]  In Finding Bigfoot müssen wir, wer hätte es gedacht, auf die Jagd nach Bigfoot gehen und einige vermisste Leute finden. Dafür stehen uns sowohl Waffen, also auch Köder und Fallen zur Verfügung. Sehr cool ist, dass wir einige Kameras im Gebiet aufstellen können und von unserem Wohnwagen die Gegend ebenfalls erkunden können. Wenn man dann die Rufe des Bigfoot hört, ohne ihn zu sehen, bekommt man durchaus schonmal Gänsehaut. Die Frage ist, wie es um die Langzeitmotivation steht. Hat man einmal den Bigfoot gefangen, wars das eigentlich... Trotzdem ein tolles, grafisch aufwändiges Spiel, was die 15$ durchaus wert ist.  Ich habe auch ein Let's Play in meinem [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ok91FKp_SAtxhz63Ti3KQ]YouTube-Kanal[/url] aufgenommen:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRZc3Ki5l3I
Date 2017-02-20 Playtime 10h 58m Rec Positive Всем любителям кооперативных хоррор игр советую поиграть в Finding Bigfoot.
Date 2017-02-20 Playtime 16h 13m Rec Negative I highly recommend playing this with friends, the downfall is that the "server" you play on only allows up to 3 players. The only map avaliabe at this time is big, so plenty of room to explore. The AI for bigfoot is pretty damn advanced so finding and capturing bigfoot isnt the easiest task (which i like). I suggest giving this game a try, they are constently updating it... fixing bugs and what not, im just excited to see what the new content updates have to offer.  *UPDATE* They haven't given this game an update in forever... Content got boring.
Date 2017-02-19 Playtime 22h 45m Rec Positive Its a good game, and it has alot of things to make it good... except the bigfoot never shows up. Please make him come more
Date 2017-02-19 Playtime 7h 6m Rec Negative Так новая карта и не вышла,долго я жду,но в игре ничего не менятся, максимум на 2 часа.Своих денег не стоит

Date 2017-02-16 Playtime 18h 30m Rec Positive разработчики просто красавы игра оч интересная в отличии от рейка эту игру обновляют несколько раз в день добавляют новые ништяки с плюхами вообщем доволен покупкой)
Date 2017-02-16 Playtime 1h 15m Rec Positive Игра интересная, особенно если играть с друзьями, но таких денег она не стоит 
Date 2017-02-16 Playtime 8h 39m Rec Positive Навалил кучу кирпечей из за снежного человека  Разработчики красавы))  Каждый день добавляют что то новенькое. Мелочи, но приятно))
Date 2017-02-16 Playtime 42h 8m Rec Positive Однако здравствуйте 🖖🏽 Если вы хотите обосраться или просто напрячь свои булочки, то эта игра именно для вас. Даже играя с друзьями, очаг будет напрягаться постоянно, ведь не факт, что Бигфут побежит на твоего друга, когда есть ТЫ😈 Сама по себе игра отличная, даже не смотря на маленький фпс(даже на минималках) играть в неё можно. Вот только с обновами лажа, кормят завтраками разрабы, но надеюсь на лучшее. Сам лично наиграл 30 часов (соло и в пати с друзьями) чесно сказать, больше там делять НЕЧЕГО.. Я уже от балды могу бежать за Бигфутом, чтобы быстрее его убить и найти проклятые трупы, которые можно всю игру искать, но один точно где то в дыре мира будет.
Date 2017-02-15 Playtime 1h 34m Rec Positive Игра классная хотя и в стадии разработки. Очень атмосферная. Жалко что нет сохранений 10 молний из 10
Date 2017-02-14 Playtime 50h 15m Rec Positive Первый мой обзор вообще из всех игр.  Плюсы : в игре есть атмосфера, есть идея, игра действительно годная, интересная. С удовольствием можно не только пострелять, но и просто провести время в компании друзей за охотой. Минусы : поведение йети пока недостаточно агрессивное и не хватает динамики, есть баги, но без этого никуда, проект еще на бете.  P.S. Из первого источника есть информация, что поведение врага будет дорабатываться, мир будет дополнительно заселяться и будут патч ноуты, поэтому игру советую всем, не пожалеете, да и цена вполне приемлимая.
Date 2017-02-13 Playtime 3h 18m Rec Negative Жутко сырая игра! не по купайте! Играть в коопе с другом нереально! Первые 10 минут игры жуткий рассинхрон, потом то оружие не перезаряжается, то ещё какое то го**о
Date 2017-02-13 Playtime 21h 39m Rec Positive Игра норм атмосферная
Date 2017-02-13 Playtime 2h 38m Rec Positive Игра очень интересная. Затянула с первого раза. Атмосферно. Хочу выделить плюсы и минусы: Плюсы: 1.Игра реально атмосферная. 2.Неплохой монстр, убить его нелегко, поэтому нужно продумывать его шаги наперед. 3.Игра выглядит очень красиво. Нравится природа. 4.Очень понравилось искать туристов ночью. Сразу говорю что минусы по моему мнению очень слабые и именно из-за этого я рекомендую эту игру. Минусы: 1.Плохая оптимизация. Игра сильно лагает при дожде. 2.Отсутствует смена дня и ночи. Один раз день меняется на ночь и дальше сюжет игры состоит из бесконечной ночи и охоты на бигфута.Надеюсь это изменят. 3.Очень бесит лаги в мультиплеере. Т.е. когда один из игроков использует камеры у всех начинает дико лагать. Исходя из всего этого могу сказать, что игра очень хороша пусть и немного сыровата. Но это ранний доступ и в будущем я надеюсь эта игра станет ещё лучше. Всем советую.
Date 2017-02-13 Playtime 13h 2m Rec Positive Очень интересная и качественная игра,монстра в этой игре довольно сильный но УМНЫЙ, Парой даже умнее играков...
Date 2017-02-13 Playtime 8h 20m Rec Positive GOOD GAME!I recommend this game to all people that like horror co-op games.It is very fun,especially if u have friend to play with!
Date 2017-02-13 Playtime 4h 59m Rec Positive Если вам не жалко денег, на пару вечеров веселой охоты с другом, то эта игра вам точно подойдёт. Смысл и цель игры- поймать чудовище, которое по слухам обитает в национальном парке и разузнать что-же стало с группой туристов пропавших в этих таинственных местах. И вот под покровом ночи с ружьем и фонариком вы выходите на охоту, что вас ждёт на пути к правде об происходяшем в этом месте вы узнаете сами. Из плюсов: Атмосфера Кооператив Интересная задумка (Rake все-же не то) Из минусов: Оптимизация Быстрое прохождение
Date 2017-02-12 Playtime 7h 56m Rec Positive Разработчики BIGFOOT большие молодцы, я давно мечтал чтобы кто нибудь взял идею Rake и воплотил бы её в более профессиональном варианте. Разработчик Rake явно хотел лишь заработать легкие деньги на игре сделанной на коленки и получив сумму денег которая окупила создание игры просто смотался в туман, обещав что якобы будет патчить игру, хотя уже через пару недель было ясно что он всех кинул. Я очень надеюсь что разработчики будут продолжать патчить Finding Bigfoot в будущем и что эта игра станет ещё более суперским хоррором :) От себя желаю игре гармонии и процветания, чтобы она популяризировалась и чтобы у разработчиков всегда были новые идеи которые можно воплотить в данной игре. Было бы круто увидеть самого Рейка в этой игре, это было бы довольно забавно, хотя бы в качестве DLC. Ну и так же было бы неплохо если бы Бигфут ломал камеры, как Рейк.  П.с Как же меня достали пугать эти молнии попадающие в деревья аха П.с.с Хочу игру по фильму искатели могил, с геймплеем как в Rake и BIGFOOT (Расставлять камеры а потом пытаться заснять призраков). Ну вот наконец то вышла новая обнова которая изменила игру почти что полностью и я так скажу, это топовски
Date 2017-02-12 Playtime 23h 39m Rec Positive Cel mai blanex co-op horror
Date 2017-02-12 Playtime 21h 53m Rec Positive Игра суперская, но когда проходишь, дальше не интересно. Так что Пожалуйста разработчики не бросайте игру, обновляйте её что бы, можно было играть интереснее и дольше. А не 2-3 часа. И оптимизируйте нормально. Ещё раз ,не бросайте игру, реально  классная))
Date 2017-02-12 Playtime 16h 38m Rec Positive Really good game it seems like a clone but its not really you got better Ai and coop in this game theres abit more but i think finding bigfoot is much better I played it with my brother we were thinking is bigfoot going to come then 10mins he comes out of the fucking forest and scares the fuck out of us so we ran for it keep up the good game.

Date 2017-02-12 Playtime 11h 29m Rec Positive Игра просто потрясная!  Оценка игре 10/10. Всё то,что здесь описанно можешь увидеть в этом видосе https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQbgbFvB2cY самый интересный и страшный момент на 32:55 и не забудь подписку! А теперь сам обзор! Появился в трейлере,загрузился пушками и думаю,а не пойти-ли мне Йети убить? Ну такой иду по лесу днём. И тут нашёл труп девушки изуродованный. Подойдя к ней услышал из-за кустов нечеловеческий звук и побежал ко всем ебеням дальше в леса после чего и заблудился. Искав кнопку открытия карты потратил 1-2 минуты и уже наступила ночь. Вообщем решил пойти,как мать учила. Возле горы. Иду такой и тут нашёл пещеру. Зашёл в пещеру поставил капкан и камеру. Побежал от туда к ебеням. Спустя секунд 30-40 этот капкан в пещере сработал и я понял,что рядом со мной бегает зелёноглазый ишак. Вообщем я побежал в фургон. Сидел там наверное 1 час от общего времени в игре зажавшись в углол и накрывшись пледом с выключенным светом. Меня всё это взбесило и я решил побежать в леса посреди блядской нескачаемой ночи. И кстати да,когда ночь там наступает,она становится бесконечной. Ну дак вот побежал в леса искать зеленоглазую паскуду. Нашёл,изнасиловал,продал в музей и теперь вообщем живу хорошо и пишу обзоры к этой игре. А и ещё меня по большей части напугало дерево,когда в него попала молния. Вот тогда я реально ахуел и настроил 5 кирпичных заводов. Вообщем всё это вы можете увидеть вот здесь,на моём канале. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQbgbFvB2cY Поставь лайк на видео и напиши комментарий если тебе понравился обзор,всего наилучшего!  P.S Те,кто хочет со мной снимать и просто играть добовляйтесь в Steam,приму всех. Будет весело! Т.к я очень весёлый человек.

Date 2017-02-10 Playtime 0h 45m Rec Negative Спустя более года зашел проверить, что сделали разрабы. Ответ очень прост-ничего. Обещали новую локацию-не сделали. Обещали оптимизацию-не сделали. Вообще, они давали очень много обещаний, включая камер-дронов, но ничего из этого в игру введено не было. По факту мы имеем все то же самое, что и год назад. Да даже такие мелочи, как полное не взаимодействие игрока, пуль, бигфута с водой не сделаны. Чем вы занимались целый год? Пофиксили баг, что теперь нельзя ставить перед собой капкан, когда бигфут приближается? Все? Гениально. Только как он был тупой, так и остался и убит он мною за меньше чем 30 минут, мною, в одиночку. Надеюсь Габен сжалится и вернет деньги за эту браузерку. Никому не советую эту игру. P.S. Не знаю как в других странах, но в России эту игру активно рекламят ютуберы, так вот, не ведитесь на это. P.P.S. Не, не вернули, но оно и понятно, разрабы все полученное бабло спустили на кокаин, им отдавать нечего, а Габен копит на новый гараж для порше 911. Плакали мои 300 рублей)

Видео по игре залью в ближайшие часы) А Кто хочет интервью с разработчиками жду вас на канале)  Теперь об игре) Игра Очень хорошая! Тем более если сравнивать с тем же Рейком. Тут и графика, и более проработанный геймлей, и развитый ИИ! Больше разнаобразия в плане рандомных событий (падаюшие деревья, молния бьет в дерево и т.д.) Есть отслеживающие пули, сигнальные ракеты.  Огромный плюс что обновления выходят каждый день! Ребята не забросили игру а постоянно обновляют! Тут можно полюбоваться на природу и в то же время есть криповые моменты! В общем 10 из 10. Ждем вторую карту)
Date 2017-02-09 Playtime 18h 15m Rec Positive ну во первых, основа игры, идея очень крутая, но это значит что нужно работать над вашей задумкой в серьез  например первые ощущения: очень круто, через 20 мин понимаешь что возможностей в игре очень мало, обычная бродилка и если повезет, то тебя напугает йотти  неплохо было бы дать немного разнообразие твоим действиям, капканы и ружье очень скучно, неплохо бы добавить еще какие-нибудь разновидности ловушек, приманок, добавить хищных животных, от которых тоже нужно защищаться и дичь на которую нужно охоиться, также дать герою возможность рыбачить, готовить и прочие отвлекающие от скучного мотания по лесу,   серьезно ты просто ходишь и понимаешь что после 15 мин игры, большее от игры ожидать нечего  добавьте голосовой чат и возможность искать игру с рандомными игроками

And yes its a Rake copy but i really like that but that game is now dead so i'm happy it has a new game. (not from the same developer) And i have to its really fun to play with others.
Date 2017-02-07 Playtime 20h 17m Rec Positive Игруля норм. Из бета мне кажеться не выйдет, над игрой сильно стараються и это заметно!Сегодня игру обновили 2 раза. Есть мультиплеер, так что можно поигратьс друзьями, но после смерти ты или твой друг не возрождаетесь, и это печельно, приходиться ждать пока друг его убъёт, либо же ты не умрёшь ну или вообще просто не пересоздашь сервер. Бывает страшно когда молния ударяет в дерево, вроде в настройках поставил звук на минимум, а когда молния бъёт в дерево и звук очень громкий и страшный!!))   Итог : игра отлично и стоит своих денег !!!!
Date 2017-02-07 Playtime 19h 22m Rec Positive [h1]Кратко о плюсах и минусах[/h1] Плюсы: -Графика -Частые обновления(в основном фиксы багов) -Интересный,разнообразный,увлекательный геймплей Ну для бета версии нормально Минусы: -Оптимизация -Упоротый Бигфут -Баги с мультиплеером  всё [spoiler]-ИГРА НИКОГДА НЕ ВЫЙДЕТ ИЗ БЕТА ТЕСТА И ЕСЛИ ВЫ НАДЕЕТЕСЬ ЧТО ИГРУ ДОРАБОТАЮТ ТО НИХЕРА ПОДОБНО ЛУЧШЕ ПОИГРАЙТЕ С ДРУГОМ МЕНЬШЕ 2 ЧАСОВ И ВЕРНИТЕ ДЕНЬГИ [/spoiler]

Date 2017-02-06 Playtime 14h 19m Rec Positive Игра очень амосферная и довольно таки СТРАШНАЯ!!!! Не радует оптимизация, у меня компьютер за 50к играю на низких-средних. Кооп можно было бы сделать побольше, но так как это бета-тест думаю будут фиксить и добавлять много нового. Предупреждаю сразу если вы хотите сходить на вылазу, чтобы поменять капкан, то покупайте стул покрепче, потому что когда молния ebanet в дерево то вы подскочите как ebychiy заяц На данный момент 7.5 из 10 (так как я любитель пошекотать себе нервы)
Date 2017-02-06 Playtime 15h 11m Rec Positive Короче. Дело было вечером. Решили мы с другом прогуляться до первой  камеры, она была совсем не далеко, в метра 100-150. И вот мы решили выйти наружу, пробежав сука метров 10, этот пидарас выскакивает даёт нам пиздюлей и уёбывает обратно в лес, чуть сука душа тело не покинуло!! А до этого в дерево ебанула молния, и тогда я построил второй этаж в своём доме. 10 молний из 10. Если вы страдаете запором - покупайте однозначно! Почему блять каждое обновление лучше другого??? То лагает, то ваще не работает. Ребята, давайте уже нормальные обновления делайте!!

Date 2017-02-06 Playtime 48h 48m Rec Positive this game is amazing it is probably one of the best horror games i have played in a long time including the co-op wich has brung me and my friend amazing moments but there are a few problems that we have incountered including the bigfoot. it seems that the first time we played together the bigfoot was so aggresive and he would attack every 3-5 minutes but after that game its like he will not do anything we will see him once possibly twice and that's about it and then 10 minutes after we see him he runs up hits us and we wont see him for a solid 15 minutes afterward so if the game creatore read's this please do something it will be so much more fun if he would actually "hunt" us. also we have found something to do with this problem also we will find 4/4 of the bodies and he will still "avoide" us no matter what. so please if you can fix this bug? also one more thing i have to say is the noise's the bigfoot makes wich is only really 2 noises which is the roar it makes when its far out in the woods and the almost like lion roar it makes when it attackes my self and i hope most of the people playing woudl agree to add more Bigfoot roar's and howls personaly there are pleanty terryfing howls and roar's across the internet that would increase the games scaryness ten foald so if some one see's this please let the game creatore know about these problems it would help so much!
Date 2017-02-05 Playtime 14h 9m Rec Positive Игра шык поиграл такой, раставил камеры, надо было отойти. Попросил друга за камерами последить (через скайп "демонстрация экрана"), прихожу сказал что была тень на 6 или 5 камере. по афекешел мин 5-10. И вдрук эта обезьяна ростом с фургон, проходит сквозь стенку фургон ***шит меня и смывается. После первого удара я выключил это. И жду пока он купит мне её играл через (семейный режим) Игра норм советую поскрипту: ломает нервы и психику :)

Date 2017-02-04 Playtime 19h 25m Rec Positive I have played this game only about 2 hours and died 2 times already first one was just like 45 mins just wondering around and trying to find the bigfoot. I had placed all the camera and was pretty happy what I had done. He set 4 of them off and lost some of his hp but never really saw him through the cameras. After that I was walking down on some rock wall and lost third of my hp for no reason wierd... But anyway i was heading back to my RV when he just surprised me and smacked me in the face and ran off. I got lucky because i hitted him with my tracer round but then i realised he was heading towards my RV like really? then he stopped turned around and was heading my way I was like this is not going to end well and soon I died because i didnt run to the opposite direction. Second time I died inside my RV and if you are wondering is the RV a safe spot?? Let me tell you it isnt he runs at it slams the door open comes inside and smacks you and runs away D: and he opens the windows too for some reason to smack you again.  but honestly yes this game is awesome I really enjoy the feeling off getting scared shitless but yes yes the game needs some improvement and maybe more medkits. 2 inside the RV seems pretty useless if you thing how much the bigfoot can hurt you. Any way I just really enjoy playing it and definitely recomment it. If you think buying this game maybe its the best if you get it on sale or if you cant wait just buy it.   AAAND sorry if I made any mistakes writing this on the grammar side :).
Date 2017-02-04 Playtime 1h 26m Rec Positive Купил я эту игру значит из-за того что просто люблю йети. Так как я уже смотрел про неё видосы на ютубе, сразу после начала игры начал ставить капканы абсолютно везде, но спустя 5 минут стало страшно и я решил посидеть в трейлере и наблюдать за камерами. Первый раз я его увидел когда он СУКА ВЬЕБАЛ ПО ОКНУ И УДАРИЛ МЕНЯ В ТРЕЙЛЕРЕ! Я обосрался и тупо забился в угол и стал ждать. За 10 минут моих ожиданий он приходил раз 5 и все эти 5 раз он пытался уебать меня, но я отстреливался. Самый дикий пиздец произошёл когда ОН СУКА ДВЕРЬ ОТКРЫЛ и сьебался сразу. Я вышел из трейлера думая, что тот придёт минуты через 2 и я пока могу пойти и проверить всё. Хуй там плавал. Только я отхожу от дома он подбегает и с вертухана мне прописывает по щам. Короче игруха страшная, советую ночью под окна трейлера капканы ставить что бы эту мразоту уебать. Советую к покупке если хотите поиграть в страшную игру

Date 2017-02-03 Playtime 8h 50m Rec Positive Неплохая игрушка, хоть и ранний доступ.  Местами будет страшно!  Надеюсь сделают вменяемое, кликабельное меню, фонарик чутка поярче, ружьё немного покрупнее, да возможность взять с собой запасную батарейку к камере.  Ну и автоприцеп немного апгрейдить: решетки на окнах + металлическая дверь.  В остальном всё норм))
Date 2017-02-01 Playtime 0h 51m Rec Positive This game is amazing! I actually FOUND BIG DADDY! it was intense... i was walking in the woods & found a dollar then i found big foooooooooooooooooooooot. at 1st i was scared ran back to my trailer but then this game me the confedense with that 12 gauge shot gun to run a train on that hairy beast! i killed big daddy and saved the children in a near by village. I won the gobal peace prize.  Good luck to anyone that plays this game. Big Foot can be scary but just know you can always beat the evil in this world by chanting " BIG FOOT WILL NOT DIVIDE US"  10/10 IGN
Date 2017-01-31 Playtime 1h 17m Rec Negative Lack of variety available to the player with a single map and a single enemy but this is early access. But that lack of variety is shown in how you approach the game the equipment you have available to you has each its own total load amount, as there is no need to decide what equipment you take with yourself you can only approach the game in a single way. The game does have single and co-optional modes but this just causes balance problems to the game (ie cameras that can be viewed at base very useful in co-op but near useless in single player). The target is bigfoot which is also boring because as far as targets go it has as much versatility as a bear. Game looks pretty but the core idea is so boring and linear I cannot recommend.
