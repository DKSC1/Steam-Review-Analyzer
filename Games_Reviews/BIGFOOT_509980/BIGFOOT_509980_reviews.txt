[Date: 2025-03-27 | Playtime: 6h 40m | Rec: Positive] My time in-game has been (as of writing this) spent exclusively playing the multiplayer version with one other friend, both of us playing survivors against an AI controlled Bigfoot. With that out of the way; I have deeply enjoyed this game, the shooting feels pretty good, the looting feels pretty good, Bigfoot is scary when he sneaks up on you.   Many of the the aforementioned, and not mentioned, parts have some rough edges to them. For instance, the shooting feels nice, but is kind of samey due to an either real or perceived lack of hip-fire inaccuracy. The looting can be a bit tedious at times, especially when you lower the amount of loot on the map, finding maybe 2-5 items in any normal sized location seems to be the norm.  Now, my favorite part of my experience so far has been the titular character: Bigfoot. Fighting Bigfoot can be very thrilling both when you are not armed to the teeth with every explosive and weapon on the map, and even when you are, seeing how much damage you can do in one go is also a blast. Throughout the close to 10 rounds I have played of this, across all the maps, it has been very interesting to see how the environment changes how both you and the Bigfoot play. To explain, within the Redwood Forest, you have access to many camp sites and cabins, leaving you often with resources to spare. However, due to the amount of wildlife and trash within the map, Bigfoot also has many chances to heal, leaving both sides pretty well balanced.  My only example of game-breaking jankiness was in the second round I played, wherein Bigfoot got stuck on some rocks in a river and could not move, which ruined any fear and tension that was established in previous Bigfoot attacks.  Overall, very fun with friends, a bit of jankiness can be expected, but nothing game-breaking happens frequently.

[Date: 2025-03-12 | Playtime: 9h 57m | Rec: Positive] It is a fun game, I have enjoyed it. It says that it doesn't support the controller, however, thats how I have played the game with an Xbox controller
[Date: 2025-03-01 | Playtime: 7h 21m | Rec: Positive] I genuinely love this game, it's so much fun and I can't wait for the official release. That being said, I despise the resurrection ritual shit. I'm not saying that I think the idea is bad because I don't, I actually really enjoy it as a concept but I have some issues with it. First off, it's hard as fuck to find and if bigfoot comes in and wreck's someone's shit and now your teammate is dead before you find all 5 totems and the ritual sight then they're just like there waiting for the rest of the team to bring them back. Which imo is boring as fuck being the person waiting but I digress. The second issue is how buggy it is when you're carrying a body, like it's funny at first seeing them flop around in your arms but it lost it's novelty and I hate when their big ass forehead flops in and out of frame. I understand things will change and that it's early access and I'm still learning the game but personally that's my opinion and besides those 2 issues again I really like this game it's super fun and I highly recommend getting it.
[Date: 2025-03-19 | Playtime: 13h 7m | Rec: Positive] This game is LIT. The multiplayer experience is awesome, and the game play is chillingly awesome. 10/10 would recommend.

[Date: 2025-03-25 | Playtime: 6h 31m | Rec: Negative] бигфута не появилось за 10 ночей, пересоздавали даже лобби с другом, всё равно нихера. а когда нажимаешь кнопку в игре "сообщить о проблеме" игра просто крашит) разрабы, вы мрази
[Date: 2025-03-25 | Playtime: 1h 33m | Rec: Positive] Игра отличная, только вот про игру с тем самым другом у которого вечно нет денег придётся забыть. (Стоит дофига)
[Date: 2025-03-25 | Playtime: 13h 47m | Rec: Positive] Fun but quite buggy and the AI gets stuck on everything so he doesn't attack at all
[Date: 2025-03-24 | Playtime: 59h 38m | Rec: Positive] Hello and as someone who played it in the beta stages all the way back in 2017 I can ensure you this is and absolutely astounding game graphics game-play a mix of high actions combat mixed with hunting themes ans the big beefy boy himself its worth the money
[Date: 2025-03-24 | Playtime: 5h 4m | Rec: Positive] Super fun with friends, horrifying, exciting, and a must buy! 8.5/10
[Date: 2025-03-24 | Playtime: 14h 35m | Rec: Positive] Possibly the best game I have ever had the honor of playing. I was brink of suicide before playing this game saving my life and the bullies at my school so thank you bigfoot for my life.    FOOT.
[Date: 2025-03-23 | Playtime: 9h 38m | Rec: Positive] pretty simple game just set traps and try to stay hidden. long nights and short days make for tricky or slow looting but with the right team and a set of mics this game can be a lot of fun.
[Date: 2025-03-22 | Playtime: 8h 13m | Rec: Negative] This game was fun until the new update where it is now unplayable. it used to run fine with no issues but now every action is delayed and when we were 5 min from beating the game it crashed on us.
[Date: 2025-03-21 | Playtime: 5h 41m | Rec: Positive] The game was pretty good, love the atmosphere it creates. I do feel while playing with AI Bigfoot it can be a little dead during the day. We have also experienced issues with AI Bigfoot getting stuck in some parts of maps, this really slows down the game and honestly ruins the experience. Other then that the game is nice and makes you feel on edge. Despite the let down of the AI I still recommend this game.
[Date: 2025-03-19 | Playtime: 6h 22m | Rec: Positive] its fun but the loading times are stupidly long
[Date: 2025-03-16 | Playtime: 3h 47m | Rec: Negative] dogshit, nothing worked, they had voicechat and then took it out, servers never worked, nothing explained in game
[Date: 2025-03-12 | Playtime: 12h 8m | Rec: Positive] Great game but I'm worried for the future of it... I understand that the game is in early access but it feels like it has slowed down in updates over the years. Part of this could be the fact that the developers are currently dealing with the war with Russia. It still feels like a buggy mess even with it being in EA for almost 8 years. Some of these bugs are visual while others are game breaking, such as Bigfoot getting stuck in a river and not moving the whole game, and achievements not working. I will still personally recommend this game to who ever is feeling like playing it. It is still an amazing game and fun with friends. I would just keep in mind that this game is more than likely never to be finished at the pace it is moving in the development process.
[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 0h 8m | Rec: Negative] 商店页面支持简体中文游戏里不支持是吧 什么jiba游戏 没简中就算了还欺骗消费者
[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 17h 46m | Rec: Positive] This is the best game! u gotta survive, get better weapons, find bigfoot take a photo of him then and more quests, i think u can catch Bigfoot. but anyways its the best game EVER!
[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 96h 27m | Rec: Positive] I love this game to play with friends but the only thing I dis-like is that the skins for big foot, so you have to choose for him to now look snowy and have the skin or for him to be snowy and not have the skin you paid for...
[Date: 2025-03-24 | Playtime: 5h 39m | Rec: Negative] I picked the black guy with my friends, and the ONE rule in any horror movie/game is that the black guy dies first... ALWAYS!!! so like i told them protect me because we all knew what would happen, so the AI bigfoot jumped off a cliff 360 me and ONLY TARGETED ME!! ignored the 2 white fellows and only got me the black guy, then after he killed me right away, he proceeded to ignore them and not attack for 9 NIGHTS!!! (based on a real story...) (I do actually recommend the game its funny asf)
[Date: 2025-03-02 | Playtime: 4h 50m | Rec: Negative] Hunting Bigfoot more like actually trying to find bigfoot, spent a few hours trying to find him the only thing that got me scared wise was lightning   do not recommend
[Date: 2025-03-01 | Playtime: 7h 49m | Rec: Positive] крута гра є атмосфера жаху та виживання.Реалістичний ШІ Бігфута монстр розумний,вчиться на помилках гравців,уникає пасток і може несподівано атакувати.
[Date: 2025-03-13 | Playtime: 7h 9m | Rec: Positive] Me gusta jugar el juego con amigos, si no en mi experiencia es muy aburrido.
[Date: 2025-03-10 | Playtime: 30h 22m | Rec: Positive] This is fun with friends! one of the jokes that i did was Bigfoot was bodyslamming people. But this game is actually fun.  "Guys, the Bigfoot. Go get it."
[Date: 2025-03-09 | Playtime: 4h 43m | Rec: Positive] Game can range from horrifying to funny depending on who you play with, which is a real plus. A good game that involves a decent amount of strategy and critical thinking. While the game description makes it seem as though the player is hunting the titular Sasquatch, the actual feel of the game shows its the other way around, which was a pleasant surprise.

[Date: 2025-02-28 | Playtime: 26h 9m | Rec: Positive] if the devs are reading this i would just like you to know that i love the game the details are of the charts i appreciate the hard work and effort put into this game i was wondering if you want to try out some of my ideas  idea 1. trip mine when big foot steps on the mine after he take another step it would paralizes him because of the damage to his legs.  idea 2. stun gun/net cannon -when you shoot the net at big foot it gives you 2-5 seconds to shoot him or run away.  idea 3. taser same mechanics as net cannon but a secondary   when i think of more ideas ill post them
[Date: 2025-02-26 | Playtime: 18h 23m | Rec: Positive] This game is an absolute blast to play. Bigfoot nailed me in the face with a stop sign. 10/10.

[Date: 2025-02-25 | Playtime: 14h 17m | Rec: Positive] good concept starts out good getting a challenge out of Bigfoot but does not last long. pulls back and never attacks again after getting hit. game play begins to get stale and just drags on game can probably last days in real life lol if you can never find him you would at least think he would pick off solo people make some effort game can definitely make improvements on the AI i would say we love a scary aggressive big foot ready to do battle or even continue to stalk you and your friends but just the constant hiding does not do it for me.  It would be nice if he could change between scared hider to aggressive depending on how far one is from his group again good game just need small tweaks with the AI of Bigfoot
