I tested this with two friends and one brain dead bot Honestly i don't know if i would recommend this game or not I really want to like this game because of its really really good idea but something about it just doesn't get me on hooked And since I have no one to play this game with others refund it went into refund
The game is simply awful it is trash actually Annoying sound effects annoying unbearable and unreadable UI Essentially 0 gameplay loop its amazing how poor that is it's NOT entertaining as a shooter is NOT entertaining as horror and is NOT entertaining in combat or strategy For me this game fails at everything It fails to deliver anything meaningful at all even while playing with 4 friends
Fantastic Great atmosphere amazing game mechanics Just all round great
An amazing game if you play with friends but the game is dead for the most part for those of us who don't have friends Takes nearly 10 minutes to find a lobby if you don't want to play with bots but is definitely a challenge with friends or solo if you have the skills to overcome the odds

Get the fuck out
My friends and I haven't beaten the second level 10/10 worth every second favourite game in my library
good game very recommend D
its fun game with friends ofc
A really great game with the blokes just make sure you dont get confident thats how you die 3
Doom but your just 4 random people with guns
difficult if your bad also your bad really cool game though
very fun and scary all at once
This game is really great I heard it was hard so I gave it a try and got ass handed to me because I was playing with CPUs 7/10 by yourself 9/10 with friends 10/10 ruined friendships
Don't play this game 1 The stealth flows like cement where you creep forward and hope the AI does not bug out and putting special enemies as an obstacle in stealth is just a cheap shot 2 The combat is somehow worse the opponents don't indicate hits at all'and sometimes can play dead just to spring back up making the forced combat sections barely playable 3 requiring 4 players is a laugh if you play with just 1 bot meaning 3 players the game is unplayable 4 The horror of the game quickly turns into annoyance when you realise the latter points 5 The GUI is borderline unreadable Unless playing with 3 psychotic peeople avoid this game and even then concider waiting for a sale

Nice game
No creia que este juego fuese tan bueno en cooperativo con amigos es mucho y emocionante cada fase complicada que te costo una y otra vez cuando la completas es satisfactorio 9/10

The boys and I are too shit and uncoordinated to get very far in this game But it's fun trying
GTFO hard game monke hardcore gamer monke think game is good monke recommend PS Monke likes whacking sleeping people in game ofcourse 100 recommend
funky game bonk the eepy
Very fun frightening tactical to have a lil fun time with the boys there is nothing more to ask
Needs a protected queue for unmodified clients because enough people ruin runs with mods that affect players besides that its like a 9
i got so scammed i bought it for 40 just to see it discaunted for 16 only a few minutes later thats just sad
O jogo muitoooo bom recomendo para quem gosta de stealth e um jogo que exige pois os recursos limitados apesar de ser PvE um combate bem massante Todas as fases/rundown diferentes tanto de objetivos quanto de dos dormentes/sleppers areas e Jogo/joguei com minha esposa 2 bots e tem dado super certo posso garantir que ate a R2B2 passar nessa config de teamplay e nisso 15h horas de encontramos bugs e o arsenal de armas itens ferramentas e estimulos muito Acredito que algumas melhorias poderia ser feitas nos bots para comanda-los melhor por exemplo pegue esse item porque as vezes eles pega automaticamente ou fique posicionado aqui mas no geral eles bem quebrados e ajudam muito Obs apesar de ter armas de fogo passa grande parte explorando como progredir pro objetivo em stealth e matando os dormentes/sleppers com armas brancas isso para evitar ondas perca de recursos como HP e o mais importante Obs 2 para quem for jogar com bots importante dar uma lida em para entender como eles funcionam na em que procurei essa aqui me foi
Nah bro
I am only 7 hrs in and I like this game already Anyways You guys owe me a new pair of pants and my manly dignity has been shattered
Got the game its fun and frustrating Now i only need friends to play with
Really under rated game This is a hardcore coop experience What I like the most about this game is how it really doesn't hold your hand There is a lot you have to figure out yourself Trial and error Its a CHALLENGE to get through even with a full team Games probably a little dead these days but if you can get a group of guys playing this your in for probably one of the most intense PVE coop experiences you could get Also just the atmosphere this game has along with the audio quality creates a very immersive experience
Difficult game need 4 players D
Actually really good now
if bad get good

Got sucked into this game for a long time Very hardcore
THEYRE EVERYWHERE
Absolutly beautiful game the graphics and the levels are all really good and its a great game for people who enjoy strategy and FPS games but not the PVP aspect of FPS Highly recommended even for people who don't particularly like the horror games but love playing video games with friends Warning you will get very competative
Pretty fun played a little bit here and there Ending is ass tho
This game is super fun alot of screams and strats that go into it Each run is different and offers a refreshing and new experience each time Team killing has it's moments and playing this at night with the boys have never been better 10/10 would pick up and play We all love the brain-rot this game give us lol

The Sniper is good and cool actually
Play the game with friends greatest team working game ever
I HATE BLIND PEOPLE I HATE BIRMINGHAM 10/10

11/10

Quite challenging specially when play only with bot

good game
Great game sniper bad much upset
one if not my favorite games ive ever played however only good if you have a full team If you have friends get this game
I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father and probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 15 now My son got this game from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories

If FPS had a souls-like this would be it

Likely I'm just a bad player but it was too hard and no option to make is easier Couldn't complete a single level even with co-op So game was good But costs to much for just a single level
Scary and so much FUN Having a Mic for voice chat is a must to talk with team
idk man like gtfo or something
idk
get the frick out
if there was a zombie apocalypse and they say that the zombies are from this game I'm alt-f4ing my self
I'm not far in but the dopamine rush of watching a sleepers head explode when I hit him with my club is worth every cent
Juegazo para jugarlo con amigos solo se hace mas aburrido

JOGO DEIXA TENSO MAS A EXPERIENCIA TOP
Very difficult but balanced and fair An immersive extraction shooter with some solid horror elements you need a team of dedicated friends if you want any hope of clearing this game's challenges
i worked together and still died together opened a door that had 8 large black men in it and they harrassed me because i didn't turn my light off 11/10 would reccomend to people i want to give PTSD to
Yes
HELLO_WORLD
MUST PLAY WITH FRIENDS Get ready to figtht for your lives
Me and my Hubby just ran a couple rounds in this game I think we're having another child gonna name it Pedro
Refunded
Masochism at its finest
I did in fact GTFO
bad
This game is meant to have some difficulty to it however it's too hard to the point where its frustrating and makes me want to pull my hair out I played it more than I should have just trying every single recommended thing on the internet to make it playable but its so bad that I just can't even look at this game again I have to go to therapy now because of this trash game Don't waste your money on this game or time It's miserable to play
Jogo excepcional realmente muito bom de gameplay bem desafiadora Requer bastante e se conseguir 4 pessoas melhor ainda eu joguei grande parte do game em duo com 2 bots e devo dizer que o mais foi lidar com os bots bastante bugs envolvendo o armamento da IA que simplesmente estragavam toda nossa run Tem um certa lore mais para ultimas rundown(7 e 8 que te cativa e faz querer ver o que vai acontecer Com tudo isso ainda recomendo experienciar uma gameplay de dois menos que isso da se for sua unica vai se divertir bastante e passar bastante raiva
great game but the bots have a horrible IA and i don't have friends to play this with
Buen juego con amigos dificultad alta como el diablo pero god
we have lived a thousand lives we have diead a thousand times
Hard to play ✅ Hard while playing ✅
my friend pretend his game is crashed and dont wanna play with me,i mean thats crazy
Only game you can say cum gun and its pulsing normally
You can sneak bonk monster in this game which is pretty good
Don't listen to anyone that says the slug shotgun is bad its good and anyone that tells you otherwise is probably bad at using it or better with other guns
This is a hard game A really hard one Actually I might as well say it's the hardest one I've ever played and by far The day I invited my friend to duo this game I had absolutely no knowledge of where I was getting us into That unpretentious invite led us to a loooong journey One filled with failures and successes Slowly but surely we painstakingly completed each rundown one by one We completed every single side mission of each level There were days where we completed 4 lvls at once and there were levels where we got stuck for months And after 340h what we're left with I could go on about the whole sense of pride and accomplishment hehe but I sum it up on this lots of memories of perseverance in failure and cathartic happiness and relief on successes Be warned this is a REALLY hard game But if you've got the willpower to own it it's definitely a once-in-a-lifetime game Think about it and if you think you can handle it all go for it God be with you You'll need Him We always do in fact but this game is a stark reminder of how ruthless the consequences of our choices can be
THIS IS SO FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN

jogo tenso pra caramba e muito top
juego dificil==yo feliz
Great game even when solo-ing
Seems super cool the annoying part is using the terminals Not great to have to go outside the game to know how to use the terminals Knowing msDOS If the changed the terminals let me know
Dark Souls but its an fps
GTFO stands for Get The Freak On so make sure you have 3 more homiesexuals with whom you can get down freaky style and bully pubs into quitting
This game is incredible if you want to live and experience a challenge Just try to get a full party or some dudes for playing it the first levels are possible to survive with the AI but is better with friends
Matchmaking sux Not many players are playing and goodluck completing a single match

25 25 10 GAME 1000/10
have no idea how this game gets the very good rating it did the game is garbage absolute fucking trash your swarmed by aliens which are bullet sponges knocking you in 2 hits or less with no real advantages over them
good game nothing else to talk just some minor bugs
300
DO NOT ATTEMPT THE GAME SOLO THIS IS A WARNING TO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID Otherwise the game is amazing and with good strategy you can probably complete the first two levels of every rundown with a duo I would highly recommend playing this game in a squad for the best experience but a trio also works well Not a very in depth review as I'm not an expert but none the less I recommend the game to anyone wanting a new semi-horror fps game to play with the boys
wish I didn't refund this game was fun but I didn't get to experience it much I dig the vibe heavy and if I played more I'd probably have loved the game
Bastante divertido com amigos dificuldade perfeita
I may need to talk to my P.O about these working conditions
Buenardo con compas

If you love slamming slashing and all-around smashing sleepers then this is the game for you Is match-making abysmal maybe Do I have friends who will smash sleepers with me I wish Does that mean that I've given up hope absolutely not The pendulum between praising your bots for following orders and cursing them for their incompetence swings faster than a striker's tongue It's one thing to remind a human to place a tool or use their gear but to micromanage every action done by 3 separate bots is draining on the soul especially when the few actions that they do perform independently often bone you anyways walking through doors I'm trying to close taking my health-pack as I give them ammo not knowing how to use a lock melter melting a lock and then just not pinging the case they melted shooting when I'm trying to clear a room silently You're basically playing baby-sitter simulator except your babies have guns and they have a side-quest to drink as much hand-sanitizer as they can when they're not clinging to your leg and using you as a human shield Some actions and missions simply require the brain-power of a human being and I can respect that At the end of the day the game-play is fun the artifacts probably taste like candy and if Dauda complains one more time about what is or is not on the bio-tracker I stg I'm going to feed him to the monsters pro-tip you can give other bots the bio-tracker
Very engaging and time consuming game Bring friends or suffer with the fact you will not have a good time GTFO has also reached end of life so take this into consideration with that being said GTFO does have an immense amount of content to explore and overcome
Big hammer go bonk on glowy mans head
Fun but hard without teammates so you'll either need 3 friends or play matchmaking
this game is insanely intense it really pushes teamwork and strategy so if you want to get the best experience you can make sure you have 3 friends to play with XD the atmosphere is super creepy the enemies are terrifying and every mission is so tense i love how big of a part actually listening for the enemies plays in the core gameplay loop difficult as hell but that just makes it so damn rewarding when you and your team actually pull off a run if into hardcore co-op games this one is 100 worth playing 10/10 one of the best purchases i've made on steam

This could be a fucking awesome prologue to the story campaign
Yes its a good game just don't play it
Fun with friends wold not play solo cool story great graphics fun missions Sadly it does get boring after about 12 hours of play time at least that's what happened with me
GTFO GTFO GTFO
It's a very hard game but satisfying Great to Play with friends
1-2
It's ok I guess If you play exactly how devs intended 6/10 but that's mainly the gameplay loop being a bit strange Don't buy slop of wolves the payday team is coming back from the dead for another easy bag and review bombing

Shhh Sleepers Don't make a sound Edit I made a sound and died
This game makes Concord look like a masterpiece Its 9000 garbage and not worth playing even it was free to play I got it on sale and am still requesting a refund Guess if might be fun if you hate having fun Don't waist your time with this trash
How to play GTFO 1 Get friends 2:Get to alarm door 3:Set up 4 Everyone dies to a mine because someone puts it next to yall 10/10 would do again

Before playing this game I had a normal heart rate a functioning social life and an unshakable belief in my intelligence Then GTFO happened First attempt Stealth mode activated We crouch flashlights off Silent takedowns Precision Strategy Friend sneezes IRL Scout hears it The room erupts into chaos 3 seconds later 5 seconds later DID YOU CLOSE THE DOOR ON 10 seconds later Full squad wipe Second attempt We actually coordinate We make it to the alarm door The game tells us to stand on glowing circles We stand on glowing circles just Screeching noises intensify Swarm spawns in We set up defenses I think we can Friendly turret eliminates half our squad We wipe Third attempt hardened veterans now We know how the monsters move We know how the game thinks We know that Carl will somehow still mess up We prepare for that Carl wakes up everything anyway We wipe Fourth attempt We miraculously make it to extraction We breathe a sigh of relief Final wave spawns CAN MAKE MAN LEFT We all die I hate this game 10/10
Not good for a solo experience Want to even have a chance at survival Bring friends I played during the time while it was free to play for a limited time

In the past 3 or so days I have spent roughly 4-5 hours on one level and have not made any progress I am living breathing proof of Einsteins definition of insanity 10/10 would struggle for hours again

Need friends for this one at least a team of 3 Game is very fun if your friends have the patience and willpower not to open fire on sight This is not a shooter in fact you should avoid shooting at all cost but when you have to its quite fun

No game will love you and hate you simultaniously as much as GTFO does It wasn't designed to be for everyone but if you're un)lucky enough to be the target audience then you'll have a narrative cooperative immersive and painful experience like no other

Great game You beat blind beings
26 hours in and I have barely scraped the surface when it comes to levels cleared Usually I get pretty mad when I fail repeatedly in games and stop playing them but GTFO is special in the sense that you don't really feel like your failures were based off of bad luck but instead are a result to your own actions and decisions that you have made throughout the levels GTFO is one of the hardest co-op shooter games I have played and it certainly lives up to its reputation The only thing I can really critique this game on so far is that its bot AI allied is subpar even if there is a horde directly in front of them if an ally is down they will drop what they're doing and attempt to revive the person that went down without fighting back causing a downing chain that causes you to be alone in the middle of a firefight The easiest fix for this is to download the betterbots mod
unusual game very enticing and you can really feel the fear of monsters that can kill the atmosphere is great and you want to play more

Its very slow paced and very methodical in its gameplay and if your brainrot brain can't handle that and would rather play Team Deathmatch then this game is not for you

Its one of those games that gives you anxiety and trauma.if you dont have any friends like me dont even think about downloading this
The difficulty seems to come from the fact that enemies will just spawn behind you when you aren't looking the janky enemy behavior and bad hit detection
Please remove the always-online requirement from this masterpiece and improve the companions AI
too much potential too little done with it
Found it more infuriating than fun or scary one of my friends had to restart it's computer after playing
El juego va sobre sigilo Los primos de mi amigo parecen no conocer ese concepto 10/10 recomendado si no tienes primos de los autos
ahem Ladies and gentlemen Id like to introduce one of the best PVE games ever made GTFO is like lightning in a bottle brutal fair reliant on huge knowledge checks and a level system that is recycling middle fingers every step of the way The game is hard to start but progressively gets easier as you get through the first couple of levels then dive off a cliff at certain points because the game devs decide this is a triple middle finger level It's electrifying how they don't hold back and keep through challenges at players through the level sets I have been a PVE fan for a long time L4D2 Deep Rock Galactic WWZ Vermintide 2 I've played at least some of the genra staples and this one is something special Nothing quite captures the ecstasy of finishing a hard level by the skin of your teeth quite like many other PVE games I've been chipping away at the levels so far with friends and am excited to finish everything one drop at a time
I dont even own it
PEAK GAME 👍
my friend just played for the first time and called it sgeeby 10/10
the hardest part of this game is finding people to play it with
This game is a lot of fun if you enjoy torturing your friends

extremely fun but you need friends to do higher levels
I did not get out The matchmaking system is the only thing holding this back
Trash Game Funktioniert nicht trotz mehr als Anforderungen niedrig eingestellte Grafik und keiner anderen Anwendung offen 5 min bis ich im game bin es in das Tutorial dann Blackscreen und sound loop
gostei A compatibilidade e jogabilidade com gamepad permitido mapear os e nem todas as mapeadas automaticamente para os do controle o que te a usar o mouse e teclado e com isso ter uma o tempo inteiro oculpada no mouse e outra tendo que gerenciar uma de comandos para se movimentar pular correr selecionar armas recarregar abrir portas tudo ao mesmo tempo no meio do ataque de uma horda de inimigos para mim a jogabilidade ficou e dropei com menos de 2h de jogo

FUN
This game is a complete rollercoaster of being proud of you and your friends or feeling like you're the stupidest people ever R3D1 still haunts my nightmares D
I've played it not too much to get bored but enough to see some problems Overall this game is great It is like dark souls but shooter you have to try hard to overcome obstacles and understand how the game works It gives you an interesting experience and sense of achivement But GTFO is very repetative It's fine if you play it once a month but I've played 37 hours in 2 weeks Main thing here is lack of variation of rooms sometimes on a new level I felt as if I was here before Secondly some weapons are useless I just never think about bringing them with me And lastly bots are very stupid And it is very easy to fix Just add a list of commands for them such as opening doors/boxes going to given position or staying at given spot taking specific consumables etc like in Space Hulk Deathwing But I highly recommend playing GTFO if you have a good friend and you are bored of other games
Didnt even finish the tutorial before i uninstalled it Terrible
This game makes me realize that all of my friends and I are complete imbeciles
guys please
Friendship is necessary for success If there is no friendship then there is no fun Also I do not like the feeler bois They are not nice and ruin runs 4 me At the end of the day friendship wins FRIENDSHIP IS THE ONLY SHIP THAT NEVER SINKS
my friends arent talking to each other anymore FUCK YOU HAM
gets bored easily and can't report teammates who shoot you for fun

this game is amazing but its so hard and thats why its so fun cant really do much without a team but its super fun i recommend it
javi no grites que me das meio
It's a good hardcore game which is nice but can be annoying when most of the time it's crouching and stealth killing Gunfights are nice but holy shoot does this game skimp out on ammo/meds for your team to get Love the vibe and atmosphere of this game something I like to get into It's coop game so only buy this game if you have a good group of friends that want to hardcore this game The game has improve last time I play like they made getting ammo/meds more abundant I still think that hardcore shouldn't sideline fun just for the sake of hardcoreness The game is no longer getting major updates after it went out of EA You can wait till it's on sale to play it
Dunno haven't played it yet
Game is really high quality and very enjoyable to play most people might not give it a chance because of how difficult it is but trust me when i say you need to stick it out
Realy liked this game only down side is that eventualy it get repetitive and some levels are quite almost impossibile to do alone or without experienced people I hope there will be a sequel
THE hardcore co-op FPS game That's all you really need to know
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP F***ING MOVING
Dice abre pero esta imposible
I don't think I'd recommend this game at full price but if you have a few friends to play it with and it's on sale I'd say it's worth it
It's not that I want to play this game the developer should be paying me to play it
Dont try this game unless you are ready for a steep learning curve fun to plat with friends.so all my friends BUY IT let me know
I use turrets btw
Rapaz.que jogo Se tu curte jogo e jogar com amigos segue marcha vai fundo Jogar de 4 ainda ain que delicia de 4 melhor ainda
I love getting demonic backshots from the little light gooners running around
Absolute beauty of a game I started off not knowing much about this game and fell in love with the concept of it I solo'd the first two levels of R1 but that was about as far as my skill would get me I convinced three other friends of mine to give it a try and for a moment we were getting work done on this game Currently I sit in R2 cause my friends moved on to the next game for them but I'm still here waiting for a new group to continue my journey in this game The game design and difficulty is addicting Knowing that if I make a bad decision it can effect not only me but my friends too really made this game stick out to me I can't recommend this game enough For anyone curious about the game I would say go for it I love this game to an unnatural level
Horror stealth shooter really great game
its awesome
Just got this game for 50 off I genuinely want to rip my hair out playing the first level of the first run down and can't complete the first level The tutorial isn't much help and for the life of me I can't remember what to type in the damn terminal when I query or ping something I didn't know the final objective triggers extraction waves and died when I literally almost had it too I don't have cool friends to play this game with so I'm stuck commanding the dumb AI ALSO I CAN'T ADJUST MY GAME TO UP THE BRIGHTNESS AND CAN'T SEE SH*T Hate hate hate hate hate this f*cking game 10/10 best game ever

Its a great game only downsides are planning 3 other friends for a raid like event that could last for hours Its truly fun but brutal Not for the faint of heart and requires determination from the whole group

Si vous aimez les jeux coop hardcore de la tactique et coordination avec un gestion de ressource mais TRES importante Avec des choix faire qui semble innocent mais qui on des sur la descente au enfer que vous entrain de mener ce jeux est pour vous Une bonne dose d'angoisse et de peur vous attend sur ce jeux avec des belle surprise quand on ne ce spoil pas Sinon passer votre chemin Pour les autres bonne descente dans l'enfer macabre de GTFO
Peak teamwork game
Un juego para quienes buscan un cooperativo en toda su letra con una atmosfera y ambientacion muy bien logrados que logra alejarse de lo basico con una tematica y estilo muy particular el sonido es exelente tanto de efectos como de musica que logran crear un ambiente que sin llegar a ser de terror te pone en suspenso Lo UNICO que le puedo criticar es el hecho de no poseer una forma de seleccionar el tipo de dificultad hay para quienes no supondra ningun problema e incluso los va a motivar aun mas a querer pasarlo pero para los jugadores casuales que se lo quieren pasar bien y divertirse un rato puede ser un tanto frustrante tener que repetir varias veces el mismo nivel hasta lograr pasarlo
pretty good game

My fiends r retarded I enter the room first and solo half of it only for jimithy jigaboo quandirius jogdairius the third to sprint in with his flash light on and get me anally raped by big black man with shit dripping out of his ass Anyways good game would recommend
so i love this game but if you dont have at least 3-4 players your not going to have a fun time this game is so enjoyable with other players and can make every second terrifying and enjoyable the bots are mad dumb tho did the reactor with them and they burned through all the items on round 4 of the reactor lol so try to only have 1 bot worth the money if you can convince your homies to play the game with you tho

This games is fun and all until one person fucks and there goes 45 minutes down the drain
Really fun I modded mine to play solo though since none of my friends enjoy suffering as much as me Yes you can mod yours to play solo Its on the Thunderstore your welcome
Great tactical horror game Work as a team with other players or command your bots to deploy their gear either way you'll have a squishy good time Remember failure is punishing but the knowledge you gain will make you that much more tactically ruthless Pro-tip load out with PDW and Scattergun for starters Shotgun sentry is also capable of holding off entire waves but melts through its ammo after a few uses
bought this game because a buddy wanted to play it and after i played it for 3 hours he decided he didnt wanna buy it anymore and now im stuck with it 10/10 would get mad and emotionally manipulate my friend and make him feel bad again

Why is it impossible to find a 4th
The feeling of surviving an hour or two long map just makes you want to complete more But then it is still recommended to play with friends and/or if your friends are too scared/lazy to play with you go to the official GTFO discord server and matchup with people that fits your vibe
I hope Den of Wolves is hard to play in GTOF And the game players should be ashamed of themselves How could only 3.3 players finish the game first
Brilliant game Very good with some friends Immensely difficult though My only gripe is you start with all weapons I'd have much more preferred unlocking them as getting further in
Fun Horror
good fun good scares Don't play alone the AI is mid

This is the hardest game I've played It is suffering concentrated into a multiplayer game but it's so addicting If you love a challenge have 3 mates who are willing to suffer and don't mind a little unobtrusive bug every now and then This is the game for you See you down in the mines of Garganta

You know when you have to do some sort of work in a group of people that requires attention to detail precision communication or simply put having an ability to not mess things up And then that guy shows up who tries really hard but fails when your project let's call it glass house for the sake of this review is about to get finished Well this game taught me I might be that guy Also taught me how to be humble and say things like guys I'm sorry let me back on the team in a few languages

This game has a good atmosphere but is severely lacking in any sort of meaningful gameplay No progression system leaves this game feeling empty yes there are boosters but those can be ignored/missed easily I'm all for a hard game but this is actually stupid Resource management is something I love but when I kill an enemy silently to save ammo and another the other end of the room just so happens to know wtf is going on where I am and what colour underwear I have on that's when the game decides to waste mine and my friends time ammo and sanity A run should NOT last 1 hour OR MORE The best games that are PvE know that MOST people have limited time to play games and show at the very least a little respect in that regard This game does not give a single care You reach a check point and get to the end just to have to sprint back to where you started with a hoard following hot on your heels This sounds like it could be fun except that your ammo at this point has been depleted your tool sentry for a friend and me is empty and you have to YET AGAIN stand in a damn circle to extract which counts up slower than your grandma shuffles out of bed This results in a checkpoint restart that means the last 30-60mins of gameplay has been for nothing This is only good for content for Twitch YouTube or TikTok NOT for someone with a rare evening off wanting to play a game or two with friends If you have any self-respect then please please please don't do this to yourself As a final note whoever thought that much dense volumetric fog was a good idea needs to be sacked and seek a job in a different industry
Amazing game with so many levels Its greatest weakness is requiring 4 friends such a high expectation
This is a perfect game But without a real team there is nothing to do You need at least three people to pass comfortably and don`t even think of taking a bot as the fourth it`s better to leave an empty slot Bots are a difficulty modifier You`ll also need time to coordinate the team divide the roles and understand how to act in different situations And remember i]work together or die together[/i
Solo is hard af and there's not much more to personally leveling up or unlocking or upgrading weapons if that's what you're into Besides that there's cool rare cosmetics you can get and it's fun to be forced to take it slow in a game Plus it's fun to genuinely have to work as a team and not just have one player carry Would definitely recommend still sweating in my chair

There are 3 rule 34 results for this game
This game is a masterpiece for everyone who loves really hard games I also recommend to play with 3 friends You will get your ass wrecked over and over again Until you find the right strategy I would call this a harder version of Dark Souls in the FPS genre So if you like suffering and pain this game would be a banger for you It gets frustrating sometimes espacially when i think about an 2,5h rundown and you die at the very end But if you are not raging that fast you will enjoy ever second of this game I freaking love this masterpiece But sadly here is the negative part Updates are kind of rare lately and this makes me sad AF and in my last rundown me and my friends experienced the same bug the blood on your mask turns into pink-ish pixelels that cover most of your screen i could only fix that by changing the resolution and by change into window mode confirming see if it works and back to the normal settings you are used to play with AND there is a bug with a huge black blop that randomly appears for half a minute and then dissapear slowly again Overall this game is the cherry on the hardcore difficulty PvE FPS game cake 9.9/10 without the little bugs that could be annoying but kinda easy to fix if it works it would be straigt 11/10
I do not understand how this game is not more known I will say very difficult game not easy at all That is an aspect that I enjoy but make sure to gather a group of your friends and give it a try
Well made challenging and entertaining
ONLY FOR HARDCORE PLAYER
escute eles vindo
This game is not for your casual FPS player You will be punished for every single mistake made knowingly or not You must prepare to die in ways that Dark Souls would deem too cruel for its players There is a reason that the first set of missions have a completion rate of 3.3 I plan on beating them all or getting as close as I can until my friends call it quits Should I complete it and remember to I will update my review as a genuine should you play this I recommend this game not because its for everyone but it is genuinely the most fun I have had being forcibly locked in for hours on end for single missions at a time with my friends Prepare yourself Work Together Or Die Together
hard but fun
Perfect at what it sets out for
Unique take on horde shooters really focuses on preparation which really sets the game apart
your friends are your biggest enemies
if you have less than 4 people this game will not be fun
this game makes me want to die sometimes but its pretty good otherwise
Some of the most tortuous friendship destroying gameplay ever Couldn't recommend more

This is in my opinion the best tactical coop shooter But don't get fooled by the word shooter It is mainly a stealth melee game You need to communicate with your team mates manage plan your resources gaining intel about the objects in the map via terminals and plan carefully your mission This game looks on the steam page like a Killing Floor clone but it isn't It's gameplay is closer to Ready or Not but with some alien monsters instead of criminals as enemies
The scariest red light green light you will ever play Honestly had some of the best experiences in gaming playing this Get a good group and buckle up though because this game is HARD
This really tests teamwork and friendship for sure but holy This really is a CO-OP game Looking for fourth LOL 11/10 game Can't wait for Den of Wolves
BEST GAME EVER MADE only problem is that there is not more games like it cant wait for future games 3 3
I have a love hate relationship with this game
The game is hard like people say Lets get that out of the way first Its a game that as you go deeper will punish you for mistakes and not thinking This isn't a mindless hoard shooter Its recommended to have a friend or more Not to played solo as the bots while useful lack a vital ability to carry certain times You also DON'T have to play each rundown Campaigns in order with A's being the easiest and E the hardest You can always change to a different mission and go on from there With friends its been a great experience A challenging game that tests patience and how well you handle a stressful situation while managing resoruces
If you like butt pain a lot of pain then you will love it I recommend this masterpiece
get the fuck out

Extremely exciting gameplay It keeps you on your toes but it will get you frustrated if you play strategic I recommend this to any freind group co op
This is my review at 12 hours in game about to complete rundown 1 that was hard can only get easier from here
I love the fact you die so many times but you always feel happy to finish and then you notice it is 4 am NOTE your sleep schedule will never be the same after you start playing Always remember to have fun prisoners
I will not be surprised if I get nightmares after staying up til 3AM playing this
great game wish the devs would pick it back up

Trying to find a 4th person is like trying to enroll your friend to army would recommend please be our 4th
just not good
This is a great game but the missions are very long 2 hrs and there are no save or checkpoints at any point during the mission destroy the chance of myself every wanting to get back into it
I dont know who i am i dont know why i am here all i know is OH MY GOD THERES SO MANY BIG GUYS WHAT

Fun game very atmospheric I like how it doesn't hold the player's hand and forces you to figure things out on your own even though I'd prefer they'd gone even further with the simulational aspects like the terminal functionality and level interactivity Pretty dumb name though but I guess appearances can be deceiving Gotta give GASP a try now Has to better than DAYZ right
I wish I had friends
Cannot convey just how difficult yet insanely satisfying this game is
100 super super easy and wonderful mhm mhmm yup yesirreee a super easy game 3 3 3
shushhh sleepers filipbz why did you hit something
Blood sweat and tears
Good so far 5 hours in and still haven't reached the first checkpoint pro tip PLAY WITH 4 FRIENDS
I love horror shooter and also love suffering a lot if this sounds like fun then this is the game for you
Still trying to beat R1B1 after 11 Hours Its hard but its fun
translate if u want
A bit buggy for long distance friends but its actually not bad just make sure to play with people who play the same tempo you do
Fun horror coop
I did not get out help
I don't think I had a moment of fun playing this game
Needs more players
Gas game I HATE R1//C1
Amusant avec des amis sans bonne chance mon ami Fun with friends without good luck my friend
im waiting for me friends to get this game
h3]Game is punishing but it makes the wins feel all the more rewarding.[/h3 h3 I am personally playing solo with bots and have found most A/B tier missions do-able C tier and higher I think I will have to find some teammates The in-game matchmaking is not amazing Kinda wish there was a server browser or something To find teammates I would highly recommend joining the GTFO discord and use the LFG there while you can Game is fully released and might be harder to find people h3
fun
Everyone knows this game is extremely difficult That difficulty changes the game from being all shooter to being half strategy and stealth Different missions have different enemies or goals which require different loadouts layouts and strategies If you have friends to play it with this game probably for you But if got a couple friends and some time I recommend giving the game a try You beat every mission first try but you use these attempts to learn and develop strategies to further beat the mission Good luck and have fun
Fun super scary
muy bueno
This game does indeed make you GTFO WARNING THIS GAME IS NOT FOR THE EMPLOYED
bought the game forced my friend to buy it both ran 2 pistols and hel turrets got completely destroyed by the first encounter of the easiest level 10/10
40 euro for what Indie games around 10 euro have more then twice content then this game
GTFO hatte einen fantastischen Trailer aber das Gameplay ist und das HUD so winzig klein dass man kaum etwas erkennen kann und das ewige Tappen im Dunkeln und langwierige von beinahe schon eine Probe der Geduld Dazu die unbefriedigenden Waffen und die fehlende Geschichte ein klarer denn hier stimmen Trailer und Spiel nicht im Geringsten
please step into the bio scan
CBT if it was a co-op shooter awesome game
Bring some competent friends willing to learn a new game and you will have a blast A true test of cooperation skill and knowledge You WILL HAVE to practice socialism if you want to win as a team
TOP
Fun game hard as hell must play with friends and w comms Duo's and trios are possible to an extent Lots of replayability
AGHHHHHHHHHH I mean ahhhhh
Absolutely amazing I will say that is you want to play solo goodluck on that man It is impossible to do a lot without 1 other person at the very least If you have an okay but new squad make sure you go to Rundown 7 which is the most beginner friendly as it introduces things simpler and is a bit easier than other ones if you make the mistake of going for rundown 1 and going up than it will probably quickly tire you out from the difficulty like I almost did Some advice your tool is your best friend if you have a turret then make sure you know where to place it biotracker than always give comms etcetera That and something I wish I knew before you can type in something like LIST AMMO PACK in a monitor and query the ones that pop up to find a pack of what you need EDIT there is a comment by someone named KIT in this review if you want a little more info on lesser known commands then I would recommend reading that Helped me know about Listing U E's
mmmmm very good very good getting the fuck out with the buddies and dying 2 seconds at the end very good very good 100 better with people you know
is very good me like chalenge
9/10 great game but u need a team and that can be hard to accomplish 3
I wanna gtfo when playing with my team
If you can't convince your another 3 friends to buy this bulls*it of a game with you then you can't play it cuz the bots are plain retardation shooting when you alert one sleeper leading to alerting the whole room and randoms are just trolling The game should be sold in a pack of four for not for one copy
game for masochists
As much as I want to recommend this game I can't due to difficulty I understand crushing difficulty is the point of this but in 16 hours I think the 2 groups I play with have managed to finish only 2 or 3 dives between the 2 of them The game is beautiful the setting is amazing and it's one of only a very small handful of horror titles that actually manages to put me on edge and get the blood pumping Unfortunately there is zero chance I'll ever finish or experience even a small portion of the maps in this Punishing difficulty is good to an extent but when there is no hope it removes any positive experience from playing All it takes is a single member of the party to make a single bad choice with equipment or a minor ammunition management mistake to wipe an hour-long run There is absolutely no forgiveness and no way to recover from mistakes I'm not looking for an easy mode on this but unless you are an extreme hardcore player this is likely to wear incredibly thin quite quickly
GTFO 25 3 9/10

Y DIFICIL
I played this game ONCE back in 2023 for an afternoon with some friends didnt get it and then never opened it again Recently i've gained some knowledge about this game and i want to sink my teeth into it and see how horrified i get i'll update this review later
Great stealth horror game with hard but enjoyable missions Would recommend playing with friends because AI teammates are not the best at fighting
i love this
4
games alright but half the game aint even in the game anymore fomo cosmetics you'll never get now and the difficulty isnt hard its just frustrating so i cant recommend paying full price maybe on a sale also get a mod for the boosters the ingame system for them is complete ass
It's so hard that I can't play it 10/10 playing the entire thing when I get friends
They made it frustrating for the sake of frustration It would be more fun without opening up 10 lockmelters vs 1 ammo or health
i cant play anymore so im going to be salty and leave bad review
sb
After every Lost mission Comes another 10/10 R1 done invisible fu*ks are real Its a fum game 10/10
ta bueno

Have you ever wanted to discover your deep-seated inner sense of masochism Is life just too good for you Then it is my deepest pleasure to introduce you to GTFO a game that truly lives up to its name as its greatest achievement is to exit and uninstall the game after wasting time sneaking around in the dark for no payoff Where to begin with this game it has no solo play 2-player or 3-player capabilities This game requires 4 players and will fill in the required number of bots if necessary to reach it The bots are fine nothing special Comms are absolutely required This game has absolutely no flair virtually no cosmetics for yourself or your weapons no celebrations for passing a mission and wastes a lot of time on dreary non-skippable cutscenes on death and drop The weapons are fine enough with variety but they handle poorly On top of that along with the rest of your gear they aren't fully supplied on drop To get more ammo you have to find it in some of the ugliest darkest dingiest environments where the rest of the background assets look like they were pulled off the back room of an abandoned K-Mart This game is completely unfriendly to the casual player and only appeals to armchair SWAT members and tryhards who want bragging rights Enemy movement is janky enemy weakpoints and behavior are inconsistent and unreliable and even the slightest misplay can end the mission even if that mission is the very first one available to play The game's UI is also atrocious The in-game map is poorly visible and the hacking segments play like a rigged arcade game While you normally have your computer commands on the screen that you need to enter at terminals when you actually reach those terminals those commands disappear so you need to either memorize them or have a teammate read them out to you To close this off this game isn't worth its 40 price tag and I wouldn't play it if it was offered for free Toss this game down the hole it would fit right in with the trash that appears in each mission Uninstalled Can't recommend in good conscience
Cool game never played anything like it Dont buy it if you dont have at least 2 friends to play it with Only thing that is bad is the fog Terrible mechanic
Jeu sympa qui infiltration et action bien tendue il y a vraiment beaucoup d'action ce n'est pas juste un jeu d'infiltration tu ne tires jamais est prenante sombre et bien flippante Les monstres sont bien faits avec des qui rendent chaque combat stressant Le jeu mise fond sur le travail si tout le monde fait quoi tourne vite au carnage aussi un jeu bien hardcore mais clairement ce qui fait son charme Par contre je trouve manque un vrai de progression Avoir des niveaux et des armes au lieu de tout donner le rendrait le jeu plus motivant et Et niveau gadgets un peu part le radar la mousse les mines et les tourelles pas grand-chose
99.93 of runs have never made it past the finale episode in rundown 2 to be more specific of the 850,000 groups who have attempted this game only around 500 of them have made it so far I am not one of them

Increible mas entretendio y complicado de lo que pense
All in-game mechanics are set up for maximum time wasting checkpoints but no progress saving resource management The game loop starts to get boring after 2-5 hours and the only thing that can keep you in this game is friends There are a lot of situations in the game where you can make a mistake and these mistakes are very difficult to recover from most often it is either a restart from a checkpoint or a mission restart An average game for a couple of evenings
rundown 20 3
Hardcore FPS game i love
I honestly do not understand what people like about this game It's dark as shit I can't see anything and I spend most of my time sneaking around like PTSD riddled space sam fisher I have no idea what is going to trigger a horde to come after me aside from the obvious alarm doors When I find out its usually because it happened with little to no warning and I just die The bots are absolutely idiotic and barely functional so you better have friends to play this with because this game is also basically dead with very few active players But why would anyone play this when Helldivers 2 exists It's unintuitive there are a ton of mechanics the game expects you to know but doesn't tell you about What's really confusing are the boosters Why Why have some weird consumable mechanic where you need to farm RNG bonuses to do harder levels Why not just make them normal things you unlock by playing For the life of me I have no idea why so many people seem to love this game It's basically the most intense game of red light green light you'll ever play
Great game to play solo
200-300 1000
A typical round of GTFO goes like Spawn in a hole Sneak around find mid shit stab a few blinking enemies find the red door open the red door scream at teammates die repeat 10/10
I've tried it twice and didn't like it much not my cup of tea But friends insist its good
Purchased this game at before release This is a very tough game Never managed to go through the first start to the door Had to uninstall it as it is wasting my time to look for clues and never ending enemies attacking non-stop
You are an expendable player You have noodle arms so aiming is kinda difficult Guns have a good amount of recoil so aiming is difficult enemies move about in odd ways that can be best described as what you'd see in laggy games so aiming is hard the main emphasis is to go through most of a match using your hammer stealth killing things At first it kinda seemed like an extraction horror co-op kinda game but TBH it's kinda over hyped Not my cup of tea but if you really like co-op stealth kinda game with forced alarm sections grab on sale
Relaxing game to play with friends
Harder than a souls game
Very fun with friends and not that hard when u get the hang of it Can be genuinely scary when you get in the mood
very hard game need friends otherwise its litteraly impossible
I don't remember owning this game
Good game
I hope you like darkness and sound design that gives you nightmares because OMG does GTFO have both in excess The game is best played with four other un*willing prisoners although playing with two is a whole level and a ton above four players bringing even more horror suspense and difficulty Whichever way you choose to play that works best for you the GTFO Discord will surly be of great help for finding friends to play with
3 2
It took me almost 100 hours to pass a ALT//:R2 Best game
good for people that like stealth games if you just want to shoot stuff try helldivers deep rock galactic killing floor or back for blood this game is rather boring you just get attacked by 4-5 guys at a time unless you open an alarm door
Not really enjoyable kinda a door simulator
You need 4 people for this game to be fun
If you like to be terrified and love being forced into uncomfortable adrenaline filled fuck fest this is the perfect game for you I as someone who enjoys said adrenaline recommend this game to others as the visuals and game mechanics ARE TERRIFYING AND AWESOME buy it do it scare your friends to join in
If you are looking for a team-based PVE game with a real challenge look no further Unforgiving experience in a unique environment where smart decision-making resource management good aim and teamwork combined are not only required but necessary if you hope to make it trough
El juego no miente es sumamente hardcore hasta el punto de super hacerte temblar la mano Tal como dicen otras lo mejor es tener amigos con quien jugar Cuando llegas a un punto que crees has visto todo el juego sale con algo nuevo desafiante que lo que conocido No es para todo el mundo requiere de mucha paciencia y con tu equipo tener tiempo porque una puede durar perfectamente una o dos horas Es sumamente y La del juego me encanta tal como dicen los tags es un juego de horror y como no tremendo de nivel y jugables No es un terror que te asustes o salga un jumpscare sino una de mucha continua Trabaja o muere en equipo

YA SABIR YA SABIR
Best COOP game ever created
i like this game very fun
yes
Nice game to play with friends
Nice tactical shooter make sure you have friends
get friends to play this with
tough but fair
I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father and probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 15 now My son got this game for from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories
First kill in gtfo No hitmarker no score just his lifeless body
scary hard fun
fix ur fucking bots
Tienes amigos juegalo con ellos No tienes amigo Juegalo sin ellos y usa bots Que no quieres jugar bots pues juega solo y se tryhard no te pongas mas excusas

fun but no controller support
Quite a good game
10\10
dont play it
fun with friends join the steam
Hardcore co-op which tests your patience Really good to grind with friends
HAHA YES DIE SCUM
Be warned this game has the steepest learning curve I have ever seen your team will die and it will be your fault your team will die and it will be your friends fault that being said once you get over the learning curve you feel almost invincible.until you hear the terrifying sound of a scout screaming This game will either Forge your friends into a true team or end your friendship in a blame game of whose fault was that you all died
Cuando entiendes el juego es el mas entretenido y desafiante

The best coop shooter out there The game is fair but very punishing Only downside are some bugs that will never be fixed as it seems
Runs perfect on Linux
The game could be a modern classic but suffers greatly from bad map design and trial error gameplay Everything else is really well made but these flaws really bring it down At best it's an amazing thrilling teamwork focused game and at worst it's extremely frustrating and irritating Some maps have you running around for 45 minutes only to die to a security alert horde because you rolled empty supply boxes so you don't have resources All in all I've had fun with it but it's really hard to recommend
Dead Space if it was actually good Co-op and leans heavy on stealth mechanics and team coordination and communication 10/10
my friends bought this game with me and as soon as i passed the 2 hour they started being pigs then we never played the game again
i get touched and i like it
rookie friendly chill game to play with ur friends

What is it It is a 4-player co-op shooter that sees the player go on missions with 3 other humans or bots The story has you as a prisoner sent by a shadowy corporation to investigate a facility that had some bad stuff go down Only you and you band of convicts are suitable to determine what happened down there How it plays Since it is a FPS you get to shoot things There is a decent assortment of of handguns shotguns assault rifles sniper rifles etc All sound very meaty and have a very good sci fi aesthetic You also have a bunch of melee weapons that have different pros and cons to using them Ammo health and other items are scarce so resource management is vastly important Stealth is also a component but it realistically just serves to slow down the gameplay and make a slow game slower Gameplay So you are given a bunch of missions Rundowns to complete with different objectives However most of them is go find mcguffin bring mcguffin to place job done It got very old very very fast The maps are also very very large and a standard mission can take close to an hour if not more The setting change You are always in an underground facility with lots of corridors tunnels and hallways Its easy to get confused with your direction as so much of the environment looks the same and becomes maze like very quickly You have to find doors keys All The Godamn Time So you approach a big door and find that it requires a key Well then you must go find a terminal in the area to type in a command to FIND THE KEY Once you have determined which room has said key you have to go through every item box till you find the key then go back to the door to progress The other door type is the security scanner door Which means your team must stand in a pulsating ring of light until a counter reaches 100 The light ring then moves and you have to do that over and over again until the door is open While this is happening an alarm is sounding and all the enemies are spawning to come kill you After doing this for the 10th time it becomes a huge chore The other door type is a which just has agro enemies on the other side and will attack as soon as the door opens So a mission structure is go find thing oh look a locked door got to find the key spend minutes finding key unlock door continue looking for thing Oh its another locked door rinse and repeat Is this game actually fun Well lets go over the facts Limited resources Lots of enemies that will attack very aggressively Game has very poor visibility due to horrible light sources Huge huge maps that need to be that size Your character has very limited run speed and when you are hit by an enemy you shake around for a second or 2 and cannot shoot accurately in that time So the elements seem to be very artificial and are done to make the game less enjoyable by simply making things hard to do I cannot recommend this game The gameplay is tedious the rewards for successful missions is poor and help the gameplay experience It is a game of busy work and time-wasting activities in the guise of Wait for a significant sale
very good game
At about halfway through with 400 hours I can confidently say this is my all time favorite game with unique gameplay absolutely baller character and level design and creative use of gameplay gimmicks I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys challenging co-op experiences and friends who are committed to long play sessions and challenging situations
I lobv this game
If you don't have friends then please go outside toch grass get to know someone and invite them to help you Solo this game is a bad choice and the BOT AI be the final strike that make you question all your life decisions Overall it is a great game if you feel your life is too easy and you want to add some spice into it then well just sprinkle some GTFO over the top and suffer for the rest of the day
Glowsticks here
Great game with deep lore The game-play loop is a little repetitive but satisfying and provides a different challenges Whether it's defend an objective find a certain item or clear out a level its always heart racing Weapons feel balanced although the pistol is hard to beat When matchmaking make sure you join their discord as it's easier to find groups there

Nice
funsies
Extremely hard game do not play without friends but very rewarding
vete
Game is made with care Quite a challange in some levels Def worth the try if you have group of 4 It is possible solo or with bots but it is very challenging if u decide to
I hate this game Dull grey irritating and unfair Some might say git gud and dirty casual but I do not care That is the one and only game that I really regret buying Maybe if I and my friends were bored with Deep Rock Galactic or Vermintide then I would like this game but it is not the case
Great challenging and stress-inducing
C'est dure
Please fix the bugs I have been having a lot of issues with this game recently The problems range from server issues to not being able to see my teammates The game just froze at a crucial part of a rundown we were so close to finishing These issues happen in every single game that i play I really had fun with the game when it used to work This situation is just so disappointing
This game is like among us you either have fun cooperating or you lose friends because you can't function as a team Jokes aside great game
The game is called Get The Fuck Out but I keep getting into it
Amazing game 9/10 Brilliant atmosphere weapons style and enemy design It's hard gritty and brutal in the best way Can play solo but would recommend buddies Grab a mate or two and dive in

GOOD
pokey with the sticky
One of the best game's I've ever played I've been cripply addict to this game for the past week staying up until late hours of the night I cant recommend this game anymore and it has a super cool community that helped me learn the game
When I got this game back in 2021 it was pretty solid these days I lost contact and play throughs with friends Came back to it tried it out decided meh tired of games like this The devs tried the perf is still a the gameplay never adapted still simplistic to a point of arbitrary difficulty Hopefully the devs have moved on and learned that their future project den of wolves is actually something to invest in I won't be buying in but best of luck my dudes from one bankrupt person to another
GTFO
GTFO is a perfect litmus test for if your buddies can stay cool under pressure
yeah
its like a perfect mix between horror and dungeon crawler-esque games
Honestly the trailer is more fun than the game itself Challenge to what not passing out at my keyboard the game might as well take out the walking mechanic considering 90 of your playthrough is going to be crouched limited ammunition is one thing but scarce would be the correct word overall the game is beautiful stunning in some ways but exciting no fun maybe if you enjoy a very slow paced fps thats punishing if you or a bot sound off a mag wrong i know i only have 16 hrs in and that isnt much at all to judge a game but i for someone who enjoys horror the only horror i found in this at all was the random enemy placement when opening a door and ole big man himself is praying that you have that flashlight on maybe for some the game is fun but for a guy with a hard case of adhd and enjoys to run and shoot or bob and weave to get out.this is far from keeping my marble brain on task also the enemies projectiles are heat seeking so you cant even duck or hide from them considering theyll just home in on your cheeks
a
0/10 1
i didnt even know what the fuck was going on throughout the entirety of my playing and when i realized this game was not for me i already passed 2 hours so i couldnt refund
boring
It's a great game if you have 3 friends who are willing to spend hours learning it and failing missions The atmosphere and lore is great It's a good blend of sci-fi biology and space horror The enemy design is super cool and genuinely unsettling in a subtle way While using similar prefabs each mission feels unique The artificial difficulty is the main drawback They give you purposefully bad guns and flashlights Enemies are bullet sponges Alarm wave doors that just get waves tacked onto them rather than new mechanics Repetitive objectives that just tack on continual alarms and infection zones that just make things tedious Dark rooms that slow your progress to a halt You will fail tons of missions and waste hours before it works If you can put up with that there's a lot to get out of it
Need Team mates I like to finish this game XD
This is a tactical stealth game more than it is an fps Its got a good atmosphere and interesting for sure But dont expect a run and gun type game
do you have any ammo simulator
A great co op game for a niche player-base that has some questionable decisions This is a game that you will not be able to play ever level as it can get very very difficult upwards of an hour or two per level that you start at the beginning for if you have a slight mistake Some of the odd decisions are The story in the game is mainly held within Rundowns Alt://6 7 and 8 Rundown Alt://6 is viewed as a good starting points for new players vice starting with Alt://1 and working through each one in order Rundown Alt://5 has an enemy in it that ruins the narrative buildup to the enemy in Rundown 7 The original Rundowns 1-6 are no longer in the game and are replaced with Alt rundowns which changes elements of the story that feeds into Rundown 7 You have to look up aspects of the story to understand what happens in Rundown 7 The Booster System is unique but not implemented well Checkpoints are in some levels but not all All in all though it is an amazing game that offers a pretty big challenge The modding scene has extra modes rundowns and alterations to the game that can be pretty fun also Hopefully they devs take the lessons learned from this game and apply it to Den of Wolves as if they do DoW could be one of the best co op games
Incredible game still holds up today

A great co-op game for a dedicated group of friends Is a hardcore shooter though so would be worth watching a runthrough to see if it is a good fit for you before you buy
Shhh wake them up

I hate thois stupid fucking game so much It makes me want to put a 9mm in my head 10/10 would recomend it to anybody who is not impationte
very good game
GTFO que nem crack na primeira vez vai usar e talvez vai gostar mas quando tu parar para perceber vai ser tarde demais Porque sua primeira durou 2h e pode mais reembolsar League of Legends ou DOTA 2 ou qualquer outro jogo competitivo essa merda aqui sim vai testar a sua amizade se tuas amizades durar 1 rundown inteiro podem marcar um casamento a 4 e serem felizes O jogo bom que se tu perder uma de 1h tu vai explodir a sua mesa de raiva mas ainda vai ficar com vontade de fazer a de novo o relacionamento abusivo se um dos lados gostar compre esse jogo se aguenta perder porque vai poder reembolsar e para um caralho uma pode durar 20 min e tu pensar que ta muito chegar na outra e ficar preso nela por semanas Mas tem melhor que completar a porra daquela complicada e tensa nem sexo consegue chegar perto da que sente o orgasmo mental 4D Sinceramente eu dou 10/10 melhor jogo Co-op criado Entretanto vai precisar de mais 3 retardado que tenha o mesmo problema mental que e aprender que toda vez muitas vezes mesmo que vai vencer
Requres friends if you don't have a group of 4 then don't get it It's like a more serious version of Lethal company I supose Having fun with it at the moment I would recommend buying it at sale price Runs great on older hardware
4 8 saat sadece 1 DDDDDD
Claustrophobic over-whelming demanding Work together or die together Imagine a difficult or annoying mechanic for a game you like Better yet think of two Now I've got this buddy with an affinity for coming up with terrible game-play ideas that usually involve making the difficult mechanic or feature even harder or just combining two at once This is the developers creative process for this game And I can't get enough of it This is the kind of challenge I've been looking for a while That said I CANNOT recommend this game if you Dislike changing or abandoning preconceptions or preferences This isn't really a game that cares about your pet loadout or favourite reliable strategy Are unable or unwilling to invest a good amount of time or effort Some games are really good to snag on sale play a few times and maybe go back on nostalgia later Save your money for one of those Are like me and keep scaring friends away by yelling at them This isn't a game for three friends and a bot or for two friends and two randoms Be better than me be likeable and have friends
pra jogar isso se tiver o time 100 fechado com amigos random estressante e os bots burros Fora isso o jogo maneiro

played for 3 hours straight with my friend got demolished for the whole 3 hours still havent beaten r1 10/10 would recomend
This game is pretty good but you need friends to even have a chance of beating the first stage me and my friend spent 3 hours to just do 2 fucking checkpoint and we didn't even get to the second one cause we ate shit 10/10 recommend FRIENDS
Best coop hardcore game
cool game but i would personally stuff a turkey up my rectum than play this
I want to rip my fucking hair off and shove broken glass in my mouth until i slowly choke to death 0/10 would rather stick my balls in an air fryer

Left 4 Dead 2 and Deep Rock Galactic's bastard child who wants nothing but to see you suffer 10/10
We suck at this game 10/10
Matchmaking sucks It finds you other 2 or 3 players and then you just wait forever for the last player to join I wanted some classic L4D experience but it's really hard to find somebody to play with It's not a game you can casually play after work you need to prepare for it like a camping trip with your friends and hope everyone shows up Maybe I'm just too old for it so spending a night waiting for a team doesn't sound fun to me
This game is really good The steam store page honestly does it pretty well in terms of description It's a stealth/wave-based mixture and it's really fun and difficult Don't get it unless you have 3 friends or are willing to play with 1-3 randoms through their discord server most of the game is just unplayably hard with any less than 4 verbally coordinated players

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME but you definitely need 4 people playing makes it even better
holy fuck
gtfo
GTFO has a lot of fun stored away by an equal amount of danger Within the time I have played this so far GTFO brings about that tension games like Left 4 Dead and others that rather'd be straight run and guns It takes a bit of tactical awareness to bring about victory in a setting that would otherwise ruin rookies a second Mixing in a difficulty and squad tactics familiar in games like Ready or Not with the horrors of games like Dead Space and Prey Those who stick around after the initial few dives into a scrap fest like Lethal Company may find themselves enjoying In conclusion the game is hard mainly because it challenges your tactical and stealth capabilities but is fun when you reach the finish line after hours of horrifying encounters
name makes sense
20h de game e 3 pra porr e precisa de muita e sinergia Um dia eu zero essa bomba

Excellent stealth-coop-shooter but you HAVE to play with friends Expect to die many times on the same map but it is part of developing a strategy
I should've got the fuck out 10/10
don't buy this game if you like winning played on a free-weekend with friends we didnt finished anything in fu**ing 7 hours
broken piece of shit

GREAT GAME I LOVE THE WEAPON DESIGNS
games pretty lit
R2D2 has consumed 2 years of my fucking life I am not joking Fuck that level Edit Nvm we beat it
love it
It is a game that is fun to most but I gotta be honest not really my type It is alot of repetitive stealth sneak up wait for heartbeat sneak closer wait for heartbeat then hit them for the first hour it was alright but after 3 more it kinda ehh I rather due something like outlast trials where you sneak past throw bottles to distract throw bottles at them to stun them or run away this games it is just sneak hit hoard sneak hit hoard IT also does not help that there is not much difference between enemy types besides one sends tentacles out and one is beefy the one that crawls and standing are basically the same thing BUT the crawling one shoots farther while the one standing melee attacks you from a distance so just shoots you
super good
Brutally hard Very fun though And the community over in the discord are really nice and can be helpful Defintely not for casual gamers 9/10
Super scary thrilling action packed at the same time Incredibly challenging and I am willing to put in the hours to 100 this game

Game isn't fun to play no sense of accomplishment no real rewards for beating levels Most importantly game is completely lacking any sort of permanent progression aside from difficulty Definitely not my game don't think this game is made for 99 of gamers
Way too hard and no difficulty adjustments Great idea wrecked by garbage accessibility
At first it was a pretty decent game but the more I advanced into it the more it became better and better At the moment I haven't done even half of the game and I think it's a really fuckin great game to play with friends if you have some lol and would absolutly recommend it if you're interrested in it
good
Very good game for challange with friends against a.l and your instict
runs poorly on high end pc give your pc heart attack no thx

goated game for people who like feeling pain
As someone who loves a difficult game doesn't mind dying hundreds of times perfecting a strategy and has a group of friends to play with who like the same type of game This game is actually garbage I love the concept but too many features push it from challenging to frustrating To add a little context for those who haven't played yet the game is all about resource management The general game loop is sneak/stealth kill enemies slowwwly working your way to rooms where you bunker down to defend while doing some objective or other Even the slightest screw up means wasting ammo or health which will result in a slow painful death to attrition over the multi-hour long stages The checkpoints are a good hour apart and don't truly save so if you have to stop playing you lose hours of progress The final straw where me and my friends put it down was after an hour of brutal slog we got to the stage finale for the first time This involved running through an entirely new section of the facility with a swarm behind us sleepers in front and a timer A completely new scenario to the rest of the level thus far Of course we died we started contemplating a strategy to deal with it but then realized the last checkpoint was over an hour back We knew it would probably take us at least a few attempts to figure out a strat which is bad enough but on top of that eventually we'd run out of game time Which means the next night we played we'd have to start from the beginning get 1 or 2 attempts at the finale rinse and repeat Never touched the game again
im scared

fear
It's so good though I have to warn anyone thinking about getting this game If you are serious about buying it then get at least two friends to buy it too because this game is made to test friendships and alone it isn't a real experience I believe reviews that attack this game for being too hard are unreasonable you are not meant to play it alone and neither finish a mission first try and you usually have to try 2-5 times until you develop the perfect strategy which then takes some time trying to execute it flawlessly Due to this the game is clearly not for everybody but for it's intended audience it's a really great experience
The game seem no support for ultrawide monitor

Not recommended simply because of the EXTREMELY LOUD noise when you start the game

this game awoke something in me
Always encountering bug from the multiplayer lobby Everytime I join the game some players weren't visible on my screen it's like they're not on the lobby but they are in the lobby But when we tried to start the game it feels like the player is completely nonexistent The rest the game is good
Um jogo e complexo de jogar sozinho mas tem uma excelente comunidade que auxilia em tudo absolutamente tudo que precisa Ensinam qual o fundamento modo de se jogar o que fazer e quando fazer para progredir no jogo Recomendo que jogadores PT-BR entrem na comunidade GTFO Brasil mais pessoas para auxiliar e jogar junto deixando a com o game 200 melhor
Convinced by friends to buy game on sale Knew bare minimum going in Spent half an hour dying in the first 2 rooms before making progress Assured game was fun but personally it's unapproachable I'm GTFO before the refund timer is up

AHUENNA RVUT O4KO
This is straight up one of the most boring games I've ever played Hope you like getting killed with no ammo and wandering around dark rooms backtracking for 45 minutes before you die
great game price is hefty so I never was into it but got it from a friend while it was on sale This is amazing with friends and has been make me die for more Although it's not that scary it is suspenseful and makes you pray that nothing wakes up If you're looking for something to play with friends this is definitely something I'd pick up especially now or whenever else it's on sale
ouais
Joguinho vale a pena numa pegada terror mesmo mas bem treta tem que junta uma galera pra jogar de boa ele mais curti o game
bad without friends
Jogo mt bom pra relaxar
Not scary at all Game play isn't fun Difficulty is created by artificially maximizing spread on weapons while moving which can be overcome through bhopping Stealth game play is awkward Objective DNA is underwhelming Played one round with friends and don't have any desire to play more Setting also doesn't make lore sense Why send people in without IR or thermal scopes and silencers but flashlights when enemies react to sound and flashlights Make it a non-futuristic setting and it might be believable Honestly game would be better if they fixed stealth removed guns and implemented better melee game play

scary game game be like agh scary games scary

good
o jogo tem uma mecanica interessante construida pra fazer medo no jogador Tudo demorado nesse jogo e definitivamente nao foi feito pra jogadores que curte rushar pra matar pois a quantidade de loot extremamente escasso e nao dao respawn entao se vc gastar todas balas tendo pegado todos os kit ammo do mapa vc se lasca de verde e amarelo O cmd que vc tem acesso no mapa em game muito curioso pois bastante semelhante ao cmd do windows isso eu achei muito legal Boa quantidade de armas e cada uma tem uma diferente podendo facilmente abrir um leque de possibilidades de builds O que peca nesse game a falta de mais tipos de monstros segredos que podem ser acessados ativando algo escondido de certo modo uma historia um pouco mais desenvolvida explicando a trajetoria de uma pessoa que esta em hidrostastase desculpa se errei a palavra ou oque levou a aquele lugar estar daquele jeito Tirando essa parte negativa eu recomendo a compra desse jogo ate 40 reais nao acho que vale o original pelo oque o jogo entrega

An authentic thinking experience requiring use of mind and dexterity Graphics are good and there's NO lag regarding controller function Seriously raises the bar
there is so much potential here but with the slow stream of updates and the fact this isnt a live service game it likly will not improve if the player base was bigger the purchase would be worth it i think as it stands it is not

super under rated game but have to play with friends
I thought this game was pretty boring until I was hit with the scariest shit i've ever experienced in my entire life 0 warning that they were gonna change the mechanics like that Heart dropped almost just died from a stroke from such a messed up experience
Definitely a super fun game to play and figure out with friends 10/10 would recommend
This game is fun if you're a masochist
Fun so far Hard
opened a door right behind it was a touchy feely rat bastard the touchy-feely rat bastard called a horde This truly is the stockholm experience
you can play solo but its difficult you need to play with friends for the full experience

It was fun to play especially with friends my only concern is the game is too dark but everything is great and fun

Game is hard community is cool Scouts are friends and new players are very welcome
Hardcore coop great aesthetic and graphics Drop in and out Big emphasis on teamwork Stealth elements All big appeals for me and GTFO has been on my wishlist for a while because of these things Having now played it though the hype isn't all that None of the guns feel useful or any good They all seem to have some sort of problem with them such as crappy sights small magazines really inaccurate really slow or something else I get that this is probably an intentional design choice and there are perhaps one or two weapons that feel alright but given the number of weapons available to select I didn't find a single one I thought finally a decent weapon so I guess they're all consistently bad Enemies are frustratingly glippy you often can't dodge projectiles even though it looks like you should be able to and you nearly always need physical cover to block things coming at you Enemies that crawl seem to clip through corners and walls and end up under your feet or behind you Feedback on taking damage is practically none existent so this means you'll only notice this when you're very low on health or you've been downed Sneaking poking enemy heads grouping up to all take down a bigger enemy silently are probably my main highlights of the game The requirement of sneaking about to preserve health and ammo is the main good thing about GTFO so what isn't good is when this option is taken away from you such as levels where you can't sneak because fog near the floor is toxic so you can't crawl in it Great Sneaking your only ace up your sleeve your one trick sleepers hate can't use it The problem here is that what makes GTFO shine is the stealth and teamwork and removing that option for the players only highlights what GTFO doesn't do well because the guns are crappy and the enemies are glippy GTFO is game that hasn't been scaled well in terms of it's difficulty I get that it's a hardcore experience and sneaking relying on teamwork completing objectives locating items preparing for hordes of enemies etc are GTFO's appeal but to make the game more difficult in my opinion poor design decisions have been made to try and force the difficulty up A great example of this are when you open doors and have to go and stand in a random arbitrary place in the area to get scanned Totally understand the decision to force players from huddling up together in a corner great idea in fact but do it in a smarter way Make it so you have to go to certain terminals and click a button or something so you can at least prepare to some degree Running into random spots in an open warehouse to get scanned while enemies openly shoot at you makes zero sense and just feels dumb So this is a not a recommendation from me GTFO is an OK experience with friends and does have some enjoyable redeeming features but it's not a solid experience that I want to keep coming back to
best co-op shooter
7.5/10
Okay I've given this enough chances and I'll probably play more since some of my friends enjoy the game but I'm not recommending it What a damn shame you make a game with a good engine amazing atmosphere great premise rock hard objectives then you mess up the bit which could have provided some of the most fun The combat You've these wonderfully malformed enemies in the game even invisible ones are cool but the combat fighting them is a exercise in frustration and it's for a multitude of reasons The weapons feel crap they feel under powered and useless The limitations on ammo are just a little too harsh not even STARTING with full ammo is just a gash design decision Headshots on enemies will remove the head and characters even state go for headshots but then the enemy can operate without a head forever like it's not a few hits before it dies it's literally not dead Those bloody things that shoot weird fast homing bullets have some of the most inconsistent hit registration on their missiles that I've ever seen sometimes hitting you behind cover The game will sometimes just toss crap at you after 40 minutes of doing a mission as if it wants to see you suffer Now if all of the above is intention game design well done you've designed a game that isn't fun for me sorry I'm out you've missed the mark you had all the right ingredients but it's come out wrong Almost there If this game was still just as hard but had good enjoyable combat it would be an utter gem As it stands a very key core element for me is so frustrating that I don't wish to play it A great looking game full of unique ideas ruined by poor design all in the name of appearing hardcore
Fun
Game is too difficult,the a.i bots don't do anything to help hardly any health/ammo,checkpoint system is trash,and nobody plays online terrible game
evil bob
fire
Game hard but game good
Ever been cucked by watching your own teammates struggle to revive you as they get fisted by tentacles 360 degrees around them Its like that
This game is very fun with only one HUGE issue for me Levels can take an hour ish to finish and that's if you do it correctly with no resets me and my crew are not great at the game so a level can take 2-3 sometimes on the much harder missions The problem is once you and your friends are done for the day if you didn't finish the mission then you will have to start from the very beginning on the very very long levels you will sometimes come across checkpoints which are very nice however these are only used after you die once you close the mission you will then have to start from the very beginning again This makes it very difficult to convince a full party to want to replay an hours worth of work that they already did the night prior There is one simple fix to this there should be more checkpoints if you care about it changing the difficulty then just make it on an easier mode or make it a toggle able option Next make these checkpoints persist THROUGH play sessions so that you don't have to fully restart if someone had to get off early or if people where just done with the game for that day I think it's also worth noting that the modding community from what i have seen seems very against any idea of making the game any easier or more convenient in any way so I don't really expect a mod adding this checkpoint feature
NICE GAME just sucks finding randos to help with the mission and not sabotage
hot
Would recommend GTFO if you love to live in a constant heart attack You gotta be a vewy sneaky snek to get past most of the enemies if you don't want to fight a horde of them and use the very little ammunition you have to your name Warning You are gonna get brutally molested in this game again and again but that's just a part of the fun The monsters do be thick doe Dark Exciting Thrilling Sensual Sexual Experience with a friend group of 4 10/10 Would get brutally anal probed by a monster again while blaming my friends

100000/10
it's not that great sadly cool idea though
IT IS VERY SCARY
The game is designed to be gruelling and unpleasant which is okay if your want a challenge but you cant just have fun on the easy difficulty and then challenge yourself on the harder difficulties I liked the puzzle solving and using terminals to track down objectives But its too hard and punishing to play solo and it takes a long time to match-make then when you do find people to play with they quit the match when they cant figure out what to do
This game felt overly tedious and everything was too dark And i don't mean the art style I mean that i couldn't see it was pitch black Then as if that wasn't enough they started adding colored fog that you can only see 2 feet in There's a bio-scanner thermal scanners on weapons that kinda get around the vision problem and the enemies have sound cues but none of that is taught very well I found the whole experience frustrating in the not fun way It feels like the kinda game that you need to look stuff up in to get enough knowledge to not just have your time wasted on dumb shit I was playing with 2 buddies and we were figuring the game out blind We got 45 minutes into a level wiped and had to start the whole thing over Then we had an hour to play before a buddy had to go we wondered around in the level for the hour realized we had a bunch more of the level to do We looked it up and found out we would have to replay the entire level 4/10 i could see how this could feel like a rewarding game if i powered through all the bullshit but i don't want to i don't want to play in pitch darkness even if i find workarounds that make it manageable I don't want to have to look stuff up from outside sources to make the game feel anything more than horribly frustrating and a big time waster
This game is awesome spent almost 5 hours with a mate stuck on the first level and couldnt be having more fun
Ahem sniff Smacks lips Takes a long sip of tea aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ask your friend to play together This game mean to be strengthen you guys friendship
Very cool very fun and very dead
I'm starting to think b GTFO b stands for b Get The Friend Online b and I haven't been able to do that Great game though
my first hour first 10 minutes fix settings and complete tutorial next 51 minutes attempt matchmaking in 6 different lobbies press the button like 15 times restart game 4 times it never worked literally default settings what is the point of playing a game that basically requires co-op if matchmaking is unironically useless this game isnt really fun enough to play solo either the bots are fine and have a ton of voice lines which is great but they're bots and i dont want to play with bots
good game for figuring out which of your friends are fully or slightly retarded

Suspense
Only buy when you have friends to play with random strangers is just worse than 50/50 you either got people whos easy to trigger easy to freak out no management or outright trolling and wasting your time And even if you have friends consider this as well this is not what i imagine a horror shooter would be you will be slowly going thru level did i say slowly yeah and on top of that is the management so until you are fighting waves of enemies cuz you are opening a big door or something you will just play a reallllllyyyyy boring stealth game And the last negative point imo is the monster is just lets say alright in look below average when they attaking you as you have the normal crawling mofo that shoot fireflies the 2legs walking that shoot fireflies the no arms walkers that shooter fireflies with its tongue.thats it i cant say i feels satisfyign shooting these thing nor feels any horror when they start attacking me In conclusion the game is average 7/10 worse if you are solo or no friends better with friends cuz you can quickly go thru stages without falling as sleep in the middle of the game NOT RECOMMENDED FOR SOLO RECOMMENDED FOR GROUP so i will give it a thumb up but personally i dropped it a long time ago
10/10 also pretty sure i saw ur mom in this one
I be sad when nobody wants to play GTFO with me
tutorial is absolute dog shit literally doesnt tell you the controls
Such a fun game Great mix of stealth strategy and overwhelming hordes of enemies

A good coop and style horror game The atmosphere is brilliant oppressive and dystopian and the combat is violent and responsive The game feels rewarding as objectives can be difficult and it feels good to avoid combat via stealth saving ammunition and health with swift melee attacks on unaware enemies I highly recommend this if you have even one friend to play it with Even 2 friends with 2 bots is a good experience
top game
Played it VERY early on and finally remembered this game exists overall it is still a lot of fun
one of the best games to play with friends D

fart noise ahhhagah what was that
GTFO emphasizes the importance of teamwork where communication and strategy are paramount to overcoming the horrors that await Every decision matters whether it's deciding to conserve ammunition or planning a tactical approach to confront the terrifying creatures lurking in the dark The atmosphere in GTFO is exceptionally immersive drawing players into a chilling world filled with tight corridors eerie sounds and unsettling visuals The art direction combined with haunting audio design creates an environment that keeps players on edge where even the smallest noises can instill a sense of dread This palpable tension enhances the horror experience making every encounter feel intense and rewarding The unpredictability of the creatures and the procedural generation of levels add layers of challenge ensuring that no two playthroughs are the same Ultimately GTFO stands out as a compelling game that balances cooperative gameplay with an oppressive horror atmosphere The satisfaction derived from working together to overcome challenges paired with the thrill of exploration and discovery makes each session exhilarating
Hardcore cooperative horror shooter is the best description of this game It's extremely fun if you're up to the challenge and have friends to play with but very punishing if you don't Playing with randoms is basically not an option since communication is so key in this game that even one incompetent person on your team can completely ruin a mission There is no proper singleplayer mode either though you can play alone you won't get far that way so definitely make sure that you have at least 1-2 other people you can bring along or join the Discord server if you don't

bon jeu on peut faire alt F4 quand on voit le brouillard
My wife promised to give me a top PC if I get at least 1 like I believe in you guys
Really fun concept with great levels but im too scared to play
Gta7
3 hours i have yet to beat a level
So its a clunky stealth game with really great shooting mechanics that you almost never get to experience because you spend 95 of the time sneaking and using a Left4Dead style melee system
Insanely hardcore
Get ready to play it with your 3 best gamer friends If your a solo well you might as well get on the streets in the middle of the night and bend over to some strangers behind your local grocery store The game is very nice but also insanely hardcore completely dark like totally black I mean as black as the devils soul Period foggy like a swamp in northern finland at the end of autumn and time consuming like 5 children with heavy disorders Besides you get all the weapons in the game from the start But 99 of the time you have to choose the right one for the level to stand a chance or else you get a 2 Shot Pump Gun with 16 shots in total while having to fight 8 waves of Rocket Heads Slingshot Faces and P**sy Catapults while hacking a reactor Good Luck You can meele all enemies and try a silent run until the enemy tanks a full blow to the head an alerts the whole level Almost forgot when you die in a level you get less reward the next time you try which is next to nothing from the beginning For more infos contact your local free psychiatric help hotline or google the least rewarding hardcore horror claustrophobic shooter Cheers

The game is cool and all however if you don't have friends to play with then there's no point in getting it It is beyond hard to an unfair point and unless you mod the heck out of the game you will find not only are the missions impossible to do your own ai bots will generally end up shooting you
lET'S GET THE FUCK OFF
The runs get kinda long but it's quite fun I need friends to play this
ok game

Jeu d'horreur et de science fiction qui vaut le Ambiance visuelle comme sonore juste parfaite Attention certaines choses peuvent ne pas plaire Une vaste partie des niveaux ne peuvent pas se faire en solo avec juste des bots il faudra trouver quelques joueurs Mais sur Discord la de ce jeu est active La est souvent par des jeux d'ombre et de et surtout par un brouillard qui va la lueur de votre lampe C'est un jeu avec des moments calmes des moments tendus des moments ou on se perd des moments ou on se rend compte qu'on perd trop de temps C'est un jeu qui peut fatiguer car il demande une certaine concentration Le jeu est difficile vous n'aurez pas l'impression la une qui rush car ce n'est pas une viable dans ce jeu C'est un jeu ou on ne tire pas tord et travers car le manque de munition rend les missions encore plus complexes La est valable pour toutes les ressources
Really fun but idk if I'd recommend playing this if you don't have a full group of friends
No ppl to play in the lobby and it is impossible to pass security scans with bots
h1 THE GREATEST HORROR GAME EVER h1 Yeah I mean it GTFO is the best horror game and quite possible the most immersive game that currently exists imo Despite that this game is extremely inaccessible to the general audience and I wouldn't recommend it to someone unless they are a masochistic hardcore player that enjoys brutal but rewarding challenges and have other like-minded psychos that are willing to go in with you If that's the case then how could it possibly be the best horror game Let me tell you u GAMEPLAY 10/10 u This WILL be the hardest game you ever complete if you manage to commit pretty far and that's what makes this game so scary These are VERY LONG endurance missions upwards of 1-4 hours and you can fail them from just a few simple mistakes and that's coming from someone that enjoys going for hard achievements or playing rage games You will be scared to lose all of your progress and redo the mission and I believe that's where a majority of the fear comes from aside from the general atmosphere of it all You are FORCED to make hard decisions at all times and while you can technically go guns blazing it will not work for long Because of those aspects there is a level of immersion like no other because you MUST lock-in at all times as if your actual life is on the line This is a game where you WILL make mistakes mostly in the harder levels but you must minimize them as much as possible because if it keeps occurring those mistakes will eventually catch up to you If you do not like the sound of what I am saying so far then you may want to reconsider getting the game Secondly you WILL need at least one other competent person to play with As of right now I managed to complete MOST of the game with just my sister so it is at least seems possible to finish with a duo as long as you have bots The game oozes atmosphere and style with its stressful tension and adrenaline-pumping combat Guns and firefights feel amazing and high-octane stealth is tense and exploring feels real GTFO will not hold back There is no leveling system there is no purchasing weapons or tools you simply have everything right at the start All you can unlock to help yourself are boosters you build up across missions and those are limited supply and have limited uses There is nothing to earn really aside from a few cosmetics This is all for the experience of the game not for a grind It's a long game too so if you really enjoy the game like I did then you are in for a treat as the game will constantly introduce new obstacles throughout the entire 100 hour experience u WRITING 6/10 u The lore in this game is genuinely very interesting and fun to look into although I believe that learning about the main characters Woods Dauda Hackett Bishop and the Complex itself are the most interesting aspect of the writing I didn't care much for the other characters and the workers There isn't much to say on it beyond that though but for what is interesting it is REALLY interesting u VISUALS 9.5/10 u Claustrophobic dark and oppressive The Complex does not feel welcoming and it is very cold The visuals of GTFO go beyond simply being eye-candy as the effects can really change the way you play the level of the game Some levels could be pitch-black some could be foggy etc They aren't just visual flare they could completely change how you approach things I'm genuinely impressed by how good-looking the game is despite being a Unity game It shows how important a strong visual style can go It has mushy textures here-and-there but they are almost never noticeable because they are overshadowed by the fantastic varied setpieces lighting and effects u AUDIO 10/10 u The sound of the guns monsters voice-acting of the characters and overall environmental sounds are truly above and beyond which isn't surprising because the man behind this game is none other than Simon Viklund the guy behind the amazing PAYDAY 1 2 soundtrack Speaking of soundtrack despite being mostly ambient music they are gorgeous genuinely creepy and truly alien It really strengthens everything about the game and it adds a certain weight that I can't really describe u OVERALL 11/10 u This is THE definitive tactical horror-shooter masterpiece It's a truly horrifying game with a perfect gameplay loop filled with surprises at every corner throughout the entire experience from what I've seen if you dare venture further and should be a staple game in its genre While it's not for everyone what is there is very special It's the most immersive game I've ever played thanks to every element playing to its strengths and the fact that the game caters to a hardcore audience gave GTFO a strong vision that those who will enjoy this game will have a total blast and it'll likely land in their top-games lists P.S The game should've been called Rundown or anything else and not GTFO in my opinion

This throws your right into immense action
Great gameplay Amazing ambiance Huge amount of content A gem of a game for hardcore players
Imagine playing a game of red light green light against 5 simultaneous enemies where anyone in your 4 player team isn't the playing perfectly you set off a horde of spastic enemies and just lose Call it hard or punishing but stretch this out to missions for 3 hours you just have a frustrating game that asks you an unfair challenge where 0.1 percent of the player base can even get through the 3rd level Doesn't help that this game also makes you do an ungodly amount of backtracking the longer and later missions so you're constantly ping ponging between stressful rooms of 10 enemies and being completely bored out of your mind finding out where to go As much as I love challenging games this game takes it to far to the point of stupidity
Fun and difficult Definitely an acquired taste though Best played with friends that communicate well The game is also very dark with no way of changing brightness making stealthily clearing rooms as a beginner incredibly slow There are checkpoints to reset to if you fail a mission but you can't quit and pick it up from that point later So this game is more for long sessions where you have at least an hour of free time But it does support modding via Thunderstore and Nexus where you'll find community maps QoL changes tweaks to make the game feel more or less punishing and ways to increase the brightness
this is the most ass-clenching experience of my life i heard a monsters heart beat shit myself then was ripped to shreds with my friends by eldritch beasts.10/10 THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY SO COOL PLEASE PLAY and I RECCOMEND TO HAVE FREINDS OR ITS ANNOYING
GTFO
THE BOTS KEEP TAKING MY SHIT
I'm not sure people play this game so I am not sure how it has so many positive reviews Only 21 of owners as of this review have gotten the Bare Minimum achievement which is completely a single mission
game is great and all untill one of your team mates forgets he has his flashlight on and blindly walks into a room that has not been cleard yet gets the entire team killed 10/10 would do again
Difficult but fun 3
i love this game i wish my friends did too
The game is very difficult but its so cool once you get into it its so much fun
Acquiring the means necessary to evacuate the immediate premises with the utmost haste
Juego de m te genera con la en la parte final de las misiones Hablando en serio juego recomendable jugar con amigos los bots aveces te hacen pasar un mal momento juego que lo odias pero pasar una pantalla es muy gratificante Recomendable
This game is super hard but it's really rewarding to learn the mechanics and get better at the game I've really enjoyed it so far
i need to find a group to play this with lol
Lethal Company with EXTRA STRESS Get in stealthily claim objectives and GTFO Better with friends but if you like solo play there are AI bots you can play with Careful though as this game was designed for a squad of 4
I Got The Fuck Out
Jerry Smith pro player says I just kept crawling and it kept working 10/10 would recommend
Never had my back side more clenched than when playing this game Not fun solo bots in the game are pretty worthless Great for squad play Cool story Worth 25 at the most
play with friends or use a discord to get some help the bots are pretty bad
HELP HELP HELP THEY ARE COMING

Very hard game which reward team play Perfect for a nigh with real life friends but everyone need to be pro hahaha PS running thru CrossOver on macOS it runs great

The gameplay is phenomenal but GTFO is hard to recommend Here's why GTFO's core gameplay is tense full of thrill and adrenaline The game largely focuses on stealth going from room to room picking off enemies one at a time with your melee weapon of choice on your way to complete an objective task One room full of angry monsters can be enough to end your mission so you have to do your best not to wake them Even the littlest of the sleepers hit hard GTFO is one of the most difficult and punishing games I've ever played because one bad mistake like waking up a room of enemies or not preparing the room for a door with an alarm can mean you have to redo the hour-long mission Overcoming a steep challenge with your team while the odds are stacked against you is what makes this game rewarding and fulfilling to play This game has 83 levels which are all unique and have different gameplay elenents layouts and objectives A number of levels also have secondary and even tertiary objectives too effectively turning one level into two or three separate experiences There's a lot of content here The bittersweet element is team play and that's why it's hard to recommend GTFO for purchase The game's catch-phrase is Work Together or Die Together and they really weren't kidding Team play is paramount to the success of your operation Without even one team member the game goes from manageable but difficult to insanely difficult even on the easiest tiers of missions Solo play is nearly impossible The game does give you bots but they're not all that great You should really consider if this game is worth your money if you don't have a set of friends to play it with The built-in matchmaking is not good It makes a random player the host so you can't choose which level you'd like to play 3/4 times which sucks because you unlock levels in chronological order within the set of levels AKA the rundown It's hard to find lobbies unless playing at peak times and not all that many randoms communicate with you If not playing a set of friends your best bet is to use the GTFO Discord server for a LFG but even then it's sort of the same story not enough people playing Considering the game got its final content update about a year ago I wouldn't hold my breath about the player count having any significant increase TLDR Gameplay good Game hard Much content Need friends to play Work Together or Die Together

oooh yeaaaa
The most intense infiltration/extraction shooter money can buy This game requires a high amount of teamwork and communication to not alert the Sleepers who are extremely deadly for a solo found lacking and separated from the group The monster designs each present a new challenge for your team to get around or through There is a lore to the game and is explored through the game and reading Due to the difficulty of the game it is quite long as single dives can last up to 2-3 hours and death means a restart Great game on a sale It is playable as a solo but will require a lot of micromanagement of AI teammates to be effective 8/10
great fun
Very fun game

Simultaneously one of the best and most difficult games I have ever played There are certainly some roadblocks to getting into GTFO as it requires a dedicated group of 3-4 players and many levels are quite a grind but you will be rewarded with one of the most intense satisfying and well-made coop shooters on steam The gunplay the enemy design and the level design are all top-notch The game begins pretty slow and eases you into the mechanics and difficulty while later on you'll encounter some trial-by-fire tests of skill throwing you and your team into pure chaos There is such a crazy amount of strategic depth to the game as well and planning around encounters and how to build your team's loadouts is necessary I find the game also has a very good balance between super chaotic guns blazing segments and slow methodical stealth segments Plus the terminal system is genius The other reviews are correct in saying that this game is definitely not for everyone but if you're a fan of difficult games or teamwork focused coop I seriously think this is a must-play There is also a crazy amount of content easily 1000 hours worth Absolute banger
GTFO
here a few word for you that might want to buy it Insanely fun but hard Better with friend Be patient while playing I find this game really fun but it will take a lot of try to go trought the level i recommend it
Left 4 Dead Pro Max Version
this game is so much fun half of the time im crouch walking around like a fucking midget with a sledge hammer the game play is amazing every time i go to charge my swing they love to randomly wake up and slap the shit out of my huge cock this game honestly wants me to strip naked and get my ass slapped by the big guys u can find in some of the rooms the little guys for some reason want to spread there legs as they crawl around like they want to get some head from u but dont be fooled there just trying to get ur little virgin pussy this games amazing would recommend getting it with a group of friends
Great game The only bad thing is once you get the game there's no lower level people in the game doing the lower levels 1-5 etc

Difficult dangerous and a very eerie environment overall You better love stealth if you want to try this game as you will die fast otherwise Be prepared for missions that can last an hour or longer
One of my favorite PVE experiences the atmosphere stealth and combat feels amazing if you have friends i would highly recommend
AI are pretty useful
Love this game cause it's damn hard lmao
better with friends
It's difficult without other real players right off the bat but it's a very fun challenge Can get repetitive at points but part of the challenge is figuring out how to ration your supplies and how to manage your loadout Would recommend for NOT beginner FPS players however
Step 1 get lowered in step 2 find sleepers step 3 find long flash light step 4 KILL step 5 use turrets to achieve goals step 6 Run out of firearm so you gotta rely on the turret step 7 bots die because they ran infront of you while you were shooting step 8 die step 9 repeat step 10 type Ping_[Insert keycard name_randomcolor_random3digitnumber step 11 do it 5 times over cause one part woops your ass step 12 get the checkpoint step 13 start shitting bricks because of 2-3 titan mf step 14 accidently go back to lobby not knowing if the checkpoint saved step 15 cry step 16 ATTEMPT 2
no difficulty selector no checkpoints too long
GET OUT
If you have friends this is very fun If you don't then its very hard But still fun
Woaaaw dinguerie Jamais j'avais a un jeu comme GTFO et j'aime quand c'est dur Titre Nan sans le jeu les facteurs accru team work essentiel et niveau long comme pas possible et donne GTFO la quand il y avait pas les bots et qu'un seul pote avec qui jouer beaucoup plus d'heures mais j'ai pas d'amis qui aime donner 3h de son temps par niveau et la a son prime
Thrilling stealth Co-op experience Disclaimer create strategy and most importantly backup plan before moving forward They are everywhere

its a fun game no doubt but it's way better with a full group of 4 i got this to play with a friend who happens to already runs with a full group so bummer on my part can't really recommend this unless you know you got a group to play with
very good game but too scary please add a setting that reduces scaryness googly eyes

Excelente jogo muito foda mesmo Aprovado
los bots tienen autismo
amount of love theyve put in deserves praise
alien but coop multiplayer
Stayed up til 5am with my squad squandering ammo and meds didnt make it would play again
I get so stressed playing this game I love it
Sooooooooopoooooooo much fun with a party of 4 so hard set aside like 6 hours worth
Its cool
A pesar de que el juego tiene ideas muy buenas peca de pedante Los creadores crearon un juego para el tryhard pero no adaptaron la dificultad para el de jugadores por sala y eso es un error muy grave la IA aliada es terrible Estorba que ayuda provocan que te detecten los enemigos te matan con el fuego amigo no administran bien la ni los objetos y en general no valen para mucho que para usarlos para colocar minas y torretas Es decir aunque el juego tiene un buen gameplay no lo recomiendo al menos que 3 amigos porque usar 2 bots ya perjudica demasiado y con uno se hace asequible
Hard but rewarding
scary ahh game shit myself D
Wish there was a thumb in the middle option for this one because while I loved the atmosphere and parts of what little we did play of it it was ultimately too hardcore for me to get my friends to want to consistently play and I interested in getting on a discord to find strangers to play with I speak for the effectiveness of the bots in the harder levels but in my opinion if you are considering checking this out as a solo player buy If you find a group of 3 friends that will be willing to commit to this game with you grab it If you willing to connect with strangers then grab it If you able to or willing to commit a few hours potentially to get through a level play it since added some checkpoints here and there at least which is nice for some of the really long levels I agree with criticisms of it being too often a light green light bonk the simulator but I speak for any further than 7 or so missions really and that was spread between 2 or 3 rundowns I last played before they released all the old rundowns for all players I wish I like this more I am hoping the next game is less punishing with a more enjoyable gameplay loop that makes my crew want to come back often to play Curse me for a casual if you must but this simply an experience that clicked for me and my crew The review is super late but I saw this on my list and felt it deserved a review
hold crouch and slowly kill every enemy until a checkpoint security door to then play Tower Defense and rinse and repeat also have fun typing console commands and remembering what command/label/key to type in game feels like it wants to waste your time for the sake of stealth/realism but at least it looks pretty and has fancy UI to waste your time

Menos balas pero estrategia Si te encanta comer papilla ve por una cuchara grande porque te la vas a pasar comiendo
This game is sweet
I literally had this game in my inventory then I had to buy it again because it wasn't in my library No one that I was sharing games with had this game and I have achievements How is this possible
I like the game but in my opinion it's content is not yet worth my money most of the rundowns appear to be capture item do thing with item kill these guys repeat the levels layout are also not randomly generated from my knowledge so it's the same setup every time all the common enemies seem the same and take the same amount of power to kill I enjoy the special enemies but for the most part they aren't a threat usually there are also some visual bugs when loading in sections but maybe that's an AMD problem not that they are severe would've kept the game nonetheless maybe I'm missing something and that's my fault but for me I would rather purchase another game
chefs kiss
boring
10/10
I may just be a masochist but god damn this game is fun the adrenaline rush I get whenever I notice that guy was just a bit too close to someone else and sets off a massive ass horde is so unique to this game yes there are other games like it absolutely nowhere near as hard though and it's multiplayer I highly recommend this game if you have friends that are willing to spend a bit of money for it even through my small amount of playtime on it it is still one of the most fun games in my library as of now

my friend made me play and i was zzzzzzzzz
Amazing game but decently time consuming on later levels Great community great game concept all around great mechanics Although it no longer gets updates the game stands strong and the community is willing to help most new players Even though at first glance it seems dead the discord server is keeping it alive would definitely recommend joining that for matchmaking Difficult but fun definitely a change of place in comparison to other modern day games
This game is just like my childhood you have to pay attention to not wake up the sleepers just like your parents when you get the controller from the bedroom
shid game
Muito bom e pra krai
The game has an amazing design and vision deep down It's unique in its own genre very niche but if it fits your taste you'll addict to it However this is one of the few game that I rarely use such a strong word to say that developers is really incompetent From one point all new game mechanics updated into the game is poorly designed and executed Boosters/Respawn zone/Heart beat/Checkpoints.etc you name it Infection is fine imo if you're wondering Not to mention the mess deep inside the fundamental level like procedural generated levels and all these glitches long lasting in the game My rating to the game changed during last couple years at the beginning I upvote it then for a couple years I downvote it then finally upvote it again until recently I do feel complicated but the final version of game is OK I guess It's fair to say at least GTFO got a solid ending and as a final product
such a fun game
ass
You have to friends to play with them and lots of free time coz this is gonna take a while
nice game
tohle
Dauda shoots me in the back

fun to play with friends hardcore as fck
Extremely buggy Its been a couple yers and i still havent been able to play much barely runs on steam deck
Fun
an amazing game with loads of mod potential very hard but in a skillful way would highly recommend i can not preach this game enough
Needs a full team to even be playable and from what I've heard playing with strangers isn't the best experience It's otherwise a really fun cooperative game that I'd recommend Apparently the bots can be modded to be a little more competent but that isn't an avenue I've explored Recommended on the condition you have at least 2 other people to play with you

lowkey dogshit
Great game 10/10 would play again if I scared shitless
I absolutely adore this game GTFO definitely isn't for everyone as the difficulty is very high and you have to put in a lot of hours to get good But I still enjoyed exploring the world of GTFO and encountering the enemies for the first time while I was still a beginner The sound design is phenomenal the atmosphere is amazing overall and the weapons are extremely satisfying to use The story is interesting too and the level designs are well-made The game is scary cool and difficult and I have enjoyed playing it a lot The game also takes on an entirely different form once you start using speedrunning tactics Overall it's a 9.5/10 for me and I recommend that anyone interested should at least try it
If looking for a game that masterfully combines teamwork tension and triumph GTFO is the ultimate experience From the moment you descend into the eerie depths of the Complex immersed in an environment that perfectly balances dread and exhilaration The game's atmosphere is unmatched with hauntingly detailed environments and a soundtrack that intensifies the sense of unease without overpowering the gameplay What sets GTFO apart is its commitment to true cooperative gameplay This is not just a game where you can rely on solo heroics every mission demands tight coordination clear communication and strategic thinking The feeling of successfully executing a plan with your team whether a perfectly synchronized stealth takedown or a desperate firefight is pure adrenaline-fueled satisfaction The level design is brilliant offering labyrinthine corridors massive open chambers and chokepoints that make every encounter feel unique Each mission feels like a puzzle that requires not just brute force but clever problem-solving and adaptability The enemies are a work of art in their own grotesque way with behavior patterns that keep you on your toes and ensure no two encounters are the same What truly elevates GTFO is its attention to detail The tactile sensation of the tools and weapons the tension as you hack a terminal or open a door and the ominous glow of your flashlight in the dark create an experience that feels alive and immersive The developers clearly poured their hearts into crafting a game that challenges you in the best possible way Whether you're a fan of survival horror or a lover of cooperative gameplay GTFO is a must-play a game that just test your skills but also rewards perseverance and teamwork in ways that few other games manage to achieve If you dived into the Complex yet gather your squad and get ready for an unforgettable journey GTFO just a game an adventure be talking about for years to come

definitly not a normal shooter and its pretty much unplayable without a party but one of the most fun games I have played recently

Boring Guns feel very weak Stealth is repetitive
this is game is a lot of fun when it works and when you can play with friends but this game lacks basic match making features like private lobbies which is the worst offence the net code is garbage spent and hour trying to start various matches and could not get them to start I'm sure there are mods that fix these issues but these are things that should already be in a game that is 5 years old
Meg lehet szeretni Egy nagyon coop fps
slog
This game is a co-op focused 1-4 player game You are exploring abandoned facilities complete objectives managing resources health and ammo while facing terrifying enemies Communicating with friends is a must to plan your escape I love the sentry guns do wish they had more ammo and far better animation 50 calibre round animation I have never experienced a game like this ever I always end the game if failed or completed with an adrenalin rush 10/10 please buy this
it would be better if monsters could hear voice chat but its a nice game
A great game whose price tag was its downfall With friends GTFO can be a fun experience However everyone will have to fork out a small portion of their wallet for a game that expects to always have friends at the ready The matchmaking is basically just a fancy UI decoration and the single player is just a single tutorial level There is very little replayability for levels besides boosters which even then are only fleeting Cosmetics are earned through first completion of a level and only ever earned by such Overall GTFO is a fun experience But notably different to anything you would have normally played
La del juego es lo que mas resalta su sonidos y se integran perfectamente a lo que el juego quiere transmitir
i havnt played it
best coop horror game.;P
scout
TERRIFYING had to refund cuz i'm a little piss baby
would be great if matchmaking would find all 3 squadmates
👎
pretty cool when you just die would recommend took me and my pals 2.5hrs to complete the first level edit remove douda from the game i was on the last room of the second level about to get the last ID and douda thinks it would be a good idea to run headfirst into a scout we all die cause of douda remove douda
Leider konnte mich GTFO nicht Obwohl das Spielkonzept spannend klingt und die durchaus intensiv ist wird der durch die extreme Schwierigkeit und den Mangel an Ohne ein perfekt abgestimmtes Team und viel Geduld sich das Gameplay oft frustrierend an Zudem wirken einige Mechaniken zu komplex und die Lernkurve zu steil um wirklich zu machen Hardcore-Fans von Koop-Shootern mag es reizvoll sein aber Gelegenheitsspieler ist es schwer zu fassen

Good and fun to play
get the fuck out
This game is the equivalent of a black hole It sucks all the life out of you When my friends and I started it we thought we were getting into a fun challenging horror game In reality it is just too difficult The enemies look like a gangreen cooch and moan/scream all the time Ill put my spear through their arse and roast them over an open fire Everyone saying that it is just a matter of learning the strategies are actually living in their mother's basement SHHHHHHHHHHH be quiet You are going to alert the throbbing cocks All enemies look like they are trying to force their guts out of their butt
It's fun and very intense but put it on a big drive because it has a ton of graphics and is very laggy If you want a challenge then this game is good for you

Really fun game Worth the money 3

Enjoyable Difficulty I want more games like this
F u n GaMe
pure chaos with friends and then we kill one of us during extraction 10/10
ABSOLUTE cinema also absolute GOD DAMN IT
Play mission for over an hour Plan everything it's good but not great Run for extraction with turrets placed on your way to watch your back Start extracting Going great so far Sh*t hits the fan Massive swarm spawns 80 extract we all die Do the same mission 2 more times over 2h Get a piss yellow suit as a reward Great game reccomend to everyone
Great shooter with a sneak segments creepy dark atmosphere Love it so far although one mission can take up to 1 hour
The gameplay loop can get a bit stale Moving from room to room finding this finding that and moving to the next room that is pretty similar to the last can get a bit boring But often right when I start to feel that boredom the game throws a wrench into the loop An unexpected insane event will happen during a mission or a mission will break the expected mold The game is still awesome I love the difficulty co-op with your mates is a blast and will test your friendship when someone fucks up the stealth kill collecting artifacts is fun mini-game during the missions and the story is great
great atmosphere and good enemies although i would have like some more unique enemy interaction however im only 3hr is so maybe ill see more
SO DAM good
This game is very hard have to retry a LOT of times on a single level but its very addictive Its difficult because it gives less resources like heath ammo etc forcing newbies to learn how to stealth kill the enemies in each room and only use ammo in alarm and blood doors It has a variety of loadouts for you to choose from It's scary fun and can be quite a challenge Would definitely recommend to buy this game
69Nice
no puedo pasar la tercera mision y voy 10 horas de juego recomendado
sneaky time
this is shit
Wow just no
Smash
The gameplay is slow passed repetitive and unfair This game make me feel like if i was wasting my time
took me and my pal approx 4.3 hours trying mission with just 2 people before realizing we could add bots instead we got a full squad took us half an hour to beat it 10/10 game
Took 5.2 hours to beat the first level time to attempt the second
It's a really immersive hardcore first-person shooter game A game that will keep you on your toes Best played with friends You will need all the coordination and cooperation you can muster
Great horror game love the game style Hard But a fun hard game would recommend to friend for this game
This type of dark sci-fi is really unique go play Signalis as well

Liquidates my brain stem on a regular basis Good game
They really do mean die together Me and my friends have been trying to complete the first mission and it took us around 3 hours and we needed to add 2 bots
Great game 10/10
yes
wow this game is really hard if your friends are subhuman
run around in a dead end labyrinth while taking massive damage from every fight which happens seemingly both infrequently and constantly take in the beautiful grey walls and floor as you wander aimlessly for an entire hour and repeatedly run out of ammo also the game is not scary it is annoying although it kinda has the charm of a xbox 360 era game and i do like that about it it's not very fun nor is it worth 16 and certainly not 40 i'd say 5
Even with over 1900 hours on the game it's always fun to play the game also playing on solo without bots makes it even more fun with the challenge though the bots are a challenge in itself but you got to fully understand how they work to make them work
yes
bello
simplesmente e medo de fazer qualquer barulho e sentir sua bunda e ganhar mais 5 kg
The game in intense very difficult with less than 4 people Scary action Very good
good spooks
Game tells your BPM is 57 while dealing with 3 Sleepers all alone that's totally incorrect on my side
Very good but hard as fuck you need good friends

very sick game
Gutes Spiel aber meiner Meinung nach nur zu viert spielbar
Actually annoying game spent half an hour looking for a key tried the ping said it doesnt exist Maybe im dumb but the puzzles grind the entire game to a screeching halt if you don't perfectly grasp them The game play wasnt even hard I just got bored of wandering an empty map Extremely disappointed in this game and I don't see the hype at all

good
This is one of the best games I've ever played The way they make this a horror game is very similar to how they made left 4 dead a horror game It's scary fun and can be quite a challenge Aside from some very minor issues the only issues are that it can be a time commitment and it's best experienced playing with friends Those issues are more of a personal issue I can have from time to time so it's not the games fault whatsoever So if you don't have a lot of time to spare or aren't comfortable playing with randoms on the discord than this might not be for you Definitely one of the greatest multiplayer games of all time even playing with just the bots is fun
um jogo de bastante skill based ent pr novatos vai ser um pouco complicado e team work a palavra chave desse jogo Recomendo pr quem quer jogar de jogos mais Procure um amg ou um server discord dedicado pr jogar esse game com vc jogar sem mt ruim
Very nice yees i Approve very much
I could not get past the tutorial The stupid computer buzzing sound legit enraged me yay sensory triggers Among other things I didn't enjoy Sadly purchased off of another site so can't request a refund
do lokacji przypadkiem w przeciwnika nagle z lokacji wszyscy i mnie i tak do skutku nie wyjdzie
This game is painful but god is it fun Would recommend playing with friends at least 1 but 2 or 3 is best not even for gameplay but the mental solo is horrid starting out I've been playing solo with bots and I'm stuck on R1C2 5th level of the game and I had to bring in players for R1C1 Good for people who like to learn and try again and again If sitting in a dank hole with your friends for over an hour doesn't sound fun don't buy
shitty game

pretty fun game
This game is great It sure does take a while to GTFO as the game implies but alas it is the journey that matters Regretfully I could not GTFO as my teammates mistook this game for a PAYDAY 2 loud heist It's like trying to do shadow raid with 75 detection risk Truly cinema
Excellent experience I recommend that you play with your retarded friends that don't know how to stealth whatsoever makes for an enjoyable experience Still haven't figured out how to GTFO but I'm sure we'll find out with enough brute forcing 10/10
Scariest stories
I don't care for stealth game play and not being able to be loud ruins this game for me
good game
Great blend of horror stealth risk management and teamwork/strategy The atmosphere is phenomenal Find some friends and you're set but don't bother getting the game if you aren't willing to use discord or otherwise get a group to run with
👍
It's a fun co-op games with friends once you get into the swing of things and you start really learning what you can get away with it's a lot more fun but the process of learning that is fun too It is a decent time by yourself but the experience is 150 better with even one more person If you have someone who will play with you even infrequently I think it's worth the dosh

Game has great sound and atmosphere Can be fun to play with friends Though the biggest surprises are pretty much over after the first few hours it seems Gets repetitive after a while sneak melee monsters find terminal find keys find objective extract repeat 7/10 Get it while its on sale
Because I used the mod MeleeFriendlyFire v0.2.1 by Andocas I accidentally injured my teammates in the game due to my relatively poor skills As a result I was reported by a small number of players who were always in cahoots Surprisingly the reason for the report was friendly fire in close combat which led to my inability to match with others inability to enter the server and others were also afraid to play with me ruining my gaming experience I think this mod is a great interactive mod and the outcome of the game can't be determined by this mod Please update it to make the official version fair Don't let a small number of people dominate the fairness of the game with their personal ideas and actions I will post this matter online Please attach importance to this issue The fundamental problem still lies in the matching system
a real deal for a tactical horror this aint your typical run n gun sim it took guts to press the drop button
Le jeu est bien
Sehr gutes spiel Mann stirbt zwar fast nur wenn einer faxen macht aber sonst ist es sehr gut
i somehow cant seem to GTFO its been 85 hours and im still in the first room
It frequently freezes in the middle of the game without showing any error code and so I don't know how to fix the problem Regardless of the finished game it still feels and plays like an Early Access title

this shit is fire it requires so much coordination and teamwork must play with friends the ambiance and and the sounds are so nerve racking
pretty high skill ceiling really cool atmosphere and concept highly recommend requires lots of coordination between a team will require brain power
Good Team Multiplayer-based Horror Objective FPS Monster AI is unique and fun plus the addition of using sound/noise as a large mechanic of the game
This game has a lot wrong with it but the core concept and execution of levels are incredible The enforced co-op is amazing and I hope more games learn from this idea
jogue com pelo menos 4 pessoas esse meu conselho
This game is super difficult but I think its a lot of fun too
I got abused by unimaginable horrors for free and now I`m paying for it 10/10 I would do it again
When I tried this in the testers version I got brutally tickled loved it the game is totally worth the money 10/10
thought it was ok haven't played it in ages played it recently realized i've been sleeping on it because it is awesome

fun for the whole family
The only game where I can live out my dream as a paranoid schizophrenic war veteran while simultaneously being beaten up by a school of kids who learned how to articulate from watching anime Love it
very niche game would not recomend to people who don't like a challenge however if you are willing to die over and over this is a great game
I have completed only 2 levels in 8 hours of playtime
This game has me feelin some kinda way Worth your time This game can be played with AI characters as teammates but to get the real feel and most out of the game you'll want some friends to tag along in the rundown hellscape Aim small miss small Only shoot what you can hit Stealth kill as many sleepers as you can Watch your corners The Warden is a cruel mistress
Get The Fuck Out more like Get The Freak On I stole this review from a friend
Save yourself while you still can don't download the game Hell's pits have opened up for this game alone so don't be drug down with it
Great fun with friends

I played only with friends full shotguns loadout maul on the ready stuff is pain but in a fun kind of way like benching your own bodyweight of rusted nails above your head The developers absolutely DO NOT fix bugs glitches or take care of connectivity issues This game is pure vibes only and there is an easiest and hardest way to play it nothing is equal the finished product is sloppy and every aspect of the game screams Elden Ring Combat System but even more convoluted and unfriendly Definitely a buy but only if you have spare money and 3 friends to torture otherwise don't even look at this title
We had a perfect set up planned everything out for 2 security doors Pulled two security doors sleepers flooded in Got behind a door and shut it but a friend got shut in I opened the door telling him that no man should be left behind But it was too late He told me to leave him I shut the door again knowing nothing could be done We reinforced the door but there wasn't enough time there were too many of them The mine we had set earlier blew with the door With my two other fellow prisoners down I stared into the face of several hybrids that survived the explosion Taking out my scattergun I blasted and hid behind cover blasting again and again and again With a shred of health left barely standing I survived With no ammunition and health to my name I helped my brothers up and trekked onward into the facility continuing to our deaths
Very good game need reliable friends to play though bots are a liability
be warned this is not a first person shooter a common mistake new players make is assuming that it is an FPS game just because you get to shoot guns GTFO is a horror game first and foremost with excellent shooting elements mixed in to its core gameplay it is first and foremost a team based game the games own motto work together or die together is the perfect summary for how 10 chambers demands you treat this game going solo will only work for the first rundown after that you are guaranteed to lose without at least 2 more teammates preferably 3 since the bots act as if they had actual lobotomies in battle you and your team must be able to expertly manage every resource you find ammunition for your guns health refills for your other tools everything wasting resources is often a fatal mistake ammo especially most of your combat will be stealth and melee based so it is critical you know the enemies weak points how each enemy acts and most importantly patience because going for the kill isnt always the smartest choice it is rarely a good idea to go loud and start shooting however there will be sections and situations where you have no choice but to shoot since your ammo count will be quite limited your aim and positioning when shooting is also something you will have to master if you want to get out alive note that friendly fire is very much on and the damage you can take from teammates and your own sentry guns is not a small amount this is not a game for those who are just beginners to the shooter genre despite it being a shooter second and a horror game first you have to know what you are doing at all times thankfully the discord community is quite helpful and you shouldnt have any problems finding a team who would be willing to teach the games mechanics to you gameplay aside the atmosphere and art direction is simply great you get the feeling just from the environment alone that where you are at is not a safe place to be and you must be always alert because of it the enemies are all threatening to look at the sound effects are done masterfully each gunshot sounds as if it packs a punch behind it you make small echos when you move around etc the story is there but it takes some digging for you to piece it all together sort of like how fromsoft handles the stories for their souls and soulslike games thankfully with GTFO you get just enough story told to you to make you interested in it and thus make you want to know more so despite this game being brutally difficult i will still recommend it even if you are a beginner to shooters you can still get by with a good team teaching you everything and while the game is hard its also fair it is rarely ever BS levels of difficult so most losses are almost always the fault of you and your team when something bad happens there's usually something you could've done to avoid it hardcore but still a very fun horror/shooter experience if thats what you are into i definitely suggest giving this game a try
I enjoy difficult games with trial and error as I've played Fear Hunger and this game is quite similar in the sense of being a horror game with quite a bit of difficulty if you don't know what you're doing initially Every level is mostly different and has something new and you don't really know what to expect Most of my hours were played solo however there is no doubt that multiplayer offers a better experience The game is doable solo however you just need to be quite good along with a lot of trial error to actually beat very difficult levels
Got migraine from menu and HUD text overlapping and couldn't play the game 1/5 Nice concept

pior copia de left 4 dead
very long and hard but also buggy despite developement ending some time ago very thrilling and enjoyable experience overall expect to invest at least 250-300 hours if you plan on beating it and 100 more if you want to 100 it if youre unsure about buying this then try out some free weekend/get it on sale 50 the discord community has you covered if you dont have any friends to play with too
GTFO is an excellent and special game It takes the 4 expendable lackeys go on impossible mission formula and expands it in such a wonderful way The gun-play is great you feel strong but only for so long Managing resources scrounging through zones all the while avoiding or carefully executing sleepers or jumanji'ing big guys creates this deep sense of camaraderie and reliance on your teammates And actually forces you to work with them which is something not a lot of the genre gets right.The perfect example being the terminal pings they only work with someone near the terminal and only last so long so it creates this immediate we need to work together situation with another person My friends have described it as Doom but you aren't Doomguy and I think that's perfectly accurate You're equipped with capable weaponry yet the prisoners are mere mortals not able to take much physical punishment This weakness forces you to rely on your tools tactics and positioning to avoid as much unnecessary resource expenditure as possible The atmosphere the environment you're thrust into the lore the game-play its all so damn good there's only one caveat you NEED friends to play this game with at least 1 other person but having a 4 stack is best The AI teammates are actually brain dead 9/10 I just really wish the game scaled with less people
Boring game was literally a cake walk Might seem like it's intense at first but you'll quickly learn its a crouch around and smack things simulator until you open a door Then you're just shooting the same guys you were smacking plus a couple of the bigger tougher to take down guys Truthfully 5/10
Well this game can lead you to divorce and even eating disorder maybe even worse you become the game so basically well recommended I gave my soul to giantess giant shooter God damn
this is as fun as shoving broken shards of glass up your ass and having your friends cheer you on as they try to help you shove more glass up your ass would play again

I wanted to love this game but certain aspects of its difficulty were just plain annoying like the fog and unforgiving checkpoints requiring replaying large sections of the levels For the first couple levels it was a lot of fun playing this with friends figuring out the best way to clear rooms and take out different types of enemies But then the combat would be inconsistent and ruin our well laid out plans or we couldn't 100 tell if the enemies were partially alerted someone would take one step too many and alert everything in the vicinity A rewarding game to figure out until it just becomes unforgiving and annoying
yes
GTFO is a game where you work together to find DNA samples and whatever other items through a labyrinth of an abandoned mining station fighting hordes of mutated zombie like creatures and its FREAKING BORING Tastes differ and some may like this but this isnt the shoot em up horror it makes itself to be my only regret is not refunding it on time the gameplay is stale and dry some will excuse this by saying its Simple and not complicated its just boring update gave it one more shot still freaking boring

Good game Very flawed matchmaking One day I'll join the discord and get the Rundowns done Ive completed R1 and half of R2 Very fun stealth mechanics they just need to try and rethink the way they do matchmaking
imagine a coop shoter on meth and BOOM you got gtfo also theres no settings for hard or easy mode theres hard harder insane and super butt fucker 30000 basically the game is easy with 4 players to make it hard just play with less than 4 players also i love this shit so much OMG IM gonna cream in the sleepers
For Wardens sake use the discord to matchmake it's so much easier Also sounds like they're hungry eh
Great game got to play for free during the free weekend thingy Will buy once I have friends to play with 👍👍
fire alien game so cool yes yes yesr need more than 4 brain cells tho you need 5 for this gaem
anyway we can be able to drop supplies otherwise great game
The first co-op horror game i've ever felt scared in This game is not afraid to pull its punches and one mistake can ruin a run You need your team to survive but they often cause problems when sneaking The bot ai is decent but needs to have a less itchy trigger finger I often alert one that i could easily silent kill and the bot just starts blasting away also i wish the bots had the option to pick up specific pinged item During the reactor startup it would be nice if i got to choose what we take in with us overall great game best with friends
I don't get the hype this was turbo ass

This game is amzing hard but amazing This is a must buy
It prides itself on being suuuuuper difficultbut it just ends up as a bunch of unfair bullshit and goes tee hee isnt this game so hard runs take hours if you dare to play solo and god help you if you actually manage to get to the exit because OOPS NOW THERES A SCAN THAT TAKES MIN WHILE YOU GET SLAMMED WITH AN ENDLESS WAVE HOPE YOU DIDNT USE ALL YOUR AMMO ON THE 4 OTHER MASSIVE WAVES WE THROUGH AT YOU and i could forgive all of it i can forgive the bullshit enemies and the fog and the infection BS and starving you for resources and the bullshit escape and hell even how ungodly long the levels can be at times if the god damned ai teammates acted like they had a single line of code in their retarded fucking heads they waste every single ounce of that microscopic supply of tool ammo gun ammo and every single fucking health kit that you find if they didnt soak up every last hit like it was their ob if they didnt shoot the giants instead of hitting them with the spears i gave them JUST FOR SUCH AN OCCASION and if they didnt completely ignore every command besides put your util here this game isnt difficult get 3 buddies and run through it until you hit your limit of bullshit and uninstall dont buy this dumpster fire for full price if you want a good game like this go play Ready or Not or something call it a skill issue or whatever but this game used to be fun but with every little mechanic getting gutted for a slower and way more clunky as well as buggy mess of its former self i just cant play it anymore if you have friends that hate themselves and are willing to stand in a room you just cleared til you finish the entire level only to do the same thing again the next level by all means get the game on sale but for those of you that like a good solo challenge or just dont have friends that are willing to puit themselves through this game just dont even waste the time

cool game
good for days where there isn't enough stress in your life
Take the risk or not You'll fuck up anyways
Even with the bugs even with the unholy ammount of needed information not being teached This game fucks so hard
The devs need to give us a way to turn off the GUI mirroring I've solved it with modding but that's a bad way to enjoy a game as the devs intended otherwise After one mission with my friends my head hurts just looking at the GUI for 50 minutes The game is unplayable without this mod imo 3/10 I'm not returning it and will enjoy high anxiety shooter missions with my buds but I won't be positive about the game either

Fun but make sure you have competent friends

Es un realmente hermoso tanto en como en el sonido en general buenos y jugabilidad complicado para jugarlo solo pero con paciencia se puede de es recomendable jugarlo con amigos porque esta bastante ZARPADO como punto negativo que es extremadamente repetitivo lo cual lo vuelve algo tedioso a largo plazo teniendo en cuenta que 1 sola partida puede durar horas y si se pierde hay que empezar de 0
This game slaps harder then my step dad
After 8 long hours I finally beat the first level with my best friend

For the two days I was able to play the game I loved it Great story amazing visuals and great game play 10/10 Would recommend
one of the best coop games
10/10
Some mistakes can be made but its alright its alright
Even though the sounds and feeling of the most guns and atmosphere are nice I cannot recommend this game because of the creatures that shoot fire from their heads the first level creatures that take a quarter of your life even in the beginner levels Also the fact that it tries to give the feeling of having minimal bullets to spare and forcing you to act stealth it completely alienates the players from the main story and turning them into literal bullet beggars

Extremely fun and challenging mechanics Worth every penny
annoying sometimes when you are by yourself but other than that its an amazing game and very challenging and takes time to practise and it take patients to play so not good for inpatient people like my mate
it would be fun it open world
Hard at Two players
What do healthy relationships and good GTFO players have in common Good communication and patience

Wer braucht Freunde wenn man GTFO hat Das Spiel ist wie ein Team-Building-Seminar auf Crack voller Spannung Panik und epischer Nichts bringt Menschen zusammen als im Dunkeln durch eine Einrichtung zu schleichen und leise zu das Ding nicht an sonst sind wir alle GTFO ist nicht nur ein Spiel es ist eine emotionale Achterbahnfahrt In einer Minute du dich wie ein taktisches Genie das jede Bewegung perfekt plant In der Minute schreist du wie ein kleines Kind weil jemand die falsche hat Danke Sven Wirklich Die Zum Schneiden dick Der Schwierigkeitsgrad Ein liebevoller Schlag ins Gesicht Das Teamplay Ein Meisterwerk des Chaos das euch gleichzeitig und die Wahl eurer Freunde nachdenken Pro-Tipp Macht euch bereit Nur noch ein Versuch!"-Abende Und vergiss nie In GTFO gibt es keine Helden Nur wenn ihr habt Wenn ihr Lust auf Nervenkitzel und das ultimative des Triumphes habt dann ist GTFO euer Ding Und hey wenn nichts klappt ihr immer noch eure Freunde alles verantwortlich machen von auf zu laufen du

very challenging suggest a full squad communicating at all times to be successful
Its so good

esse jogo maravilhoso underrated AF dificil pra caralho muitas tentativas em fases mais complexas
Recomendo se tiver e um grupo de amigos para jogar Jogo super total furtividade Tem que ter muito trabalho em equipe e para ir com calma sem rushar atmosfera e o HUD bem legais
Jogo muito bom e acha partida pra jogar coop e solo super paia de jogar Se tem pelo menos um amigo pra jogar eu recomendo d Infelizmente vou pedir reembolso os porcaria de amigos que tenho querem comprar o game
This is the most difficult game I've ever played and its why I live it so much You lose because you made mistakes and didn't play better It expects you to get good at the game and once you do the satisfaction of completing a difficult level is so great that its why I love to come back to it
very fun and good
Perfect blend of unforgiving and fun Not really for the casual crowd though would advise you watch some reviews before picking the game up
I really really want to enjoy this game because it seems sooooo cool and interesting but the sheer amount of blindingly bright as hell white popups for EVERY SINGLE DAMN text bit is causing me sooo much pain I am sensitive to flashing bright lights and I can usually shake off most of it in videogames I think just due to it 1 not being a giant white flickering pop up and 2 most games aren't as dark in lighting as this one Its really sad honestly cause the game seems so cool and interesting but I can not deal with EVERY text pop up being a stark bright white text box flickering and then the regular text showing If it was just the regular text like flickering into effect in its subdued colors I would be fine but the giant white box is an absolute no go for me sadly If its ever changed I'd love to give this another go and give an actual review for it but as it stands currently I just can't play this The hilarious irony is you can turn off the photosensitivity warning that will pop up if you go to the settings menu but you cant do much about the stupid white boxes constantly popping up The game itself is likely a solid game but if you are photo sensitive do yourself a favor and find recent gameplay of it to make sure you can handle the stupid white flashes before buying this
a bad mans is coming
Dull
Joguinho bom de mais Da pra criar objetivos com amigos e fazer boas gameplays O jogo de certa forma meio estressante pelos eventos que acontecem e como acontecem Talvez a longo prazo fique mais chato por ser meio RougueLike mas muito boa a proposta fora o fato de ser um horror game
idk know what to say erm play the game with friends it very fun
The atmosphere is great I especially recommend collaborating with friends to pass the levels
Shh sleepers don't wake them they'll call their friends and we'll be in deep shit
IN HELL YOU LEARN KILL TOGETHER OR SUCK
Last game I remember playing there was some southern guy screaming about how he wanted to kill vaccinated people into his McDonald's drive-thru mic It's edgy it's mean even when things are going right it feels weird and unclear Just not a fun experience It's like Helldivers with none of the charm
Fantastic horror stealth game completely playable with bots I managed to beat most of the rundowns by myself but the game excels in a group especially because you can blame someone else for waking up the room
Too hard to be enjoyed even with friends
Very awesome game and fun to play with friends
good

You need some friends with BALLS to play the game and you all need some good mentality to play it If you enjoy the suffering and the stealth gameplay you can have the funniest and most exciting time of your gaming life But you need 3-4 firends at best to play the game with you because its very long and can be quite tough some times I only played the first Chapter and the second Chapter half way through with may friends but my friends sadly didnt want to play anymore because the levels were to difficult The problem is I still want to play the game but alone its almost impossible Overall its a great game and you can enjoy it for a long time if you and your friends have the endurance for it
good stuff
joguei gratis num fim de semana gratis meu pc era gratis entao nao rodou gratis

Fun

This game is a friendship make or break I don't think I have ever played a game where you are constantly conserving and worrying about ammo health and resources as much as GTFO does and the pure fear of sometimes only being able to run from the massive horde of monsters chasing you to the extraction Coordination between your team can also be the decider of the rundown and only perfect timed executions of sleepers and other monsters allow your survival Long rundown times 2-3 hrs cause tense realisation that right before extraction one mistake could end it all and leave you and your friends strewn across the map dead The sound design is chilling and the visual effects are pleasing but also terrifying and the game play is quite difficult I can highly recommend this game if you love a good challenge and have at least 2 other friends to play with
It's a hard game that requires a lot of team coordination to survive Get some friends because if you not going to enjoy it I like it
STOP MOVING DAMNIT
Game stealth is way to jank Which would not be so bad if it were not that one random waking up can cause a horde that often leads to a party wipe Which enemies wake up seemingly randomly no one has a flash light no one moves no one attacks and they wake up You also have to try to navigate it pitch darkness most of the time The stealth needs work to make is consistent instead of rolling the dice to see if you make it or not
Great game very hard
Foi jogando esse jogo que descobri que o maior inimigo na verdade o inimigo em si mas sim o amigo b Maldito homem que confia no homem b
O jogo dificil requer bastante estrategia mas bastante divertido embora demora muito para fazer as e principalmente se vc tem um amigo gay que quer ficar testando arma com monstros por perto
Very good play alone
This game is great but you need to know what you're getting into It's a horror game first This is not a shooter You will be crouching and sneaking around with a melee weapon to stealth kill enemies 90 of the time You need a friend to play with or you need to be willing to engage with the community on discord The bots are for practice only and matchmaking isn't viable The game is hard While sneaking is the focus you also have to be able to shoot VERY well or your team won't make it You need to be patient and take your time If you're the type to try to optimize the speed at which you can do things your team will not like you
Really great and fascinating game with cool story I just really wish the Co-op system worked better
hell yeah brother
Cool game a lot of fun with somebody you know pretty challenging some moments in the game will most likely make you frustrated but patience and strategy will be the key to succeeding

Super Spiel
fun spook
To preface GTFO is the type of game that totally enforces the concept of TEAMWORK right at your face No ifs no buts teamwork is the ONLY way you'll finish your objectives and extract in one piece This game doesn't shy about being hardcore EVEN on your first play as a solo/team newbie Once starting the game it is IMPERATIVE that you play through the tutorial as it will give you an idea of how the game works and how you will kill the Sleepers enemies within the Complex To make it short your guns are your last resort and stealth melee is king for rundowns After that it's all up to you and your team on how y'all strategize to complete mission It's better if you all spend 5 minutes strategizing on how to proceed the area assigning targets identifying ideal firing positions/turret placement rather than trust on an impulse to run-and-gun What makes this game particularly difficult for newbies is that resources are very scarce and you are forced to be efficient and effective in dealing with the sleepers and the hordes which is why dispatching them via melee is the best Run-and-gun strats are ineffective as you'll alert the entire horde inside the room and soon you'll find yourself having insufficient ammunition to take them out/low on health to proceed Remember this isn't L4D2 or WWZ and weapon discharge should only be reserved for areas in the mission that will trigger alarms because alarm bioscan sequence incoming horde Lastly should you buy this game If you are the type of person who craves for a brutal game of slow methodical and stealthy shooter then perhaps you should get the game For casual or veteran fps gamers the game won't really care about that because what matters is how you will plan and proceed once shit goes wrong and like how the game is advertised SHIT WILL REALLY HIT THE FAN no matter what If you are up to the challenge then I recommend you get the game because I promise you won't regret it Remember Don't shine the light on them Watch your movements Stay quiet Go for the head DO NOT TOUCH THE FORBIDDEN SPAGHETTI
The scouts gave me ptsd
cnm
I dont know why i would want to GTFO when there are baddies constantly chasing after me
No FOV-dependant zoom sensitivity scaling is crazy for a fps game

Taught me how to socialize
shit my pant
Game is so easy to cry tears of blood Stuck 6 hrs on one beginner mission
It is very fun Especially when the bots are dumb and don't go into the team scan for some reason
This game blows weewee
Necesito 2 negros para jugar
was deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
the sleepers r lowkey caked up
coll
work together or die together Yeah with emphasis on WORK because this is how the game feels like in the later stages like WORK If you enjoy working together like with morons form your corporate business office job this game is for YOU Expect from people what you would expect from people and that is that they do stupid shit which destroys hours of work you all put into completing a rundown But holy shit this feels so good if you play with smart people and the teamwork is teamworking 10/10 would apply for the job at the mining company again
I think I was not supposed to play this it's so good
gameplay loop fall into hole kill monsters try to ping key in terminal terminal tells you to fuck off manually find key kill more monsters run out of ammo no ammo packs only equipment ammo packs no health packs die
be me have friend with me on run go through run room with four giants narrowly avoid it next room has a scout we narrowly avoid the scout prepare to swing on sleeper we miss and wake up the sleeper bots start shooting shooting wakes up scout we begin to fight remember the giants remember the giants remember the giants watch in horror as they stroll their happy asses into the room and i'm the only one left
Absolutely Perfect
3/10 score from me that's it Well it's a masochist tool all in all Nothing special Masochists or the so-called enthusiasts tryhards and hardcore players like it but it's definitely not for the average player or below It doesn't quite feel like an usual game clearly the solo experience is problematic and the way the coop behaves makes that thing more suitable for people that don't have any job or anything else to do in life as it doesn't act relaxing feeling more as a job itself The game has no proper difficulty balance as it's extremely unforgiving It feels strange to hear that it has been nerfed over time This There is a term too harder for that Because it is The community behaves good.most of the time Not all of the time people are really welcoming And it is clear why the game is generally unforgiving for all types of mistakes No way to alter game difficulty in a proper way and it feels slow and boring over time rather than normally challenging The way you are going to learn stuff is too often by inevitable dying experience You might feel a bit scared.of being pissed off too much not by the vision of the creatures There are multiple interesting things around here but without a real difficulty balance I wouldn't put this thing in the Games category For people that use the term difficulty balance more than 95 of all Steam games have a better difficulty management I'm still giving it tries from to time but getting pissed pretty often Probably just gonna quit it permanently sooner or later which feels sorry as it seems like you can't even enjoy halfgame alone and you get thrown into online with unreliable teammates or forced to organise instead of checking it out for yourself first
If you have a group of friends to play this with I think it's the best PvE co-op shooter since L4D
I'v been playing this for some time now and I must say it's one of my most favourite games to play online with friends love the start as you go down to the bottom on what I would described as a theme park ride Great choice of weapons and tactical elements just a great game with friends with a good bit of horror jump scares 5 out of 5 for me
I know im meant to gtfo but i just dont wanna
my wife like very much
Is it hard Yes Is it awesome Also yes
Don't wake them up

GTFO
I'm going to give this a recommendation because it's a hardcore game that caters to a hardcore gamer demographic What this means is you need time and patience primarily As many other reviews state this absolutely is NOT a hardcore shooter What this game is is a test of patience and stealth along with resource management You ideally want to rope 3 friends into the game and go in with them but they better be truly hardcore gamers with no lives at all and I mean this you cannot just log in to this game after work unless you dedicate yourself at least like 2 hours or more to a gaming session Most gamers normal people can't really handle this You are given super cool and relatively powerful guns and sentries but you really never want to use them because that means wasted resources ammo this is probably the biggest feelsbad of the whole game design I respect a game and a developer that has a vision for a game and sticks to it even if it's not marketed for mass audiences perhaps especially if it's not That said despite being a pretty hardcore gamer myself the extreme length of rundowns levels/missions combined with next to zero checkpoints in the game make the barrier to entry extremely challenging I have something like 4 hours to sit at this computer screen and even I am getting taxed by the length of these rundowns Have you ever played World of Warcraft Classic or Vanilla and ran the dungeon Black Rock Depths BRD This dungeon was so vast and took so long that people decided to split it up into different wings when they formed groups for it like the jails emperor runs lava runs coffer runs etc This is what GTFO reminds me of You will be travelling to a dungeon and you will not get out for hours You need to have time period Again it's so great that this game exists and it's so hardcore but I am writing this review to let you know what you are getting into Set aside a huge amount of time for this game use the Discord to get games play with your friends if they have time but if they are dads or have ADD don't bother pitching the game to them It's just not possible Honestly this is the info I needed to see before I wasted my time and my friend's money in pitching the game to them they simply don't have the time to sit at a screen uninterrupted for 2-4 hours To the developers For the 10th time I love your hardcore nature keep it but my advice to you would be to add in a feature that gives an average time players completed or estimated time to complete in the info-box for each rundown This will give players some semblance of how to plan their lives before they decide to enter a rundown or not You could also add something like difficulty stars on a mission and also when hosting a lobby allow the host to check a box that allows something like more checkpoints This would encourage more people who might have 1 hour or 2 but can't sit at a PC for 2-4 hours But again if you think this would harm the vision of your hardcore game then just stick to what has worked for you
Good game
gaem
Best co-op game that I've played in a while I've spent too many hours in this game so far and will spend more I love the stealth and the horror game style that the game has It isn't necessary that you have 4 people I've been duoing and it's working out great
This game is like deep rock galactic if it was an adventure involving the psychological torture devices you once called friends Imagine a haunted house but everybody is armed and the decorations are trying to fellate you from 20 feet away That's this game and it's great
bom demais esse jogo
some say that when a horror game gives you guns it becomes less scary in this game it becomes even more scary when you have to use your guns
if u like cbt this game is for u 100 recommend

One of the most controversial games I've ever played It's suffocating with its barrier to entry and the need to have friends who want to suffer as much as you do But it's still a lot of fun at times
AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
GOATED
Amazing game Good with friends only with good friends tho
Extremely difficult but a lot of fun if playing with friends
This game is hard,but really good If you play it strategically with a plan,you'll have better time than going gun blazing yolo and eventually being quite,very dead The ambiance is just amazing,the tension is there gripping you hard,the guns feel nice with that umpf",the moments of fighting can get very intense and you only need one single moment to get your entire mission screwed and back to 0 The multiple updates the devs did to improve the game gave it such QOLI
my husband pounded me while playing this 10/10

Game is great and I love it hope they will come back to it to fix some gamebreaking bugs even if it's finished tho
pretty difficult but the atmosphere is amazing incredibly gripping and intense due to the scarcity of resources combine that with alarm doors where stealth is no longer an option and that's GTFO
I've never wanted to strangle those closest to me more then when playing this game 10/10
Este juego es muy bueno pero no tengo amigos para jugar c
Por ahora solo jugue por 2 horas al momento de hacer la lo jugue hace con la cuenta de una ex pareja y solo puedo decir este juego es como la miel desde que salio no ah empeorado en nada una atmosfera hyper opresiva que te mantiene en alta tension constantemente debido a los escasos recursos de todo tipo contando con modificadores que hacen un poco mas amable la experiencia a cambio de ser consumibles de una vez tienes que prestar especial atencion a tu entorno para no morir a los 10 minutos de iniciar la run y de extra todos los enemigos son pocisionados de manera aleatoria por el rng haciendo que se sienta como que siempre cambia en conclusion 20/10 y ojala optimizaran la cinematica in game del decenso

otimo
its fun and difficult stealth is your greatest friend in this game
Its a great game to play with your 3 loser friends where you HAVE to work together or forever be stuck at levels for-EVER
Jogo muito bom mesmo recomendo a compra apenas se tiver amigos para jogar Devido a dificuldade do jogo fazer sozinho ao menos que seja o mago merlim dos jogos Eu apenas recomendaria para futuros updates se houver melhorar a qualidade da IA dos bots bizarro o quanto eles burros e ruins de mira poderia adicionar um ping para trocar de pack caso queira levar algum em porque tem momentos em que todos levam um medipack ai o jogo fica mais do que era pra ser
I wanna play it more but one of my friends got addicted to osrs
Best game ever If I ever beat this game I will put it on my CV
Si
WORK TOGETHER OR DIE TOGETHER Questo il motto principale del gioco secondo gli sviluppatori che un motto una regola il gioco veramente punitivo se si smette di collaborare per raggiungere l'obbiettivo Ma quando tutto va secondo i piani il gioco appagante a cui io abbia mai giocato Da giocare con i soliti 2/3 amici con cui si hanno tante ore sul groppo e una buona intesa Semplicemente stupendo
Salid cagando ostias el videojuego me hizo insultar a los bots
Jogo pena que tenho amigos pra jogar

Alt tabbing/any amount of other screens/resolutions/windows being simultaneously used causes lots of issues incredibly annoying Also enemy AI is schizophrenic and makes me wanna pull my hair Otherwise cool game tho 8/10
this game is kinda hard alone unless you're one of my friends who play this game a lot or adapt quickly to it juice and zeraden
This game is kinda hard I guess
Unfinished game all players screams are the same could not differentiate who's screaming and where Poor melee design and no way to test the weapons before actually playing with each one Oh and bad design of injury moment no way to tell you you're getting hit update bot is so stupid that he'll shot enemies through you doing FF glowing sticks are useless they are barely visible and stop lightning in short time no way to pause the game or go AFK if a player need to take a short break no way to resume the game progress if master went offline for few moments you are basically forced to start over
Try to survive get downed 100 times and finally complete the level great game would recommend

is a hardcore cooperative first-person shooter that puts players in an unforgiving and atmospheric world Developed by 10 Chambers this game is not for the faint of heart demanding precision teamwork and nerves of steel a brutal yet rewarding experience for those willing to dive into its depths Gameplay GTFO thrusts players into the role of prisoners forced to undertake dangerous missions in a subterranean complex teeming with horrifying creatures Each expedition involves gathering objectives navigating through dark corridors and surviving overwhelming odds The gameplay focuses on tactical coordination resource management and stealth Stealth is essential the enemies known as Sleepers react to noise and movement meaning one wrong move can turn a quiet exploration into a desperate fight for survival The balance between calm and chaos creates a constant sense of tension Combat is deliberate and brutal Ammunition is scarce so every shot counts The variety of tools like trip mines foam launchers and scanners adds layers of strategy to each encounter Atmosphere and Visuals The atmosphere is oppressive and terrifying with dim lighting eerie soundscapes and grotesque enemy designs The industrial environments are meticulously crafted evoking a sense of dread and isolation Flashlights and glow sticks become your best friends as you navigate the claustrophobic levels The visual presentation complements the tone perfectly The low-lit foggy corridors and unsettling creature animations create a sense of unease that lingers throughout Multiplayer and Teamwork GTFO is a game that thrives on communication and teamwork Playing with a coordinated team is essential as each mission requires roles to be assigned and strategies to be discussed The game has no solo mode and even with bots surviving without a well-synced squad is nearly impossible The built-in voice communication system and map tools help teams plan their approach but the game punishes players who fail to work together Success feels earned and victories are incredibly satisfying Difficulty and Learning Curve The difficulty is one of its defining features little hand-holding and newcomers may feel overwhelmed Each mission is procedurally generated and can take upwards of an hour to complete Failure is frequent but for those who enjoy a challenge part of the appeal However the steep learning curve and difficulty may deter casual players This is a game designed for those who enjoy trial and error and revel in overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds Final Verdict GTFO is not a game for everyone but for players who enjoy intense strategic co-op experiences a gem Its terrifying atmosphere challenging gameplay and reliance on teamwork make it a standout title in the survival FPS genre Be prepared for frustration exhilaration and a sense of accomplishment that few games offer Rating 8.5/10 A relentless terrifying co-op experience that rewards the brave and punishes the unprepared
Use the discord server if you want to find a game I can't stress this enough majority of the community uses it
they have butt fungus and its really gross
Insanely difficult but rewarding and hella more fun with friends if u got some lol
Work together or die in rigatoni

If you love suffering buy this game

GTFO is stands as this G Get T The F Fu*K O Out And make sure to do that ALIVE But honestly tho it's a Fun game but I recommend you to play it with your friends as for Me I didn't played it well because I don't have anyone to play this game with so yeah

An apt reminder to buy games on steam so that you can make use of their generous refund policy
its good asf
too easy
Really fun game if you like difficult games and have friends to play with
The main problem is the way this game is advertised as according to video trailers and screenshots it's a fun co-operative zombie shooter but in reality it's a strategy game where you have to spend time searching for lobbies in the official Discord channel

I don't like how I have to use the Discord server to get connected into a server Since whenever I use the games matchmaking feature it takes like 5 minutes some times to get connected into a server The gameplay felt very repetitive after playing through some levels I'll admit the atmosphere and monsters made me get some shivers up my spine but that's the only positives I can find about this game
obra de arte
I like the game but R2D2 is the worst scenario ever Buggy and not fun
BEST TACTICAL HORROR SHOOTER
Nice game to play with friends
too easy
100
This game is not for run-n-gun speedrun type of gamers It requires teamwork strategy and better munition management as they are pretty scarce when go for a rundown
fun but challenging
Mmmmm yes Pain
muito bom
nice game 1 hour per mission very irritating game but cool at the same time rage quit 10000 caution can give brain damage
wox compact
horrid gameplay and terrible controls make for an overall bad experience
Pretty fun if you like stealth games

jogo dms n passei da primeira com os amigos
three friends required but otherwise really fun and difficult
If you're playing solo like I do make sure you hold Q then hit one this will allow you to set the turrets for the bots
now if only I had friends to play with But seriously you can't get far in a solo run This game is just so challenging yet fun to play

only pain and suffer if you like to get fk in the game highly recommended to you
This game is very good with friends The art style and atmosphere of the game is done very well However it has a learning curve which is not explained too well in game The game has a focus on stealth and resource management The game is not for everyone but I can highly recommend it to people which are not afraid to fail some missions and are looking for a challenging game to tackle with friends
Hard rewarding team based stealth game
Very very difficult game first 3 hours in this game all to complete 1 mission.in which we failed
Fofo e Para melhor experiencia recomendo jogar solo
You're going to suffer like a son of a bitch so that in the end they don't show you fucking shit just the credits
I tried to play on my i do not recommend good game but no friends to play with
GEILO
one of the hardest Games hope you still have friends when you are finished
poke
GTFO is basically the feeling of poking a bruise made into a game It hurts but you like it It's a brutal game at times with limited resources and the potential for enemies to overwhelm you But working together with your friends to complete expeditions is extremely rewarding And yes you need friends to play this with All bots or solo isn't a good experience The two main playstyles stealth and loud are both nicely fleshed out and with the strategising that this game requires they mesh nicely into each other The atmosphere is really well designed the music is awesome shoutout to Simon Viklund for that Note you will probably swear and get angry at your friends but that's okay Chances are they deserve it P.S PICK UP YOUR DEPLOYABLES
Finding three friends who are willing to play this game with you is much harder than the game itself You probably won't enjoy playing it again maybe you will The choice is yours
Preciso de ajuda
Keywords Fun and challenging and unforgiving Details This game is so much fun whether you play solo with bots or with friends There is always so little room for error or you'll die Not your typical FPS shooter game If you like games with a bit of a challenge this game is for you because all the levels are challenges on their own without even keeping track of the objectives This game is unforgiving for those who want to play around and still beat it Their own moto states enough Live together or die together I highly recommand GTFO BUT there is a HUGE learning curve
Played this game with friends EACH MISSION takes 1-2hours some take even more than that NO rewarding feeling whatsoever no progression system VERY repetitive ONLY played this because friends wanted to spend time together it got to a bs point around rundown 2 if you wanna save your precious time you have other than work DO NOT PLAY THIS
The game is too bland same encounters same missions no progression no weapon attachments no nothing You are just doing the same stuff over and over The worst part is that each missions takes around 2 hours to complete Stupid
Was or I mean is scary would play again
I unfortunately do not have any friends to play this game with but thankfully it has bot support Starting on Rundown 1 I was able to beat the first level and nearly complete the second level within 4 hours I'm hoping to dump many more hours into this game and would love to get a friend group to truly play this game correctly but for now bots will do
Took us 3 hours or so to complete just the first mission im going to kill myself because HAZNOODLE kept alerting the guards like cayo perico heist on gtaV
it took me 6 hours to complete 1 mission 10/10
Amazing game I honestly love strategy games and would recommend to people looking for a strategy horror shooter
im going to kill myself
good
Good game
So fresh
muy gtfo
I feel like I should like this game more than I do would probably be a lot more fun with a group that plays a bit more tactically absolutely gorgeous
get out
teehee fun scary game dauda my beloved 3 i don't know the lore my friend tells me he's done fucked up shit but oh well
Gtfo R2C1
Cara pode comprar esse jogo se vc de jogos de tiro e cooperativo realmente GTFO um game onde voce um e muito menos um super soldado vc se sente como jogando Dark Souls pela primeira vez completamente perdido e com bastantes inimigos furiosos qualquer erro pode ser fatal Mas a desse jogo mora ai longe vc para descobrir o que acontecendo As fases ficando cada vez mais bizarras realmente assombroso o sentimento de medo nunca te abandona aqui Recomendo demais Obs liguem para essas reviews negativas onde o cara fala um monte de palavra bonita pra se parecer culto mas no fim mais um Casual que n tem dedo pra jogos e culpa o jogo a falta de dele e possui 20 min de tempo de jogo
Great Game Good Stealth Bulls**t Monsters Good Mechincs And Anyone That Dislikes This Masterpiece Is Coping Cuz They Can't Clear A Mission
hard as
Crazy good Beating every level is rewarding as hell
This is one of if not my favorite game of all time so my review may seem a bit biased This game will pump you full of fear and adrenaline and then beat you down so hard that you get back up so it can do it again You go in you die you learn you repeat It can be very challenging and often you'll find yourself staring at a death screen with your squad mates talking about what kit changes to make or ways to better approach the level to survive next time While it can look and feel fairly intimidating at first the learning curve for the gameplay isn't as steep as it seems at first you just need a good teacher The official Discord is a good place to LFG and/or look for someone to show you the ropes if you're new The story is hard to follow at first but is very deep and interesting once you get into it The environment is amazing and is all around one of the coolest settings I've experienced especially in the later Rundowns Though it isn't without some flaws and if youre a solo player you may that as this is a game designed for team play it can be rough for solo players out here but there are several options available to them For those rare few with the dedication soloing the base game is possible even without the use of the in game bots from what i understand but is a Herculian task in the later levels There are mods to help solos though such as rundowns designed with solo players in mind and mods that improve the bots/give you more control over them should you wish to use them and run the main game TlDr Id say that if you like a challenge and enjoy hardcore team based FPS games that combine stealth with action you should absolutely give this game a try And if youre a solo player you should do some deeper digging first and see if the solo is your speed
Super schwer ABER ein SUPER Spiel und das Prinzip dahinter ist einfach toll Ich hasse meine Mates die immer alle Viecher aufwecken
cool
oh my days
Es la mayor tortura a la que me he sometido me encanta recomendado
good game
Although I haven't played this game as much this game was really awesome to stream and connect with life long new friends I definitely recommend trying this out even though this game is difficult like a souls game with guns and the horror aspect is actually peak they did a really great job on making a horror game Kudos developers just beware of one thing though do not expect to connect with just english speakers sometimes you will connect to Asia and other continents that might not speak english so there will be more than just the game itself as a challenge but a language barrier too you've been warned Also play with friends or a group of 3 or 4 you will not survive with less
Super atmospheric really hard but fun it's a great feeling when you finally finish a level Brutally hard though and pretty much realistically unplayable without a group of 4

a lot of fun to have with the boys
Un juegazo pensado para jugar con gente y dificultad considerable El gameplay esta muy bien planteado con el sigilo y el mezclado con momentos de disparos cada requiere si no quieres morir o perder valiosa Los escenarios a veces se repiten pero como esta tan bien representada la ni inporta no es que se repitan pero si son similares en al final muchos son en bases subterraneas Un juego bastante de nicho pero si te mola el estilo vale la pena probarlo Va considerablemente bien de rendimiento a mi me va de locos con una 3060ti en 4k Si lo vas a jugar solo no lo recomiendo a no ser que te guste sufrir mucho
I like it

a game about getting out of somewhere i think idk
who ever you are don't take mistake to play this game if you not want to try about super duper skibidi hard game ever but i recomend it to you if your hardcore player
a bit easy for my tastes GTFO is a hardcore cooperative survival horror game that puts players in a high-stakes dark environment requiring teamwork strategy and precise execution to survive waves of enemies While GTFO initially gained a reputation for its punishing difficulty in recent updates and with the evolution of the mechanics it has become arguably too easy for experienced players The primary reasons for this shift in difficulty include the game's excessive reliance on repetitive mechanics the reduced impact of procedural generation the ease of coordination in cooperative play and the current balance of enemies and resources which all contribute to a less challenging experience for seasoned players First the game's reliance on repetitive mechanics has contributed to a sense of predictability that diminishes the challenge Early on GTFO was known for its punishing tactical gameplay where players had to carefully sneak through areas to avoid alerting hordes of enemies However over time the game's mechanics have become more predictable with players often able to memorize enemy spawn locations room layouts and necessary actions to complete each level While this predictability may have initially been an advantage for players trying to master the game it has resulted in a loss of excitement and tension that once made the game feel difficult As players become more familiar with the scenarios the challenge of outsmarting the AI or surviving the randomly generated environments has been replaced with a repetitive cycle of known solutions Additionally GTFO's procedural generation a hallmark of its design has become less effective at increasing difficulty Procedurally generated content should create a sense of unpredictability but in recent updates the system appears to have grown more formulaic Players can often predict enemy placements level layouts and resource distributions with startling accuracy which erodes the thrill of exploration and challenge This lack of true randomness makes the game feel less dangerous as players can often approach each level with a sense of confidence knowing what to expect While earlier versions of GTFO left players in the dark constantly facing new unexpected challenges the current procedural generation does not create the same level of uncertainty which reduces the game's overall difficulty Cooperative play a core feature of GTFO also has shifted in a way that makes the game easier The mechanics that govern as coordinating stealth splitting up tasks and covering each other during still vital but have become less complex and easier to execute This is largely due to improvements in player communication systems and the introduction of more forgiving mechanics for both combat and exploration While this has made the game more accessible for casual players it has also watered down the difficulty for more experienced teams Where once players needed to communicate flawlessly under pressure the reduced difficulty in later levels makes it easier for teams to execute basic strategies with little risk of failure Finally the balance of enemies and resources has been tweaked in such a way that survival becomes more manageable even in high-stress situations The game's enemies though numerous and relentless often feel less dangerous than they once did This is due in part to changes in enemy AI and the addition of more powerful weapons and tools that make combat encounters less threatening Players are often given ample resources and ammunition making it easier to overcome the challenges of each level The pacing has also shifted with less emphasis on tension-building moments and more focus on action-oriented gameplay While this might appeal to players who prefer a faster pace it takes away from the initial feeling of dread and vulnerability that made it so compelling In conclusion GTFO has evolved from a game of intense difficulty and brutal survival into one that feels more manageable even for less experienced players The reliance on repetitive mechanics the decline in true procedural randomness the simplification of cooperative play and the balance shift in enemies and resources all contribute to a game that while still challenging no longer maintains the same level of difficulty that originally defined it For players seeking a true test of skill and endurance GTFO no longer provides the same sense of danger and dread which ultimately makes the game feel too easy
yes
way to expensive for what it is
my favorite part was when john prisoner said we need to GTFO and GTFOed all over the place
Cant even save the game and the average game lasts 2-3 hours Amazingly bad if you have a life DO NOT RECOMMEND
Atmospheric af great weapon design those reticles gahdaamn VA is great too I felt like I was going thru an Umbrella Labs wing on a Saturday night Nothing more british than bonking aliens in the head with a baton to secure a foreign land 10/10
I love hearing my friends scream 3 also its all so detailed and teaches you how the game works nicely

GTFO is best described as a game that is fun to suck at The basic premise is you and three other characters or players make your way through a level to accomplish objectives It a unique concept but the manner in which it is executed makes it different than similar games like 4 and While most games like this encourage you to fight your way through hordes of enemies this game seems to reward you for sneaking by the hordes of enemies Granted there are times where a fight is inevitable but if you gotten into too many fights before this time you should have enough ammunition and health to be successful The games dark fog filled levels add levels of unpredictability as you try to creep around without waking up the enemies that are scattered around in resting states They only really attack you if you make noise shine lights on them or attack them at the wrong time Amongst these groups of enemies are occasional special monsters scattered in between Navigating around all these enemies to gather ammunition and mission critical objectives with very little clues on how to find things makes it a very pulse pounding experience not to say finding items is impossible however Real world common sense is required for a lot of the level navigation which in itself is really neat For example you may know that you have to go through a door into you look at the doors which are marked with various numbers and letters and figure out where section 7a is You can even use various computers and consoles around to ping objects to show up for other players and to do even that you utilize real world typing When accessing a computer a computer prompt with player typed inputs are the way to access the information a player has to type various commands to get the results and even to access these commands they can type help or something of that nature it is a nice little immersive aspect The game itself is very unforgiving however and for a lot of players they will find themselves restarting over and over as various playthroughs can go very bad very quick If you take it too seriously you might find yourself getting frustrated as an enemy detects you without any reason or a player accidentally walks into a giant detection enemy There also is an interesting story that plays out through the various console entries and such While the scifi horror aspect is a really cool to me I find myself motivated enough to dig too far into the lore as I tried to just make it through whatever missions I could
es como jugar con la nintendo a los 8 a las 4 de la intentando que tus padres no te pillen
Very challenging game keeps the heart pumping approved heh
Lots of variety when it comes to strategy and interacting with the environment I know for some it can be difficult to understand the format for game-play but this game has a lot of options and opportunity to strategize if you're smart enough For this type of game it's balanced enough that you don't need a lot of progression the enemies are just hard enough to maintain a challenge and the weapons are balanced enough that you can control combat flow with a little planning I love the simple format that doesn't complicate things especially for new or inexperienced players who can't understand the items or how they affect the environment All in all great game and is fun to play with friends so long as they can keep quiet
big guy here
es un juego en le que en el trailer sale que es un juegaso y despues es la mayor mierda que he probado en esta vida pido un rembolso por esta mierda de videojuego.gracias

Game started very unforgiving and kinda boring 2021/22 The time given to provide huge updates to the game has definitely paid off Kudos A company that makes a game better than it was on or near release
This game is not for the faint of heart or those looking for participation award(s You will work for every win for the likely several failures and level restarts that come before it This game will test you and your crew on communication strategy and teamwork This isn't a run and gun game you will want to go quietly as possible to avoid a firefight and use up your precious limited ammo no more than 5-7 clips/reloads per gun and save life Even then they throw curve balls at you If you have a few friends who are looking for a game to hop in to and are willing to learn and progress slowly levels can take 30m-2h and we're only through the second Rundown has 11 levels in it and it's been nothing but fun There are 8 Rundowns total which each Rundown having 6-11 levels each with each higher Rundown being harder Bring your A game

Very niiice
Best Game I suck at
get helldivers 2 payday 2 or Deep rock galactic instead much more customization and also not walking around for 20 minutes then fighting 2 minutes stealth is extremely bland and theres no progression
shoot pew pew scary aaa
you would not believe how exciting this gameplay is
Repetitive Trash 2 hour long missions with no checkpoints Game leaves you in a malaise in 30 minutes each session Would Refund if possible
awesome

Pretty Awesome
Great game feels pretty good all around I've been playing with one person so it's very difficult But it's also just a great team-building exercise aka much communication is needed We've both been enjoying it a lot
This game is good for double date events

I fell off some stairs and got stuck between them and a pipe I was not able to get out quitting the game and rejoining just sent me back to the stair gap

super chill game
Docile bots or naughty teammates Lmfao what does a dead man have to say about this
i hate my friends D
I had fun playing though it was with Bots It's kinda like Ready or Not on that level ig The friends that I had who got this game fell into 2 groups A Game was too difficult so they gave up B They became busy I played this game alone the normal ai for the bots is atrocious it's very questionable However if you add an AI mod it is playable by yourself you can even 100 the game Overall it's a nice game to play while watching something I finished the game while finishing Grey's Anatomy solid 7/10 0-0)b
are too Leif 2024 colorized My friend left me to play a different game 11/10
dis pretty heat
The most extreme game that will test yours and your friends teamwork patience and will You will fail the rundowns many times but the feeling of finally prevailing them cannot be compared to any other game Of course buy this game with 3 of your friends who are willing to commit to this painful and rewarding experience
I don't like this game but I feel like I am just playing it wrong Done a few missions with a friend and is this it Just walking into rooms killing the same 3 types of enemies over and over again Please tell me if I am doing something wrong
i your mentally unstable play this game
game is good

This broken game is shit.,Mission guidance is terrible.,Blame is also anti-human.,Bugs are constant.,It's hard to describe the torture experience that this game brought me in human language
Se avessi saputo prima a cosa andavo in contro non lo avrei acquistato Presumendo che un buon titolo metto la recensione negativa non sostenibile e troppo frustrante per i miei tempi e impegni Avendo solo poche ore per poter giocare e ancora meno per riuscire ad organizzarmi con un paio di amici questo gioco non proprio indicato Quelle poche volte che riusciamo ad organizzarci ci siam trovati a dover sbattere la testa contro un muro e dover buttare ore e ore a ripetere le stesse missioni Vedendo cosi diverse serate sfumare nella totale insoddisfazione collettiva e conseguente perdita di tempo Essendo la mia squadra fatta tutta di lavoratori non abbiamo la di sprecare tutto questo tempo con poco ritorno Basta un errore una distrazione o il bot che da di matto e bumme 2 ore di gioco buttate al vento e nulla di concreto tra le mani che rimbomba nel silenzio di microfoni che vorrebbero solo imprecare Ci abbiamo tentato per 23 ore non capisco la presa di posizione dei developer di non venire in contro ai giocatori nella mia situazione ed inserire easy mode o come vogliano chiamarla insomma qualche checkpoint visto che una meccanica presente nel gioco Mi spiace perche non avrei altro di cui lamentarmi Ma a tornare indietro non lo avrei dovuto comprare Tl;Dr Non lo consiglio a chi ha poco tempo pazienza e pochi amici con la stessa problematica
alrught not rlly for me

This game is if dungeoneering from RuneScape 3 was a first person shooter with zombies
pain
O game muito imersivo realmente sente que esta no ambiente e que qualquer erro bobo pode custar a vida da equipe infelizmente os bots parecem a artificial da Sheva do RE5 Ve o inimigo e fuzila gastando a como se fosse agua o melhor jeito de jogar no full multiplayer com mais 3 pessoas separando as distintas do game para que possam sobreviver melhor no ambiente
cant have a lobby by yourself without bots an the bots all just shout an shoot an kill you so realistically if you dont have 3 people to play with an the ability to set up your lobby within about 5 minutes before it resets the lobby you cant play the game successfully the bots literally shout an shoot within the first 2 seconds of landing Second time purchasing thought maybe it would be sorted out by now but its not really wish the game wasnt like this or even had the option to shut off the trash bots that literally have nothing better to do then to shout ingame an cause the enemy to be attracted to you or shoot while you an the other none bots are crouched trying to quietly do things game play wouldnt be bad if you have 3 people to play with an the lobby didnt auto reset after 5 minutes an inv randoms or fill with bots again took us 15 minutes just to get into a game with the 2 of us everytime we almost got into game it would throw 1 of us out an refresh the lobby while leaving the other on main menu

i enjoy the game becuse i like a littel horer and this game give me that
Another good game to play with just friends Solo is fun too but not as good walkin around and getting caught fighting thousands of alien zombies then yelling at each other to blame whos fault it is was that woke em up and now you are out of ammo and health and all hope is lost This is a game of learning from your experiences YOU WILL DIE

The TUTORIAL ALONE made me sh!t myself This game does its job well Not a game to play alone unless youre a super soldier or a nutjob
quite a b]hard game[/b if you are just starting out and will take you hours to actually get the basics if you dont have someone helping you out with more i]skill.[/i for the most part the game just drops you expecting you to know the enemy types and how to deal with them but tldr the overall learning process is you fail and you learn so for this i would recommend either getting some friends together or play with pubs/randos on the gtfo discord mm is bad dont use it unless you want hackers whom are quite friendly the ambience and overall style of the game is great with bright lights in dark environments on the other hand the story/lore is quite rushed where the i]true[/i story doesnt start until really later on furthermore the lore are mostly up to environmental story telling and you must specifically search for them to read up about them plus the devs basically speed ran the last part of the game to end it there so they can dedicate their efforts on dow in terms of production readiness of a game definitely isnt bug free quite a lot of bugs especially big memory leak issues that can end a 3 hr run good game not worth 30 but give it a try when its on discount

The first level is way too hard and has a terrible learning curve but helps you get an idea of how much lube you need to bring for the following levels It's a good time with friends but be prepared to take everything very slow and plan out each move
NOW This is a hell of a game we lost ALL 6 INITIAL RUN And it was still damn fun Also i wholly appreciate the mature approach to both the design of the game and the theme We need a lot more of that in current gaming
God Tier
Fun with friends Can be fun solo but understand the game is not designed around that

This game is sadly only really playable with others Ive become very addicted to the lore and story of GTFO The only way to actually get hard facts and info in game is by taking it slow and exploring Some missions this is hard to do on because you have a timer limit or waves of infected sleepers are rushing you This is not a problem The real problem is this game requires coop to actually be able to complete the game Which most people are trying to rush the game and/or are veterans whom just expect you to know what you are doing You can solo and play with 3 bots but the bots have poor combat skills leaving you hopeless to complete higher tier levels I really wish this game was more single player friendly Its super annoying to have to try find people to play this game with Other than the issues Ive have stated the game is amazing It could be better But you have this feeling of purpose even though your character is being forced against there will to deal with every objective When you are going through the complexes of runs you have many computers in the zones of the runs Which allow you to search for items and or find logs the give you information about what may be happening in the story It feels like you are following a bread crumb trail If you follow along and think critically with an open mind the bread crumbs lead up to something spicy I would give this game a better rating but Im going to have to give it a 5.5 10 due to basically being required to play with others If they would somehow up the AI teammates ability in combat this game would be alot better HONESTLY if you dont mind playing with randoms over and over until you find some good GTFO players you could get this game and join the discord There is a pretty great group of people playing this game I did try it I met some cool people But I do not like playing with random people and or meeting new people on discord If I did like meeting new people this game would be an 8.5 10 So if you don't mind using discord and meeting new people I highly suggest getting this game
Boring and slow game designed exclusively for playing with 4 friends
Did not enjoy a single minute in this game It is just not fun or interesting at all You are not supposed to kill stuff i get it But the whole riddle solving is stupid You got to write obscure codes into terminals to do stuff It is just not fun I really regret buying this and not being able to refund it
Fun engaging and difficult Definitely a challenge but lacks a bit of progression

This game only gives you pain and also has repetitive gameplay
Do not play this game This game is not easy This game is not fast You will die you will fail it will not always be your fault You will be forced to rely on your teammates or become good enough not to need them at all Very few people still play this game so finding a team will be difficult but not impossible beating this game without a team and a damn good one is nigh impossible I beat this game it took a village and an age If you really want this hardcore experience you'll buy the game anyways and you will probably enjoy the grueling climb to the finish The rewarding feeling for completing the game is not something you'll find anywhere else like this game has to offer a sense of achievement for overcoming this senseless onslaught of brutality dragged out over countless slogs of levels A victory well earned But if you're not sure you want to invest that kind of time into a game if you don't want to gamble your success and hours out of your day on the competence cooperation and altruism of 3 random strangers don't buy this game You will not finish it and I very much doubt you will ever come to enjoy this game and if you have these doubts I urge you do not buy this game
Absolutely love this game Best coop fun in years for me Looks very good runs very good so far it's bug free

Very fun but i do suggest joining the discord if you don't have friends since playing in matchmaking is extremely difficult and the phrase work together or die together can't be more true
GTFO is a game I never would have picked up if I hadn't found some cool people to play with online If you have a consistent group of 3 or more this game is an absolute blast However rolling with me myself and I will result in a frustrating and short-lived experience There are many things to love about this game The atmosphere is fantastic The enemies guns and environment are very detailed When you first start the game it feels very tense and will immediately give you an immersive feel After a few missions the tension tends to die down and you become confident in your bonking and knifing skills though For an indie game the visuals and audio are quite stunning and worth the experience In terms of gameplay mechanics its quite simple Slowly clear rooms as carefully as you can and start blasting once something wakes up Open up alarm doors and wait for reactors to start up Despite the simplicity of retrieving samples or delivering batteries the experience hasn't dulled even after 40 hours With the different bioms slow incorporation of varied enemy types and the panicked fun of friends screaming and yelling when a room wakes up GTFO has many many hours of fun to offer At the time of this review my friends and I are about 12 missions in out of a total of 80 or so A word of caution this game is hard My friends and I are all confident in FPS games and have gotten overwhelmed numerous times It's not just about your ability to click on heads Resources are scarce your ability to read and room strategize and funnel enemies are all pivotal skills Additionally being able to pace yourself and determine when you should sneak past a sleeping room rather than engaging is also pivotal There are a few negative elements that are worth mentioning This is not a single player game though you have the ability to play it solo If you do not have a full squad of 4 there is the option to have up to 3 bots to assist you These bots can lay down turrets use resources and items when commanded However that's about the extent of the AI It is a struggle to beat even the first mission with three bots as there is no difficulty scaling in menu or based on the number of players The difficulty is what it is and you need to overcome With that being said if you don't have at least two other people to consistently play with I'd recommend passing on GTFO The other negatives are relatively minor Some minor bugs have occurred nothing game breaking My greatest complaint is the lack of checkpoints It depends on the mission but many of them do not have any checkpoints If you die you go back to the mission select screen Some of these levels can be 2 hours long with the risk of dying at the extraction point Depending on your schedule this can mean you have one good attempt on a level before you or a friend needs to leave for the evening The last negative I'll list is the lack of a progression system Except for consumables you have all resources at the start of the game No new guns or equipment unlock as you progress You are rewarded with cosmetics though for finishing a level which is still fun In conclusion if you have friends who are interested in playing this game with you pick it up and have a blast Be warned the game won't hold your hand and you will struggle your way through the first few missions Once you start getting the hang of things you'll start getting the easier and even medium missions on your first try Be ready for a challenge and enjoy the satisfaction of overcoming all the craziness and surprises that GTFO throws at you With Friends 8.5/10 Without Friends 3/10 as most missions won't be possible to complete
Don't skip the tutorial also I recommend playing with friends

GTFO es un juego cooperativo que por puede ser demasiado complicado pero es muy entretenido Donde el sigilo y el trabajo en equipo juegan un papel importante ya que la de las rundowns demandan mucho tiempo y el error que cometas estas al horno con fritas jaja En fin este juego lo recomiendo para jugar con amigos ya que es mejor y es conveniente jugar con PD bueno que sacaran una 2da entrega de este juego jaja 8/10

It is just a bland and soulless game There is nothing in this game that is unique or original other shooters on the market do this better

AAAAAAAAAA
ass
DISCRETION I have 2 other friends sometimes just 1 who I have to play this game I hear the matchmaking is slow due to the playercount but the Discord is very active with a Looking-For-Games channel So I don't have experience with this game as a solo The game is exceptionally harder alone but has bot support and I've heard they're very good I'm just too proud to use them Moving on GTFO is evergreen In 2024 when AA and AAA games broadly fall into specific buckets of traditions and conventions GTFO sends a piercing shot through the soul-sucking machinery of Battle Royales Extraction Shooters PvPvE experiences and traditional Multiplayer arena games There is no padding There are no truly wasted parts of the game or the player and very few that go underused In that way GTFO is uniquely efficient To quote Luke Winkie who wrote IGN's review of the game Games have become increasingly streamlined but GTFO is a loud proud step in the reverse direction In other words GTFO is tightly designed It immediately reminds me of Left 4 Dead 2 and doesn't let up for a second There are no loose ends no hanging threads no elements or features that beg me to ask why is this in the game Everything relates to everything Part of this comes from how simple the sandbox is and while many games can be boiled down to it there's a distinct lack of overlap a lack of crowding on the part of the equipment and the enemies It is intensely refreshing Imagine a slower-paced Left 4 Dead 2 set to Expert mode Have you ever started a campaign and thought man wouldn't it be cool if I could stealth-kill all these idling zombies without a horde coming down on me like as a challenge GTFO is literally that idea as a good game It's as good as it gets GTFO brings out elements of a first person shooter I haven't seen pulled since Halo Weapons are balanced around more than their numbers the real estate each gun takes on your screen the sway and design of its optics the loudness of its firing are presented so immediately and understandably to you that it's hypnotic GTFO manages to straddle the line between arcade run-and-gun and military-sim You may not have to hold F and then press F2 to take a magazine out and reload it but you definitely have to respect your weapon's physicality and behavior I severely wish we had this approach in other shooters GTFO has an enormous amount of confidence in itself for giving you all the tools right out of the gate Every single one How many AA/AAA shooters do this The Finals Helldivers 2 Call of Duty All have some sort of arbitrary restriction on your playstyle a restriction that can only be interpreted as padding You do not grind this game just for more toys or to finally get the gun that plays how you wanted to in the first place Its a design choice that prompts one to ask why they play If you find that you enjoy the gameplay loop you will likely find a reason to keep pushing For me it's the level designs and its strength within a hyper specific sub-genre In a game that is explicitly a dungeon-crawling stealth-action rouge-like horde shooter one would expect to eventually see the pattern of how assets are reused you may notice the same staircase connecting to a different place on a different play-through for instance and that can take all the wind out of your experience GTFO does have this after enough retries on the same level but every single one has its own architectural not to mention aesthetic gimmicks that expertly utilizes the hodge-podge of reused toolboxes lockers and tunnels in a way that reinvigorates whats become stale again and again I kid you not GTFO sits very proudly on the throne of a very specific subgenre dungeon-crawling rougelike FPS Though it has elements from the first two tags GTFO is unabashedly a First Person Shooter All of the best aspects of the game all of the focus is of the same strategies puzzles and challenges of a typical shooter The enemies feel fun to shoot and are balanced in ways that are both fair and utterly refreshing in the current slew of popular shooters especially PVE ones For a game about zombies I've often found myself dancing on my keyboard and using cover to avoid ranged attacks while frantically searching my crosshair to places I've never looked at before Shooters can boil down to aiming a crosshair at the same spots in every game but this game does that and then some You really have to play it to see what I mean So if you're the type of player who plays A LOT of shooters and wants to experience a tactical dungeon-crawling challenge then please trust these words Look no further This is it This is the one you want At the time of writing I've only completed three missions I have 18 hours in the game as of this writing That's at least 6 hours for each mission It is not an easy or quick romp It will frustrate and dominate you It will be scary tense and satisfying GTFO is a game that knows what it is and a game that has very clear expectations for you It is a game that understands itself and invites you to uncover its secrets and gameplay I haven't recommended a game so whole-heartedly since L4D2
nice game
Le jeu est vraiment pas jouer jsuis mais l'interface est ignoble le menu donne un mal au je vous fais un avis chaud le jeu a me donner mal la En plus pas de touche au le tuto qui donne grave pas envie les armes vomir la sensi 0.1 ce qui m'oblige jouer avec une sensi de zinzin ou je dois baisser mes dpi et tout c'est passionant Par dites moi que j'ai tords je comprends pas comment le jeu est aussi nan jm'en branle ptdr c'est au plafond
Le jeu n'est vraiment pas bon Je l'ai suite au trailer et aux avis qui donnait plutot envie mais juste l'accueil avec un menu qui donne la pire qu'un jeu VR Entre les mouvements BEAUCOUP trop et la dont c'est est vraiment horrible ensuite une fois en jeu le gameplay est vraiment pas naturel que ce soit au ou le tir avec la j ai jamais autant la dans un jeu Le HUD donne vraiment pas envie lu dommage pour un menu qui tient des infos essentiels la progression Les ennemies ne sont pas satisfaisant tuer on n'arrive meme pas savoir si ils sont morts Le de hacking est mais extremement mal Bref Un jeu qui a de bonnes mais qui est mal une si mauvaise attention au donne pas envie de la suite Dommage
GTFO attire par son concept et son ambiance mais plusieurs rendent difficile pleinement D'abord le menu mal est un ses effets de mouvement aux transitions brusques peuvent donner la Naviguer dans les options devient fastidieux surtout si vous sujet au motion sickness Sur le plan graphique c'est Les textures manquent de et loin immersif semble simpliste ce qui retire l'ambiance l'impact qu'on Le jeu visuellement et les finissent par rendre l'univers monotone Enfin la est hardcore avec une bien le jeu ne pardonne aucune erreur et n'offre pratiquement aucun checkpoint On se retrouve refaire les missions plusieurs fois ce qui devient frustrant Cette approche tout ou rien est punissante et la plupart des joueurs finiront par se lasser face cette En entre un menu qui irrite des graphismes et une trop GTFO est un jeu qui ne parvient pas trouver un pour vraiment plaisant jouer
Don't wake them They'll call their friends Amazing multiplayer experience that's challenging and consists of great level design and ambience This thing was worth the price AAA quality game

The game is difficult challenging and fun all in one If your taste is difficult games this one is for you
This game is exactly what the industry needs It's ruthless and so cool that a developer finally said I'm making a game and duck what people say about it we're making it the way we want They don't cave in to review pressure and they continue to deliver a hardcore implementation of their vision I'm only 5 hrs in and I've only gotten passed the first checkpoint We haven't even finished the first scene And I am ok with it
Il nous reste deux chargeurs La prochaine salle est remplie Il nous faut cette nous n'avons pas le choix GTFO est ce qui se fait de mieux en Si vous avez des amis avec qui jouer on tire une satisfaction terminer les campagnes par C'est un jeux qui de fait vous apprend mieux connaitre vos amis et se synchroniser avec eux d'infiltration et de run&gun les heures s'enchaine sans que l'on s'en rende compte Chaque choix doit chaque tir Alarme de classe V Il va falloir courir Les tourelles sont sec On vous mets dans la peau d'un taulard dont la vie ne vaux plus que la carte du scientifique que vous devez aller Sur vos 1eres parties vous aurez tendance chercher a la confrontation au maximum mais dans certains cas il vaux mieux vider la zone que de risquer faire une boulette qui pourrait plus couteuse en munitions car dans la panique les rafales partent alors que si un est mis en place Chaque tir fera mouche Extraction dans 50 secondes Ils arrivent Tenez bon A disposition un large panel d'arme et gadget pour terminer vos missions chacune ayant ses avantages et ses lacunes Prenons une mitrailleuse par exemple parfait pour tenir votre position en cas de horde mais se elle montrera gourmande en munition contre un colosse mais si votre a un sniper lourd le est pour le Chacun son chacun son Bordel on voit que dalle C'est pas du brouillard C'est du gaz Je vous le recommande un incontournable du FPS co-op 4
scary forced labor
A very good game that has its own spin on zombie horde gameplay where the enemies are not to be taken lightly Therefore a run and gun style is most often not the best idea Instead a stealth and melee play style is much more recommended The gun gameplay is exceptionally responsive Teamwork is pretty much mandatory Story is only found in some rare spots via audio files scattered around some levels The only problem seems to be the lack of player count whether it is by matchmaking or by looking for groups in discord as this game is pretty niche and not very welcoming to the masses of fps gamers Hardcore elements make it very easy for you to die often Unfortunately there are no difficulty options for this problem to be solved Additionally it could serve new players to have guides for the later levels with new mechanics other than those shown in the first tutorial Even new monster designs are being introduced but the surprising effect of learning by doing seems to be more important for the developers By far the best selling point other than the gun gameplay stealth aspect gets rather repetitive would be the immersive atmosphere that heavily relies on level lightings and the light on yourself If I could be able to play whenever and whatever level I want with the community then I would have played well over 100 hours but the unfortunate niche hardcore elements prevent this game to be picked up by more games around the world Very unfortunate
As a solo game the stealth aspect is fine Playing with other people you all have guns use them Its a stupid game Don't give us firearms in a sneaky game and deprive us of suppressors Very counter-intuitive

Bishop keeps shooting me in the face but the game's pretty cool yeah
A fun but challenging game that really puts your teamwork to the test and allows you to experience a horrifying atmosphere and story

h1 Geeked Up Reviews 3.75/5 h1 h3 DISCLAIMER h3 All review scores are indicative of my personal enjoyment of the game and are not meant to be taken into consideration for the quality of the reviewed game(s A negative review means I genuinely came away from a game feeling as if I had wasted my time
Das einzige Spiel das ich kenne dass Koop wirklich ernst meint Alle zusammenarbeiten um durch die Levels zu kommen Mit Bots spielbar bis zu einem gewissen Grad aber nicht wirklich sinnvoll Man braucht wenigstens einen Kumpel in der Gruppe damits spassig wird Dann aber ist es mMn aber auch auf der selben Stufe mit Dark Souls was die Genugtuung angeht wenn man ein Level oder gar einen Rundown komplett schafft Weil es eben auch so unnachgiebig ist ist es auch schwierig die passende Gruppe zu finden Frustresistenz Lernwille und auch Geduld braucht man auf jedenfall Wie eben auch in Dark Souls D Ich liebs
The game that perfectly defines the sentence Think before hit/shoot Very challenging interesting and fun with the right teammates

Amazing Game with challenging levels where you really have to think about and continously switch your equipment After 60 hours you still experience new enemies or interesting twists It makes most fun with at least 3 players in my opinion
SHHHHH.quiet sleepers.let them rest we'll find a way around Was the paraphrased last words i heard before screeching like a school girl due to an engagement gone wrong 10/10 would recommend
Es complejo pero si dominas es bien divertido en especial con amigos y eso si tienes q tener buena coordinacion por que si no pues bueno averigualo en fin no te desesperes jejeejjejejjjeejejeje
I play solo w bots cuz my friends have time to play w me and I love this game so much I love that challenge I love that action and stealth and little bit of having luck
Love this One of the most underrated tactical CoOp FPS games out there Its got a steep learning curve which I really like You will fail a lot and completing a mission feels very rewarding Its one of the best designed stealth systems I've seen so far Sound design is great which is very important for a game like this Its very immersive and will yield many sweaty hands on the edge of your seat moments Playing with bots also works astoundingly well and the in game command system is well done Tight teamwork and good communication between you and your mates is mandatory to make it out alive This is no walk in the park Great game Also no greedy devs pressuring you into buying DLCs I will have a lot of fun with this

GTFO really makes you think about almost everything Stealth ammo conserving killing what target and when do I need to open that door yet Very huge brain game that will definitely keep me coming back Be warned the AI is AWFUL For the best experience try to play with a friend or two
Love this game and its vibe however its very hard solo with just ai sometimes Very good with friends though

spaghetti code and game cannot render or load new areas effectively especially if you run a multiple monitor setup leads to lag spikes and frame drops which can be incredibly frustrating to coordinate movements set up certain items or use them properly i wish the game was better optimized it has incredible potential to be fun and the concept is very interesting along with the enemies and game-play loop i just wish the game did not run like hot garbage especially in areas with high detail or props entities lag spikes can be expected at some points but every few seconds is unplayable
buggy mess that freezes every other second

I really enjoy playing GTFO It's not for everyone and definitely not an easy or casual game But for those who enjoy working as a team taking on challenges growing and learning from your mistakes it's a great game The game has no hand holding The tutorial teaches you enough to beat the first three levels and that's about it if you go in order Once you enter into Rundown 4 you can really feel in some levels where the developers start to play tricks with their levels Adding in small things to screw you over Didn't kill all the enemies and were just planned on making a break for it Now the room ahead of you is completely awake and you're being attacked from both side Playing it slow and silently taking out only the enemies you needed to That door you just opened had a mini-boss unit in it and it auto screamed waking up the room it's in causing you to wake up the room you are in Level design is clearly intentional in every detail Even though the general building blocks were put together by a program the level routes are all pretty unique Some will have you take any approach being loud and proud or slow and steady Some levels will force you to slow down because you don't have enough ammo otherwise My favorite levels will tell you to get your ass moving as it starts with the enemies already pissed off and constantly spawning as you need to figure out where to go what to do and how to do it very quickly because you don't even start with full ammo in this game The higher tiered levels will really push you in every aspect of this game's mechanics
CACETADA
As a fan of the genre for me it was like it had a kind of Left 4 Dead vibe GTFO takes the cooperative survival formula and elevates it to a completely new level While both games share the need for intense teamwork and strategic encounters GTFO stands out with its dense atmosphere and tactical gameplay that goes beyond what other titles offer That sense of vulnerability meticulous planning and perfect team coordination is something Left 4 Dead veterans will immediately appreciate What stands out the most is its atmosphere a grim world filled with tension and an oppressive vibe that keeps you on edge at all times The level design is simply brilliant Each expedition is perfectly calibrated to push you to the limit forcing you to make tough decisions with limited resources and a constant threat lurking around every corner The enemies known as Sleepers are not just monsters to shoot demand caution and coordination One mistake can doom the entire team adding emotional weight to every step you take As for gameplay GTFO rewards patience and planning not a simple run-and-gun shooter Every weapon tool and ability serves a specific purpose and only the team that knows how to use them wisely will survive The learning curve is steep but that only makes the moments of success all the more satisfying I felt like community is full of dedicated players which raises the quality of team matches and makes cooperation crucial to progress through the game That said one area for improvement is the accessibility for new players While veterans of the genre thrive on the difficulty GTFO could benefit from more comprehensive tutorials or an introductory mode to help newcomers learn the mechanics before diving into the full challenge This small tweak could attract more players without sacrificing the game's signature intensity Ultimately if you're a fan of Left 4 Dead's style GTFO is a must-play It delivers the same cooperative adrenaline rush we love but with a more tactical focus a much darker atmosphere and a challenge that will keep you on the edge of your seat
The complex is a bigger shithole than fucking Birmingham
I love this game the Bots are not that great when it comes to shooting but outside of that they are great would love to find some teammates tho friends say its stupidly hard and question me to how I complete missions solo without Bio scanner Heatsights
good game low player counts so get friends to get it also if you wanna play it or go solo not recommended
good game
can we get to the surface
fun game and fun to play with friends Hard AF Too
i played this game
Great And Really Hard Game Def Keeping you on toes and you need to think be4 act Would i reccomend it yes
the last of us
Great game unless you have a moron with the patience of a two year old
dont sneeze
Rundown levels are repetitive for lacking different kinds of objectives Level designs are streamlined into prefixed rooms to arrange just in different order which leads to further repetition in going through the same rooms upon rooms and that takes away any possible unique story telling in the environment and memorability Because of the unrecognizable layout of each rundown levels it will make certain players lost bored or not even remember any of the levels alongside feeling no worth in coming back to re-experience them The simplification of level designs might have been done to code the ai's pathfinding easier and to allow modders to design their own levels Right out of the bat GTFO is immersive from booting it as it loads information about the player being set as a prisoner getting loaded into the cortex The atmosphere and the graphics are immersive too alongside the soundtracks The story telling is done through each following In level selection as the warden displaying minimal information allowed for the expendable prisoners objectives that follows through each rundown that kind of tells the motives of the warden and the prisoners And stored logs in the terminals of the Santonian Mining Industries some added with audio that brings the characters to life which are well done by the actors It is all done in ways that the story is not enforced into the players time away from gameplay and allowing them to seek it out on their own time and interest intrigued by the secrets laid in the whole scenario of the GTFO Players are locked to each other as the majority of the game requires team scans stripping players from allowing them to strategize in splitting their forces The gameplay revolves around combat and working towards in how to deal with it better through equipment and weapons layout of the level and enemy types With the following challenges laid bear they require the players to work together and strategize with what they can get and could think of GTFO is very punishing as it has been designed for a full team of four players and to make it challenging for them It would be acceptable to improve upon set failures if the levels weren't dragged very long to average 2 hours each attempt but most fall down to requiring even more brute force In some cases such cruelty works as it is satisfying when a strategy works in overcoming challenges Weapons and equipment varies in good enough size that don't lack in any particular or dilutes any of them Melee combat sucks as they have been coded as guns striking a dot needle into a single spot instead of various forms like slicing and wider hitbox for bigger melee weapons No matter the flaws GTFO has in variety gameplay coding missing files mismatched files corrupt texture unfinished in some overlooked stuff cut contents such as voicelines the game is fun to play with friends Mods are exceptional in everyway the main game lacks and are therefore the reason I have sunken many hours upon the mods
boring

Nice
I've heard alot from some of my friends about how difficult this game can be but it does make sense Between the endless hordes and precise timing you need to have for certain things it can be difficult I think that that is what makes it fun Constantly trying to coordinate with teammates through the chaos knowing if you barely miss or if you're off by even a couple seconds a horde will be ontop of you in moments Playing this solo is a completely different experience as well you feel constant terror as you go through because if you accidentally walk too loud no one can save you This is by far one of my favorite games I have ever played and ive barely scratched the surface

Es un juego en su especie Premia la estrategia la el trabajo en equipo y la paciencia obligando a usar el sigilo y a medir muy bien cada paso que da el equipo en todas las misiones Las armas de fuego deben ser siempre la porque la y los recursos como botiquines y recargas para torretas o minas son realmente escasos Por suerte el arsenal es variado y ofrece opciones para todas las situaciones Cuando los tiroteos llegan y porque las misiones siempre se acaban torciendo se desata el caos y el juego es pura adrenalina Los enemigos son fuertes y muy numerosos por lo que si el equipo no con cabeza puede gastar todos los recursos o peor morir en el enfrentamiento en un abrir y cerrar de ojos Los escenarios son variados en con zonas abiertas e iluminadas y otras oscuras y opresivas ofreciendo muy diversos y bien pensados obligando constantemente a los jugadores a luchar no contra los enemigos sino contra el propio entorno de maneras bastante retorcidas y siempre desafiantes aunque los mapas no cambien la de los enemigos recursos llaves etc es aleatoria lo cual hace que siempre haya cierto componente de cada vez que se inicia una Aviso GTFO no es para corazones El juego es muy hardcore y un error puede hacer que maten a todo el equipo y que la fracase teniendo que empezar de cero aunque ese sea el motivo de que completar cada sea tan enormemente gratificante Es obligatorio jugar con amigos especialmente para completar las misiones complicadas hay un discord funcionando donde se encuentra gente para jugar de todos los niveles de habilidad aunque el juego ofrece bots para rellenar el grupo que a pesar de tener luces y sombras si se saben usar correctamente lo cierto es que son bastante competentes Totalmente recomendado para valientes que busquen un
This game almost made me p o o p in my nerd throne
This is the greatest game people have never played I have only finished the First Rundown and immediately love what 10 Chambers have done so far Looking forward to what the rest of the rundowns have in store
FUN

The game feels unfinished Not enough content and variety
If you wanna lose a little bit of sanity little bit of eye sight and a little bit of iq welcome to the game you want monsters with no eyes can see the light or with no ears can hear you coming to them well what are you gonna do simple beat them to death but be careful if there more which is more common than a finding milk you should watch your area before attacking but sir isnt there weapons well my boy good luck finding a single ammo pack oh btw they have aim hack so goodluck at dodging them me and the gang hate the dauda worst ai i've seen my toaster has better ai and my toaster is an normal one you get the idea
Holy shit
If looking for a game that combines horror teamwork and the kind of difficulty that makes you question your life choices congratulations found it h3]Gameplay and Mechanics:[/h3 GTFO uses standard controls which keeps things simple The UI is non-invasive and packed with all the necessary information like ammo counts and mission objectives However sometimes the map obscures some team spec numbers a minor hiccup but it derail your mission As for the difficulty curve Brace yourself It can feel unfair especially if gunning for that sweet 100 completion The game promises to be hard as balls and it definitely wait until you encounter the dreaded Immortal h3]Story and Narrative:[/h3 Now if in it for the story know this lore necessary to survive but it can add a sprinkle of joy for those who enjoy piecing together a narrative GTFO gives you the breadcrumbs and up to you to assemble them This approach can be rewarding but it also means be searching for lore logs while trying not to get clapped by a horde of sleepers or yoinked by a snatcher a gamble and for some part of the fun After watching videos by Roanoke Gaming on the mutations url disfigurement url and url genetic variability url I found myself a bit disappointed in the actual canon lore of what the infection is However since the lore doesn't have an effect on gameplay it doesn't bother me all that can make those videos my head canon and nobody can stop me h3]Graphics and Sound:[/h3 Now get to the real visuals and sound design The atmosphere is so thick you could cut it with a knife And those blood doors more than just a mechanic a living nightmare that sends chills down your spine even after several hundred hours of gameplay The sound design is so good that practically an auditory horror show making you feel anxious every time you hear a creak or a scream And the terror you feel when you hear a Scout in a crowded room scream because you failed to kill it a whole new level of panic h3]Achievements:[/h3 GTFO skimp on achievements Most are expedition completion or story-related so earn them just by expect them to come easily Some require a level of skill that can leave you feeling like you're in over your head Standout achievements like Ultimate Efficiency and Trigger Discipline test your mettle but fun to pursue and well-designed steering clear of grindy territory h3]Value and Replayability:[/h3 At 45 GTFO delivers value for those who dive in and stay committed With no DLCs to muddy the waters you get a solid experience right out of the gate a game that rewards perseverance and with over 250 hours played I can attest that easy to get hooked Keep in mind that it caters to a specific player might not be cup of tea Those who will like it though will love it h3]Final Thoughts:[/h3 Is GTFO worth your time If you crave the adrenaline of cooperative horror and afraid of a challenge then yes This game immerses you in a world where teamwork and strategy are paramount making every mission feel intense and rewarding While the learning curve can be steep the satisfaction of overcoming the odds with friends is unparalleled With no DLCs to complicate your experience and the option to enhance gameplay with mods GTFO delivers an intense challenge for those ready to confront the horrors lurking in the dark
fucking amazing
Tootsie if you are reading this please get better at this game so that I can get thru the 3rd level This game is hard 10/10 Update No worries Gingy came and clutched to pick up the slack where Tootsie failed
esta bien bueno si te gusta el sigilo
As a multiplayer horror game this is one of the best games out there I love this game and its potential so much In fact I think that the studio should keep working on and promoting this title It has great potential

One of the hardest games I've ever played lol I'm a gamer alright I can handle difficult However this game passed the fun and challenging threshold and was simply hard as heck for no reason

Like the atmosphere and game its harder than people think
It's a very fun game My only suggestion for those who want to buy it is to make sure you have many friends to play it with
GOOD
Dont move IAM NOT MOVI AAAAAA
super
Too hard but a fun way to challenge your skills
Some of the best atmosphere i've ever seen in a game mixed with perfect stealth makes this game really fun with a full team It's brutally difficult which makes accomplishing a tough mission ever more satisfying I just wish that it was possible to place resource packs into lockers freely It's main downfall is the inability to play without bots only buy this game if you have friends
i hate my friends got touched 10/10

Not really a thumb down more of a mixed review The game is good but it lacks an essential co-op mechanic the ability to ping For a 2021 game that's relying so much on light and darkness I wish it had native HDR support The last thing that's making it not good for me is the performance issue in any resolution higher than 1080p I used to play in 1080p the game was perfrectly fluid I got a 4k monitor and now my fps during alarms go down to 30-40 with a 3080Ti Tried downscaling to 2k same issue but then also blurry as heck I am not a fan of upscalers but it is much needed here If they patch these 3 things into the game it might become a 10/10 imo
good
Neat
The game is very good and challenging which makes it fun but please make the friendly AI smarter because they are so dumb I just had a run where I had to fight a lot of chargers(12 to be exact and instead of shooting them and keeping them at a distance all 3 of the AI runs into the fight spears out and they had full ammo We all died because they died instantly The game is good and challenging but please for the love of god make the friendly AI smarter
I'm using my Diablo IV pass to not play this game
Game got bland pretty quick I appreciate what the devs were attempting to make However it was poorly executed I would like more variety to the game I would also appreciate more ways to play the game the way it was portrayed was an action/stealth horror game It seems this portrayal gets lost in translation the game play is almost linear in nature stealth when stealth Combat when Combat The weapons seem a bit lack luster There are a few gems in the selection But it limits your options if you want to be an effective teammate in the game I hope this finds the right person just to alert you before getting the game Still has some fun moments but not worth the price tag
They throbbin on my Hel Gun till I Alarm
i hate this game it's perfect
It's fine Tough game with mediocre ally AI that basically requires teaming up with at least two other humans The game is very punishing so I really hope you're playing with people you like Additionally the skill ceiling is extremely high so public lobbies might be daunting Early levels with just the generic gameplay loop are the most fun to a casual like me Once you start introducing the poison fog invisible enemies and other difficulty-multiplying nonsense I just switch to a different level or game altogether Still game is fun and my friends and I come back to it every once in a while
It's way too easy
i shit bricks loved it
De la frappe si tu joues avec un pote qui flippe facilement
This is probably one of my MOST ENJOYED games I have on steam When I first bought this I didn't think I'd get so much hours out of it as I have AND still currently playing it I play this with a friend most nights if not every and stream this content on Twitch and even though the game can be quite brutal and we might not make it out A LOT of the time we still enjoy doing it all over again I can honestly say its worth the money it's a great game definitely need at least a mate to join Just playing with bots will be a challenge and isn't really fun There is discord community that are great to play with We've hosted some lobby's in that discord and its been great If you're a solo player I woulds recommend checking it out DON't GIVE UP ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE

I forgot to download it when my friend told me too D
Very hard but so good This game is the ultimate test of your friendship the game requires a lot of patience and can be extremely frustrating but how satisfying it is to complete a mission after 2 hours of hard work
I love this game but also I hate it so so so so much and it hates me right back It has proven to be an ultimate test of teamwork and coordination with my friends who I've been gaming with for over a decade and that includes multiple evenings which end with everyone grumpy and hating the game GTFO sets out to be a brutal uncompromisingly difficult cooperative experience and it nails that occasionally to it's own detriment However for the most part I've had a great time and am still being surprised by what the game throws my way
very hard but very satisfying when you win

Hardcore Stealth Shoot to Kill Teamwork CO-OP A great game all around with great atmospherics and missions Use the official discord channel to find online games 10/10
i could say amny words about this game but these three describe it so acurately im going to leave it at that it is the best of its kind
Impossible game me and my friend spent hours failing the whole extraction we never succeed a single run xD when the things rushed towards this gate/door that you have to defend stealth is out of the equation while that's what we relied on teh whole time just sneaking around and meeleing and crouching our way through so you need to utilize all and everything turrets bullets which are severely limited and perfectly strategize to not get wiped out in a second the NPCs well they're there Long story short this is just way too hardcore lol
At first I laughed when someone told me this game is considered a heist game but then I thought about it more and realized how damn right that is It's a heist game except you're heisting from unbelievable nightmares lurking in the darkness only visible when it's too late or you've made a mistake and they're listening for you GTFO does insanely well at immersing you from the UI effects terminal system for finding objectives that demands ACTUAL learning of its commands and inner workings to learning the way the different enemies can be defeated or outmaneuvered In the end it always comes down to this you're intruding and you WILL have to activate an alarm at some point Unfortunately the only downside to this wonderful game is that it takes so damn long to do the harder missions It makes sense and is satisfying the whole way through but damn do I struggle to play 3 hours of one mission Mods can help clean up the sloppy place of checkpoints so at least failing partway through doesn't mean over an hour lost but oof Masterpiece but long mission durations make short sessions unlikely
Bishop the key to success

with some dedicated friends this game is absolute peak
This game is very difficult and you will suffer throughout it but it's still somehow very fun The world the game takes place in is unique the stealth mechanics help differentiate this game from others although it can get a bit tedious the gunplay doesn't feel bad and it's a fun game to play with friends I will warn you though this game is incredibly difficult and it does not hold your hand at all and missions can take upwards of 30 minutes with some missions not even having checkpoints this isn't due to poor design just the way the checkpoints were added TLDR 9/10 a very fun game with lots of great content but also very difficult and time consuming
👍
GTFO definitely is a cooperative game In fact you likely will not be able to survive on your own It has some freakish zombie like creatures But the hard part are the mazes deep labyrinths and levels The goal here is to be very quiet and not seen Or you will surely die You must work cohesively with teammates And there is no easy game mode
buen juego si tienes amigos para jugarlo claro

zebediah arthritis kracken the third keeps getting me on this game and i'm going to smash my head against the wall
great game just wish you could do 2 or 3 player without bots
If you want a casual gaming experience that DEFINITELY isn't stress inducing or doesn't cause massive levels of panic by playing red light green light with hordes of sleepers then this is the game for you and your friends This is a great team building game 10/10
It is a really good hard coop game to play with friends The horror vibes are great and it has come a long way since the early missions Remember losing is also also fun
This game perfectly captures the essence of those horror movies where 1 moron makes a mistake and everyone dies Make no mistake mistakes will be made P.S We're all that 1 moron
Pretty good and difficult in co-op Very immersive
Just remember you're not the MC
cool best but less player
fun with a 3-4 man
God I wish I had friends who liked bonking thing with hammers in the dark
GTFO is the perfect game for a squad of four friends It combines stealth and action brilliantly making every session a thrilling experience The atmosphere is intense and the adrenaline rush from sneaking around and taking out enemies is unmatched Plus the gunplay is incredibly satisfying adding an extra layer of excitement to each encounter

This game blends horror and teamwork very well The amount of content they added this game since it first came out is a lot Can't wait to keep playing and finish every single level

Great game but only if you have 3 friends to play with coz the matchmaking sucks hard
Everything about this has left me in tears laughing
this game is like having 12 tons of pressure exerted onto your testicles
Te cagas en ocasiones pero es chido jugar con los panas recomendado
I have to say I loved this game its very fun to play with friends and have panic attacks when one of you accidentally woke up an entire room of sleepers the game does require you to have time on your hands so if your looking for a relaxing game where you can pause at any moment uh this is not it This will test your skills coordination reflexes and your blood pressure oh it WILL test your friendship the guns are good wish some pistols were better and we had more objectives rather than rinse and repeat I still love it it's great
Great game if you've got 4 other friends to play with and some patience it is a wholey unique and amazing experience If you don't have friends to play with check out the games discord
Felt way too hard of a game Don't think I will ever play it again

This is a good game and C-foam is good machanic
For people that thought dark souls was too easy
Honestly the game is very hard very fun Absolutely amazing with friends and very beautiful It has a great feeling of progression and succeeding a mission involves a lot of work and guide you through a lot of pain and finally satisfaction But we never tried hard that much and never played that much Overall a great game that would require more time from me
imagine if you were suddenly woken up by weird mask guys i mean i'd be angry too
super fun just wish had lobbies bigger than 4
Si quieres pasarlo chido juegalo con amigos y estresate como un desgraciado por que la pasaran chjistoso con el sigilo el juego es muy bueno y vale mucho la pena se nota en algunas cosas la inspiracion de payday
BOK
hard as hell damn
This game is extremely fun and not for the weak you'll need four things lots of focus good hearing good accuracy and the right equipment for the expedition Now I'm gonna list the things I love about this hardcore shooter The Enemies The Monsters in this game are not to be messed with especially if your new to the nightmare They are weak alone as a few shots or a melee strike can kill them within seconds or instantly but once the horde comes in then shit hits the fan You'll need to not get hit or even shot by the shooters big shooters etc Scouts are like recon which if you alert them they will call reinforcements along wake the room they are in if there are any left There are too many enemies to say so I'll just stop there But if you want to see a very strong one then R6D1 The Weapons There are many cool weapons to choose from to aid you on your journey from assault rifles shotguns machine guns and even snipers and more you'll need to choose the right weapons though because a bad loadout means you'll have a bad time I like taking the Burst Cannon for the giants as they can 2 shot them minimum The Tools There are a fair amount of tools to help out burst sentries bio tracker mine deployers and a few more burst sentries are good for groups of small and weak enemies but sniper sentries can help with giants Mine deployers can blow up enemies of course you can also use them to blow up enemies after a door was broken from a group of them and to thin out the wave C-foam to reinforce a door and give you and your squad more time personally I like the mine deployers 1st and C-foam 2nd as the scouts can be annoying to handle even when you use a knife Sneaking Mechanics The sneaking mechanics are mainly for patient people and if you aren't you might just go straight to gun blazing and risk your supplies from lowering near to nothing also make sure not to wake them or touch the Scouts feelers that it releases around it And to clear a room just melee them all or most just in case there's too many near eachother Reactors now I don't really like the reactors because when you play with bots as your friends aren't on it's kind of annoying as you can't have anyone enter the code as someone goes to get supplies from other rooms And running out of ammunition just before you complete the second last wave but it's a good difference for having the lights off at the start and having to rush around and collect supplies between waves that will up in difficulty including Hybrids coming into play Different Alarms The different Alarms in the game are very unique in their own ways from Travelling Alarms Surge Alarms Diminished Alarms and even Room Scans Dome of Death which can take several minutes like three and a-half minutes But there are many more alarms that you should find out yourself so good luck That is all I'm gonna say for the things I like there are more I could say but I'll stop it there Now go in there Prisoner and try and survive And remember The Warden is always Watching
worth playing with friends modded or not
almost 6 hours and i finally beat the first level
this game is like an abusive relationship it hurts you but you always come back for more pain spaghetti monster scary 3
Prison in game seriously
need friends
Great Co-Op experience well polished very atmospheric and I love how each Rundown grows in difficulty from pretty easy to tough-as-nails hard So regardless of your skill level there is something for you

This is impossible ugh Kind of fun maybe
Absolutely insane experience the only reason i have 24 hours at this time and not 500 is just simply because i dont have 2 more friends to play with the puzzle solving and horde survival elements are probably some of the most solid of any game out there and i really wish i could play more but with my limited friend group its just not possible This is not a run and gun game its an actual survival stealth game dont expect to just jump in and shoot everything its just not feasable if you like actually having to work and figure out puzzles and find items while trying to survive this game is perfect for you if you have 3 other people to play with i love this game more every time i play it and honestly it plays amazing on just about any system the core mechanics are amazing and the dev team is absolutely fantastic just please remember its not a horde SHOOTER its a stealthy survival extract kind of game This game can be so punishing if you do one thing wrong and thats absolutely awesome its not easy but damn is it rewarding to finish a mission or successfully complete an objective Honestly give it a shot its one of my most favorite games for what its worth i think it deserves a try if youve got a few good buddies you play with pretty regularly Just for an example i think it took me and a buddy 2 or 3 hours just to complete the first mission on the first teir out of 80 missions give or take there are so many hours of gameplay that 40 bucks seems absolutely worth it to me Good luck out there if you do get it i promise you will need it

A great game to play with friends So far I've completed Rundown 1 by myself and with some friends on top of a couple random missions in various Rundowns If you're experienced with shooters the game at the start won't be too hard but it WILL become brutal later I did some of the harder missions in the other rundowns and let me say that it was quite challenging Which is good if you're someone like me who has been looking for a challenging game This game gives me a sense of accomplishment like no other Despite what many people say I do think if you're good at video games the game is doable solo You might have trouble with C tier or higher levels I personally completed up to R1D1 solo but got stuck at a couple levels solo later on Don't expect this to be a game you can 100 solo with bots you WILL need help I primarily play the game duo since it's hard to get others on at the same time It's perfectly playable and enjoyable Obviously with a full team it's going to be way more fun The game has mod support with Thunderstore if you enjoy that You can even add mods to lower the difficulty if you want to go that route though I'd personally recommend against it unless you're very inexperienced with shooters or get stuck There's even custom levels and weapon packs if those interest you I think the only things I don't like about the game is how some weapons are just objectively worse than others both stat wise and feel wise Sure there's some personal preferences with how I like my weapons to feel but some weapons are and utter waste of time like the short rifle MOST weapons though are good barring a couple exceptions I also don't like how tedious some missions especially in Rundown 1 can be Collecting 12 IDs then later 10 Decoders is kind of tedious If playing chronologically Rundown 1 is by far the easiest though you might find a difficulty spike in R1C1 I faced a massive spike in difficulty when I played either a B or C tier mission in Rundown 3 it felt way harder than R1C1 even though I was much more experienced This can be good or bad Rundown 1 feels like a proof of concept more than anything else while the later ones are more fleshed out and engaging So players might get bored if they play chronologically The shooting feels good The tactics feel good The game is atmospheric and tense The stealth and co-operation feel very nice There's no paying to unlock stuff as everything other than a few cosmetics which you earn from beating levels is unlocked right from the get-go You're playing the game to beat the levels and have fun not to grind some battlepass or reach the highest character level As it should be There's plenty of levels to keep you going for a while and the more you play the more new stuff gets introduced so it will help keep things fresh as new challenges enemies hazards and gameplay mechanics are thrown at you Try it blind at least once if you get stuck look up a guide then It's a challenge that's satisfying to overcome Game goes on sale for about 20 usually Would definitely recommend it at that price If money isn't a concern for you then 40 for dozens to hundreds of hours of fun is worth it Especially since you can pace yourself and take your time in beating all the rundowns there's no rush
juste parfais pour les joueurs qui aime le challenge je recommande a fond
Very Good Game

This game can be pretty difficult but not every game needs to be easy I enjoy it the most when playing with friends Very stealth heavy at times and very action heavy at times My only dislike with the game is an occasional screen effect bugging out and making it impossible to see which doesn't happen often but often enough to mention it Still recommend
I never got the fuck out i'm still stuck here help
i love alerting the creatures to my friends positions and watching the horde come to maul us alive
great game

One of the best games that I've played with friends Our group of 4 We're not great at organization shooting and we fail on most of the levels at least once or twice before completing the main mission let alone secondary and overload However the game is so great that we try until we pass at leas the main mission using different strategy Great game for friends to learn better communication between the group be effective together I'm a little bit sad that with R8 it's over but I'm excited for the new game the team is making hopefully it can one-up GTFO Even if there will not be anymore new Rundowns for us there are still a lot of content left and also there are some interesting mods like custom Rundowns mobs weapons that can be tried
After beating one of the hardest levels of the game i turned around and said to my girlfriend You know sex with you is great but the sex with GTFO is on another level D
GTFO is an uncompromising take on the Left 4 Dead co-op shooter formula This is a game best played with three friends who you know for a fact are capable of coordinating together to defeat a horde of horrific fleshy monstrosities while navigating through advanced Destiny-style raid mechanics With the right party and with the amount of patience GTFO eventually reveals itself as one of the most rewarding cooperative experiences out there So many first-person shooters seem completely uninterested in testing our abilities but when you hit the extraction point in GTFO it truly feels like escaping the jaws of death
It's outstanding very difficult there is a learning curve and you can pretty much pick your difficulty The most difficult stuff requires you to learn the map rather than becoming better at combat though that helps which is a nice change from the usual

First time ever ive played a game like this and originally bought this game to play with a friend i kid you not the game is EXTREMELY hard to progress through single/2 players although you can play with online with others or npcs its more fun with friend The games not hard in terms of mechanics but learning whats good/bad types of strats and most importantly NOT MAKING A SINGLE MISTAKE is what makes it time consuming Any risk is a big risk And often you're overrun by enemies and running out of ammo playing this stealthy is of upmost importance And considering that there are so many levels to complete through its gonna take a long time to finish the game The learning curve of this game is kinda a big one there is a tutorial for basic stuff but most of info I had to learn from online wiki helps a lot Overall its doable Games graphics,sound design and mechanics are all very very good and for the price of 55 AUD its worth the money however I do recommend to buy this game with more than 1 other friend as itll help soo much more throughout the levels AND friends that are willing to sit through this torture over and over its fun trust Overall if you're a person who likes FPS and coop games i'd think you'd like this It's a game that needs alot of patience and grinding but its all about the fun yuh Lot's of content for 50 rarely gets repetitive 8/10
spooky and also awesome
When I was on the store page for this game reading up on game details on what I was getting myself and my squad into it deliberately mentions that this is a game meant for b]"Experienced FPS players in the mood for a i]SERIOUS[/i challenge."[/b h3]Well fucking advertised Let no one tell you different.[/h3 I saw this game years ago when Markiplier played this with JackSepticEye Lordminion777 and Bob I don't remember his YT name played it for a video or two It intrigued me and looked incredibly in-depth and it touched my soul so deeply that it stayed in the back of my mind for so long that I was looking at the Steam page for it a couple days ago as of writing this review now and noticed it was on a 50 sale with only 48 hours to act before my chance was gone So after deliberating with my squad I bought it for all of us for like 110 all in all Credit card debt is a bitch but considering the product I purchased well worth it This game is b][i]HARD.[/i][/b Like very hard One of my friends and I tried doing a duo run of the first mission playing as strategic as possible and we just barely failed at the end after multiple attempts And immediately it sounds like okay it was two people for a game designed for four no shit you failed But no even with four players this game is not a cake walk The enemies do a lot of damage and get alerted VERY easily even the smallest of mistakes will ring the dinner bell for every goober in the room Doing stealth to avoid all the enemies isn't an option either because there are alarm doors that will awaken any enemy not already killed and will spawn extra in areas behind you you've already explored And as is for most good horror games ammo and resources are not your friend and are as valuable as every breath you take Every shot you take has to be placed carefully and every missed shot may cause the death of a teammate Speaking of your teammates communication is CRUCIAL By all means tell your buddies to stop moving suggest ideas for sentry placements and positions to hold tell your buddies to stop moving and above all else tell your buddies to STOP FUCKING MOVING Most of my squad's gameplay consists of strategically stealthing into rooms and taking targets one by one and multiple at once if targets are clumped together and all of our comms consist of either shhhh or STOP STOP STOP STOP MOVING Talking to your team about if rooms are clear which rooms you need which items you need what i]kind[/i of enemies are in the room all of which are crucial Speaking of items the terminal is the first big thing to learn If you don't know how to use the terminal pray one of your teammates do The terminal is a computer that can be in multiple rooms that is your main method of finding the mission objective and keycards crucial to opening the path to it Thank god me and the other tryhard in our group learned it the other two neanderthals in our squad is more focused on calling dibs on kills no hate guys 3 I could talk about this game for hours certainly more than I currently have in the game The weapons consumables tools sentries gear on and on and on everything feels so goddamn good I've made it no secret and I'll reiterate it again this game is NOT for the weak and ill-dedicated this is a SERIOUS challenge for experienced players And that's exactly why I love it This game is SO unbelievably good and I am SO ready to see more

Absolutely love this game Big fan of the rundown that starts you with zero ammo 500 hours in and still nowhere near finished
10 10
Very hard but very cool game for coop and solo but in coop its really strategic and it can be very fun
This game is a game that is really challanging and hardcore It offers an expirience you have never felt before and its unique Despite some bugs its still enjoyable specially when you finish a mission
played 30 minutes and asked a refund if you want a good looking game prepare yourself for the blurry and downgraded texture of this game and the boring gunplay and bad stealth that follow up also the community is a 30 year old anime degen cesspool
Good
The game play loop difficulty and learning curves are so well put together and may at first seem frustrating but is generally extraordinarily fun and entertaining
hade jag detta spelet
h2 h2 GTFO spoiler you know hundred bucks
this game f*cking sucks queues up again
absolutely amazing
Devs are clowns they don't respect you or your time They randomly generate the maps they patch out player strategies they attack and ban modders Obsessed with balance and preventing modding in a co-op PVE game against computer enemies Devs gatekeep txt documents of their lore You had to be there mentality FOMO nonsense that used to be rife in the game How petty do you have to be Edit oh yeah and it's forty fucking dollars normally
stupid game you make me puke

shit
Guys in the name of saving your nerves do not buy the game if you do not have 3 teammates with BDSM inclinations The feeling of an object in the ass is the best that this game gives
Best to play with friends or if not friends people from the discord everyone ive met there is willing to help you out if your new good community good game
o jogo bom mas seria melhor se os inimigos escutassem conversando com seus amigos
Hard AF But it's also a lot of fun if you have friends to play it with
Le jeux est bien
Concept extraordinaire le jeu est juste dingue et mis jour par les devs
We've got a eeper over here eeper over there
I don't think I'll ever fully understand how to stealth but I'm having a good time either way Much recommend very nice and cool
fun
me and my friend played it on the free day and now its on a 50 sale i want it so bad oh my lord
really good game to play with friends its a masterpiece
dur dur mais addictif
only played for less then a hour and was scared shitless from the tutorial
good if you actually have friends to play with
I was blocked on their Discord Channel for refusing to participate in their forced pronoun assignment As a result I will be uninstalling the game It's a shame I really liked GTFO but I won't support forced ideology and forced alphabet agenda
One of my favorite masochistic
super fun and stressful game
Waiting for master how about you wait for my unit
its very boring all monsters look the same every 2min the same things and far far away from horror
Very nice can be played with sisters and bros

fun game to do stuped shit on D
This is a good game.It's even better if you have a friend who is willing to play this game with you
Although this game primarily requires human players to cooperate I often encounter issues when playing with two friends and a bot The bot frequently friendly fire and shoots at obstacles due to vision penetration It also takes medkits on its own and during a large enemy attack stands in front of you to heal you when you're injured preventing you from shooting and leaving you surrounded by enemies with low health Additionally when all teammates need to gather for mission it sometimes has a bug and won't enter the scan zone causing mission failure after an hour of gameplay
very good game but would need a team to play so if u have friends deff try it out
good game
yuh
nie polecam tej gry
Note this is an excellent game or has the potential to be an excellent game i loved everything about this game the stealth the combat the strategy behind everything you do The only glaring flaw i see is that checkpoints are almost non existent in early missions and by check points i mean i cant leave the game and come back the next day to continue the mission i have to beat each mission in one sitting and unfortunately with my lifestyle i am unable to do that
Joguei por 2h e o jogo muito bom inclusivo para os que estudam kkkkk Cooperativo ao extremo dificuldade punitiva mas que faz a ser maior ainda um prato cheio Se tem amigos jogue com estranhos acredito que pelo fato dos personagens serem considerados prisioneiros e se os jogadores forem completos estranhos deve adicionar uns pontos a que passar bem tempo juntos pra se conhecer e entrar num consenso 22 de setembro de 2024 metade do compre e joguem vale a pena

Good
Fuck this Fucking stupid game i hate it with every fibre of my being this shit gives irreparable anger management issues Fuck this shit Go play it with your friends
Stark and chilling atmosphere intense combat visceral weapon feedback disgusting creatures complex objectives detailed terminal log lore and absolutely hardcore overall gameplay 10 out of 10 would GTFO again
Probably the most entertaining Co-op survival shooter to play with friends its got everything bots if you dont have many online friends its got horror the gun sounds are excellent the audio design is fantastic the creature designs are awesome the big guys are very intimidating its no twitch shooter you need to work together and make plans to survive in every rundown BUY THIS GAME
SPENT 9.5 HOURS ON THE FIRST INSTRUCTIONS WERE CLEAR BUT MY FRIEND'S LIL BRAINS WERE SOMEONE SAID DARK SOULS OF FPS TRULY IT IS 10/10 FOR THE PRICE 8/10 GRAPHICS 9/10 OPTIMIZATION ONLY BUY IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH CUZ IT'LL BE HARD AND ANNOYING TO PLAY ALONE
i bought the game on my first time running it i encountered the most toxic player i've seen in all games in my entire life worst than CS,LoL,Cod old lobbies all of that while i'm still learning the pace of the game imagine all of that while being in the dark in a semi-horror game wasn't pleasant at all i might give it another shot but i doubt it maybe i'm unlucky but what are the odds of meeting the worst human being on your first day

Este juego deberia tenerlo todo el mundo
Not worth Can't seem to play with 4 friends only 2 at a time The first time I played the game I could see 2 of my team mates on the the host Edit I know that the game supports 4 person co-op my issue is I can't seem to see 2 of my friends
Really good game if you have 3 other friends not too fun otherwise but thats just my opinion overall really good game and is super stressful stealthing and coordinating with your friends 8/10 will GTFO again
really fun game

Game bugged out during R1C1 and completely reset our progress I love supporting indie devs but it's such a bummer when the game is buggy
Good game
game is really cool dont have anyone to play it with tho
mt bom o game porem meus teamates(amigos)sao animais no cio n podem ver uma xereca na cara do monstro q querem descarregar os pente

hard but fun I like it
GTFO might be the best game to end friendships Go play it with your friends This game has sleepy heads 3
Good game although playing it solo will be difficult
joguei pouco apenas 2h agora mas o jogo bom Eu joguei com gente porque nao tnho amigos mas ate com gnt aleatoria daora Nota 8,3/10 depois de MUITO tempo eu fui tentar jogar novamente Esse jogo pra qualquer um extremamente um erro seu pode custar uma partida de mais de 40 minutos A comunidade muito com jogadores novos minha compre apenas se for jogar com amizade sua Esse game pra um nicho muito me arrependo de ter comprado porque eu consigo aproveitar ele tudo muito complexo muitos detalhes E a comunidade ajuda O jogo bom mas pra mim
fun
Cool Game
The perfect game where you can very quickly find out if you and your friends are suffering from major skill issues Anyone who is saying this game needs 4 people to be playable is wrong most levels if not all can be done with 2 people and 1-2 bots
endiabladamente y casi imposible de jugar si no tenes 3 amigos que se crean capaces de jugarlo
Definitely one of my favorite co-op games AND horror games the atmosphere is done perfectly and the gameplay is dynamic and fun Stressful in all the right ways
1 1 1 2 1 3
It's not bad but it's not good either One thing that does stick out You can see an enemy blatantly miss and it still hits you like a truck Can't help but to laugh hit reg is insanely bad
Pros Definitely a nice zombie shooter with dark ambient vibe Cons The online matchmaking system is horrible you will lag disconnect bug Tip Get friends to play with
Quite the disappointment It used to be fun with a few friends but beware you'll hardly get past the first few levels without more than 2 teammates It's not difficult because of loot management navigation strategies to beat enemies No it's just stupidly difficult Even if you're sneaky all the way and clean each room very carefully you'll eventually HAVE to open one of these doors that WILL trigger an alarm spawning dozens of enemies their count does not seem to scale with your team size who will just whoop your ass no matter how many turrets and mines you deploy and no matter how good you aim It's not like fighting a Dark Souls boss that you can learn to dodge and counter it's like fighting 12 of them simultaneously Is it doable Technically yes practically no
knife a giant for a challenge
jogo bom
Great IQ test for the dumbasses that you call friends you may be the worse of them
Quem quiser jogar me add Bem e precisa de trabalho em equipe
um jogo hardcore e bastante tenso que exala uma atmosfera de terror que requer muita para jogar O jogo extremamente a escala de dificuldade e a curva de aprendizado muito brutais mas de uma forma que pode ser dominada e superada com a o jogo depende de uma equipe completa de 4 jogadores para ser remotamente se algum desses jogadores estragar tudo todos mortos raramente os erros perdoados Dominar a do jogo e a e trabalho em equipe realmente a chave para a No geral e um jogo meio para iniciantes mas quando se acostumar com a jogabilidade vai adorar
Best to play with friends
The die together part is extremely prominent in game dont you worry
It's okay
This game is like dark souls but not in the gameplay sense or the story sense or even the style It's in the feeling of accomplishment With both games you will be beaten down and faced with challenges that seem impossible with just you and your puny self and little health But you strive you learn you overcome all of these challenges With each wonderfully made level there are strategies and plans that could outright change the outcome if executed properly And after all of that is said and done the victory screen along with it's little jingle will be one of the most satisfying things you will ever bear witness to because you know that earned that victory This game is not for the casual but rather for someone who wants to prove that they are better and smarter than your average aim at target and shoot fps player

zzzzzz
Gameplay is good difficulty is hard(also a good thing BUT this is also a live service game Your ability to play the game depends on the availability of your internet connection and their servers While i am fortunate to have a reliable internet connection my trust in the later is not a given I do not like games that can and will become obsolete whenever the Company wishes it so If you are an EU citizen and want to do something about this
Rly specific game not for every one but it has its perks def try it on free weekend tho
multiplayer doesn't really work kinda messes with immersion Not a game I'll play by myself so I didn't try that Multiplayer is broken The UI moving all the time should be a toggle option And it needs a brightness setting I know that darkness is part of the game but sometimes environmental factors outside of the game can cause it to be a necessity Like sun light shining on the screen causing everything to loose much of its contrast I'm sure it's perfect for thousands of people I may be an outlier But I gave it a shot and there's my review
i refunded this game over a year ago i dont remember what it's like

An excellent tense strategic and atmospheric co-op experience Only downside is the game required 4 players but that can be fixed with mods
V fun v hard
Amazing must play coop game Almost every moment is tense the staked are high and you are very dependent on you team so choose wisely It feels somewhat like a souls game with guns when looking at the way the game challanges you This game also makes you distrusting of levels and situations adding a extra tense vibe But when you finaly beat that one level you've been stuck on for day's weeks or even months or years It feels so good
An Intense Cooperative Horror Experience GTFO is a standout title in the cooperative horror genre delivering a heart-pounding blend of suspense and action The game excels at creating a chilling atmosphere where stealth strategy and teamwork are essential for survival The storyline is engaging adding depth to the already gripping gameplay The horror elements are effectively unsettling and the difficulty level provides a true challenge making every victory feel hard-earned If a fan of horror and enjoy cooperative gameplay GTFO offers an intense and memorable experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat Working together to navigate this deadly underground world is both thrilling and rewarding Highly recommended for those looking for a truly immersive and challenging horror adventure Generated with AI and 3
ok i hated the game at first but after 4 hours of playing and looking up how the mechanics work i started to love it you can play solo but its much harder cuz the bots are a little silly at times but overall a good stealth game with planning and a little bit of coding
Get The Fuck Out is really the game alright
good
Should've added brutal like in Doom and Warhammer Should've make AI bot carry bulkhead key power cell fog turbine memory stick or matter wave projector so we dont have to run all way back to get em After failed the mission everything is back in beginning as they should be
1-4 10
jogo bom me caguei todo
Inherently dull gameplay creating a cycle of boredom leading to carelessness leading to dying with little to no checkpoints Making it a dull slog not worth the time and frustration it demands If the developer would be more open to giving options to people who just want to have fun then it wouldn't be so bad
Great game just wish I was skilled enough to beat the second reactor with my other friend I would love to finish the game but 120 hours and i'm still on rundown two is crazy If i beat rundown two I'll inform you people Edit Today me and my other friend beat rundown three like was suggested by you kind souls Thank you so much for the advice I'll keep you posted
I did not GTFO
now its paid i am zad

Esta muy bueno el juego pero a menos que juegues con amigos o con desconocidos no recomendaria jugarlo ya que algunas partes si tienes que tener personas para poder cordinarse bien
This game is good if you have one to three friends with you that is You can play solo but it is not recommended In my opinion I don't know if it works or not you should play Helldriver 2 first before playing this game because this game is very very difficult You need to be stealthy brains and be able to go to defense mode when you make a mistake or you activate an alarm And remember to take breaks and to have fun
either trust your friends or dont which is probably the best option

Pretty high quality game but sometimes feels a little empty Although this feels like it's by design and honestly it streamlines the gaming experience really well You pick a mission pick a loadout and you're done Then you drop straight into the mission Some cons though if you don't have enough people to fill the 4 man squad you'll be playing with bots who are objectively terrible at staying in one spot which is sometimes required and WILL fail you the mission because they fuck it up Consider using the duo's or trio's mod on r2modman it's easy to install it scales the difficulty down to 2 or 3 people and that way you can play without bots Maybe they have something like that in the workshop but idk

Honestly the HARDEST part of this game is getting to play it consistently Matchmaking is total fucking crapshoot and if you actually have enough friends who are hardcore enough for this I fucking envy you great game great story prepare to die

Not Bowling
Great horror online coop it's very dark and gritty
Just amazing Game with amazing Gameplay but carefull it's hard
good
Love the game but issues with having my friends invisible in the game I cant see them and they cant see me i need help solving this
MUY BUENO recomendado
Solid co-op game that requires coordination and can be very difficult
AWESOME
The name of the game is accurate
game good zombie
make as much noise as possible source trust me
very fun and difficult if you like horror shooters this is one of the good ones
I dont like scary games
I love shooting white sticky substance to monsters
My favourite game I love the strategy and the atmosphere Now I just need friends to play it with proper D
The game is good im addicted i don't have friends
not gud
OK I discovered this game watching Mark Markiplier Bob muyskerm Wade Lord Minion and Sean jacksepticeye/Toss Boy play it and was hooked I was finally able to get it and I've been playing it solo with the bots On the first rundown and it took me a couple of hours to get through A1 and B1 Even with the bots it's difficult to do and I got lucky getting through them On B2 I tried For 3 hours to get through it and gave up and will try again later This game Is Phenomenal The intensity the gameplay the environment your on the edge of your seat the entire time you play I've never played a game where you are fully immersed in the game like this If you don't have it get it Get it Get it Get it It's well worth the money UPDATE Tried B2 again solo with bots Failed after 3 hours again I love that I have to change tactics every time I try as the supplies and enemy locations and the amount of enemies are different each time so no same plan will work on the next try You have to adapt each time GOD I love this game Never been challenged like this ever UPDATE 2 So I tried R1B2 again I finally beat it with bots It took me 3hrs 42 minutes and I didn't even get through alot of the areas I was lucky enough to find the HSU quickly and luckily enough to get enough supplies to get to the extract My GOD that was intense Wow
After a little bit more time it's good with friends but that's about it
Val where are my bullets
good game
Die Koop Erfahrung die man erleben kann Ein Fehler und the shit hits the fan Wild rumrennen und alles zu klump ist keine Option da die Munition wie Gold behandelt werden sollte Immer lautlos und nen Fluchtplan parat haben wenn die schleicherei mal 10/10 um gemeinsam zu schwitzen Quasi Sauna das Spiel euer Doc D
Dead Game
very difficult and missions run very long because of it but very fun with friends
Awesome game SCARY
Imagine you had to spend around 1-2 fcking hours for a rundown
If you want to walk slow from the beginning to the end for each level be my guest
Great game and ambitious developers who did not try to conform to norms to increase player count The game is genuinely an original experience I do not strongly recommend it if you can't find 4 consistent players You may make long-term friends on the discord though
Esta Muy divertido el juego para jugarlo con amigos
freaky monsters
If you're looking for a good hard co-op shooter buy Helldivers 2 or Left 4 dead 2 and crank up the difficulty Hell L4D2 came out 10 years before this asset flipped looking game and had better level design fleshed out characters better enemy variation better looting that isn't just ammo tech gun ammo and meds Finding gun upgrades was great and it doesn't have constant goofy stand in red circle objectives Helldivers 2 has better kit and cosmetic customization but granted it came out years later All the levels look the same and take forever to get through The sneaking is a snoozefest and the wonky hitboxes on melee weapons make it even worse Blows my mind that this game has mostly positive reviews the only thing good about is is that it runs well and I guess if you like crouching around and long pressing mouse1 to kill the sleeping zombies one by one and doing the same silly hacking mini-game over and over this is for you I guess If you've played better stealth games like the old Splinter Cells you'll be disappointed
th.there everywhere oh god gunshots screems mic static
i died 10/10 would die again
Very good Hardcore Co-Op game Highly recommend for ppl that wants to challenge themselves
this game is not for everyone
Get the fuck out
Come for the aesthetic Stay for the pain
PAYDAY if it was fucking EVIL
I recommend atleast 2 friends that are somewhat smart in games and not fully brainrotten
this game has taken over my mind 10/10
Combining intense co-op gameplay with a chilling atmosphere it creates a gripping and immersive experience that stands out in the horror genre The game excels in fostering teamwork and communication as players must strategize and coordinate closely to survive the dark foreboding environment The strategic combat is both deep and challenging demanding careful planning and precise execution to overcome the relentless threats The eerie setting and atmospheric tension amplify the sense of dread making each encounter both thrilling and nerve-wracking While the learning curve can be steep and the difficulty high the satisfaction of overcoming its challenges with a well-coordinated team makes it a rewarding experience Ideal for fans of cooperative horror who enjoy a blend of strategy suspense and high stakes
I HATE R1C1
very good but very challenging game with friends coming from a dark souls vet
like
love it
They look kinda breedable ngl
GAME OVER FPS
Si quieren HORAS y HORAS de juego con un toque de de vez en cuando un poco de y un toque de estrategia este NO es su juego porque es pura y totalmente recomendado una joyita de juego la verda
Best game that you suck at
the giants are edging Bredward
With a full group of 4 this game is quite a bit of fun If you can laugh at your mistakes learn the mechanics and take solace in what you learned each time you fail you'll enjoy it Your character is a prisoner so the fact that the guns feel difficult to wield seems to be part of the design The resources are limited and coordination is key It's a fun departure from many titles out there
I love this game so much It is immersive right off the bat The game is very tense but exhilerating I really think many others would play the game if they knew about it
Why are the enemies so freaky I only put on Jean Paul Gaultier Paradise Garden

Modern Day Physchological Torture The Video Game
Scary dont have a heart attack
Shit goes wrong so fast and often I develop muscle memory and aneurysm as fast as Biden draining US Reserve Gun play Lighting and sound design are so good they give me premium trauma from all the blinding muzzle flash and screaming in the dark This game is sadistic but fun with friends like when I have Korean spicy noodle you develop tolerance gradually
This is a challenging game If you love a good challenge and strategy this game is for you It's a bit scary too if you're into that sort of thing
Meu mano tankou o bostil mas isso vai me impedir de terminar essa pedrada
i hate this stupid fucking game would pay full price
I have my gripes with this game The janky hitboxes notwithstanding it feels more frustrating than challenging Not my thing 3/10 Oh and sometimes the game will glitch and softlock you 2 hours into a longform mission No thank you
👍
just got my first computer and this game is the first one i got Very Hard but very enjoyable game
This game feels like a combination of The Last of US and Helldivers Yes very good big fun XD
Aaaah such a fun party game
not worth the time spent the game is just frustrating and does not reward the players for achieving their goals
hard but fun
great game
Great concept and atmosphere however the whole game just boils down to sneaking around a few feet stopping so you don't trigger a sleeper and then walking a few more feet stopping and then walking a few more feet so you can hopefully smack it in the face Don't get me wrong it is definitely fun with buddies but gets pretty repetitive when you try and sneak around particularly with how long the missions are Would rate it neutral if I could because the setting and guns are great and it can be extremely fun and tense but its in between long periods of scary space-themed red light green light 7/10
stfu
Great game Really immersive cool enemies andddd I SPEND AN HOUR AND A HALF ON A LEVEL JUST TO DIE JUST TO DIE JUST TO DIE AND HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN Great game
God
waiting for maste my friend cant join my game help plz
Very difficult but super fun NEEDS A GOOD SYSTEM
Been spending my summer here it's really good game that relies on you AND your team being skilled to clear the missions would recommend if you have a lot of time to invest into it
GOOD
One of the most underrated FPS 4 player Coop Horror games out there Awesome game play atmosphere is epicness all over Adrenalin Junkies will love this game I played this when it was first released great if you have friends to play with you or simple join the discord group LFG

It's worth the money and with 4 people a great experience But I don't understand the developers stance on scaling the difficulty to the Lobby Count There's plenty of people willing to play this in groups of 1-3 people but can't because it's borderline impossible in later levels Just scale the enemy spawns with the lobby count Even 5 less per person would be good It's very easy to add and would make no difference to people already playing as 4 It's a hardcore game I get it But is there an actual reason why this is missing It's designed for prisoner teams of four is only defending your ability to make poor design decisions

cool
the EULA contains a forced arbitration clause which essentially means if the company ever does something you would like to sue them for you are contractually unable to go to a normal court or be part of a class action lawsuit and will instead have to settle through arbitration which historically has a 96 bias towards the company not the individual this is common practice in a lot of companies but still a very weird and predatory thing to include though i will give them points for being honest and transparent about it in the document
Harder than Michael Jacksons penis when he sees a kid

Shit goes hard
I mainly play solo with bots and its easier than i expected but still very hard i need 2 tries to complete a mission with bots There is 1 mission that i was not able to complete with bots and if you play with them your missions will probably last at least 10-20 minutes longer than with real players but i still find it enjoyable when my friends are not online If you liked payday 2 stealth you will probably like the game
I hate this game me and my siblings can't even get past the first stages and bishop keeps letting his dawgs out 10/10

Quite a difficult game to master But a lot of fun with the right people
SHHHHHHHH UZBEKI SPYAT
Challenging but fair More stealth focused than other games in the CO-OP FPS genre Highly recommend with friends and if you dont have any join the discourd where you will find a pretty great community
This game is well made until you look harder at it It has many issues that become more annoying as you get better at the game More of the time you will have issues that throw a mission that aren't in your control The exception being if you are playing with p*bs Would I still recommend that you get the game yes Can I promise that you'll enjoy the game play loop difficulty learning curve and countless wipes to stupid reasons no The mission variety is criticized in several reviews but you can tell how deep they went into the game by reading them While yes there are missions that feel the same with the goals there are a wide variety of different experiences in each of them Simplifying it there are 12 mission types in the game 1 Go collect X amount of X 2 Carry X to X 5 for carrying it back to extract 3 Go get X and bring it to extract 4 Go to a terminal and do an up-link 5 Start up a reactor 5 for needing to code hunt 6 Shut down a reactor 7 Go to X and do a scan 5 for using a terminal or HSU for the scan 8 Use a multiple terminals in a quick sequence while fighting 9 Plug in X amount of cells 10 Live for X amount of minutes before a door opens 5 for additions of other tasks during Using these 12 mission types GTFO diversifies its levels enough to make them memorable to you Avoiding too many spoilers for the lore which do not get this game for the lore the logs ain't worth the hassle the more you come to understand what the objective is telling you to do the better at the game you start to get Just like how your characters may start out not knowing completely what they're doing but by the time you're in the later missions you know what you're doing Another common criticism I see on here is the if you don't have friends to play it with its not worth it This is almost completely false If you are too awkward to talk to anyone then yes you shouldn't play this If you are willing to talk to a few random people every once in a while and who knows they may end up playing with you consistently down the line then the discord does this exceptionally Anyone stating that this game can't be played unless you have a group to play it with have not spent more than 5 minutes on the server There are lobbies daily for new players who are getting started and have older players teaching them some of the tricks and strats for the game The biggest hurtle for a new player to GTFO is the learning curve to both the intended mechanics and the unintended bugs As mentioned before they can be frustrating when you're an hour into a tougher run only to lose it to a random bug most of which can be fixed with mods but they are not consistent enough to be a huge issue The intended mechanics are easy to learn hard to master and make for a good test of how well you can preform in any level or circumstance From little things like who takes what tool depending on the mission to big things like how to mele enemies more efficiently or use commands on the terminal faster learning and mastering these things make the experience that much more fun Overall GTFO is one of my favorite games I've ever played I think it nails the balance of difficulty to skill progression and brings you closer with people as you share in the pain of another Expedition Failed screen While it has it's fair share of issues they don't take away from the overall game play social experience or enjoyment of the game I would give it a very solid 8/10 and would recommend you try it
Absolutely phenomenal game How games used to be made all the content UPFRONT Brutally difficult learning curve Worth it

Very fun and horrific Very hard even with friends sometimes the bots act a little funny when trying to get them to pick something up or place a sentry but usually you can get them to do it eventually

The game revolves only around you sneaking around in almost total blackout trying to sneak up and kill various sleeping monsters while they are in phases of time where they will not notice you moving If you like that it is fabulous It has very good game play and a good selection of weapons
Terror around every corner
Wenn man sich drauf auf ein ultra schweres sneak/extraction Shooter DANN ist das ab Stunde 5 ein perfektes Spiel mit stetiger Lernkurve sogar noch nach 100h Spielzeit Adrenalin und wenn man eine Mission geschafft hat sind nicht beschreibbar wie bei Soulslikes Klare Empfehlung aber bitte drauf einlassen
This game makes me feel like bishop slamming his fist against his head
I like the roaming spaghetti and meatball monsters
good game
Brutal game if you do not talk to your teammates but that is the point Game is awesome if you have a good team Super challenging and rewarding Like the note on the store page says this is not a run an gun shooter You have to take it slow or you all die Work together or die together

ca ressemble trop a un jeu Lego au niveau du gameplay pas graphiquement Ressemblance entre les 2 jeux Map tres belle et mais interractions impossible avec 99 du niveau Obligation de faire le niveau de telle maniere sans la moindre alternative meme minime possible Et pour GTFO uniquement les combats avec les mechants tres peu tu tires sur le mechant mais tu sais meme pas si tu las tellement il a une animation de marde dans Wolfenstein au moins tu as l'impression de tuer en masse
This is the Dark Souls of shooters I think While most games have you sneaking into shadowy research facilities to press E to download the sensitive files GTFO actually has you command-prompting your way through a computer system to get even the slightest bit more information on where your objective is located let alone how it's achieved All this is happening while you're surrounded by scores of eerie slumbering humanoids each of whom will bolt awake if you so much as sneeze near them When it does come time to GTFO after fulfilling your mission you'll be sprinting back from whence you came bombarded by enemies until a harrowing holdout before extraction Prepare yourself
You NEED friends to play this if you don't don't bother there's no matchmaking and its incredibly hard to do matchmaking through it's discord
611037216
With friends is fun without friends sucks and I have no friends that play this
Best high-stakes co-op experience with friends This title is both a richly atmospheric stealth-horror game and an extremely satisfying shooter Certain rundowns are manageable with bots but the experience is subpar I highly recommend joining the GTFO Discord for matchmaking
Finding friends that like this game as much as I do is the hardest part about playing it It's an amazing experience but it's not as widely appreciated as it should be
Stealth mission Did you mean Fully Automatic Unsuppressed Assault
Playing alone sucks Playing with friends still sucks Help
I love this game because I hate myself
definitely a challenging game but as long as you have a few friends who aren't complete idiots it's pretty fun
Half the gameplay revolves around stepping into colorful circles while fighting wave spawned enemies until you're allowed to progress to the next room which looks just like the last room It's like Doom4 Snap Maps meets Dance Dance Revolution
great game a bit difficult to play without dedicated friends but bots help with the loneliness
The Game is pretty good I like the variety and not always just shooting but also sneaking and smashing the enemys with a sledgehammer but in some Situations firearms and powerful wepons are simply the Key to success Coordinating and eliminating enemies is easier and more fun with Friends without Teamwork it is very difficult to progress in the Rundowns I can recommend this game to anyone who wants some variety in Combat and to have a great Gaming experience with Freinds 3

Caralho eu nem lembrava de ter jogado isso
I'm not someone who usually likes FPS but I have to say that this is amazing It's creepy enough for me to go ewwww and the graphics are fantastic I find it challenging but that's part of the fun for me Would highly recommend if you like something that's indie/horror but doesn't have zombies
Want a challenge How about a panic attack Well you can have both Grab 3 trusted friends turn off the lights and duct tape your headphones to your skull This game is a unique work of art There is not another like it There's a VR mod too that is amazing But you don't have the guts for that
Stealth gameplay 24/7
I have to buy this game for people to convince them to play it with me
most pants shitting experience of my life would shit my pants again
A dreadful big beast got me it got me with its great globule of SPIT

Need friends
This game is one of a kind 1 wrong move and you're likely to get punished by enemies within seconds Recommend 4 ppl team for better experience and teamwork
b b
This game quickly became my favorite to play I don't even have a full team of friends to play with most of the time but that's the magic of it You can practice with bots to get a feel for all the weapons and mechanics as well as with your friends to just hang out and have fun goofing around Then you hop into a mission to actually beat it and you watch yourself and your friends all suddenly become stealthy murderers with a hivemind mentality for what needs to be done It's all around a great game but playing with friends is always better than random matchmaking Or you can random matchmake and make new friends that form a group for regular playing sessions
For people how love having there balls twisted and teeth kicked in i love it

Hard game when solo
Fuck it we ball fuck it we ball fuck it we ball fuck it we ball
I hate playing this game but I love it A really fun way to spend a night with friends screaming in terror and getting the satisfaction of after a grueling 2 and a half hour mission to fail and have to redo the whole thing at least twice You know its a good game when less than 15 of players complete the tutorial lmao I will say its not as sneaky-scary as I thought the terror comes from accidently walking into a sleeper and having to run for your life 10/10 I piss myself every mission
GET YOU NEED TO LEAVE keep ur sanity intact and play with 3 others

I got this game since very start of it's early access Unfortunately I can't recommend this game given how the devs treat their product In addition to that I really doubt if the devs can keep good care of their future products There are some really serious bug exist in this game which basically make you unable to complete a rundown For people who has experience this game some of the rundowns may take you and your friends hours to complete During the early access stage of this game I have encountered those bugs for a couple of times Which is fine imo since the project is still in early access However I am writing this comment after the game has been launched for years and no longer has future updates and these bugs are still there Which me and other 3 of my friends just spend 2 hours in a rundown and the extraction zone bugged out Forcing us to quite at the very end of that rundown These kind of bugs are simple not acceptable to a game like this During the early access stage we literally had a time spent 4 or 5 hours in a rundown and because of an bug can't complete it Unable to imagine how on earth this kind of bug is allowed after 3 years

Needs weapon armor item weapon attachment unlocks as you progress in level to keep it interesting rather than just letting you pick anything you want from the start All the unlocks are cosmetic it seems Other than that I highly recommend this game

GTFO is a great game in concept and potential Note that only completed like 4 levels so far alone with bots In this game you need to navigate through a facility to complete your objective main gameplay is stealth and gun shooting As many point out the stealth focuses on a red light and green light this To start playing the first few levels were a great experience both atmospheric and you have think about how to tackle groups of enemies without triggering them all However this got repetitive very fast as there many mechanics to spice things up Just crouch walk up to them and wack em in the head In further levels there are a few different enemies that can make for more diversity To summarize the stealth again a red light green light game with little to no depth and variation Now the combat aim and shoot at them And uhhh it You can set up turrets and traps but that change how you engage in hold outs As for how the gunplay feels eh as well Gun designs are cool but it feel very nice to shoot a sleeper with a DMR 5 times in the body before it dies This applies to other guns as well damage is noticeably bad The enemy tracking is also a problem for me as well This part is somewhat just skill issue but the tracking on the enemy projectiles is way too much I can be shooting at them see they shoot I take cover and then I still get hit That feels unfair and lead to a good experience So the combat has not much strategy and is not very satisfying For the exploration mostly to find objective items or to stock up on supplies for combat Now when roaming around the facility you have those two options plus one You can either wack every enemy in stealth and fall asleep Go through combat and get annoyed as well as lose supplies Or you can walk past the enemies in hopes you trigger them later if you need to run back or open a hold out door There is a form of progression in boosters Boosters improve certain stats such as hacking Boosters for some odd reason are consumables which are lost upon use So rather than making a certain you just end up never using them because you want to lose them You also unlock cosmetics and it Again this game has a great concept but it lacks depth and variety So far the two main forms of engaging enemies is very lackluster and provide a good experience While the atmosphere is amazing the gameplay is what will keep us in the game and GTFO just provide
this is the game where eldritch horrors diddle you 10/10 awesome experience
Probably one of my favorite games It's so hard but I love the challenge if you don't I would not recommend this game to you but if that's your thing it's an absolute blast
5/10 Room for Improvement As an avid gamer who genuinely wants to see GTFO thrive I wanted to share some thoughts on aspects of the game that could benefit from refinement While GTFO has a solid foundation with its eerie atmosphere and cooperative gameplay a few areas feel unbalanced and could be tweaked to enhance the overall experience Stealth Mechanics The stealth mechanics are a core part of its design but they currently seem overly stringent The frequent detection state of zombies even with minimal movement can make progress feel painfully slow and tedious It would be fantastic if the detection system were adjusted to offer a bit more leeway allowing players to navigate the environment without feeling excessively restricted AI Homing Projectiles One of the more puzzling aspects is the homing projectiles from creatures Given that these enemies are perceived as being blind the fact that their projectiles can track players feels inconsistent with their lore and undermines the dodge mechanics A reevaluation of how these projectiles work and perhaps adding different projectile mechanics could help make the gameplay feel more logical thrilling and rewarding Ammunition and Health Packs Finding ammunition and health packs is often a struggle and it can be disheartening to discover that large containers hold useless items such as glow-sticks or only a single use med pack or ammo pack Increasing the frequency of these items could make exploration feel more rewarding and less of a gamble AI Performance The bots in GTFO currently fall short of being useful allies Their sluggishness and ineffectiveness in combat can make missions unnecessarily difficult Improving their combat abilities and responsiveness would significantly enhance the cooperative experience and alleviate some of the frustration that players experience during co-op Map Size and Game Pace The vastness of the maps while impressive can lead to prolonged and drawn-out matches This clashes with the intended premise and overall feel of a quick infiltration and extraction Balancing the map size and the pace of gameplay could help maintain the thrilling tension that the game aims for Overall GTFO has immense potential and addressing these key areas could significantly enhance the enjoyment factor hoping the developers read this and I hope be considered for future updates Thanks for taking the time to read
very very good but very hard game
Really good game to play with friends

TL:DR Buy this extremely high quality and complete product and feel what it's like the first time you are sent down in a pod to the depths of infested sci-fi catacombs Brings friends or join Discord don't in-game matchmake I have played enough of GTFO to say that it is genuinely an extremely good product If you want to play REAL multiplayer PvE where you are trying to survive with others against lethal enemies then this is the game for you There is a great amount of variety in the level design both visually but also game mechanics weapons special equipment strategic play styles and especially enemy types This game does not hold your hand and requires real teamwork Thankfully there is a great etiquette-driven Discord community that actually communicates during gameplay which is a must Even better with a dedicated party of 3-4 solo and 2 player runs are reserved for masochists and veterans as the game does not scale with party size

GTFO has potential but it feels like an unfinished project The game is brutally difficult which is fine but the lack of content repetitive levels and limited variety in enemies make it feel more like a tech demo than a full game The mechanics are solid but not enough here to keep you hooked for long It desperately needs more polish more content and a better sense of progression Right now more frustrating than fun If looking for a complete engaging experience GTFO just deliver
Jogo muito bom precisara de uns amigos ou uma boa comunidade ativa no discord pq jogar sozinho complicado

get the fried onions or gtfo is a crazy game about getting fried onions
Play this if you hate yourself
No
I feel things when the evil italian spagoot touch me
I'm too lonely for this fuckin game
Great game super hard and scary worth buying
This game disrespects your time It is a multiplayer game that requires 3 or 4 people and each level takes bare minimum of 2 hours of crawling through the level to be stealthy One bad move and you get to do it all over all 2 hours of it No pause button absolutely no room for failure Hope none of you need to take a bathroom break have kids a dog live in an apartment building have roommates anything worthwhile in your life outside of this game because go yourself it listens to your mic for loud noises On top of this it has some serious network problems I had the game crash twice and 3 times someone had a random disconnect When you disconnect from the party then everyone else has to go on without you The difficulty was 10/10 scaled for 3 players does not get easier so you might as well give up Can I do what the other players are suggesting Abuse the system kite this very one specific way Only use the meta Bunny hop to avoid sounds Sure but why What is the point It isn't fun
Super Challenging i love it
I love this game 10 neck stabs out of 10 triggered scouts

best game if only my friends would play with me
the game's dark and uneasy atmosphere will keep you on the edge of your seat everything you check for bio-signs when opening dors.and adrenaline will flood soon after once THEY hear you either by accident or after initiating a scan with an alarm involved These monsters used to be human.the many corpses in the underground facility in varying states of transformation provided the necessary clues for me a barely 6 hour mark player to figure out what they once were And I've yet to enter the deeper circles of this man-made hell

10/10
very much good
good graphics very intense and grippy but stealth is only a suggestion
peak aesthetics good mechanics and pacing and good gear variety for you to use kinda sucks there's no enemy scaling so you are forced to have a full team or be stuck with bots aside from that it's a really great experience if you are into stealth/tactical games
tedious and boring the opposite of what makes zombie games fun
good game good game
My friends won't play 10
its good probably
Curb stomp hybrids kill hybrids execute hybrid offsprings annihilate hybrids 360 no scope hybrids
Crazy good atmosphere Weapon-selection is nice however would love some customization options in the future I'm not really expecting any though The amount of hours one must spend to complete each rundown is crazy and good bang for the bucks Not as great a game for solo-gamers this has a lot of team-play with bots but there is quite a micro-management hell and lack of comms if not played with friends
the bots in this game are like my ex wife constantly bothering me but when I'm at my lowest they shoot me in the back and leave me for dead for me to get blasted by the evil alien drake snakes 10/10 I love getting railed by the p diddy of gaming
I did not GTFO
fire ass gasme grat to play with freinds 1000 worth
VERY NICE
Really great and fun game Sadly as a solo player it is hard to progress as the skill level required for even C-D solos are extremely high The AI are also very lack luster and can throw runs very often But other than that the game is enjoyable and really gives a sense of progression when you complete a level I do really recommend playing CO-OP but if you enjoy solo play or don't have any friends solo is still playable though much MUCH harder
The game is incredibly fun but it's incredibly punishing and hard If you and ideally 3 of your friends have the resillience and will to keep going you will find a gem I unfortunately have no friends who play this game but I still enjoy it Reccomend if you hate yourself
Atmosphere is cool but gun-play and combat are frustrating
GTFO is a tactical PvE Coop team shooter It's very fun and genuinely one of my favorite Coop games there is But it is NOT for the regular person This game is best played by two people Masochists and people who genuinely hate themselves This game's levels require cooperation strategy and the willpower to stop yourself from smashing your keyboard in pain when you die and have to redo a mission that took you several hours to do The mission in this game can take between 30 minutes and 3 or more hours depending on the mission If you don't have the right plan you die If you don't have enough ammo you die If you brought the wrong weapons the wrong tool the wrong boosters for the job you die Sometimes you have to redo missions just because you didn't bring the right stuff That said when you do bring all the right tools make the perfect plan and just barely get out with your life boy does it feel good
WHY THIS GAME CRASHES FOR NO REASON I LITERALLY JUST RE DOWNLOADED THE GAME AND IT'S STILL CRASHING
Just Yes no more to say Its Horror style FPS best of both worlds
i love this game so much but now that my group is divided i can't finish it still i 100 recommend this game if you have a group of friends to play with

Honestly really solid game The environments are spooky and it helps keep you on your toes This is not a shoot em up game this game requires careful preparation and tactical skills when playing You have to scrutinize and think about every movement every door that you open every consumable you pick up where you place turrets/tools and so on/so forth One misstep a stealth kill timed wrong or a misplaced turret could easily send you back to the lobby Gameplay loop and missions while somewhat repetitive are engaging and different enough to keep you playing The shooting is fun sound design of the weapons are good Your loadout choice is pretty good as well there are several weapons available to you that have their strengths and weaknesses You get a primary weapon special weapon melee and a tool Enemy variety while fairly simple is decent enough and different enough to keep things interesting much like level design My complaints with the game are pretty mild overall For starters I firmly believe all of the missions should have check points Not because I want an easier experience where I can be more careless but in the interest of time If you are careful calculating and thorough you will easily be looking at an hour play time for a single mission God forbid you you die at the end The amount of times I've died at the end of an expedition are high and stings each time I have to start all the way over Another complaint is the bot AI not the enemy AI but the team bot AI I dislike how frequent bots will steal resource packs when you open a locker or crate Then they will waste them or just straight up not use them AI commands are near useless The only ones that work 100 are the tool deployment and I've had good luck with objective based commands I won't say bots are useless because they shoot well and are overall helpful but I wish you could do more with them My final complaint is nothing more than more of a pseudo plea to the developers I wish we could get some more in depth reloading animations The team has created some interesting firearms in my opinion Yes some look like guns we are familiar with in the real world but they are interesting nonetheless I can see visible charging handles bolt releases and magazine catches yet they are not used It would be great if we could get more in depth reload animations/weapon manipulations using the mentioned devices For me it's a little immersion breaking just to see a magazine dropped and a new one inserted and bingo your gun is magically charged and ready to fire 8.5/10 for me overall
Scary shit fr
impossible to play without friends

El juego mas de jugar escasos recursos muchos enemigos y mapas bien extensos si intentas jugarlo solo vas muerto desde el inicio ya que muchas cosas pueden salir mal en muy poco tiempo El juego para quienes buscan un verdadero
Muito bom
Cara GTFO uma montanha-russa de tipo entrar num pesadelo COOP super intenso mas no bom sentido A atmosfera de arrepiar com aquele clima de suspense que te larga nem por um segundo A jogabilidade mega desafiadora te fazendo planejar cada passo com a galera pra sobreviver um daqueles jogos que te na ponta da cadeira gritando de adrenalina e gritando com os amigos tudo ao mesmo tempo Dificuldade 8/10 8.5/10 Enredo 7/10

Good game
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH LOCK TF IN
I don't really like walking in darkness and fighting thousands of monsters but this game was kinda fun I guess it is because of the cooperative Solving lvl by lvl with another 3 gangstas is joyful The design is not really my cup of tea but u join the process after a while The game is hard so u need to be carefull in moving and choosing of teammates There are no horror moments lol u have a giant gun in your hands B but maybe its a plus Some levels are too hard so u ll need to try again and again and even change your strategy can't just go forwad and destroy everything In my experience there aren't a lot of mob types but mb I've just played not too much 7 awakened sleepers 10

Get The Fuck Out
ever
Such m0re bugs ths game
wish the bots were better you could tell them what supplies to take tell them to conserve ammo go guns blazing tell them to wait in an area unless you get downed otherwise amazing game I'm never going to be able to play any other shooters because the guns here feel so satisfying to use and the missions are hard enough to feel satisfying
was good until i got hacked and the game was refunded then one of my tf2 items worth 30 cents was sold on the steam marketplace for 54.99 AUD Still a good game though
long time no see
very fun game that also makes you suicidal
Muito foda otimo coop
Top difficulty Hell is loose in this game Weird creatures Brutally deadly But manageable with tactics And friends And luck And experience Do not miss this one Its really fun Until all hell broke loose Then you'll yell to your friends GTFOut
Played this together with two Fellas when it was free for a few days We had fun but it did not motivate any of us to actually make the purchase and continue Also belongs more in the category of comedy instead of horror judging by the gameplay and levels we all played Encounters with enemies were rather predictable and you get the hang of it very quickly
GTFO
GOOD,BUT NO FRIEND
Agonia com o barulho desses dementes desses bichos e um escuro de querer rasgar o cheiroso num anzol Tem fase pra caralho e leva entre 5 e 6 meses pra passar de uma O jogo deve ser um tipo de pros seus filhos e netos To fud ido da agora Recomendo
Due to the amount of stress this game has caused me I'm probably going to die a couple years early 10/10 Buy this game and play it with friends
screw this game when I'm playing with ethan
This game triggered a stress levels are high remember to relax notification on my smart watch I think it shortened my lifespan Very happy with this purchase
Good game can be played solo but I recommend having a friend or two
Very challenging game requiring strong cooperation with your friends
FUCKING AMAZING GAME even if i have no friends 3
sleepers ass is more bigger than my future
This game is interesting and can be fun but I find it's difficulty ruins it for me A lot of runs feel like you got screwed over by RNG cause of ammo refills There also isn't really a progression system meaning if you struggle with a mission it won't get any easier and your loadouts probably wont change much overtime Also seems to be no intent of adding much needed difficulty settings
Let me first mention that this is not your typical run and gun shooter and when playing this game I highly do not recommend you go for the guns blazing strategy as that will get you nowhere Teamwork and strategy are critical aspects of this game which is why I highly recommend you get this game with your friends as it makes the game 100x funnier and enjoyable Great co-op shooter that keeps you on your toes throughout your entire play-through
Not recommend using a toaster to play My FPS goes boom boom Rundown 8
My friend scammed me 800nt dollars for this shit

Good
this game slaps
scary monster go brrrrrrrrrr
I recommend this game but it is the hardest game i have ever played Me and my teammate spent 1.7 hours to complete the first mission and we gave up later on One day we will have enough power to play GTFO again but i still have problems related to the psychological trauma this game gave me still worth it
This game is like the dark souls of cooperative shooters if only I had friends to play this with
Es ist Schwer aber es macht richtig bock
Fun game Paid for my trip to Sweden No but srlsy check out bricky's video on this game still by far the best explanation of the game and whether or not it is a good purchase The community on discord is good for finding people to play with and having fun if you are willing to use it
cuando les digo k no se muevan posta k no se muevan les voy a pegar por eso no pasamos ni el 2do nivel del juego c
googed
good game
not for the weak This game made me sit down and lock in for several nights with the squad being terrorized of doing missions over and over until complete Insane times great game
we are low on ammo we have to kill these two feelers without alarming them ok just killed the first feeler lets stay quite and get the other one two gunshots oh shit-OH SHIT FUCKING RUN
This game is like dragging my testicles through broken glass But I love it
Best game ever
Not bad wouldn't get it for full price though Aim for 15-20 USD if you see a sale
400
very fun my mental broke
FDCAFASFASASDAS
i think theres enemys right infront of us so lets go quie many MANY gunshots
GOOD GAME
The game is fun Now follow the objective stack and complete your expedition
I want a raise
This is a fun creepy game that I've enjoyed quite a bit I highly recommend against purchasing it unless you have friends to play with

best coop horror game
I LOVE THIS GAME
Kinda scared of the dark and that makes me a little scared shaken even maybe even a little startled I dont really know what these things are but buddy let me tell ya if I was naked pink and full of teeth this is totally what I would look like Also Hacket is super cute 3<3<3<3 mew
GYAAAAAT that sleeper making me act up for real
Forewarning It is not easy If you don't have a party to play with good luck
Game is worth maybe 10 not 44 CAD TL;DR game is hard but because of bad mechanics slow speed and janky enemies weapon feel is very meh especially melee animations Enemies attacks feel janky with ludicrous range They tentacle snap at you in unpredictable ways Damage feels random Guns feel like they shoot peas rifles are a joke half a mag of body shots for a regular enemy or 3-5 headshots Getting chased while out of ammo guarantees a hit per enemy chasing you as you cannot outrun enemies at all and reloading stops sprint This will result in you taking most or all of your hp bar with no counterplay That's terrible design Mission pacing is BAD Most of the time nothing is happening with a few moments where things are chaotic Worst offender is reactor defence missions where the mission has you walk in boring corridors for 10 entire minutes before the game really starts melee and gun feel is meh especially melee animations Melee range is too short to be realistic Most of what kills you is running out of ammo getting chased with guns needing reload again which guarantees your death if below like 60 hp or random garbage like friendly fire from turrets or allies Loot contains useless garbage that makes me wonder why its even in the game like glow sticks or big flashlights that make you unable to shoot 10 of the time enemies head explode but they aren't dead So they hit you for free Just why No progression or anything to work towards other than cosmetics that aren't really interesting Having to type commands in terminals to interact with them sounds cool at first but gets annoying real fast I avoid them like the plague unless needed
I love when when you use the spear and the butt haha please help me
Juego con mecanicas muy basicas buen marketing pero tiene muchos bugs

Great game fun with friends
You will die Together
i can see how people say this game doesn't respect your time the average play session is extremely long like hours long but if you have some friends and a few hours of time this game is a blast find it for cheap on a key resale site and enjoy a functional prototype to the co-op roguelite type of experience that helldivers 2 and deep rock have popularized but in a mature and eerie atmosphere
i never got the flip out
gas
id rather throw myself into a meat grinder than play this again

Great shooter equally terrifying as it is challenging
It's somewhat difficult
It's really good and underrated That's all you need to know
This game is absolutely insane oh my god
it wasnt me bro
dure tres horas en una mision y no se que me mato GOTY D
jogo bom,mas e melhor ainda com o amigos
With friends is fun without friends sucks
Stressful af but love it Play with friends tho if you don't have any commit tax evasion
Dificil partidas largas que explorar todo y tratar de conservar la muy cooperativo
if you like games that you have to work together with friends then get this game
I can see where this is trying to go A survival horror that requires team work and stealth I probably haven't played it enough to really provide a proper analysis on the game there are most probably loads of mechanics that I haven't discovered yet I maybe wouldn't describe this game as fun though I've spent about an hour playing and not once have I felt like I was having fun interested and intrigued maybe but not fun It's definitely not made for solo play bot teammates are provided but the game is just far too difficult to play solo I'm sure it has it's audience It's definitely not a bad game and on that basis I would recommend at least looking at it since this game is just a bit too unique to outright say if someone would like it or not It's just not for me
Can't play it coop and the ui bugs out alot the menu can give you a headache
Walking Sim with a few moments of firing your weapon throughout the mission The devs dropped the ball hard on this one HARD PASS

Good game Makes you wanna question your existence
Great game works shockingly well on my trash laptop
Really cool semi-hardcore fps with interesting design choices but a few problems First off the game calls itself a hardcore FPS though it isn't anything like arma or insurgency or even rainbow six It pretty much has battlefield mechanics standing crouching going prone and running/jumping are all the control you have over your character and the usefulness of the jumping aspect is questionable The gunplay feels great similar to a battlefield and that's about it Your ammo is scarce but you don't have to count magazines You have to be pretty accurate but the enemies aren't particularly hard to hit or have obscure weak spots or a shitty internet connection making them hard to hit or predict or anything like that The game pretty much has no standard hardcore mechanic though it does kind of have one the enemies in this game quickly overwhelm you That mixed with every other mechanic does in my opinion make it a hardcore fps but I'll cover the rest before expanding on that The enemies in this game are simple There's maybe 4 different enemies you'll encounter with a couple of variants So not a whole lot You'll occasionaly have rundowns which are the levels of this game with more or less unique enemies but they're rare and normally kind of boring But as I said before the game overwhelms you The variations in enemies make a normaly easy shot suddenly a lot harder when you're wondering what variation this one is That mixed with ammo scarcity and the naturaly fast moving enemies make it pretty hard to hit your shots but enemies hit hard even the smallest ones can kill you in a matter of seconds if you let them meaning you HAVE to take your shots which only serves to increase the pressure And then there's the stealth aspect which is where the game becomes problematic Most of your game will be spent being stealthy since the only infinite ammo you have are your melee weapons Enemies hit hard so when the shooting starts you won't want to be standing anywhere near them Meaning you'll want to use your melee in stealth to take out everything you can as fast as you can This makes the first missions really really long and boring which is where most players will end up quitting But as you progress the game becomes more interesting adding a lot of events that have alarms and either big waves or one infinite wave of enemies coming after you These events only add to the core gameplay forcing you into bad positions making you make tough calls more or less forcing you to make the best choices you can in a really bad situation If those missions were more early on the game would probably have a way easier time maintaining a healthy playerbase There's a few other things such as the hacking which is pretty fun but they're minor details The only other thing is the multiplayer The game is made for 4 players Do not play this game alone You will have a bad time Objectives and every other mechanic where made to be able to overwhelm a 4 player party alone you'll end up hating the game Either join the discord or play with friends the more the better Duos are okay with mods they're downright manageable but the game really shines the more players you have on your squad All in all every choice this game made adds up for a really fun and stressful experience that's awesome in coop but pretty much unmanageable solo it's only flaws are the early boring stealth phases that you only learn to treasure once they become less frequent and it's enemy variety that could have easily been resolved while still maintaining balance by simply having unique basic enemies for each rundown
I have only played for 3 hours on my own with bots to help 1 of the hardest games i've played I can't get out of the first area Would be a lot of fun with friends has that creepy feel to it like exploring the caves in the forest Definitely worth getting IMO
Very difficult very scary very fun Too bad all my friends stopped playing it a week after I bought the game Not like I bought the game to play it with them
h1]GFTO h1][quote table tr th url tr tr th th tr table quote][/h1
THIS GAME SUCKS unrealistic recoil trash monster mechanics not fun not able to get into it at all whats the point of playing this dog water of a game anyways and the graphics suck i cant even see half the time because its so dark its supposed to be scary but its just frustrating
Yknow This game has a LOT of problems that you'd think for a company would attempt to fix but hasn't really esp after saying they were moving on This game has its good sides and it has its hideous ugly sides its nice gameplay when it works fun to play with friends when it works has a nice story when your actually able to piece it together in some way or form somehow You can play as some silly men and giggle or just play and try to finish a level that isn't actually just hard but fair but just impossible and trying to make itself look fair but other than that its okay
GOD this is such a good game i love it so much Ive played alot solo and with a team and for me its always a blast and i just want and wish there was more

WHY ARE WE HERE JUST TO SUFFER
10 10 4PvE is pretty fun This one is more on the stealth side for most missions There are chaotic ones but that's just more fun You also get to type on the CLI Terminals NEAT 3 Note The difficulty used to be brutal but they added checkpoints at some point so it's more lenient for parents gamers on a stricter time crunch
GTFO Well I can't seem to get out anyway Unplayable solo but as a co-op teamwork game it is great
This game wow cool concept but the community is ABSOLUTE TRASHHHHHHHHHHH and the bots are completely useless just standing there and not even shooting anything
Left on the cutting room floor just 2 years after it came out Stealth is awkward enemies stupid and spongey This games really could have been something cool but it was just dropped out no where
Get The Fxxk Out of here GTFO
h3 h3
fps
get three friends ok
O jogo vale cada centavo Bem desafiador e interessante de se jogar com os amigos
Buy the game they said.It will be fun they said
I can't convince my friends to play 0/10
GTFO should come with a friendship warning We spent more time yelling at each other than the monsters did If you enjoy sheer panic pitch-black mazes and watching your buddy Dave accidentally alert every enemy in a mile radius this game is for you 10/10 would sacrifice Dave again
SCARY
I hate this game
THE BOTS ARE ARE FUCKIN POTATOE VERY DUMB WE DO NOT LIKE DUMB IN THIS HOUSE!1!1!1
wish i got the money for it
2 hours of mission without anyone saying anything in the voicechat cause I'm too scare to use Discord to join missions Yeah this game is perfect
i hope you like glowsticks
they give mad top
Pray to God you get out alive or you will get your butt touched
tecnicamente un aborto quando ricarichi l'arma non spara per tipo 3 secondi specialmente con il pompa l'animazione in ritardo i nemici a volte ti beccano da 10km e altre volte gli puoi correre addosso e non ti sentono l'obiettivo sempre lo stesso e ci stanno due mostri in croce diventa ripetitivo 0 checkpoint in mappe lunghe kilometri e ti tocca ricominciare da capo se muori e le partite durano pure 1 ora e mezza
O jogo bom encontrar partida para completar a sala sem contar que as pessoas caem ou quitam da partida e vc fica alone em 4 pessoas ja mto se sair alguem fica
hammer'em up
Really polished game with distinct gun-play and unique coop play-style that makes you feel like working together is awesome and if you prefer to play solo the AI is So GOOD and easy to direct Had great content and NO micro-transactions Great Game 9/10
its fucking good
O
The most intense PVE game I've ever played Phenomenal with friends but expect to sweat a little
Very fun game super intense
an absolute blast but can be difficult at times 10/10 would recommend

desnecessariamente e as armas horrorosas
Oh man Where to start look it's a 2/10 for me Bought it on sale and was excited to play it Let's dive into why it's bad First the annoying gasp during drop Yuck and you'll hear the same sound bit constantly each match Guns no attachments and no upgrading Yes it's nice you get access to all of them but ammo is scare Fear factor minimal Once you learn their basic traits its meh Duration I don't mind a long game but checkpoints need to be more then 1 per hour Lot of time lost for a fail due to something as stupid as a the bots not getting in the circle for a door to open and a endless wave hitting you Rewards cosmetics Legit 2 hours of gaming for a backpack skin You can't even see because it's FPS Weapon choices look they have a few good ones and the rest are basically asking the freaks to eat you So I found myself not even liking 85 of the weapons Yes I gave them a chance Overall pass on this you'll thank me

muy buen juego pero por favor mejoren la IA no es mala como tal la IA de pero si te tumban al suelo los que maten enemigos ellos solo van a intentar revivirte sin matar ni nada les vale madres que rodeado por 20 gigantes y 80 de los normales estos solo van a revivirte si no pueden pues se mueren y ya si te bajan vida y estos tienen medic kit QUE DISPAREN NI VERGA solo van a curarte aunque rodeado y necesites ayuda urgente estos solo van a intentar curarte o morir en el intento cuando le pides a uno que ponga la espuma esta que refuerza las paredes los bots son capaces de intentarlo teniendo una pared en medio y lanzarlo todo en la pared en lugar de a la puerta aunque marques perfectamente el centro de la puerta esto ya es mi punto de vista cuando tu tienes 78 de vida y ellos 50 cuando consiguen un medic kit priorizan tu a la del grupo yo prefiero que tengan vida ellos y no que se centren en mi para tener el doble de todo que ellos parece en cuanto a los kits tools ammo bag por favor que no lo pillen a no ser que se lo mandes para ahorrar trabajo bien simplemente hacer que lo pillen si lo marcas EZ si quieres hacer una kill con los bots tienes que matar tu primero y rezar para que estos maten al otro antes de que alarme al resto bien agregar que puedas ponerle un objetivo y que a la cuenta de 3 lo eso si bueno se si pudieras colocarlos donde quisieses en lugar de que te sigan todo el rato porque prefiero estar completando yo los puntos y que ellos defiendan la puerta a tener que rezar para que las torretas hagan bien su trabajo y esto ya desde mi punto de vista hay principal y especial que las bolsas de ahora te permitan gastar solo el 10 y elegir tu el arma a la que quieres darle odio tener 98 de en la especial y 24 en la principal y no decidirme de si gastar un uso de la bolsa o esperarme a ver porque no me gusta gastar tanto en un 2 y pues en mis 22h de juego las cuales la fue con bots de pues esa es mi muy buen juego pero la IA aliada se mejorar y mucho y se hacer algunas que otras mejorar a parte pero esta bueno aun
it is fun and worth playing only if you have squad of 4 ppl who will think before doing an action
Sad this game has so much potential Ruined by thousands of bugs Didn't understand why the game doesn't have that many players now I understand Might get it again if the bugs are fixed
good good game
It's my favorite game I want other people to like it as much as I do But be warned it is not a casual game Learning curve is tough and you must enjoy stealth If you don't like being anxious scared or panicked do not play this game It's dark its scary you never know whats around the corner You'll find yourself panicking as one by one your team mates are eaten alive by monsters in the dark They scream for you but your in a mess of your own No ammo monsters chasing you clawing after you as the alarms are blaring overhead inviting more horrors from deep in the complex You run but you don't know where to go because you've lost your nerve Eventually they corner you and the last thing you'll hear is a giant grotesque brute ripping you limb from limb as little ones scavenge over them If you can even make it passed the first level don't think you've accomplished much True nightmare inducing horror lies beyond You've only just scratched the surface See you somewhere in the darkness
fino
be quiet
Very fun and challenging requires lots of team work.and mental preparation seek therapist
do not get this game unless you have four people to play it with its impossible to play without as its incredibly difficult
Make friends
I really dig the aesthetic guns ammo survival gameplay and spooky atmosphere That said I personally can't bring myself to really play this as it's too tough for me This is one of those games where you HAVE to use a mic and you either need a dedicated friend group or have to go out of your way to join the game's discord server to look for people to play with The levels are hard but they're also way too long and if you can't beat the first levels some taking over an hour each then you can't even try other stages as they're locked until completion If you're into very punishing drawn out games that demand close coordination and voice communication then sure this game should be great for you Ultimately not what I was hoping for though
Das Spiel ist so extrem schwer gemacht dass nach dem 100 Mal Sterben die Lust vergeht Ist man gestorben darf man alles von vorne anfangen Die Level sind so gestaltet dass man manchmal 30 Minuten braucht um wieder dahin zu kommen wo man gestorben ist Dann stirbt man wieder und die geht von vorne los Man verbringt viel viel Zeit um immer wieder das gleiche Level zu spielen denn erst wenn man das Level geschafft hat schaltet sich das neue frei Das Spiel macht am Anfang echt aber wie gesagt das Sterben und nicht abspeichern nervt ganz gewaltig Nach einer Zeit wird es zu da man wie gesagt 1000 Mal von vorne anfangen darf Es ist nicht der Schwierigkeitsgrad der Monster das Problem sondern nur Mangel an Munition und Medi
Muito bom o game

A great team game Not got bored yet

i need disinfection
Super fun but needs to be played with friends
Really spooky game however I feel like the stealth could use some more tuning The Kika mechanics make stealthing sectors practically impossible wish they put more effort into the stealth side of the game
i love this game so far but i keep getting this weird glitch where a have this guy on my team named kika makes the game unplayable
game goes crazy unless you have a kika on your team

GET THE F OUT
very good
This game made me realize how awful my friends are at teamwork and timing It can be seriously ball busting but is genuinely fun
Look at a solid 4-6 hrs of game play videos to see what this game is actually like because that's the time its takes to realize that washing the dishes is more suspenseful than playing this boring half-assed slop well past the 2 hr refund policy The whole diving down the glory hole and not getting blown by the hoard seems suspenseful at first But the game play narrows down to sneaking around and playing fetch all the key cards like the good little dog wh*re you are Just about as suspenseful as wiping your own ass Don't trust positive reviews and don't buy this dog water
cons no player/enemy scaling so whether you play by yourself or with 4 people there will be the same amount of enemies no weapon attachments cant put on a silencer for a game that requires silence you have a mine GUN but you have to place the mines the gun doesnt even do anything if you play with bots they will be uh demented sometimes you will melee 95 of the time shoot 5 because you will run out of ammo in the first 20 minutes and then you're screwed this game has what is called boosters which is essentially a perk system but they are consumables so once you use em you lose em and you have to grind your ass off just to get them this game is considered horror but the only thing making me sh*t my pants is the fact that i spent 20 bucks on this good for nothing waste of developer mountain dew sweat garbage they call a game AND ITS 50 OFF Pros if you're into hentai this game has tentacles that loop around the map just to feed off your bootycheeks My advice Play this game if you want permanent regretful out of 20 bucks depression
fallout new vegas was better
wasaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I find this game to be pretty fun most of the time It does get pretty crazy as you go deeper but it is still fun It's near impossible to play alone on harder maps though Sure you can find some sweaty kid that pulls it off with the bots but that's like 1 out of 100 runs that it works out that way The bots are stupid and piss me off more than anything Can't tell you how many times I have domed stupid ass Bishop because he's shot me or constantly moves into the line of fire Anyway if you have a team or just a couple other friends to play with this is a great game Easy to pick up but very difficult to master All in all a great game though Catch it on sale and it is definitely worth it
relaxing
en vrai le jeu est un peu cool
I do think this game is worth the 120-160 cuz without 3-4 players you gona be able to experience this game properly so sadly for you solo gamers this is an automatic deal breaker To those who have managed to convince their buddies to shill out the money and give this game a try while there are MANY things about this game that will frustrate you to no ends once you sunk your teeth into it the first 50-80h is honestly magical To put it simply there are NO games like GTFO the game has an incredible premise with an amazing sense of atmosphere the combination of total silence and suspense as you are sneaking across a room full of enemies only for the game to throw you into a brutal chaotic shootout the moment someone make a mistake is amazing The sound designs are top notch from the crunchy reload and firing sounds of each weapons to the otherworldly growl and tick of each enemies the total darkness that permeate each levels illuminated only by the faint glow of the enemies and your flashlight This artistry behind GTFO is simply phenomenal This game foster a sense of cooperation and trust unlike any coop game i have ever seen if you try and play selfish and recklessly YOU WILL DIE even the most skilled players can not beat the game solo without resorting to exploits and cheats most combat encounter will require some level of basic understanding of team synergy and roles and the hardest missions demands near perfect coordination and maximum efficiency to beat Which is why GTFO is best played with friends you know personally rather than randoms as you all progress deeper into the complex so too will your understanding of each person strength and weaknesses giving you a very real advantage when tackling the harder missions as you all can distribute roles and strategize more effectively This is where my praises for this game ends however once you sunk your teeth into the game probably around the 100-150h mark realize that GTFO is probably one of the most poorly designed game ever and is the very definition of wasted potential The first and most glaring issue is that this game NEVER changes level designs enemies mechanics mission objectives Throughout the 83 total missions across 8 rundowns the first 5 offers nothing new and everything encounter in the first 10 missions is ALL you will ever see for the rest of the game saved for rundown 8 as when the devs actually bothered to create something new for once This isnt too much of an issue for casual players who just hop on for a few sessions but for anyone wanting to see everything the game has to offer you will probably get burnt out from playing this monotonous mess of a game by the time you finish rundown 5 Secondly for a game with such a heavy emphasis on player cooperation and mechanical skill that rewards players for thinking ahead instead of blindingly shooting everything on sight It sure has a lot of RNG in it a victory in GTFO is achieved by setting up little advantages that eventually tips the odd in your favor however sometime the game will just decide to screw you over by having alarm scans go into unfavorable position or spawning the objective item way further inside the room than usual RNG is fine when used correctly and carefully cuz an easy way to keep the game from being too predictable but GTFO leans WAYYY too hard on RNG for a game that is supposedly all about player skills Having a good run ruined due to elements you cant influence feels horrible and being handed a free win cuz RNG decided to play nice feels undeserved and cheap Thirdly this game has some of the worst mechanics and balancing i have ever seen being unable to drop items is moronic and having an unkillable enemy that RESPAWN EVERYTHING that you just killed honestly dont know what to even Out of the total 41 weapons 18 primary 15 specials 4 melee 4 sentries nearly 90 of them are filler garbage that are completely outclassed by the meta picks once the player learn how to use them properly while meta picks are usually inevitable in a lot of games most of the non meta weapons here just feels awful to use and in a game as brutal and oppressive as GTFO it usually result in players taking the exact same 2-3 weapons for every run you can argue that no one is forcing anyone to use the meta weapons but there's no denying that by not using them you are deliberately putting yourself at a disadvantage Lastly.the bugs visual bugs checkpoint bugs game breaking softlocking bugs poor optimization that cuts your frame in half this game is held together by glue and duct tape in a game where a slightly delayed reaction can snowball into a defeat these bugs are extremely frustrating to deal with and the horrible frame drops is a massive hindrance to your overall performance one of the hardest mission in the game have you running at like 30-40fps for the majority of it All in all while this game is objectively a janky buggy horribly designed mess that stops being interesting after the first 50h there's no denying that GTFO offers an experience unlike anything out there A game with so much to hate and little to love yet i'd still recommend this game wholeheartedly just please dont try and 100 this game it is SO not worth it b]S b
I use this game as my sleeping aid cause after a session I will be so exhausted I will fall asleep the moment my back touch my bed good ass game
Great game crashes to much i get anger ism each time it crashes and now there isa small tumor developing in head and my pc inst potato so i do not know why it crashes and im about to flip my table each time that i encounter rude angry Chinese users in vc
if you don't have friends don't bother games pretty fun but extremely difficult and heavily team work oriented
stay together the darkness might save you but not the sounds you make

The hardest game to solo But not impossible
Love this game Devs did a fantastic job The creatures and the environment do a great job provoking thought to stratogize and work as a team to survive
The part where we get the fuck out is cool 10/10 would get the fuck out again
a poorly put together game It tries to be both a stealth game and a combat game The result is that not good at either You have all the weapons unlocked from the start and the majority of them are boring The UI is incredibly bad especially in the lobby/menu it looks and feels like a beta version The skill/trait system is terrible You collect artefacts during missions and after collecting X amounts of artefacts you unlock a ONE USE trait you can bring with you on a mission I have no idea why people praise this game so much If you want a good Co-Op game I recommend that you get World War Z Aftermath instead
nobodg want to play more than 1 mision robert wont come on anymore
I hate those crawling things Especially the lock on attacks from enemys Other than that very fun with friends
Je me suis 4h d'y jouer pour jouer avec des potes mais vraiment j'aime vraiment pas ce jeux perso il me fait peur il est et dur pas chill du tout violent j'aime pas perso mes potes aimaient donc chacun ses

good game
pure pain and suffering
one of the best co-op game out there.if you even got atleast 2 friends to play together it's a 100 game you should play or atleast try and i'm giving you the guarantee it won't dissapoint you
GTFO is a cooperative first-person shooter that plunges players into a tense and immersive experience This game stands out for its intense atmosphere challenging gameplay and reliance on teamwork

A bit expensive but offers a bunch of different unique levels and intriguing game play A flawless mix of stealth and action paired with a nice amount of freedom for creativity Oh I forgot about friendly fire

The game is boring or difficult But then again boring-difficult
TLDR Picked two copies of this up during the 24 summer sale at my son's request Definitely lives up to it's legendary hardcore/difficult tags While I enjoy horror swarm arena linear and other co-op shooters there's something distinctly lacking from this title a sense of progression and satisfaction for being a good prisoner After a 1 to 2 hour stealth slog through a maze of doors while searching for a key-card to open a door you've passed you think you'd have a sense of satisfaction for completing said challenging labyrinth In reality receiving a random cosmetic is about as disappointing as it gets There's no ranks to be achieved no customization options that indicate your level of experience and certainly no good news for completing a bloody joyless romp through hell I find the game exhausting to play because of it's repetitiveness and almost mandatory requirement that you wait on enemies to stop glowing before you can pop their dome in order to move on It's pace disruptive and boring to have to stand their and wait to take your shot If you are playing with only one friend like my son and I you are sure to share struggles with the incredibly poor AI of the bots who accompany you Bots these days are a necessary evil The bots will unintentionally wake enemies by going loud if you don't get a one-shot kill with your melee weapon bots will shoot you in the back or the front with high power weapons that you equip them with and bots will steal items from you they are out of if you aren't quick enough They also have a nasty habit of blocking your vision by walking directly in front of you at horrible moments 10 Chambers nailed the atmosphere and gun play pretty fantastically The scifi universe is a personal crush of mine and often times I make excuses for poorly executed games that claim to be hardcore scifi horror just because of the thrill accompanied by exploring a hostile new universe There's nothing hardcore about ammo starvation horrible melee mechanics and garbage alternate items that are far too abundant here's looking at you glow sticks and lock melters especially when what's needed is a placeable checkpoint There's no room for pregame experimentation with the diversity of weapons all available to you from the beginning which is sad There's no true in game explanation about just how much you can do with the terminals you come across Lacking explanations is another area that I don't find justifiably hardcore You can go ahead and eliminate half of the FPS Player base by creating a world like this I do enjoy experimentation but also enjoy not feeling like I have the opportunity to play with others and not hinder their experience by looking like a total scrub Last but not least for those still interested in giving this one a solid go not recommended CONS 1 No checkpoint system some missions can last up to 2 hours if you're doing them as a purist 2 Mandatory stealth engagements 75 of the time 3 Resource starvation 4 You will struggle to see some missions are pitch black from beginning to end 5 Disappointing rewards upon completion 5 missions have netted me 2 helmets a back pack with a flower in it a chest piece with octagons on it and the color purple for my longjohns You literally get nothing else other than boosters which I'm not even getting into 6 Combat appears fun and flashy at first but alas you'll take damage and not know where you took it from unless you see it happening PROS 1 Great environmental atmosphere 2 Interesting enemy design although very repetitive 3 Cosmetics look good 4 You get what you pay for no microtransactions which is a massive thumbs up from me Again TLDR I will continue to chip away at this one when I find the time but for what it's worth I'm not suggesting that you do There is something about it that I find just mysterious enough to make me want to come back but I'm sure that will wear off quickly Edit While I still really think the longer missions need checkpoints I'm changing my review to recommended but ONLY if you are a fringe gamer with a strong masochistic side I guess even when playing alone with bots most of the A through C tier missions are doable Much more doable with other humans however If you're a fan of dark horror and being brutally punished by one of the steepest learning curves I've come across and enjoy tactical action sequences where careful planning truly pays off then by all means get it on sale

Genuinely a really good game and i enjoy very much 10/10
it's cool but boy it can be really annoying sometimes with having to deal with some enemies and boring objectives If you can look past the stank parts and you have more then two friends give it a shot
Fun to play definitely need at least 2 other players though as there are plenty of situations where an AI teammate is utterly useless But if you've got other friends to play it with super cool spooky and all around good time
Very Teamwork heavy and the bots kinda suck so yeah
This game too ez I have almost 30 hours and I already finished the tutorial
awesome to play with friends
Hard
Best Co-op.exe
yes if u like monster gyatts and darkness
Been forever since picked up a shooting game Can say this one is real enjoyable due to its HIGH difficulty level Little loot all down to sneak and aiming skills Do not buy this game if you want a walk in the park easy shoot at whatever and doesn't matter if you make the shot or not
Friends are forcing me to play this game I keep screwing up their campaigns in return I hate it but love pissing off my friends so I love it as well

Thrilling and exicting
I got out

AWESOME GAME
7/10 Atmosphere the Game Only we never actually got as far as I wished mainly due to the difficulty of certain levels spiking way too damn hard Case and point the mission in which you have to escape up a spiral stairway while fending off an endless horde and doing timed check points Its slow It sucked And even with careful planning we kept failing And I like to say the boys and I are really good at it too So yeah I recommend it but my god does it need teamwork
very good game
Age Rating 17 Blood and gore Intense violence Disturbing imagery Genre(s Co-op FPS Horror Tactical Game-play Players will group with 3 other people to take on levels rundowns with main and sometimes side objectives that get increasingly harder as you progress you will be able to choose your own weapons and tools beforehand and as you play and coordinate with your teammates you will scavenge for resources like ammo and health Most enemies are asleep and give you the option to approach encounters with stealth using a melee weapon Strategizing is a must and dying is a teacher to get through each level Difficulty Very difficult expect to die a lot Visuals Visuals are nice and have a good horror aesthetic utilizing dark and low lit areas forcing players to use their flashlights to navigate each level Sound Design The sounds and music are reactive to each situation sticking to a low droning sound when all is quiet spiking when killing an enemy in stealth and picking up full pace when fighting off hordes of enemies adding to the intensity Replay Value Lots of replay value as enemies are randomized in number and location each time Closing Thoughts Overall this is a great and sometimes aggravating experience and is at its strongest when playing with a group of friends There is an active Discord for this game with lots of people willing to join you on your dive into the hellish environment that is GTFO

Really good stealth game with friends but a bit too sweaty
Fun game to play but you'll need a number of friends in order to play it properly There's a number of rng aspects that only playing with multiple people can truly rectify
spooky
Played during a free weekend a while back 2021 don't remember much from back then besides it being a hell of a lot of fun to play with my buddies 10/10 Chambers
bock schwer aber einfach geil
please for the love of god give me a checkpoint i am begging
amazing game
get the fuck out
Boring
nice
extremely good co-op game requires friends requires a lot of coordination
8h playtime 2 successful missions i love it BUT The bots are so fucking retarded Unfortunately
Make sure you and your friends have a lot of free time some levels can take hours to clear The enemies are asleep and your melee weapon is your best option to deal with them If one of them wakes up stay quiet and don't panic Use your melee weapon to kill it before it screams If it screams be ready to fight a horde
I don't understand what people see about this game to give it such good reviews The whole gimmick of this game is it being extremely hardcore but in this case hardcore is synonymous with monotonous The entire game is just wandering around a map crouching half the time bonking sleeping enemies and then when you actually have to shoot the only real challenge is that you absolutely need to hit every single shot you have or you're going to get overrun The hardest part about this game holding your will to not just go guns blazing out of boredom I fucking hate this shit and feel like I got scammed buying this game It's no wonder only 16 of players bothered to finish the first level
The PooP you suck but get better in time
patience is virtue
Boring ahh game
Awesome game You definitely need 3 or 4 players to survive if you're completing a mission for the first time though
GAME GOOD I POOPED PANTS ALSO THEY REMOVED SCREAM AT START VERY SAD
Worst matchmaking in history of co-op games
Boring
This game is like a domestic violence relationship It can be an extremely difficult at times and buggy but when you put time and effort into it your effort pays off You'll see people saying that the GTFO community is toxic and extremely mean in retrospect PLAY WITH FRIENDS This game is amazing with 2 to 3 friends and can be great at building communications with them I suggest this game to people who love a challenge and are willing to get their ass kicked multiple times before they learn a Rundown
good
doido
Its so terrefying i love it
my first time and it will get your blood pumping
the main menu is gross
truly game
I tried this game out during the free weekend and this is one of those cases I wish you could put a Maybe on wheter or not you recommend a game Because there's some genuinely good stuff to be found here The setting is perfect the sound design is terrific and the enemies are genuinely unsettling That said me and my friends tried for over two hours to just get past the first level We played it smart avoided as many enemies as possible and only engaged them when we b]had[b to due to alarms the game forces you to trigger Yet on the first level on the easiest difficulty we died over and over again at the same stupid locked door because the game b]forces[b you to stand in very specific spots in a tiny room while enemies are actively swarming you otherwise the progress on getting the door unlocked won't continue This to me is absolutely inexcusable Because this is a game where you have to play it smart and think tactically because you have very limited resources and just a couple of hits from even the weakest enemies are enough to kill you I really wanted to love this game but in the end none of my friends decided to get it
The GTFO community is quite toxic but the game relies heavily on playing with others so its kinda difficult to suggest this game
This game is slept on Just know you're getting into something brutal and unforgiving Keep a bat and something large and destructible nearby to smash to pieces instead of your keyboard

One of my favorite experiences and co-op games I've played plus the sound design is amazing would recommend playing with friends or use the discord server that still has active members
Can not play the game at all FREEZES on Steam deck
Not really for me but you might like it
wish it had more players

This is what it feels like to be a little boy in the Vatican
challenging but fun as hell get some buddies to play with and you'll have a good time
If you have committed friends a group then you should definitely consider this game If you do not then this is not the game for you

TLDR Extremely slow boring unrewarding and annoying Boring If you awake the enemy you will get swarmed and depending on the level probably die So you are strongly encouraged to conserve what little ammo and health you have by sneaking around slowly and killing enemies with your melee There is no sneak mechanic beyond crouch walk until they are partially alert and then hold still until alert is down repeat until within melee range This makes for slow boring and repetitive gameplay Unrewarding Slow sneak stop wait slow sneak and melee the entire room difficult to coordinate with mouth breathing matchmaking partners Great that took 5 whole minutes Now activate an alarm door that will trigger a horde to swarm your exact position requiring you to set up turrets to survive There was almost no incentive to spend your 5 minutes clearing that room methodically Did that for the entire level Cool you get more bland clothes and barely useful buffs you can use once There is no reward to clearing a room correctly and no reward to beating a level Annoying This game doesn't know what genre or type of game it wants to be so it half asses multiple instead It's a bad stealth game because you aren't really rewarded for being stealthy and there's no mechanical depth to the stealth It's a bad action game because you will not have enough ammo to finish what you start should you choose to play it like an action game It's a bad tower defense because planning and placement are devalued by the devs making turrets intentionally miss have little ammo and take an obscenely long time to recognize a target and start shooting
I do it all for Daddy Warden
Fun game best with friends Otherwise it is going to be a grind Really enjoying it with a couple buds right now
cool game would love some more recon items
Unrelenting suffering and pain an overall excellent experience

this game IT HATES YOU
ALORS LA 3 HYPER DUR pourtant je suis au sol mais mes mates sont forts normalement et j'ai rien compris au lore du jeu
Too many terminals
Consider the following What if instead of the enemies being called Sleepers they were called Freakers
yeah
1 After having bought the Game you have to accept Terms and Conditions if you dont accept you can not play the game I already payed for the Game this is unacceptable 2 The spray and ammo mechanics are bad and the developers make it playable by adding auto turrets which do everything for you TLDR just go play L4D2
wrong side of heaven
Matchmaking is atrocious but great game
It's very difficult but the monsters and weapons were cool I think the UI is confusing took a bit to figure out how to make a lobby with friends as random people kept joining in I think the more people you have with you the better It was hard with just two co-op
Graficos muito bom vale a pena Jogar com os amigos e top de mais
Excellent game with rich lore and terrifying stages that are constantly evolving to keep the gameplay fresh
4.5 5 3.0 5
Work together or die together This quote has defined many of my losses and many of my wins The game truly lets the players learn the game for themselves letting mistakes be made to be remembered GTFO prides itself on its difficulty and trusts the players to overcome it introducing new mechanics frequently most of which being obstacles they put a lot of content in this game The story is interesting whether you find much of it or not actually explaining everything in the story pretty well The atmosphere is great though rooms are repeated it does make a sense f dread hang in the air If you play with friends randoms or even the terrible bots GTFO will make you feel like you need to triumph the impossible and then do it again

best game you suck at
This game is incredibly challenging yet gratifying and fun Success requires great strategy and perseverance as repeated attempts help you learn and improve Playing with friends significantly enhances the experience and makes progress easier I would say that teaming up with someone is practically essential
Very good game
Me apaixonei pelo jogo desde o mas que ele tem muitos defeitos Me dar uma negativa em uma obra que gosto Tentei com dois grupos diferentes de amigos que se frustraram e abandonaram o GTFO por diferentes motivos Dentre eles Muito stealth em certas fases Quem ansioso simplesmente aguenta repetitivos A partir da segunda campanha as fases ficam mais diferentes mas mesmo assim Sem meta progresso desbloqueia roupas Sem novas armas equipamentos e coisas do tipo para que o interesse seja mantido Fases longas entender o quando o grupo morto no fim de uma fase em que investiram mais de uma hora Tentei continuar sozinho Se pretende fazer o mesmo desista antes de Os bots tem comandos Por exemplo consegue pedir para eles carregarem um item de objetivo e as vezes precisa levar dois simultaneamente pegarem um ou trocarem de com um bom jogo mas a falta de algumas coisas faz parecer que em acesso antecipado Tentei colocar alguns mods para tornar os bots minimamente mas tem como

I watched a good bit of this game and thought it looked fun to play IT IS GTFO is a very fun and difficult fps game with amazing lore and a great community Be ready to fail a l o t though
Testei durante o fim de semana e um jogo extremamente frustrante e desnecessariamente Joguei com 3 amigos e nenhum de conseguiu se divertir Falta mana e vida constantemente os objetivos nem sempre de identificar e quando o grupo morre precisa voltar pro inicio da sinceramente uma perda de tempo
really fun and challenging game
A horde shooter where you never want to shoot your gun because that means something has gone horribly wrong or you are trying to survive against an incoming wave of 100 zombie things Join the official discord grab a group of 4 and remember stealth is paramount to your survival Play it like Left for Dead and well you will die
Es muy dificil jugarlo solo y si lo juegas con amigos te quedas sin amigos 10/10

OH NO
I had been on edge about buying this game for years now almost since its release Had the opportunity to play it on a free weekend and it sold me That being said you do kinda need friends to play it It's not easy It's no walk in the park There is no upgrade system to make it easier It's just you and 3 others with nothing but skill and luck With friends easy 8/10 By yourself man it's harder 5-6/10
Great game just not for me
Gunplay is bad and stealth feels random

Como persona que tiene mucho sexo a toda hora puedo decir que este juego es 100 parecido a tener sexo con una mujer como yo siempre hago Obviamente este juego no me puso caliente no soy gay yo tengo mucho sexo con mujeres reales como para gastar de 15 minutos en este juego Por otro lado me recomendar este juego a la gente que no tiene sexo no como yo porque yo tengo mucho sexo con mujeres mucho como si hubiese una mujer desnuda y desnuda Ella se ve como una de mis varias novias con la que tuve mucho sexo He tenido mucho sexo soy muy guapo y las mujeres SIEMPRE quieren tener sexo conmigo porque soy muy musculoso y guapo y muy bueno en los videojuegos Todas mis novias dicen que soy muy bueno en el sexo y jugando videojuegos y siendo guapo Una de mis enamoradas me tener sexo con ella pero le dije que estaba jugando un juego de sexo y a llorar y se hizo lesbiana y se porque no tuve sexo con ella Tengo sexo con mujeres no con hombres no soy gay Soy muy cool y guapo que las chicas siempre quieren tener sexo conmigo porque soy muy cool y sexy Mi pene es muy grande A todas mis novias les gusta mi pene porque es muy grande y soy muy bueno en el sexo y lo soy tengo mucho sexo soy muy guapo y sexy y tengo mucho sexo En conclusion No me gusto
Great game to play with friends and while the bots can be annoying to work with at times I had a blast playing through rundown 1 solo
Great game Nuf said

GTFO is a horror fps game where stealth matters most on a rundown aka mission the ui is pretty confusing and after 26 hours of experience it's still confusing AF visual wise I mean the ui is good but it hurts my eyes a lot and I don't know if it was my eyes or the ui in this game is the one playing tricks on me and I can't unsee what I saw The game is pretty hard at first especially when you don't know what you need to do so here's a some tips advice and tricks that'll help you understanding this game But first you gotta know what you're keybind is b][u]NOTE THAT I'LL BE ONLY MENTIONING IMPORTANT ONES AND ALSO NOTE THAT THIS KEYBIND IS SET TO DEFAULT[/u][/b b]E[/b Interaction of an objection such as using terminal opening/closing doors hacking placing/picking up a turret and using items b]F[/b Toggle off/on flashlight b](VERY IMPORTANT)[/b b]TAB[/b Shows you a map and the location where you and your team currently are b]O[/b Shows objective of what you need to do to that rundown b]Middle mouse[/b This pings doors and resources in front of you b]Zone[/b every zone has a terminal and a subzone to identify which you are in you either go to the door close the door and there you will find the zone you are in you can also find the zone you are in through terminal typing b]"INFO"[/b b]Sub-Zone[/b this is like an extension of the main zone which is similar to the main zone to be honest there's not much of a differences between sub and main zones except it's just an extension to increase resources and zombies/sleepers/Mutants b]Zombies/Sleepers/Mutants[/b in a preferred way and most common way to call this is a zombie officially in-game they are called SLEEPERS each one has a different types of zombies/sleepers/mutants I won't spoil much and let you experience the fun of identifying each one of those but I can give you an advice to handle a normal sleepers optionally of course so feel free to ignore the one below this with black/censored text u][b]c!SPOILER ALERT PROCEED WITH CAUTION b][/u spoiler]Ways to handle and avoid sleepers sleepers once awaken they'll wake up their friends in that room the most common way to avoid this so called sleepers is not to wake them up how to notice if they are waking up A sleeper will growl or twitch in a moment they notice you and you'll see the sleepers glowing meaning you either have to move quiet when I mean quiet you have to move when a sleeper is not twitching/moving/growling or glowing with flashlight off otherwise it'll wake them up and other common method is to kill stealthily and unfortunately some sleepers requires a significant synchronization with the team for some sleepers that are next to each others[/spoiler b]Terminal[/b this is a tool where every zone has this device helps you a lot finding what zone you need to go and get what item you need/want to understand this more better there are some commands you need to enter first and the most basic commands you'll need is QUERY LIST and PING this command will help you most of the time I will also provide explanations how this 3 basic commands how it works below b]Commands[/b this command allows you to see what available commands you can use on that terminal b]Query[/b this command allows to know that the objective or item you are looking for is on a what zone to use this command simply type in the terminal b]QUERY[/b name of the item)_(unique id of the item b]Items[/b every item has unique ID next to it to identify which allows you item to ping an item you want for example MEDIPACK_722 HSU_635 AMMOPACK_921 Key_(color)_580 b]List[/b this command helps you identify which item was left in the current zone you are in to use this command simply type in the terminal b]LIST[/b b]E[/b]_(Zone you currently in b]Ping[/b this command allows you to ping whatever item you need in that zone the other players can also see this ping meaning you can rely on your teammates finding the item for you as a terminal user to use this command simply type b]PING[/b Item name)_(item unique id b]ADDITIONAL USEFUL COMMAND[/b b]Info on this command it allows the terminal user see what zone they are currently in in the terminal it says b]Welcome to the terminal_[/b](unique item id b]Currently found in Zone_[/b](current zone That's all I hope this helps new players I really like this game and I really recommend this game playing with your friends families or co-workers b]10/10 GREAT GAME b

Only just started playing so I haven't a clue how to GTFO But so far i'm enjoying the challenge the process of figuring out the right tactics working together and learning from mistakes Absolutely love the atmosphere of the game as well and that claustrophobic drop into the maps really sets the mood for whats to come
yes
An exceptionally fantastic game and experience through and through Every level is unique and interesting requiring learning adaptation planning teamwork and communication The eerie atmosphere and scarce resources do very well to make you feel that you are screwed at every turn and when you somehow pull it off you feel great Especially when the game taunts you with so many damn glow sticks and long range flashlights instead of the tool or ammo refill your team desperately needs
Peak
I'd rather drag my nuts across poison ivy and then slam them inside a pressure cooker
Finally a game that perfectly captures the essence of being forced into a terrifying pitch-black hellscape with your least reliable friends It's like a team-building exercise from the depths of your worst nightmares 10/10 would panic and scream incoherently while getting devoured by monsters again
Really fun and difficult stealth/strategy game Worth on sale
WOah
I thought they were bluffing when this was the Hardest co-op shooter I have not played a harder shooter game than GTFO
This is easily the most enjoyable co-op game available It doesn't treat you like an imbecile or your teammates as brainless sheep it challenges your strategic thinking and adaptability to unpredictable variables especially in the context of your teammates and highly dynamic surroundings each level changes every time you replay it with only the core principle of passing the level remaining constant This very well-thought-out immersively atmospheric and unforgiving game ensures every step matters from the rundown selection and your team's gear choices to setting priorities and executing coordinated strategies As you progress through rundowns the stakes get progressively higher in each and every zone where even standing up from a crouch in certain occasions can instantly annihilate your whole team Now let's put aside its respect for players IQ and address the functionality to play with actual players Wait a sec did I just say functionality Lmao If you don't have THREE friends who own this game and are willing to play it daily until you complete all the rundowns DO NOT BUY IT The matchmaking system is a DISGUSTING UNBEARABLE ATROCITY Yes you can use Discord there is a well-established way to get teammates quickly Yes you can add on Steam those decent GTFO players you miraculously found through matchmaking But other than that you will be playing Disconnecting-From-Lobby Simulator either because of ping issues or because people are chasing particular rundowns It's rare that they'll accept whichever rundown is chosen because they have either played it numerous times or have not played it yet so they want to play rundowns in order even tho there's nothing in the story that they'll miss or gain by going out of order It's all about the specific zone you are in and your engagement with it
Great game but you need 3 friends
One of the greatest games i've ever played
load up on what you can to survive

Played over a free weekend Was thoroughly surprised by the size of the game given the amount of content available Played it with one friend and really enjoyed what we played For the price you can get this game on sale I would recommend Most of the negative reviews I have seen have been about the game being difficult to get into But if you have played games that require you to input some amount of thinking and strategy you will be able to get past the initial learning curve quite quickly
It's not fun to play even the multiplayer is already a challenge to find someone who want to play the same level as you and co-operate
Excelente
amazing co-op game
you will not want to stay anywhere in the game you will always want to get the fuck out of the mission you will always want to get the fuck out of the situation ur in ur going to always come back for some reason to do it all'over again because something twisted in you loves it
I really would like to like this but even on the easiest difficulty I was unable to finish any mission This might be a skill issue or the lack of stealth But having finished games like elden ring i doubt thats the case Most randoms love going in guns blazing and im one of those Problem is ammo is so rare or that a single player takes all the ammo only to end up dying few min later Other than that the game has an amazing atmosphere rich options in weapons and intresting consepts/puzzles Please add a beginner friendly alternative with more ammo And I'll reconsider the review
ii
My hubby says this game is good y
horible dont own it so i dont know why i can rate it but it sucks
fun with friends im going to kill myself after i post this cause i got none
No tengo la mas puta idea de lo que estoy haciendo y por eso me encanta
hard
This game is sick really good story and a really cool game loop Having every tool unlocked from the start allows you to use any strategy you want which is more uncommon in games that said this game is VERY punishing make sure you have some friends that can buckle in for it or find some friends online
GTFO aka get the fried onions 100000/10
GOOD GAME
great if you have a squad to play with Demands flawless teamwork on higher difficulties but feels extremely rewarding when you manage to beat a stage together with your buds Wouldn't recommed going in solo tho
I installed the game started a mission with bots and got devoured by an army of mutants seconds into the mission It was a very fun experience that I can recommend to everyone
Fun and cooperative just make sure to have friends to play the game with or use the official discord and get some friends that way the game just isn't the same without people to play with
Yes
play this game solo if u hate urself
really fun
Super fun challenging game Honestly don't know why more people don't play it
9/10 would be 10/10 but one of the achievements has a grammatical mistake
This game would give me back my virginity if I wasn't already a virgin

10 Chambers c'est des anciens qui ont sur Payday 1 et 2 et qui se sont faire leur propre studio Quand on voit Payday 3 et quand on voit GTFO on capte vite se sont les les plus Chopez 3 potes et jouez-y vous verrez le jeu ne fait pas de cadeau au mais il est beaucoup plus qu'aux premiers abords et il vous mettra en tension constante dans des maps claustro au possible
Very cool game but you need a lot of patience and you have to think twice about every next step it's an absolute team game

This is a game not for the weak This game is a test One that tests you every second of every mission Your Teamwork is tested your planning is tested your Aim is tested your Stealth is tested your Hearing Restraint Speed Efficiency etc You and your teamates make or break the mission and is rewarding like no other Work together or Die together ROCK AND STONE
Spooky team play at it's finest

Team-Based Gameplay Players must work closely together to solve puzzles manage resources and fight off hordes of terrifying enemies Atmospheric Horror The game excels in creating a tense immersive environment with dark claustrophobic settings and eerie sound design Challenging Missions GTFO is known for its difficulty requiring precise coordination and communication Each mission is procedurally generated ensuring unique experiences Stunning Visuals The graphics are top-notch enhancing the horror experience with detailed environments and creepy enemy designs
this game is so alphacore
A game where you play as a mentally ill homeless man with his 3 friends forced to survive the horrors of L.A equipped with shitty box cutters and other various implements as the government sends you on various suicide missions through skid row

honestly pretty good getting touched in ways my uncle couldnt by the tentacle man and trying to be quiet with my clicky ass keyboard all things consitered 10/10
The game is impossible without a functional team Matchmaking does not work The entire discord is edgelord tryhards If matchmaking worked or if you've got some reliable people to play with best coop horror shooter ever made hands down If you're hoping to find someone to play with via the game itself give this one a pass
I have PTSD
me caguei nas
Nunca me he divertido y estresado tanto jugando a un juego pero este de es muy bueno pase horas y horas hasta que incluso la del tiempo cuando termine el juego como un que creo que no se llenara con nada aparte de una entrega gracias Persona 5 Royal por tantas horas de El GTFO es bueno tambien y lo recomiendo
it's about stabbing butts in the dark

played for 2 hours with friends Got to the second alarm 10/10
definitely need friends to play this game
Pho KING SLAPS yo Momma Honestly its wild that lethal company even exists when you could be playing this non meme game Its left for dead meets old rainbow six with a little bit of looting and LOTS of stealth Deceptively difficult all you have to do is cooperate and you'll be fine
very good game
I really want to like this game The guns feel and sound great The world and the enemies are creepy mysterious and I want to see more The core gameplay is thrilling and satisfying when it works But as a newcomer to the game via the last free weekend I am definitely feeling what some of the other reviewers have The game's checkpoint system should be revamped The first mission gave my team a checkpoint in the middle of an engagement halfway through This was great despite how it might sound It perfectly loaded the encounter when we tripped up later and we were able to complete the mission And that was the last checkpoint we ever got during our gameplay We played two other missions and any kind of checkpoints would have been greatly appreciated in those especially after the game set our expectations they would exist It would be great if these checkpoints were user settable via a consumable I would love to find a mulligan unit between all those glow sticks and lock melters I want to change this review to recommended later As far as feature requests this should be a reasonable one and one that should greatly improve adoption player satisfaction and profitability
HAO
Superb game Fun to play with your hommies and chill Creative game But should add a item drop option my opinion
its difficult yet so fun Its a great game to play with friends I recommend playing the game with friends

this game is 100 fun though its gets repetitive quite quickly as the way you learn in this game is by dying all around fun though would recommend if you want a challenging game with some friends
All of my friends are dumbasses what the hell

Lucas told me to buy this trash game
Is become sale after I buy full price
launch game sneak up on monster hit with sledge hammer he is mad almost shit in pj's get jump scared by 40 goobers rushing me pj's promptly shat refund game so i can play other game 10/10 game
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING BUT IT IS WORKING
Jugar solo este juego es un asco recomendado para jugar con los amigos
es un juego
Y*U
Its good Really good But it's very hard You need patience wits and the support of like-minded people to survive the storm of shit this game drops you into on each mission To play this game you absolutely must have a microphone and people willing to work together and communicate effectively in order to win otherwise small mistakes will snowball into a lack of health and ammo that will prevent you from coming out on top My squad of 3 got roadblocked on like the third mission and had to slow down and really consider our strategy to pull off a win When we did it was by a big margin cause we'd figured out how to operate together effectively No matter how good you are at shooters this game is gonna make you think to win and that is a huge plus where I'm standing
goated game
gg
Best co-op experience of my life And pretty cool horror designs
Short thoughts are Its a pretty shallow game that artificially increases its runtime through a mixture of bugginess intentional softlocking a tutorial that actively teaches you how to play the game wrong and by hiding objectives If you know the 3 things the game wants you to do it's a relatively easy walking simulator with a fantastic atmosphere that brags about being so epic cool and uber hard The game intentionally turns away new players which is likely why it never caught on For those who are interested an extremely passionate and wholesome community are both happy and ready to give as much help as possible to acclimate new players and explore a stunningly terrifying world together GTFO's community will work together with glee and die together with laughter They always have a door open for new prisoners Just make sure you do some research beforehand and get the game on sale GTFO presents itself as a serious challenge but the bulk of the game's difficulty is just that it doesn't feel like hooking you or showing off the actually pretty wide variety of problem solving tools you have at your disposal While other game intentionally design challenges to guide you towards discovering these tools and let the player's creativity guide them to their own solutions GTFO is content to just point you to a zone and let you figure the rest out GTFO's gameplay can be broken up into 5 sections 1 Slowly sneaking through pitch black rooms to stab sleepers This will be the vast majority of your playtime There are no stealth mechanics beyond not waking enemies up Stealth is neglected to a disappointing degree and to the point it actively sabotages the play experience as enemies will not un-aggro even after killing whoever alerted them They will instead run across entire maps to attack other players 2 Standing in circles at doors and shooting a few dozen enemies AKA the horde shooter part There is some interesting depth to this segment of the game as the bulk of your loadout's sole purpose is keeping you alive here Interactions between tools selective closing of doors and found equipment can make a security door extremely difficult or painfully easy The most seems to go wrong during these sections which leads to rapidly improvising updated defenses and doing your best to not be overwhelmed These sections can be tense stressful and an auditory treat 3 strike Death Stranding strike Aimless wandering to fetch an item/key You're only told the zone an item is located in and items range from being hidden in locked containers to being placed surrounded by non-intractable map props You will not be given any sort of heads up that you found an objective item and hitboxes are frequently buggy so expect to occasionally not notice you found something integral to progressing the level The location of objectives is somewhat random so this portion of the game mostly serves to waste your time At computer terminals you are able to query list and ping objects to identify the region of the map an object is located in which speeds up searches significantly and rewards good team communication Unfortunately for you you will never be told you can do this so get rekt cuz our game iz eXtreme 4 Wildcard objectives which literally just don't tell you what to do You will occasionally receive objectives that do not list object names zones or otherwise point to anything These objectives serve to waste your time and usually point to either a hidden command on a terminal somewhere on the map or an object on the map that otherwise needs to be interacted with You will not be told you are able to do either which is unfortunate because these interactions are actually pretty interesting 5 Getting The F*ck Out At the end of a mission you will be prompted to evacuate Music grows tense the Sleepers are woken up by emergency intercom notifications and everything is now sprinting towards you You need to make it to the evacuation point usually at the very beginning of the map and survive until you can be pulled out by the Warden with whatever resources you have left Tense exciting and extremely fun I genuinely have no complaints about this Nothing is designed to waste your time nothing is intentionally hidden nothing is designed to softlock you It's as straightforward as can be The big thing you'll notice is the game loves to waste your time and considers either not giving you directions or intentionally hiding features difficulty There are many MANY complaints you could have such as guns being weak objectives having next to 0 variety meaning that missions only differ by locale a lack of narrative in a narrative driven game the same don't wake the sleepers up voiceline playing every 30 or 40 seconds the fact that sleepers use an MMO style damage system so you essentially automatically get hurt in the range of a sleeper which strips all the skill from encounters the fact there's an in-depth dismemberment system but it doesn't actually do anything the lack of checkpoints in almost every level among MANY others GTFO plays like an early access game and not like one that's been out since 2019 Early access in 2019 and fully released in 2021 I've heard many people defend the game but bulk of it is usually It was so much worse before which isn't really a good sign From a new player's perspective the tiny player count means that matchmaking doesn't really work and you're going to spend most of your time playing solo where many of the previously mentioned problems are even more apparent While the developers are obsessed with hostile design intentionally fucking with new players and wasting as much of your time as possible a wholesome and helpful community has somehow blossomed around GTFO If you hang around GTFO servers or forums the community is extremely quick and happy to give advice tips and even party up to guide you h3 Final Thoughts h3 While most new players are mostly going to be turned off GTFO the game's player analytics make that clear the community is always there to help interested prisoners figure out how to thrive and survive If you're willing to join a discord server GTFO's biggest hurdle of being extremely hostile to new players is easy to pass Once you have a basic understanding of the game's mechanics there will be a lot of aha!"moments that will make GTFO a memorable experience I could never recommend it at full price but the current sale price of 20 makes GTFO at least worth checking out As long as you're willing to do some research beforehand GTFO is a pretty neat little game
ta bueno pero es para jugar con amigos
hush
Fun hardcore stealth extraction shooter but must have friends to play
I LOVE THIS GAME It is so fun I didn't think I'd like it but my friends peer pressured me to play it and it is so fun The only downside is it is a MAJOR time sinker one area can take you 1-2 hours It is so worth it I couldn''t recommend it more
Seemed very flat graphics were amazing but and animations but PVE is just so boring and repetitive but people love it so what do I know
so fun w friends
With friends this is Awsome
pretty good game i jsut wish it was a lot cheaper than 20 or 40 dollars but its worth it if you play with your friends often i wont but its worth the money wish there was more stuff to do like more levels though
el juego y esta bastante bueno pero es mas divertido gritar con tus amigos
O jogo bom mais Requer muita inteligencia algo que tenho

I played through the free trial they gave for the weekend and I plan on buying it This is probably one of those top most strategic games I've played and that's something I enjoy especially with good friends I suggest this very much even if you have only 1 friend to play with those classic bots Hackett and Bishop gonna do good enough for you They even thought of the frusturation of the mistakes of the bots and make it so that it's harder for them to make mistakes that'll give you trouble like the monsters are being less sensitive to them and such that I've noticed I also really like how you can command them to use their tools in specific areas and whatnot and they listen hell they even thank you if you give them consumables I also really like how the monsters interact with players they ocasionally light up but they also light up when they detect you nearby and you never know if they light up because they detect you or if because they are just chilling And that pulsating effect for when you're about to cross the line is just such PTSD lovely enemy design The loadout mechanic is made perfectly nothing to to pay to unlock just get guns and go blazing or go sneaky Generally speaking I'd be hard addicted to this game if I had it and I am planning to get it
moi good
good hard most times but good
My most played game I enjoyed the atmosphere more than anything and there's been very intense extraction moments when everyone is making a mad dash One guy missing his C-foam on a door to block the horde behind us while another tries to mine the door but it breaks open and triggers the mine killing both teammates The final teammate kept running and extracted with a horde in his face and 5 health left Good times
Honestamente no suelo hacer de juego pero se lo ha ganado Debo decir que el juego por la temporada de juego gratuita de fin de semana y lo inmediatamente Me La apuesta de ser 100 cooperativo Me ha gustado que el equipo debe trabajar unido para lograr los objetivos a diferencia de muchos otros que apuestan al PVP El mundo Es simple y nada novedoso en el sentido que ya existen mucho de CiFi futuristas y pero creo que en GTFO bien logrado el contexto los objetivos del juego y las El suspenso Este aspecto me resulta bien logrado ya que me a como Alien o Outlast al estar en la oscuridad de las salas inferiores y el intentar avanzar en sigilo para no agotar la poca disponible es diferente a los juegos que porque te puedes defender y disparar hago referencia al suspenso La versatilidad Creo que ofrece una libertad que se agradece para alcanzar los objetivos de cada y generar una estrategia acorde al equipo con jugando Permite variar en y formas de juego La dificultad Considero que GTFO no es un juego ni que se pueda terminar de una pasada enfatizo que es una personal de que si juegas con personas que no conoces lo hace interesante Variabilidad de armas Creo que las opciones de armas bien aunque creo que ser al igual que las especiales Creo que se puede mejorar Existencia de armas en el escenario Creo que a pesar de comenzar con tu equipamiento decidido para la a realizar interesante encontrar armas que no estuvieran en la de arsenal y que dieran una ventaja sea una amplitud de cargador balas perforantes otra mira silenciador etc Poder dejar caer objetos Creo que positivo poder dejar caer objetos para compartirlos con tus De modo que si elegiste un arma que otra persona puede usar mejor poder compartir o al dividirse poder compartir equipamiento Agregar objetos Creo que muy interesante objetos ocultos como una linterna frontal que ilumine que se agote su ya que de mucha ayuda alumbrar pero que no sea una ayuda permanente Un silenciador para ciertas armas que se gaste Monocular o objeto para ver lejos nocturna que se agoten sus pilas distractor con ondas para que las criaturas vayan a atacar por un corto de tiempo

I wish matchmake team maters weren't re*arted 10/10 game
The matchmaking on this game is literally dead you are forced to join the community discord to play with someone and thats a terrible red flag for me If you buy the game with mates it will be fun for you but otherwise dont
a mi me gusto el juego pero de verdad necesitas puedes jugar con la ia si pero realmente necesitas jugar con personas para poder hacer bien las misiones
One of the best designed co-op games i've ever played Unfortunately that means you need 3 other people who know what they're doing but once you do its great
eu preciso mesmo falar algo Eu joguei pouco porque testei,MAS JA FOI O SUFICIENTE mas queria mais kk editado:man comprei o jogo e quando me dei conta ja tava com 4 HORAS de game

I've been wanting to play this for a few years but never had a group to play with The game is great however I do have a few problems This game is the equivalence of going through a dark abandoned warehouse in the middle of the night during a new moon with 5 pairs of sunglasses on and only having a candle for a light source Game is dark AF in some areas which isn't a big deal overall adds to the spook factor but it does make some missions a pain since you can't see anything Enemy variety is a bit low so you will find yourself sneaking and fighting the same few enemies for the entire game which does get a bit boring The only form of progression in the game as far as I've witnessed is completing the rundowns which are handcrafted levels with some random elements and getting outfits for your prisoner All weapons and tools are unlocked right from the start Biggest complaint Whenever you leave the rundown(a mission there is not an animation or short clip of your prisoners re-entering their pods or anything The game just ends and you are taken to the end of mission report screen regardless of what you were doing This is jarring af and I would like for the devs to add something hell even an audio clip saying good job prisoner right before the screen transition just so I don't get ripped from the game like that mY iMmErSiOn It is a stealth based game with some forced combat encounters but you are not punished badly for wanting to play a little loud Some guns are under powered ngl with some gear like the mine layer not being super useful unless for very specific situations Mine layer mines can blow open doors if you place too close btw My guess is the mine layer is for dealing with scouts A ton of enemies spawn during alarms and they chew through mines making them only useful for the first wave All in all game good with friends
good

A lot of walking silently which isnt the kinda game me and my friends are looking for so we won't be getting the game for full after the free trial
gtfo
Lo siento pero no osea por hay sigilo en este juego si luego vas a tener que activar de una alarma por narices y liarte a tiros con armas que son una mierda y que normalmente escasa Contra bichos que tienen una del demonio y que en ocasiones tras volarles la cabeza te siguen zurrando No es ni un juego de sigilo ni un shooter es el hijo bastardo que nadie quiere porque saca lo peor de los padres PD para aquellos que piensen que hay recompensa del esfuerzo no la hay Desde el principio el juego te da todo lo que vas a necesitar Lo que ganas tras pasarte una son y la de que eres bueno en juego Que a algunos les vale en mi caso personal no
BOOM
Those monsters Look kinda thick ngl
hard but kinda rewarding it cost a loooot but stil its good but pls can it be for 60pln C
immersive isn't a good enough word to describe this game really really fun stuff sneaky gameplay with some seriously tense and entertaining moments but like each mission is super long so make sure you have the time to beat it i guess play with friends bots are awful reactor alarm from R1C1 gives me ptsd

Game Good
It good but if you can command NPC to melee a target that would be nice
Team Kill
Im going to write this on two different languages so it be easier to read,Game is really epic,visual and sound its perfect have a unique atmosphere Team AI can even do something good game be much much better if you have friend to play with even more better if you have a few I sure you go from all kinds of fun situations from failled hacks that gonna cal everything alive around you or oopsie with shots or nades anyway am recomend that game am dont have much time to play it becouse am a student but it was enough to anderstend what game give you also interact with console who would know they put consols to give you hints where object is also there no visual hints where needed object so you can lose a lot of time seeking it also escape be tough there wave of monsters coming at you they endless so safe as much ammo as posible playing stealth like you can't push there P.s
I am a little bit sad that I did not play more on the free weekend because I think it MIGHT be something I COULD get into but ONLY because I am so out of other stuff to play and get bored and not exited about games the older I get But from the little I came to know it was not really my cup of tea I was hoping for more hordes and like coop killing many enemy waves with limited animition I was thinking its was more like Vermintide 2 just with limited ammo and horror to it Turns out its a lot of stealth and HUGE maps with doors everywhere and for sure not fun with noobs who just start shooting Difficulty feels to hard to get into with random players We got overwhelmed so fast so quickly in situations there did not seem they should be that hard when you just trying to learn the game The enemies that shoot these things in an arc at you seem to be unfair it seems like their shots home in onto you even when you dodge you get hit anyway Not sure if it just feels like this or its its just true but to me it always looked like I dodged their shots but got hit anyway Having to go steath all the time and just one mate who can ruin it is not really what I expected High stakes for sure but just I imagined this to be different Again I guess I could force myself but the stealth element makes it worse for me I had one guy in a team who put up his sentry gun everywhere I guess this is the wrong way to do things as the wake sleepers up and then there will be a mob against you Even after telling him this he continued to do it I just figured this out with common sense and observing Am I wrong I read its not fun with randoms and that its hard to actually finish as you just get into random maps with Matchmaking and not somethign you actually want to complete Unity has no DLSS or FSR Why I noticed this in multiple Unity based games I mean it runs OK without but I for sure would like to get more FPS anyway Again not really what I expected Barrier of entry seems to be too high I realize a free weeking is probably the worst time to start the game but isn't up do the devs to account for that
its really fun its jsut not known to much and definently need friends to play
very fun but i suck at stealth 👍
Very fun and challenging
Really hard game play with freinds or make sure everyone has a mic and speaks english Had a bunch of tards or non english speakers in my game which basically makes it impossible to coordinate you need to use terminals and computer commands like ping query etc to find items/rooms and you need to communicate over the mic what the code to type in is to the person waiting at the terminal etc etc I did not enjoy it enough to buy it but there is a good game here
I like the watermelom
Tutorioal good 👍 game only free for weekend i couldnt play more
Extremely Hard for me my friends can't event finish the 1st stage Perhaps 4 players could help to finish it Teamwork also very necessary Overall it's fun to play with your friends you just need a bettter teamwork strategy
Jogo muito bom de dificuldade realmente desafiante para jogar com os amigos tem grande necessidade de e Garantia de horas de game play eletrizantes e divertidas pela inicial acredito que as algumas fiquem um pouco repetitivas
fun 10/10 gameplay
its so good the graphics is good for u know 12 or 13 gb of space it still has room for improvement
Very hard Very long
I've only had ONE bad experience with the community but this game is pretty good Bots don't trigger any and everything great for revives and actually follow instructions Great scares in the game but I'm just getting through my very first mission SUCCESSFULLY R1A1 Can't wait to play through the rest
I like this game because it offers an intense and thrilling experience that relies heavily on teamwork GTFO excels in creating a suspenseful atmosphere with its dark foreboding environments and eerie sound design making every moment feel tense and exciting Teamwork Challenging Missions Graphics and Sound Replayability Atmosphere

HARD AS HELL If you and your friends are bad at stealth synchronization BUT y'know otherwise it's really sick Great atmosphere sick looking creatures the bots suck but like y'know Wouldn't recommend if you're not into FPS or horror games but if you weren't you wouldn't be here
I played this on their free weekend deal My friends wanted me to play it with them cause they enjoyed it It was okay I prefer the high action breach and shoot type of game I feel the marketing leans way too heavy into that aspect of the game considering 90 of it is sneaking and very quietly avoiding the enemy Also the tutorial doesn't really help you understand your objective quite as well as I'd hoped I played a game on my own after my friends and I died in our run I got to the last objective of collecting a sample and had no idea what I was looking for I had to look up on google what exactly I needed I figured it was something in a box or locker like most items All in all it's a good game if it's your type of game I enjoyed it I might buy it not for 40 though
Really an amazing game
Spookems galore
Quite Fun but too many of the games design choices dont complement or outright ruin each other A primarily stealth based team coop game where you have to tactically preserve ammo health equipment With mandatory force broken stealth sequences that bombard you with too many enemies and push you out of your advantageous positions to be sacked Enemy models clip through map terrain and geometry to hit you doing around a quarter of your health if its melee or a tenth if ranged They shoot you ranged while being impossible to see as they stand in the pitch black darkness and pelt you
h3 Work together then die together h3 b A stealth-focused CoOp-Shooter think Metro meets Dark Souls b list b]Preparation:[/b url WATCH A GUDE url b]A Tier:[/b Levels that can be played by anyone Solo 3 Bots or CoOp who has played a shooter before Usually completed on first try unless you never played the game b]B Tier:[/b Levels that can be played solo 3 bots by a mediocre shooter player or in CoOp with inexperienced friends Usually completed on second or third try b]C Tier:[/b Hard Levels for good 2 player teams Bots Think Dark Souls difficulty Usually completed on forth or fifth try b]D Tier:[/b Extra hard levels for good 3 player teams Bots Not always beatable by mortals b]E Tier:[/b list I have 170h in game and 2/3 completion So there is definitely sufficient content

good game they do freaky shit with there mouths i fw it
Fun and exciting game The sound and the AI of the monsters are great.Love this game
Ottimo gioco difficile ma tattico ho apprezzato molto il tipo di gameplay un po particolare dove si basa sullo stealth e nell risparmiare e usare le armi nelle situazioni movimentati
Not free anymore
Didn't like their in-game UI nor the tutorial gameplay A tutorial is meant to teach us what to do but in this game it's like you're playing a mission without any basics I really hate how their UI keeps moving when you move the mouse but thanks for the free trial

How is this getting very positive reviews Combat is horrible and stealth is horrible
I played this for free on the weekend and I had fun with some friends It's a pretty solid game runs well but I would not recommend it unless A It's very cheap at the time B you have friends to play with and C You have ample free time While the gameplay is solid enough it's very slow paced simply due to how the game pushes you into crouch walking two steps stopping for 5 seconds repeating repeating repeating finally stealth melee an enemy and repeat This can make simple missions excruciatingly long and a little too repetitive I simply do not have the attention span required for this personally however depending on who asked I may still recommend the game to them it's a solid 6/10 game with serious pacing issues but a fun experience for a little while if you can get it for a substantial discount I feel the free weekend was about the most I would want to play this personally
very fun die a lot scream in advanced darkness would VERY MUCH recommend
bonk
Un gran juego divertido para jugar con amigos y con una buena El detalle que me ha gustado es la buena para ordenadores con SLI que hace que se vea espectacular si tienes varias para usarlas todas
MY TEAMMATES ARE ALL MORONS
I was playing for fking 3 hour Test version just for 1 match exactly at the 2.59 hour it just kicked me out
Like Left 4 Dead or Vermintide but if everyone was constantly desyncing and hits didn't register half the time The core concepts are pretty cool but the execution is lacking
h3 h3
good
40 euros for this nty very repetitive thanks for the free trial
it an amazing game the graphics are amazing too also the Melee option amazing so keep up the good work 👍
que good eh essaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Great Game Really hard needs Friends to play with
Was Fun Playing it for the weekends for free with my friends and would recommend it to others to play with friends as the AI is kinda bad
Remember to take a pee before playing The gameplay is great but the play session is so long Avoid peeing your pants while playing
its hard to lern and not fun at first if you'r not playng with friend but after 10-ish hours it started to be fun all the missions are at least 1h and the first rundowns(missions have allmost no checkpoints you allso have to beat the mission in one sitting so don't buy this game if you don't have a lot of free time(my first mission was abt 4h and i lost cuz i didn't know what the objective looked like
My friend poop his pant for playing GTFO too long
Extremely exciting and Co-op game highly recommended to friends parties
A game without any microtransactions without any unnecessary and distracting elements and without new updates overwhelming the progression I'm so glad I decided to download it will definitely buy it after the free promotion ends
20 1
tanta roba sia da solo magari un po noioso sia in gruppo Coordinarsi per attaccare silenziosamente o alla tank maniera davvero tanta roba.moltissime armi difficile al punto giusto Un comparto grafico niente male Consiglio al 100 per gli amanti del co-op
Nice Idea less than nice execution everything looks the same all clues are environmental and if no one comms then get wrekt

La pqtp Hong deja de moverte con los tentaculos
Harder than my cock when I see your mom
apos anos finalmente tenho esse jogao hardcore
Controller support doesnt work well at all and I refuse to use m&k Controls make it hard to get past missions where the ONLY way to survive is to sneak around stealth Not a fun experience and graphics could use updating
Actually very unique horror shooter it is hard but you can do most of the level with bots I played with only bots i don't like to play with randoms and actually the bots not bad and had fun play with them but idk if there will be any update but i hope the developers would give an update to the bot ai to be more intelligent and do more tasks and pick up more type of item
Does not run on steam deck Would hard freeze shortly after starting Tried on two different steam decks
OK GAME kinda boring repetitive at times
Such a good hardcore game Fun stealth Give me a free copy please
Work together Die together
Repetitive
Just Nah Movement and interface feel weird most of HUD is too thin and transparent and requires getting used to same as inventory management Health bar often blends with envirement game starts in 1080p on medium settings by default main menu gives off this feeling like something is not working correcly or that it was ported from VR due to the spacial effect and overall just game that pushes for stealth approach on players to avoid mayhem that mainly feels like L4D game with KF2 graphics Repeatative game grab a card use the card find a card open the door find an upgrade get to the door leave an area move to an area with limited objectives and enemies Glad i could verify that without spending money on this game Completly not my jam
Why do horror game developers keep making the bad guys just naked people It wasn't scary in The Forest it's not scary here it just looks silly
um otimo jogo para jogar com amigos sozinho n~~ao da
Funny glowing man get mad Team wipe Me sad
Really fucking good if you have friends But You absolutely need at least 1 person to play with This game is nigh-unplayable without people/a person to play with
O jogo bem divertido e completo Jogar solo mais complicado os bots ajudam bastante que pode usar comandos e eles alertam os monstros um extraction shooter com diversas de armas para usar e objetivos para completar os bonitos e as possuem um design interessante
Awesome
I love the dystopian genre this game is everything I would die for this game I absolutely love this
haven't played much but on lower levels you can play it like Doom 10/10 I am going to be overrun on higher difficulty for sure
played during a free weekend can't recommend pros good graphics can draw dicks on the map with your friends cons abysmal UI EVERYTHING you do requires for you to hold down something rather than making things fast and simple with clicks and quick key strokes i wish i could say that was the only downside of the UI but it keeps getting worse crowded menu screens that are hard to navigate health/ammo/tool bar placements are all around the screen when in game and just overall messy design there's nothing good that i can say about the game's UI boring areas and low visibility in game your visibility in game is like if someone ripped a fat wet fart right on your screen and the fart cloud now floats on your screen for the rest of times it's clearly a design choice just not something i like enemies are boring take a human model disfigure it a little put some teeth in places where they dont belong glowing bubbles tentacles or stretch the model to be taller/bigger bam you have a gtfo enemy gameplay the game WANTS you to stealth your way through 80 of the enemies but doing it is really really boring take out your melee weapon hold m1 go up to a sleeping enemy release m1 while aiming at their shoot me here"-glowing weakspot rinse and repeat 20 more times until you've cleared the room combat is bad guns are not satisfying i picked out a heavy machine gun and a pistol in my loadout hoping that i could utilize the pistol in places where shit hadn't quite hit the fan yet but ended up finding out when it did that the machine gun did less damage per shot to enemies than my pistol what doesn't make it any better is that your screen shakes like you're in the middle of an earthquake whenever you shoot and the fact that one of the common enemies is someone that shoots fast projectiles that are hard to dodge and eat up your health like a fat guy eats up a slice of pizza in a buffet there's no directional damage indicators so you won't know where you got hit from until you look around it's an overall bad experience boring surroundings every room looks roughly the same just shelves/boxes/other scrap that's been placed differently with some different lighting effects at times pair this up with the fact that there's no minimap but a map that opens up on your entire screen and you're going to have a bad time facing hordes has been made as boring as possible need to get through a door to your next area expecting a creative turn of events that triggers the horde to come your way maybe breaking through the door having to punch a hole in it payday style no it's just security check on that specific door that blares alarms because why not i've seen reviews saying how this game is somehow innovative a breath of fresh air and even genre defining i don't see any of those in this game go play left 4 dead or left 4 dead 2 those came out over 10 years ago it might not be the same but you'll notice the similarities in gameplay the catch is that left 4 dead just did it way better nearly 15 years ago this game ain't it i wouldn't buy it even for 5 bucks
muy bueno me encanto esta muy inzano

interesting game not my type but still keept me interested i think people who are into horror should try it but the game is very simple im hoping theyr new game will be more to my liking it looks really good
Before I played GTFO i had a small wee wee no friends no girlfriend depression and absolutely no will to live None of these things have changed but the game is pretty good
Buen juego buena dificultad esta guapo con los amigos y es divertido pero como los trakers disparan balas teledirigidas y las balas escasean que da mas miedo que los enemigos le pongo un 5 recomendado XD
10/10 would smash
PUTA MIERDA NO HAY BALAS ASCO
The game has 4 player slots and tries filling them once usually fails to fill them and start the game instead hanging at waiting for match indefinitely until the host quits the lobby After a couple tries with just one teammate I was able to finally get 2 people and me in the same lobby and start Unfortunately nobody understood english in any round I played so teamwork was limited to pinging things and trying to stay together Coming from DRG which has flawless matchmaking with a simple UI trying to understand how to even launch a lobby successfully here is not user friendly and I am not going to matchmake with some other external tools Maybe focus on actually allowing people speaking the same languages to find each other instead of all the fancy unnecessary main menu transitions The actual gameplay didn't wow me it's a co-op shooter set in dark foggy corridors with solid weaponry and glowing zombies around every corner If I could actually play a round with 3 other people and talk in the same language then it could certainly be a great game And on sale it's priced well enough that I'd give that a pass anyways and just play it but it literally doesn't let me except for the few times it dropped me with people from russia and china where I couldn't understand anything So yeah I absolutely cannot recommend it and I have no patience to spend my limited gaming time with staring at menus
So I played this since it was free over the weekend and I was really really frustrated because I was expecting to have a Co-op zombie horde power fantasy but then the game bent me over the table and taught me a lesson with all my little friends watching I hated how punishing and methodical the gameplay had to be and put it away After giving it one more shake though I came to realize how gratifying it could be to approach this game with a very careful strategy My friends and I spent hours on just the first mission taking every room and scan challenge slowly optimizing the different tools we all had and setting up positions and contingencies and whatnot and it was actually really satisfying to get past those challenges So after the trial and error I'd say this game is worth getting into Price is steep though Papa needs to buy Killer Bean first
After playing this during a free weekend I really do like this game but not enough to pay the exorbitant price for the full release Not even worth it on sale Instead of down to The biggest reason for this is the lack of a safety net when you fail Before anyone says anything I'm well aware that's the point of the game but it is just too unforgiving for its own good I can imagine myself becoming incredibly frustrated after sinking at minimum 30 minutes into a session for it to be completely wiped and receive nothing back for the time you've invested into it Overall though a very good game with a great world atmosphere gameplay the works Just such a shame it costs so much
boring repetitive and not scary
game too hard
I used the Free Weekend 3 days to play this game A difficult game if you do not like to read stuff Played with some friends and we failed like a pack of wet kittens I enjoyed even playing with 3 bots and we did not get very far in the game I might buy it in the future when I win the lottery So wish me good luck

Gotta say Yes but The china 1 people are rampant and hack the game and take up english player slots
cool
Very stealth based You need a lot of communication in the game and someone to be leader to direct everybody and have things neat and organized if you arent a pro The whole group cant move together always for practical reasons so sometimes you have to send people off alone to run lower risks of dying Teamwork heavy strategic objective based mission based zombie if u can call them that shooter Sort of like Doom Eternal except theres 4 of you and none of you are the Doom Slayer or have his privileges Other comparisons you can say its kinda like a BO1 zombies specially map five Dead Space combination Just keep in mind that the game will give you a headache because it is HARD difficulty wise Also forgot to mention its like left 4 dead but combined with Rainbow 6 I know its a weird game
Muito bom entretanto tem como jogar sem as DLCs(terapia e psicologo
work together or die together
I love this game the gameplay is familiar but also unique The only downside I can think of is that this game lack a progressing system I wish this game had more upgrade mechanic or something similar not just booster and some cosmetic that we players don't/can't pay attention to during a match
Its realy good tryed it for free im buying it for sure
Now this is my type of game when teamwork really makes a difference in gaming it just feels nice to have a team in general and this game is no stranger to that Perfect gameplay in my opinion vast weapon selection which is something i really like and yet of a all a fantastic story I love GTFO

good
I sit on the terminal half the game because it literally stunlocks all of my friends
would be better if i had friends to play it with i personally just didnt find it scary at all its too puzzle centered for my taste and it asks way too much coordination from 4 random people
Imagine you're Vin Diesel pulling another career stunt possibly involving leaping out from a tank that was launched out of the international space station and reentering orbit while a hot babe is wrapped around you for some unspecified reason Vin Diesel will aced this stunt no problem For the rest of us mortals we'll failed miserably I've played a few hours of this game going through a few campaign failed every single time I think the problem with this game is that the bar is set too high This game really needs a much much and I can not stress this enough much easier entry mission where you can just shine your flashlight at the monster and win the game If the developers doesn't realizes how important the learning curve is to a multiplayer PVE game such as this one The player base will wither and so will the game also there is some basic level IT command game play that technically isn't that challenging if you're somewhat tech savy but I really don't see much point in it and could have been replaced but a much simpler button prompt instead Overall I see a lot of potential that was executed somewhat poorly For those reading this review whenever that is do check the community and see if the player base is still alive If not then this game is definitely a hard pass
Better with friends than randos Namely as coordination is key For those loving a challenge that relies on sold teamwork this sure fits the bill
list 4 Dead 2 Rock 4 3 b If you're planning on playing this game solo please don't buy this game This game will punish you HARSHLY if you decided to play solo or in a RUN N GUN playstyle Your patience will be TESTED and your communication are ESSENTIAL TO KEEPING YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS ALIVE This is not Lethal Company FUN and casual this is GTFO HELL and Pain If you're really deadset on playing with strangers b I HIGHLY recommend you find people in the official Discord GTFO server b

I did not like how puzzly this game is you really have to figure out where your going and what your doing in a way I dont find enjoyable
You don't need to get to the choppa but you have to get the F out
From the time that I've spent playing this game during the free weekends I can say that the game is a decent play when you have someone to make you a company If not good damn luck trying to make it through the native matchmaking because it sure does suck Whenever you try to host a lobby with matchmaking you can just get completely thrown out of your lobby and in a completely different one with a mission that you certainly did not choose I wish lobby hosting was a bit more intuitive rather than intrusive and you could just create a lobby on a mission you want without the slightest care in the world Other than that The game was really fun to play even if I could only complete the first mission of the first rundown kekw There's a playstyle for everyone whether you like fast rifles or clunky revolvers the game has it all Wish I could buy it but due to some regional restrictions on the Steam's part this game leaves my library but certainly stays inside of my heart
FUN
APAGA TU LUZ BABOSO y no toques al hombre fideo
spooopy tense atmosphere poking holes 10/10
I need friends
This is a fun and challenging game and I enjoyed playing the free weekend
Fun horror shooter but your team bots are kinda dumb and I never made it past the 1st objective despite 4 attempts over 4 hrs Need real teams
It's good
url url url RTX 3050 DLLS 120fps
aku jago ngoding dari game ini
Very good 39 min of my life Only problem that the game is too hard when you don't have full squad of 4
Played when it was temporally free The game is ok though not being able to exit the game without losing everything I collect is a bit un-fun to play around for me personally it takes about an hour to get to a first checkpoint which I assume is a half-way point for the first level so maybe like 2 hours for 1 level of the game I recon Just not the kind of timeline I want to dedicate to I don't think I'll want to play any game that doesn't let me save and exit when I want to and I suppose that applies to this one Also I suck at the game miss like 90 of my shots the guns are cool but I just suck
Game is really fun you just need to have friends My first ever time playing and joining with randos ooooh we got a newbie noob and just procede to troll me
While challenging at first GTFO presents a unique gaming experience where you truly have to work together to achieve the win You can't go by yourself keep to yourself and withold information or not communicate with your teammates You truly will Work together or die together After you get the hang of it and strategize well you can get through the levels faster The game brings a thrilling horror aspect with a micromanagement tactility vibe that can't be replicated by any other video game The game is very polished from the UI and UX to the options to the optimization depending on what settings you set to the gameplay itself Definitely a game that isn't for everyone but can be won over if played correctly I had a friend that hated the game then played it correctly and enjoyed it immensely 8/10
El juego tiene una dificultad altisima tienes que aprender para que te sirve cada arma y como equipar a tus ademas de hacer una estrategia de como pasar las zonas con las diferentes criaturas que hay Para solucionar el tema de los bots les recomiendo ponerle mods con la thunderstore y ya con eso tienen el apoyo que se necesita Recomendado con o sin amigos pero sin mods es un caso perdido
Buen juego pero la ia del bot es una basura aberrante mejor no metan nada si es esa cosa que dispara a y no se mete a objetivos Gracias
so when is the cavalry coming
Get The Fuck Out
DS
A game where you never want to play with randos Only friendos
It's hard but not in a fun way like Pathologic 2 imo The visuals are good aside from the hud/start menu and the sound is mostly good My main gripes lie in the gunplay progression checkpoints and overall gameplay loop Everything is unlocked on launch which sounds nice at first until you realize every level plays out around the same Unlike something like Left 4 Dead where you pick up new guns as you play through a campaign you're stuck with whatever assortment of weapons you pick at the lobby screen It just makes every run feel the same since there are only so many pickups you can find throughout the level The gameplay loop is too repetitive The stealth aka just crouching around everywhere is very barebones for a game that punishes you so hard for making a singular sound The guns all feel pretty trash and none of them have power to them both in animations and in sound As for the checkpoints what's the point of putting good checkpoints in the first level if the whole game is basically not going to have them It sets a weird belief that the whole game will have good checkpoints Also the game has a staggering lack of enemy types makes repetitive campaigns even more repetitive All of the enemies looked the same to me The game is hard yea but it's just not fun The game is too slow takes too long to complete and offers no real reward other than bragging rights No story no unlocks and no consistency between campaigns as far as I can see I could be wrong 2/5
El juego es aburrido desde el tutorial me quitaron las ganas de seguir jugando
DONT LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS

My one and only complaint about this game is the optimization tbh I cant tell what is bottle necking but for some reason when I spawn in its just unplayable Other than that i'm sure its a great game I would have more to say about it but I didn't really play it so ya that's it
OK game relies too heavily on darkness to be scary not really that difficult though wouldn't buy it at full price
cool gunplay but not really scary and its too time consuming just laborious to play
Tried on the free weekend UI is unforgivably bad for a game that felt mid at best with uninspired enemies I could see something like this being fun coordinating with friends but with a group of less than 4 or with randos I cannot see much enjoyment in this game
Play this game if you like wasting your time eye strain and overly complicated UI I would be pissed if I spent a dime on this
Muito bom
Very difficult PvE game really only playable with friends VERY strategic and needs teamwork and skill also takes forever to finish a level Very grindy and painful getting to the end and wiping but overall one of my favorites
W game fun to play with friends and i love the stealth aspect but the bots could use some work sometimes they mess up stealth get lost and try to revive other bots and sacrifice themselves and ruin the mission but other than that i love this game and plan on buying the full game when i get the chance 3
this game is too scary can't get past the tutorial the ui is really hard for me to read BUT the sound and lighting is really cool i love typing commands into a console inside the game and you can have a turret
Espectacular muy bueno Deja la E presionada y usa la torreta
am i just bad or is this game supposed to be really damn hard great aesthetic fun when you can live
very nice
Si no sabes gestionar tus recursos te la pelaste NO HAY TETAS
kinda boring
Cant even start the game without crashing on turorials
Un juego super aburrido simulador de caminar y buscar cosas
This game is very bad the map designs are bad and you cannot know where to go and the place is dark and difficult to see I played it for less than an hour and I got a headache Don't waste your time
The stealth mechanic is children's game red light green light in a nutshell Your characters are squishy and don't have enough firepower to take every enemy on You're encouraged to engage with the stealth system Playing a crouch-walking simulator is not my idea of engaging and entertaining Also the main menu UI is not very good
i spent 3 hours on a mission thats why i have 3 hours
SCP vibes
Oyun ilk size ne nereye bile Sizin yolu Tutorial bile bir bilgi yok denecek kadar az Yeni biri parti kurma ya da girmek rasgele ve bu yeni birisi zor olabiliyor Mesela R1 ama sistemi o kadar ki Sizi R7 olan ve Zaten yeteri kadar yok Bu oyunu gereken bir hayli 6 saate kadar ne bu Haftasonu oynama iyi ki yoksa para falan verirdik oyunu falan Uzun Ama oyun olsun gerilimi olsun Her boss gibi bir Arada gereksiz sesler gereksiz gerilim var Oyunun diye 10/3 atacak varsa
fun game no gyatt or skibidi toilet though 6/10
singularmente e unico y aislado aunque es bastante hard y hay que tener de sigilo pero aprender de el asimila lo mejor de una conexion con tu pc codigo al principio el deber es conocer su teorica de zonas asi como sus funciones con la terminal la propuesta es barbara con gran planteamiento de como proceder en una dispareja en donde las hordas acabaran con todos tus suministros y el echo de tener control de las municiones o los items como usarlos es fundamental para lograr la y la algo negativo es que es necesario de 4 jugadores asi como los participantes de la cooperen en cuanto a coordinar y de los objetivos aun hay grandes amantes del titulo que si saben apreciar la jugabilidad de GTFO
meh
Do buy under any circumstances Game not working in current state

Es como entrar en la villa pero aca son blancos
masochism for people who don't like physical pain
we got killed by the bots shooting us in the back of the head 10/10 would reccomend
I would like to have been thrilled by this game However it is plagued with long load times drop outs and a feeling of lack of playerbase Had 1 good game many failures for a 4 coop game it shines when your tm8z fuck the team over s I am not a fan of games that rely heavily on going into discord to find non azzhat tm8z to play a core coop game Thus appears to be one of those The bots suck too much for a new player to learn the enemy mechanics as well
I stabbed a big tall guy that had many tentacles around its head it turned bright green then caused a huge horde of creatures to kill my friends and i
Infelizmente ele trava mesmo com um pc bom muito na primeira vez quando abre e disso mesmo que possua bonitos ele se baseia nisso mesmo pois a jogabilidade chata o jogo extremamente punitivo e desbalanceado principalmente por que precisa de um squad de 4 pessoas que saibam montar uma perfeita para continuar nele
START ON R7A1 NOT R1A1 good game very difficult fun with a group Hard solo but doable and the bots are better than expected would recommend if you have a group
good multiplayer game with strategy and spooks
O jogo desafiador e diferente de muitos o fato de ser a escolha de um servidor acaba com o jogo e afasta muitos players Joguei 6 partidas e consegui completar por causa do ping alto e em todas as partidas acabaram instantaneamente por causa da de jogar com pois sempre cair com norte americanos e europeus
Solo se lo a grupos de amigos o gente que le gustan mucho los juegos muy sin modo de poner mas y necesita una interfaz mejor para elegir las armas aunque si puedo decir que el de los mapas en general atrae mucho tampoco me gusta el de los monstruos parece muy xxx y son algo odiosos
game crashes and can never play
2nd mission took two hours sneaking around not a single mistake And then we found a room with 20 really large guys you can't even oneshot in the head with a sniper Ran out of ammo before we killed them all died A team of experienced gamers
4/10 at best didn't feel like I got my time's worth out of the game for free
One of the best game I ever played the memories I made with my friends being a scared lil punk in the dungeons are stuff I will be remembering for a long time Move aside apex
the souls like of first person shooters

I have the right components and yet it doesn't even let me do the tutorial lol it just goes black good thing I never bought this game
Played during the free weekend good enough to secure a purchase
It is very cool and scary if you go full blast
good
meu estilo de jogo um FPS que tu fica sem muito passando sufoco pois tem que ficar usando arma branca a maior parte do tempo Mas o que fez eu desistir foi a compatibilidade com o controle/joystick
game crashes and can never play my friends game crashed too in our firs 2 hours of trying to play it 0 out of ten Rather buy an overpriced hot dog from New York CIty
Not for everyone but definitely for me
They just want a hug
very atmospheric its kinda hard its good when you have a good crew
title does not lie I sure do wish I could fucking leave
Fun game and I appreciate the dedication to immersion but the lack of accessibility settings and quality of life make this game annoying to play Some more customization settings for the HUD and ways to disable flashing lights would be nice
Muito gratificante o Bot morrer de infarto depois de 2 horas de 3
jogo de macho
the main difficulty check is your patience
is this what it feels like taking horrendous backshots

omg there is no friends list and no internal method to invite friends One must go through discord THEN steam in order to invite friends And that ONLY when the mechanisms work JFC I never spent so much time trying to get a game together with friends this was an awful experience

Jogo incrivelmente infernal se jogar sozinho.se gosta de um jogo tenso ao extremo dificuldade hardcore igual thief jogar em um breu absoluto em um ambiente que parece uma mistura de the last u.s com Alien.esse jogo para para aqueles que querem se divertir brincar com os amigos e se desestressar.fuja o jogo gira muito nas entradas de cada pode causar tontura o nivel de estresse e adrenalina de fazer soar frio torcendo para os bicho notar A limitada cura.um pingo no oceano.vai usar muita arma branca Para os corajosos que comprarem.boa sorte

Kind of honkin can't lie
I really liked it but it is a bit time consuming If you like these types of strategic horde shooters this is defnitly a must play
launched the game has a really cool asthetic but 5 mins into the tutorial i had the graphics break and cover my entire screen in black keeping me from seeing literally anything at all but the hud NO thanks lmfao
Tem que fazer um curso do SENAI pra jogar esta merda
GTFO is good so i buy
GTFO Cooperativo Terror seria o modo easy do game Interface e Legendas em PT/BR Conquistas Tematica sombria Aqui trazemos um Fps de estrategia em tempo real e cautela na de itens onde isso pode prevalecer sua vitoria ou derrota um erro pode ser a derrota da equipe toda aqui e joguinhos de tiro onde sai atirando igual um louco Game focado em jogadores mais hard que ficam de mimimi porque perderam e tem que jogar novamente aquele mapa maldito que ficamos 1hr para tentar passar A ideia que o game nos apresenta e descer com prisioneiros em complexos espalhados no onde temos pequenas miseras de achar concluir e simplesmente extrair que nem sempre e simples assim pois muita das vezes no final da ou ate antes esta totalmente escasso por conta do gasto de ate chegar a extrair da muitas das vezes o ideal pode ser o uso da furtividade em determinados pontos do mapa evitando o gasto de Uma coisa interessante e o uso da estrategia pois como dito as cura e itens que utilizamos durante as praticamente escassas e a cada vez jogado mesmo que volte no mesmo mapa ate o sleepers acho que assim chamados no game meu amigo adianta decorar Outro ponto legal e a visibilidade totalmente dark necessitando de upgrade com lanternas melhorando assim a visibilidade ou itens que retiram a neblina por um de tempo O sistema de Steath e interessante pois o uso de arma branca faz o inimigo ou da o tempo dele atrair mais aliados caso consiga com sucesso a dele(s caso esteja em um local cheio deles e a equipe efetue com sucesso a mutua Muitas das vezes que perdi foram em abrir determinadas portas onde as mesmas soam ou fazem barulhos excessivos atraindo essas de monte e o que acontece sempre jogo com gringoos onde os mesmos ficam perdidos ou nunca jogaram tal tipo de jogo sabem colocar as torrets no gastam com facilidades tiros logo de inicio da partida sabem jogar em grupo as vezes ficam longe do grupo caindo longe dividem item encontrados ou O ideal dele e com amigos ou encontrar grupos para jogar com brasileiros pois ai da fechar o time e se comunicar perfeitamente e melhores estrategias assim dando melhores expectativas de sucesso GAME FOI FEITO PARA JOGADORES CASUAIS pode ate ser mas o que mais tem da dificuldade do titulo e do mesmo acho que se consegue ou se enquadra na dificuldade o por que de negativar algo por que seu sucesso e sempre o fracasso O empresa diz o game e um tipico game de tiro e sim para jogadores que procuram um desafio maior algo mais peculiar do apresentado ai fico pensando por que dos negativos Realmente um titulo que venho acompanhando desde 2021 e pretendo adquirir joguei no final de semana e adorei pena como dito encontrei na maioria das vezes gringoos nos servidores e sem onde pareciam bots jogando que muita da vezes o bots jogavam melhor

Mechanic run-n-gun farming game that doesn't care about the lore or atmosphere Play it this specific way or lose
very good
Maybe I just didn't get it or maybe you really do need four people to really enjoy this game but I tried it over the free weekend and GTFO just wouldn't click for me The gunplay feels solid the game looks nice and it runs great but even if the atmosphere and difficulty should have me on edge in theory I mostly just felt well bored I only played with one other person and the game is tough so we didn't manage to clear even the first mission R1A1 but while playing it felt like I was spending ten to twenty minutes wandering around a series of uninteresting concrete cubes waiting for the occasional alarm door to decide whether or not we fail the level holding off a wave of uninspired feeling zombies Maybe the level design gets less bland and meandering feeling after the first level maybe the enemy design gets more interesting as you go on too but after burning an hour and half on two attempts with only about ten minutes of anything that wasn't wandering empty rooms looking for keycards between them neither of us were enjoying the game enough to keep trying I wanted to like the game but unfortunately I didn't really feel tense on edge exhillerated or even frustrated Just bored
combat just isn't any fun I get you're supposed to feel weak compared to the enemy for tension but it just goes so far in that direction that I wonder why they even bothered putting weapons in the game at all they should have just made it a pure stealth game it's mechanics would have worked better that way
Gameplay loop is fun Procedural generation keeps things interesting The bots are absolutely braindead tho If you want to play have at least 2 more friends cause a friend and 2 bots makes it much harder The moment something fights back they shoot and wake the whole room
The UI HUD and menus gave me cancer
Brilliant and Scary mic and headset needed
Only played the demo and the servers lagged a lot Looked good otherwise
fun yes fun with friends fun
get tf out
Played the Free 3 Day Trial gave up playing during the tutorial due to freezing crashing on my steam deck Removed from wishlist
Game has no difficulty scaling
Negative reviews are either bad at the game or have no friends despite needing a better tutorial this game excels at making me pee around every corner and hate my friends
good good good good
play the game theres nothing wrong with you if you say its bad its just a skill issue
Heh Get the e rflip gout

a checkpoint once a while would be nice
I played for less than 20 mins the ui is awful and completely overwhelms you it is difficult to navigate and is a literal seizure fest it looks like a ps3 remaster of a ps2 game the objectives are the same the bots are dumb as well the only thing stopping you from succeeding in the mission is the urge to alt f4 and play something else above everything the extraction horror theme is not met by the game play which shows not creative enemies in a very un-scary environment the actual combat is pretty boring and as said before the enemy designs are not scary the interactions are not scary and making a scary shooter game is not new or hard its been done before this game is a total scam IMO TLDR boring stale dont buy
The UI is not good and makes it seem more confusing based on how they designed it Then you get into a game and the objective of what your meant to be doing is not laid out in a comprehensible way making it feel like your just running around aimlessly hoping you accomplish what you were sent to do until you find out you have no ammo and cant find anymore so all your teammates run out and your killed by enemy's that are not scary but just cheapskates you as they get a free kill
I enjoy the game thumbsup
No sense of progression Everything is unlocked from the start Enemies are more annoying to fight than fun to fight
Cool game
ooooooooooooooooo it's SO GOOD
GTFO is like if DayZ Escape from Tarkov and L4D2 had a child and that child was a hardcore COOP shooter If you like this kind of games you'll remember every single level/match for a long time Because they're just memorable Teamwork is essential and so is communication One war or the other you will trauma-bond with your teammates
get the fuck out while you still can
developers really hit the mark on the title with this one GTFO of the game

War mal am ob ich es mir hole Habe es jetzt mal gestetet mus aber leider sagen das es meiner meinung nach nicht lohnt es sich zu holen Entweder mann darf alleine mit kaum und alleine OHNE BOOTS gegen eine Horde von Monster zu verteidigen gegen die selbst Jack Nores und Rambo zusammen keine schonkse Dazu kommt das man verschiedenen dinge suchen und sichern muss ohne richtige hilfe und wenn mann mal hat und mit rendems in ein Team kommt ist sich in sachen loot jeder sich selbst der egal ob mann heilung oder Ammo Braucht wenn mann einen schrank ist jemand andes Schon zurstelle um sich den in halt zukrallen bevor mann eine schongs hat es zu nehmen oder mann kann 2h einen suchen den einer sich genommen hat aber NICHT am Terminel benutz um weiter zukommen Das Spiel potenzial aber leider nutzt er keines und frustriert einfach nur Kann es nicht empfelen
Gives the chills Good
So the game is fun atmospheric and cinematic BUT i played 3 missions and I REALISED that there are 4 with their bigger variants and hybrid enemies 2 similar objectives some interesting weapons and same main experience open a door clear the room and turn off security OVERPRICED AND NOT WORTH MORE THAN 10Euro If you want my recomandations for 4vAI worth experiences here are some GOLDEN WELL WORKED GAMES Legendary 4vMobs ai DEEP ROCK GALACTIC and HELLDIVERS 2 Zombies Left 4 Dead 2 or Killing Floor 2 Atmospheric SCP 5k Swat Ready or Not(5 squad
just another zombie shooter tbh nothing special
its fun yet scary but i didnt think i would like this until my sister was asking me to play it and omg its so much fun and i dont normally play games like this but would recommend playing it with another person who has played before to give you a rundown about the game and what guns and other things are good for the game
scary and fun at the same time but lowkey hella hard

Gameplay and mechanics are interesting been an enjoyable free weekend Only issue is with matchmaking and a bug midgame where everyone/thing on screen stops moving for you yet you can still hear them talking in comms in a world that didn't freeze
Genuinly a really fun game the stealth in this game is amazing and the tension you feel when you alert the spagetti man truly rivals no other This is a trial and error game.you willl die.a lot.but you will learn use the things you learn to come up with new ways to get past an obstacle This game REQUIRES more than 1 person there are bots but the game just inst built for bot teammates

while i loved this its little hard for me to recommend game is straight up too hard i was playing with 3 friends we had strategy we managed resources tried trice to finish one run but enemies just swarmed us no matter what when u have 4 players co operating and actually doing proper work and still loosing that means that game has zero balance especially for newer players u cant play this game unless u have 3 die hard friend who likes to suffer i sure do but sadly i cant find 3 more players so its near impossible to play to be short if u like hard games if u are willing to fail continuously till u learn and master it and u have 3 more friends just like you take it game is great but if u don't fill this criteria don't even bother

Tried for free weekend Played with my boyfriend and two bots Well ACTUALLY we played with bots for about 3 minutes the time it took for the bots to completely spazz out aggro everything do zero damage and get us all killed So we searched for bot settings found none then kicked the bots entirely The UI was set up very vaguely so instead of joining up with other players we tried to go in just us 2 since we were on the easiest one The game hints that it wants you to sneak past all of the creatures instead of engaging them but if you successfully sneak past you aggro them when you start to open doors anyways They're also seem suspiciously similar to Clickers from The Last Of Us Oh and good luck actually killing the horde of them that rush in You're given next to no ammo and the horde just keeps coming You can club some of them down but it's a literal SWARM of clickers shooting you from afar Any damage you take I guess you're just forced to live with since there's no natural out-of-combat healing and you're completely reliant on finding medkits Did I mention that finding medkits is pretty rare they come as a stack of 2 and each medkit heals for 20 of your health So at best one team member can heal 40 and the rest of you are just hugely out of luck But don't worry if you're down a teammate can very slowly revive you to 8 health An amount of health that will have you downed again after one hit Big fun There's probably a reason only 10 of players have ever finished the tutorial You also have access to every gun imaginable right at the start with the only things you unlock after completing maps being cosmetic items shirts pants for your character to wear So the only drive for progression is fashion items I dunno man There's better options for co-op shooters out there that don't immediately throw you to the wolves with next to no explanation hoping you're willing to struggle for that unlockable gray shirt And maybe you are willing But I'm sure not Super skippable
fun
neat BUT THE MATCHMAKING SUCKS AND RECOIL lil wierd and should be MORE weapons but overall too hard for even beginners even a and b but overall 8 id SAY a good game hopefully will fix these 3 pointers would be ALOT ALOT better
A proposta do jogo legal O que mata ele 1 o sistema de encontro de jogadores Deveria ter uma lista de servidores para escolhermos e depender do acaso 2 o sistema de queda totalmente quebrado 3 metros de altura e o personagem perde muita vida 3 a jogabilidade bem que perde para FPS da de 2000 o jogo te permite dar cover nem se inclinar para mirar
El juego es bueno pero para jugar con amigos o con personas online pero jugar solo con los bots es una perdida de tiempo es realmente dificil superar un nivel ya que necesitas de coordinacion buscando los materiales para pasar el nivel como pueden ser tarjetas o para la terminal cosa que es complicada con amigos ahora imaginencia jugando solo con puros bots No recomiendo jugarlo si no tienen amigos jugando al juego
This game is terrible Its impossible to beat missions unless everyone on the team is a pro and even then its unlikely The enemies shoot homing projectiles and have long range melee attacks that make it impossible to fight them with melee weapons and ammo runs out too fast for guns to be viable Sentries help a bit but they also run out of ammo after the first wave of enemies on some missions
Jeu multijoueurs avec une ambiance sympa
Takes forever to get into a game I tried twice two separate days in a row This games dead Dont waste your money
Sehr
The noodle man touched my friends now I always shoot at noodle man so he can't do the touching of my friends
gave it a try personnaly think the gameplay has major flaws it's not snappy enough and everything is made in sort to make u panic but as far as my gaming experience goes this sum up to be cheap tricks to enhance the horror genre the thing is that the pace is extremly slow gets fast only in fights so somekind of suspense buildup except that the firing mechanics recoil etc make it that u can't actually hit the targets precisly u can probably get other weapons by playing and all but the base ones are as basic as it gets graphics are fine not much to say on that part spriting feels very slow personally i don't reccomand this game as it feels very heavy to play and full of gimmicks to make it look like it's horror when it actually is not personal opinion tho
NOT WORTH THE TIME
Super interesting concept fantastic environment Cool action But there is absolutely zero progression or replayability Not much of a reason to play it unless you like getting spooked and blasting creatures with your friends I recommend this game on a free to play weekend but not to spend 40 dollars on it

very fun when playing with others who communicate would be a great game to play with friends
Group Stealth Simulator no friend no game
The game has a high difficulty level even from the beginning Even the tutorial was pretty challenging especially since I had to search online for how to deploy a turret as instructed because the game failed to explain how to do it Later I played the game with a friend and we included two bots in our team We gradually learned the ropes together and reached the objective of the first mission He experienced a bug where his screen suddenly went completely black except for the HUD info So he had to quit and rejoin Then when we triggered the event for the team security scan our two bot companions REFUSED to enter the team security scan area So we were unable to complete the mission due to the bots behavior and we finally just had to quit the game If you have an opportunity to try out the game by all means do so I do recommend finding some videos online to explain the basic concepts mechanics and strategies of the game to beginners because the game itself doesn't explain much The tutorial is very minimal I can only recommend this game at all if you can consistently have a full team of 4 human players We used a voice chat program outside the game so I haven't tried the in-game voice chat and can't comment on it But voice chat is absolutely critical to communicating with your team mates and planning strategy You will need to plan Just running in and shooting everything will almost certainly result in a rapid demise for your team The bots are good at reviving a fallen player and they are good at pouncing on an enemy if a player fails to kill an enemy in a single melee attack The bots are bad at stealth and from my experience often wake up sleeping enemies And as my account above illustrates they may prove useless at performing tasks that are necessary to complete a mission We only encountered the one bug with my friend's screen going black but considering that it happened during his first game it certainly doesn't seem to bode well for future prospects of having a bug-free game play experience In summary the game is challenging and offers the potential for a fun horror action game emphasizing cooperation between 4 friends The game clearly needs work when it comes to the bots AI and it appears to have at least one potentially very disruptive bug If you have a lower-spec machine the game is playable with the minimum required specs but you will have to turn most graphical options down to the minimum to get anything resembling a playable FPS I cannot recommend this game if you expect to play alone or with less than the full roster of 3 friends due to the problems with the bots But if you have that a reasonably equipped PC and a desire for high challenge stealth-based missions then this game is definitely worth playing if you can pick it up on sale I would have a much harder time recommending it at full price until the problems I mentioned are resolved
fun w friend

The game concept is fine but everything else not so much Starting from the menu you are already lost No idea what to press or what am i starting Just pressing forward you get some shitty overview of R1 R2 etc I guessed those are the maps and clicking on them still couldn't figure out what to expect In short the game menu is messed up Maps start with obnoxious ear bursting heavy breeding starting cutscene I guess it was suppose to represent agony of the people you play with but only my eardrums felt it Atmosphere is good but movement and shooting are clunky uninspiring All enemies look the same Even at tutorial you can feel something is off with the fight mechanics as the game suggests sneak approach with melee weapon but once the fight starts you can instantly see what is off Enemy can move in all directions attack from all directions shoot from all directions with some weird lateral left and right movement while your movement is like forcing a brick to roll over You try to rush a ranged enemy with a mace but nah he dances left and right and once you swing your movement is limited and you will most likely miss while ranged enemy shits all over you since he can move and shoot at the same time Had to google how to reload a weapon or use healing item Objects and items you collect are hardly visible blended in with terrain and repetitive Spent 20 minutes walking around the objective but could not figure out what exactly is it that i have to interact with Had to google it to see the picture of the objective to get some DNA sample crap or whatever All in all concept is fine reminds of doom and Deadspace but besides that nothing else is really good even with a team It is too simplistic and feels unfinished
Free weekend
You feel like a bull in a china shop
While I believe the game has potential the AI seems suboptimal for solo play When using the matchmaking system about 50 of the time you'll end up with players who treat it like L4D recklessly triggering alarms Additionally visibility is a major issue as everything is often pitch black making it hard to discern what's in front of you I'm unsure if this game is niche or just designed for a very specific type of gamer Overall I'm glad I could play without paying as it's not worth the money in its current state
An exceptional game for team players with patience The dopamine cycle is being delivered by increasingly rising positive stress and a wonderfull relief at the end It has still some bugs and synchronization problems here and there but the overall experience is refreshing and worh it imho
wird leider sehr sehr schnell laufe kreuz und quer durch die map um zu finden lauf dann um die zu

It is challenging It requires skill and focus But it is just not that fun Matchmaking sucks donkey private parts Bots are bad but most of the time better than randoms You survive after dying 20 times you get a different looking gas mask
Nice Missions last so long though you need a second life to play this game It's not for casual players
gameplay mediocre at best
Me gusto bastante y divertido para jugar con amigos

Bon pour avoir plusieurs reprises avec des les IA et solo bbaaah spoiler alerte c'est un jeu de merde x'D le shoot des armes est Le trigger des ennemis en phase est tu joue 1.2.3 soleil marche sur 5 ennemis et le 6 trigger pour rien La localisation des WTF des ennemis en deux juste 2 jambes qui vous poursuivent mdr Les commandes sur les ordi c'est relou bordel c'est naze Pas de dash ou d'esquive possible on subit les et on survivre Sur le papier donne envie vraiment mais finalement j'accroche pas Les IA restent les portes et les murs aucun level scalling entre le solo 2-3-4 joueurs
Big difference between AI and players those being AI Sneaks around when you do actually does the commands that the players gave somehow doesn't take damage in combat inaccurate shooting while Players Mauls everything in sight like a hungry pitbull dog on a playground Rarely sticks together which conflicts with the game's main goal Tactics What are tactics Dies when you walk 1 cm too far away from them Overall the game is such a good experience the design is phenomenal especially with the sound of the machine gun that sh goes so hard the fun factor of this game is defined by its players imo although the shooting is quite clunky
piece of shit
Played it on free weekend Great game died a lot 10/10
Honestly the concept is pretty awesome I just wish that even with a team of 4 seasoned FPS players you didn't get so absolutely decimated in the first handful of maps the game loses all appeal because it's far too frustrating to enjoy WarHammer is more balanced and enjoyable after this experience Even on tier A-B which is like the normal difficulty we were getting so viciously slammed the game just wasn't fun It's very unbalanced imo at least in the first 2-3 maps where you're trying to learn the game and figure out how things work having 5 giant mobs in one tiny room in the first map is just a buzz kill Unless you like dying over and over again having to restart each map which is a huge undertaking tbh since they are huge maps all because the game refuses to save checkpoints on any map I wouldn't recommend this game I would have loved for this game to be a good fall back game to play with friends between other games or just something to do as a group but honestly we all got tired of it after 2 maps and being wiped like 10 times spending hours just walking in a circle of frustration
Die Idee ist nett bin halt 60 von meinen 70 min Spielzeit nur rumgelaufen nen Free-Weekend ganz nett aber nicht grade der Nervenkitzel schlecht hin Aber wer den Walking-Simulator feiert und gerne Sachen sucht nur zu Vlt im Verlauf wirds spannender

The Fxxk Off
I played this with my dad we both suck and died a lot 10/10
Very misleading trailer when you watch it you think it's some kind of mix between ready or not and resident evil but in reality it's a quite boring shooter the shooting itself is made very poorly shooting is very unpleasant graphics even on highest settings look like metro 2033 even worse the gemplay is not fun at all the enemies are unfair most of them can hit you no matter what you won't be able to dodge their self-guided attacks you won't be able to outrun them cover won't help you either and the enemies themselves are not very creative it's overall a bad game not worth even 5 i see why the daily online of this game on Steamdb is 400 people outside of weekends when you can play it for free what i don't understand is how it got such positive reviews
bu zorluk ney salak herifler
I do not give a FUCK Bishop

GET OUTTT
yes
If you like horror games this is perfect I couldn't get past the tutorial because I was terrified My friends love it though
GTFO is an amazing concept done very poorly I cannot see how anyone would have fun playing this game due to the massive amount of problems it has If these were all fixed or worked around however I think this could be a very enjoyable experience Pros Visuals are quite good even though I was playing with every single graphic setting on the lowest possible option Horror is present but takes a sideline to stealth action and exploration which seems to be intentional There is a small amount of actual fear but the game seems to more be going for spooky or gloomy which it succeeds in nicely Resource management discourages combat which sounds like a bad thing but is again what the game is going for You are supposed to sneak around with combat being a last resort or a fail safe If you shoot everything you will die The bio scanner only marking moving targets is a well designed way to balance out how strong the item is This system provides opportunities for players to work together following the instructions of the scanner player to avoid monsters Small details here or there really make the atmosphere that much more real Little splatters of enemy juice on your face from close range kills and the visual effect when shining a long range flashlight directly into someone's face make you feel like you are really in the facility Another example of this is the heavy breathing during the deployment cutscene at the beginning of each mission Truly masterful set dressing Cons The tutorial is awful It doesn't teach you many of the button prompts needed to progress provides no guidance on typing commands into consoles and gives unclear instructions I spent a good 2 minutes trying to figure out what the correct command for the console was and at the point where I was told to place a turret I placed it facing the large obvious door instead of the much smaller door I just came through If this is just me being an idiot fine but the tutorial which is designed to teach you the game shouldn't just let me be an idiot It should teach me how to do what it wants me to do correctly which it fails miserably in The stealth isn't fun Stopping whenever a creature is pulsating is cinematic and cool but not fun After the initial shock of wuh oh I gotta stop now the stealth ceases to be engaging which is very unfortunate for a game that emphasizes stealth so heavily The guns aren't great either There is no feedback for when your bullets connect or when something has died Amidst all the creatures running and crawling at you and the gunshots and exclamations of your friends any visuals or audio indicating damage or a kill is lost I have stopped shooting at monsters several times believing them dead only to be wrong Friendly fire makes the game worse There are games where friendly fire forces you to use caution and its presence improves the gameplay experience This is not one of them When my friends and I just started we tested if there was friendly fire with melee weapons and deduced there was not Because of this we didn't worry about shooting each other Color us surprised when not only do guns have friendly fire which isn't too bad but turrets do as well The inconsistency of friendly fire alone is bad but GTFO is not the type of game to benefit from friendly fire Melee weapons are not fun The slow swinging and slow charging of melee weapons makes them unfun to use In a horror game this makes sense Making the player feel weak by giving them weak defense options enhances the horror This is why Lethal Company lets you buy a shovel as a weapon not a sword GTFO doesn't benefit from this design decision because it does empower you with firearms turrets and explosives and because the horror takes a backseat to other things the game focuses on more Navigation is unintuitive On our first run my friends and I always took the doors whose numbers were closer to our target number Doing so for about 15 minutes led us to a dead end where we then backtracked to the beginning and got on the real path towards the objective through a door that through its number told us was the wrong way The game seems to want you to go in the wrong direction I think it is good that these wrong directions exist as sneaking around while checking doors for the most optimal path sounds like a good gameplay loop but this only functions when the doors accurately relay information Combat is both too punishing and not punishing enough Every time combat began at least one of us though usually two went down This is far too punishing Yes I'm sure we just suck but going down to every single encounter just because we suck is not fun I am aware this game is designed to be difficult but difficulty can be fun Elden Ring is fun difficulty Cuphead is fun difficulty Skul the Hero Slayer is fun difficulty GTFO's difficulty feels cheap and unfun That being said combat is also not punishing enough While we do lose multiple people during each encounter unlimited revives make this trivial As long as one of us is still standing there is no punishment for the rest of us dropping which doesn't disincentive combat as the other design choices of the game are trying to do The game does not function I had to open the game six times just to turn down the graphics settings in the menu before I could play the game The game crashed five times before this happened just during the intro cutscene If I were using a potato computer sure that would be tolerable but I have a very good computer that is able to run other games typically thought of as requiring a good computer with no difficulty whatsoever For this reason over anything else I have written in this review I cannot recommend this game Steam is very nice and will provide a full refund if you have played less than two hours and have owned it for less than two weeks That is great but when it took me 30 minutes just to begin the tutorial and then another 15 or so to beat it I wouldn't risk losing track of time and being unable to get a refund if you didn't like it with only an hour and change to experience the game If this problem and no others are solved I do recommenced at last trying out the game because worst case scenario you can get a refund but until then don't bother
Crapola
Es un buen juego pero no es mi tipo de juego En lo personal se me hace repetitivo y aburrido pero esto es algo completamente subjetivo Si le echando un ojo y te interesa es que probable que lo disfrutes Si te llaman sus de sigilo y combate por hordas te puede gustar Y es Lo guay de GTFO es darle con amigos jugarlo solo es meh
The name GTFO aptly describes the experience It is not recommended due to its hardcore gameplay and the demanding teamwork required or rather its poorly designed teamwork tactics system
10/10
Felt clunky and the tutorial does a terrible job explaining what the different classes special weapons are for The combat just never felt satisfying
pretty hard ig couldve been harder tbh
Game is fun but hard will rage at times but still will enjoy the game as long as you play.Note to self:Do play the game with friends,makes the game more fun then playing with bots
i got the freak out guys it was no easy task

no progression it's like a burger with no meat or a car with no wheels 3/5 microwine rating
its great i def recommend this game its can get confusing in some bits of the game but if your smart enough sure you would love this game
I recommend this only if you have 2-3 friends to play with cool concept of cooperative tactical shooter
All weapons and gadgets are unlocked right away absolutely no sense of progression you just have 100 levels that you can play Gameplay is kind of boring and repetitive
10 10
Really wanted to like this game But its clunky gun play and completely unbalanced weapons make the game un-fun and a chore to play The fact the semi auto rifle an one shot enemies but the two burst rifle cant is mind boggling Pistols are better than ARs or SMGs all day 0 sense and the NPC's shot block far more than they help
GTFO
12/10
Like L4d2 but a lot sneaky
Felt miserable to play Wish I could refund my time during the free weekend
I would need to be paid to play this terrible game
shit game
Free weekend play It has potential but the broken bits make it a frustrating experience The menu breaks 50 of the time buttons disappear unnecessary click and holding buttons just to activate the menus built-in animated delays in navigating menus navigating leads to dead ends in the menu The gameplay is fairly good but again the matchmaking is broken and disorderly and so is the button remapping functions If someone drops out of the lobby pregame another player is rarely found forcing a complete rematchmaking and the same is for in game if someone drops out you're permanently a man down for the session I get the gameplay is supposed to be hard but when getting into and playing the game is a task in and of itself they need to work on it In game enemies can be bullet/melee sponges which is counter-intuitive to a realistic styled gameplay If I smash a small enemy in the head with a sledge hammer they better be dead not willing to take 3 more hits The game has been out for a significant time for these issues to still exist It makes sense that its not played anymore and not because most gamers can't handle our challenging game
Good co-op game hard and challenging from the start Not for the faint of heart teamwork is essential for the progress
Stealth and Bonk the game
Methodical stealth mixed with super intense action Literally the most heart pumping action game I have and I love it
The Scout tickled my testicle 9.5/10
why the eepers kinda freaky tho
This game makes u realize how stupid some of your friends are
Hard asf but its rlly good
h2 h2 h3 h3 h1]This is a hardcore cooperative game that focuses on melee combat and stealth[/h1 it will be very difficult for one person to play solo you may have to avoid using firearms and tools except for Spam and special gameplay in some levels because the amount of ammunition is very limited so please start this game with the expectation of playing a normal FPS game XD the special effects weapon design equipment design and strike feedback are all very nice h2 However the game optimization is not very will[/h2 in some later levels FPS will drop due to too many level objects if the game is open for too long it is easy to have data stacking such as FPS decreasing bugs starting to appear etc not to mention the optimization of the graphics card players who use N-cards must have encountered b]graphic errors that temporarily black out the screen[/b and high device temperatures during gameplay all I can say is that the overall gameplay is interesting and fun to solve missions with friends h3 If you want to experience high difficulty with friends recommended to buy it on sale[/h3
I LOVE THIS GAME
1 2 3 4 5 10/10
Not my type of game but its ok
This game gives me a renewed appreciation for life
It's a nice game but if i want to have max graphics game just crashes In the first 2 missions played i've got speedrunners and made the game not that fun
Nothing
all i can say is i hate this game with every fiber if my being it was designed by a group of nutless monkeys this game has taken years of my life and i hope noone else will ever have to suffer like we did with mods it took 70 hours and every second was an eternity i wish i could get back may god have mercy on the devolpers souls and i wish i had my life back everyone who has played this game is dumber for it jesus cant save you anymore
cool concept bad execution i only beat this game with friends outta hate and spite not a good time i wouldn't listen to the good reviews most of them probably haven't beaten or touched this game in months or even years if i could refund i would
Is Hackett single PLEASE SAY YES
Would be actually fun with more ammo drops
Not a bad game just really need people to communicate with you on the missions Also please share ammo and med pack
locked out
I won't downvote this game because it is really well done and it deserves the praise The story the setting and gameplay is of great quality I can easily see why a lot of people are praising it However this is definitely not a game for me I'm a Doom Eternal/Quake3 player I suck at stealth conserving ammo using melee weapons in FPS games and etc This game rewards strategy awareness stealth and patience
El es algo inusual con el sistema parallax pero es un juegazo
um jogo testado o ultimo limite jogar com os amigos torna a experiencia mais interessante mas jogar basicamente suicidio n tem muitas formas de se viver quando se esta mas os bots aliados bem uteis os utilize o jogo no geral muito bom possui incriveis e uma unica dos objetivos serem bem unicos e complexos Eu amei
Hora y media en una partida perdimos la la partida y la amistad 10/10 recomendado
I successfully gtfo however I would like to commend bishop and dauda for their hard work and efforts good game
i wish i werent so poor
The difficulty gets a bit easier when you realize you need to equip a weapon that can one shot stealth kill units Becomes easier when you go stealth first guns blazing second You just don't have the bullets to fight every fight I played the first mission with one buddy The FIRST mission And it took us 2 hours to get to the final moment where we'd scan the sample and then have to high-tail it out of there Well we never got the chance because the absolutely moronic AI wouldn't get in the circle We couldn't continue We tried for legitimately an hour to get it working and could only get a few percentage points at a time before they ran out like idiots We got to 30 percent at 1am before we finally gave up I don't usually feel like gaming was a waste but this was a complete waste of my time Would be fun with 4 people and being super tactical and managing equipment and resources But I will never again play this game after that experience I've never had a worse gaming experience than with this game Uninstalling With prejudice TLDR If you aren't in a group of four DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME
The game is worth the price Its surprisingly well optimize that it can be run from a non-gaming laptop on low settings Its very atmospheric and I have a great time with the gunplay and mechanics although frustrating at sometimes it gives a unique experience and good challenge for the player I do have two major problems with the game Bad friendly AI The bots that you can use in switch of a player often lacks features that's otherwise makes the game harder to play They can't be ordered to attack a specific sleeper while in sync with others They don't have the capacity to use the terminal its hard to find the objective especially if you don't have someone else using the ping command on the terminal due to the short time window given when pinging They will also prematurely fire before the doors is completely down wasting ammo in the process Updating it would make the solo player experience much more better and fun UI The UI and the fonts used in the entire game gives me a headache There's no option to turn the UI more bearable to use and the fonts in the objective especially the numbers often are so small or unrecognizable because of the glitchy UI that I constantly have to retype the entire ID item to the terminal
Despite the absolute thrower gameplay provided by the AI bot Bishop I have somehow successfully got out
Game R6S Lethal Company Amazon warehouse Silent Hill Get suffer now
Fun to play with friends
This game feels like it is still in early access Me and my friends played it and not even haft way through my Keys stopped working and I was unable to pick up items I do have to say it is very difficult to play with bots because the bots dont help you After a few minutes you get bored
Lot of crybabies leaving bad reviews without even trying the game long Its a hard game that is the whole design of the game Without learning the game mechanics and how the gun play works you are not going to win
Game is very unpolished and feels like its still in early access The whole time I was playing I just thought This is fully released Extremely difficult and dull game play and that's coming from someone who has played DS2 multiple times and enjoyed it
Lights scare them They are scared of light
Boring dumb AI Cool premise with poor execution
Absolutely Great Game I played it all weekend with one friend and we've completed a few levels but you will need 4 players the BOTS are okay They will pick up health ammo or tool packs and start replenishing when not necessary I.E I have 50 health and they will heal but i think that's plenty unless going against a Level 7 Security door Overall 09/10 game Mechanics 08/10 Enemies 9/10 random spawns 9/10 Weapon Customization 5/10 NIGHT VISION GOGGLES NEED 0/10
it fun
Tive primeiras desse jogo joguei com dois amigos diferentes na mesma fase e tive uma O jogo MUITO bem ambientado e entrega o que promete desafiador frustrante e de vez em quando te uns sustos quando espera Essa pegada de ter que trabalhar em equipe muito bem desenvolvida e o jogo extremamente punitivo ou seja tem que pensar pra jogar bem jogar com amigos pq a IA bem tive apenas 3 horas de gameplay mas me diverti bastante um jogo 8/10
600-800
Everything feels weak sounds weak and is weak
Excelente juego para pasarla como el pico

WHAT THE FUCK
Eu sou um pai de 45 anos provavelmente uma das pessoas mais velhas a jogar este jogo Sou pai solteiro criando meu filho que agora tem 14 anos Meu filho ganhou este jogo no Natal de 2021 de seu tio o instalamos em seu computador e ele a jogar o final da semana ele tinha 24 horas neste jogo Isso foi para mim pois era encontrar maneiras de passar o tempo com meu filho pois ele sempre com os amigos ou apenas assistindo ao YouTube eu decidi fazer uma conta no Steam e pegar esse jogo para ver se eu poderia jogar ao lado dele Eu comprei o jogo criei meu carpinteiro e comecei a jogar mas eu estava preso no que deveria fazer Pedi ajuda ao meu filho e ele organizou um jogo para eu participar Adorei pois foi o melhor momento que passei com meu filho desde que minha esposa morreu Desde esse jogo aproximou eu e meu filho novamente e agora passamos um tempo juntos fora de casa Este jogo me lembrou que em tudo e trouxe muitas felizes para mim e meu filho
I at first cannot get my head around this game however after an hour it rocks hard To those complaining about the lack of gunplay and the needed stealth go try levels like R1C1 They give you almost unlimited resources and what is needed to go loud even then me and my friends could barely come out alive after using all of our ammunitions THREE TIMES OVER Stealth doesn't change this outcome btw so no bias hell stealth is worse than loud in that level Good graphic can be ran on potato pc mine is a bad asf laptop and very good gameplay overall
Jogo ainda bem que paguei por ele simplesmente fecha a Steam outros aplicativos ou desliga o computador Passe longe dessa
Game is very very slowly paced and boring
GTFO is undeniably challenging and atmosphere-rich but it falls short in enjoyment for several reasons The missions are slow-paced and repetitive often involving the same tasks which become monotonous even with mods granting unlimited health and bullets The emphasis on meticulous team coordination can be frustrating without a perfectly synchronized group making solo play particularly unenjoyable While the dark tension-filled environment is initially engaging GTFO's steep learning curve and repetitive gameplay may leave players feeling more drained than entertained
Shit is hard
Interesting concept with intense audio and visual elements The cooperative gameplay is fun with friends and offers a challenge The UI is a lot to take in but I feel like I am slowly understanding it more The variety of weapons and tools keeps the experience fresh and inspires creative solutions
Te lleva a un ambiente de terror como en minas cuevas o excavaciones con bots o bien otros jugadores en un punto del mapa paso a de puertas donde lleno de esas plagas que hay de todo tipo Puedes ir en sigilo asesinando a los bichos o disparando a quemarropa Da la de ser un l4d2 solo que con sigilo y mucha dificultad y lo mejor es que resulta interesante porque no entiendes nada de lo que pasa entonces da una de misterio el juego en No lo he comprado pero para probarlo free demasiado bueno Ta piola Aaa y puedes elegir varias armas principales y secundarias antes de lanzarte a las cuevas te acomode
loud and bad
deve ser legal com amigos por que sozinho com bots tem como
Skibidi sigma game
Juegaso recomiendo jugar online si eres nuevo
Me encanta la del juego es inmersiva tensa y cuando toca mucha
it should not have taken me twelve tries of the game crashing and barely functioning to lower the graphics so it can run on my potato laptop runs fine once it works The game doesn't teach you how to do most of the stuff in the game and is very confusing I guess that makes sense your first run is the worst run but it is complicated to the point of it will scare most people away I also didn't enjoy the gunplay WAY too much recoil I had no idea where I was shooting half the time tldr 6/10 this game is mid at most Reviewed at part of the free weekend
good shit
GTFO More like WTFO as in Who The Fuck Other_than_retards_would_ever_want_to_play_this_game
I got into a match with a dude named Baba Yaga he was like a brother to me he revived me helped me ill miss him He was my brother I love you Baba Yaga god speed
I really wanted to like this game But the server issues and the game freezing during matches was annoying Kind of hard to work together when the game freezes during matches and other players just run in place Great concept monsters and design I am sure if it was working properly the game would be more fun

Awesome gunplay and movement but the gameplay is painfully slow Stealth should be more an option or else the game just feels like you're holding crouch the whole time
Epic
waste of time
contemple uma vela seria melhor q essa lanterna
Fun and challenging
extremamente coop n funcionou com meus amgs
If u have not played for more than 3 hours dont hate on the game thats all amma say
Callisto Protocol multiplayer and extremely better
fun
Tried playing twice refunded then played in this free weekend to see if it had gotten better months apart Matchmaking sucks shame game play feels ok/goodish and the concept/technical side is there would'nt recommend as ive never got into a game successfully to play bar the Tute
Nunca me dado por el culo tan fuerte y con tan poco amor como en este juego muchas gracias es justo lo que buscaba
I will eat 1 tablespoon of MAYONNAISE for every like this review gets
bad
Played for 2.3 hours with a friend and two random players The game is fun but suffers from an identity crisis Despite its flaws some elements work remarkably well Points Movement It's smooth with no stamina restrictions allowing for full-speed rushes The adrenaline from escaping a horde is palpable but dropping from a 1-meter ledge results in a 30 HP loss which feels off Guns They look fantastic but feel plastic lacking recoil and weight However the feedback from enemy kills is satisfyingly meaty Enemies The design is poor making it hard to distinguish between ranged and melee enemies Their footsteps are almost silent and health status is unclear without watching the health bar If they ask for my 40 which is hard earned money especially for people OUTSIDE the US they gotta fix their shit

Dis game is BUTT Pure BUTT
UNA PORONGA
game sucks

More like GTFO out of my Steam library amiright guys
hold e to hold e
Game has a severe lack of identity tutorial explains nothing just a vague overview of mechanics UI is a disgusting eyesore maps have retina searing floodlights in green fog that is incredibly disorientating The only thing that differentiate each gun only appears to be ammo capacity This game can GTFO my library

Enemy variety is bad and the enemies are unfair homing bullets too many variables with teammates and friendly fire boring gameplay cycle of finding things and pressing E weapons feel great but are inaccurate asf und shoot like nerf guns damage-wise bullet per enemy ratio is off great intro and atmosphere tho AI is decent too no gamma slider jonathan mother
norm
Pros and cons Pros Good game good light and other stuff The bots are cards on one hand they can be good and on the other not really Cons It is easy to get lost if you are not checking the map some lag in some places of the maps the ping command is broken when you try to use it
wasn't really my thing
The trailers try to sell it as an atmospheric sci-fi horde shooter when in actuality it's a cross between Oblivion melee combat and red-light-green-light stealth game with the VERY odd shooting sequence Also the gunplay makes you feel like the air is made of molasses
naur thank yew
gtfo z mojego dysku

I usually like the shooters but this not my type of game it's too stressing for me The graphics are fine weapons look and feel well There is some stealth and planning I think that horror games are for people with difficult mental health problems

i gotta say this games kinda freaky
not very interesting
Well.that was a shame
UI kompletnie nieczytelne
trash
There's a feature where the bots are magnetized to the front of my barrel so that every time I shoot a critter they heroically dive in front of me to protect it from my bullets 10/10
Over hyped game it's mid
AI id terrible loot is non existent ammo runs out halfway through the mission constantly forced to sneak cant see shit fall asleep between battles battles are horribly one sided Maybe better with friends but i highly doubt it
NOOO Hate it too hard to play played on a free weekend den var bajs som extreme level
bir gireyim dedim daha ilk oyundan siktiler Edit Bir daha denedik gene siktiler
Controls feel terrible doesnt tell you which buttons to ressuply your ammo i had to guess which button did it Boring stealth could give it more mobility to make it at least engaging
Nauseabondo interfaccia con effetto glitch permanente dopo il tutorial non sai che cosa cliccare o fare la prima missione dispersiva rispetto al tutorial
Gameplay atmosphere is good But no checkpoint or anything after play for 2 hours straight and lose need restart the whole campaign Waste my time
for those who are a fan of extraction shooters
shit game Waste my time
good

Really need to beg 3 of ur friends to buy GTFO to survive the levels 2 players isnt enough
NOT controller friendly controls are non intuitive and gameplay feels stiff AF
HUD 8
I managed to GTFO
Tried it out during free weekend had a blast even though we're still stumbling like babies The game's definitely not for everyone though
Os desse jogo muito complicados literalmente um labirinto trancado e escuro muitas partes se deparando em ficar preso em algum local e a gameplay travadona
Luckily there is free weekend thing This game is dog shit fuck you up in the arse so that you can become masochist and purposely confusing af and slow as hell Play stealth everywhere God forbid if you alerted the enemy before any alarm door segment Run out of ammo and health gg restart or uninstall game There is good game design and there is this game No git gud game bad I ain't sweaty balls I want to have fun
I cannot say that this game has bad gunplay or that the movement feels stiff or that there is no fluidity The idea where you and your friends have to be really coordinated excites me upmost I love tactical teamwork based games The problems arises when everything you do in this game is punishing you You don't get rewarded for anything you do and there is almost no way you can make a comeback after a singe mistake Exploring new rooms and taking out monsters the way you are supposed to coordinating attacks with your team so you don't alert the others does not reward you The risk you are taking to take out the monsters far outweighs the benefit of getting the items in the room The checkpoints are absolutely useless even if you complete a room you get sent way back and getting the progress you lost back feels super tedious My main problem is that these type of games should feel like tug of war You make a mistake you get punished You make a play you get rewarded After activating the scan you have to fight the monsters head on and you cannot stealth your way through this encounter If you play the game how you are supposed to you get punished Ammo is never enough even when you are supposed to use it The game feels extremely punishing and after a certain point exploring does not intrigue the player but it makes them feel uneasy/agitated because one single mistake can get you sent 4-5 rooms back After a certain amount of time playing this game feels like a waste of time because one mission can take 2 hours and it is better to stop than to go through a sector you already cleared successfully so you can do the one that you failed The audio when in combat is absolutely horrible The monsters like to hide and without audio it is almost impossible to know where you are getting attacked from To sum it up the game feels like a chore to play after a certain amount of time there is no second wind audio is not working properly the game does not reward you for anything you do I don't want an easier game I want a game that rewards me when I make progress the way the developers intended the game to be played This is the biggest problem that this game is facing and fixing it will make it 100x more enjoyable to play
Gut i want to get my male friend to bed
nice play please offer more in my region is sooo expensive
Bon je louchais dessus depuis un moment et le week-end gratuit m'a y jouer avec une bande d'amis HEUREUSEMENT que je ne l'ai pas Les graphismes pas ouf mais si ce que un gameplay basique un FPS sneaky mais avec un la p Les mobs se parfois on ne sait pas pourquoi le respect le la la position accroupie les 3/4 du jeu et le 1,2,3 soleil pendant le cours des mobs Oui pour la en jeu mais vu le bancal on manque souvent de munitions et il n'y a aucun de def d'esquive etc tout devient vite redondant Les drops sont au bonheur la chance la peut rarement en d'ennemie mais sans cette il y a des coins si sombres qu'on ne peut rien voir rien faire BREF tellement de petites choses qui ont mon et celle de mes mates Bien dommage car sympa mais mal Il y a des jeux du genre bien meilleurs Je ne mettrais jamais ce prix dans ce jeu ne le vaut pas du tout
This game has amazing atmosphere and visuals but its painfully unfair A horror shooter that gives you absolutely no ammo to work with most of the time with enemies that fire projectiles that arc and hit you for shed loads of health and the game gives you next to no health kits to replenish after a firefight which sums up to the experience if you make one mistake you might as well restart as you'll only die 40 minutes into the mission and have to restart The stealth mechanics that are cool until the game spawns enemies so close to each other that you cant deal with them without waking the horde I genuinely regret buying this its not fun it just punishes you for the tiniest mistake
var 31 kesinlikle bu oyundan daha keyifli bir aktivite
The game is very cool and underrated Many do not understand what to do and make the verdict that it is bad This is wrong The game captures its atmosphere of horror and apocalypse You be able to do anything alone with AI Bots I recommend understanding the game getting together with friends to play you will get unforgettable emotions
ich mag shooter aber das hier mir iwie nicht hat intressante features das bisschen brain braucht was genial ist aber das aiming ist rotze z.b wenn zoome und im zoom hoffen muss iwas zu treffen weil die hitbox verstrahlter ist als in css/csgo und in cs hast wenigstens ne abfolge damit kalkulieren kannst wie triffst hier hast generell einschlagskreis und im zoom auch das mich am meisten sonst das spiel gehen wem sowas kanns gern spielen wer mag sollt sichs
h1 A Challenging and Buggy Experience h1 I recently spent some time with this game because it had a free weekend promotion I played 2 rounds in Singleplayer and another 2 in Multiplayer Unfortunately I didn't manage to win any of the rounds The game felt overwhelmingly difficult and riddled with bugs During my Multiplayer session I encountered a significant bug about 5 minutes in and every round I played which made me unable to interact with the environment I couldn't use ammunition packs open doors or access worked I tried dying or changing the Key but it did not help at all In Singleplayer mode I found myself struggling as well Either it was due to my own lack of experience or because the difficulty is poorly balanced but whatever I played was not suitable for the first mission after an easy tutorial While I see potential for fun when playing with friends the game in its current state needs critical bug fixes Right now practically unplayable at least from my experience hr][/hr Overall u I recommend this game u The lack of enjoyment and numerous issues led me to stop playing after just 100 minutes
h1 h1 GTFO
Very fun mulitplayer game D
muy divertido con amigos
helldivers 2
Played it for a bit but found a bug where the E doesn't work searched online and it is a 7 month old bug Played another game the lobby owner left and we got sent back in time and enemies were not spawning doors were bugged and the key that the owner had despawned because he had it Sadly it still needs work
Frustrating experience
Very unintuitive UI The game progression is a little boring as you come across a horde or waves of hordes after which you just run around the map looking for the next door with the next hordes Not for me
NOT GOOD GAME VERY dark visual cannot see much where you go
Move or not
it was overhyped
2 money

good game plz add akimbo
i played this game during the free weekend and wanted to share my experience as a new player first of all i have always wanted to play this game because it seemed good So today i took the opportunity to play during the free weekend so the big problem with the game in my opinion is starting out as a new player because the game is so confusing for beginners You don't know what to do where to find the objective the key etc i was really lost for 40 minutes in a mission because of this i don't know what I'm supposed to do in the game even sometimes when i know the objective The map is incredibly confusing and i think this lack of clarity kills the motivation to keep playing But it is what it is the gameplay is good but that's the problem playing the game and getting lost not knowing what to do or where to find a key or whatever u need which makes me lose the desire to keep playing especially since i was playing without any guide for now im going to try looking up guides and see if that helps me play the game and no im not the only one Even my teammates who are new to the game don't know what the fuck they are supposed to do tbh the game should be cheaper
bred
Not that fun tbh
Jogo muito jogar sozinho porque os bots muito burros Vai desde ficar com a lanterna ligada como uma batata idiota ficar agachado levando tiro na nuca um jogo feito para ser jogado com amigos para se planejar Mas olha que maravilha fui jogar com os meus amigos e tomamos no mesmo lugar A gente parecia um monte de bots tentando passar pelos primeiros 20 minutos do jogo vezes que nem consegui contar E isso um grande feito porque minha equipe de amigos composta pela mais alta patente de pessoas treinadas Temos uma matadora de zumbis que foi treinada em Those Who Remain L4D e World War Z Depois temos outro veterano em Valorant CSGO e TFT habilidade no TFT em como posicionar o Mesmo assim com todos esses a gente falhou
me rompieron el orto
Painfully slow uninspired enemy design and no where near as thrilling as they advertise Also either audio is bugged or they had a terrible audio engineer It's like in between Darktide and Lethal Company so a very boring PVE extraction shooter and a completely relaxed horror game
Get the fudge out
This game takes a while for you to actually know what your opinion of it is Took me like 20 hours to understand more and more about this piece of art I love how they constantly throw new things at your face and you have to figure out in a fraction of time because it's life or death at that certain moment If you play this with 3 forgiving friends who can take a beating it'll be very fun and you'd have multiple good laughs when a friend does a fuck up a run Trying to figure out a new mechanic together is also a big laugh when you already kinda see how it goes but everyone tries to learn it their way not listening at your explanation This game grows on you and you start to have more and more fun with the hectic experiences If you have the friends and they like this setting and theme I'd definitely recommend you trying this
This has to be the worst game i have ever played in my entire life I really mean that with all sincerity It's actually really good i]at first[/i then you realise that every single level is i]exactly[/i the same as the last and every single tactic and requirement of you is i]exactly[/i the same as the before It's basically just one level copy pasted 100 times with minor cosmetic changes once every ten levels Absurdly detached-from-reality difficulty whose whole gimmick is simply not giving you any ammo not giving you any health and expecting you to complete levels combined with the fact that most levels will take i]at least an hour[/i to get through b]only to have you die at the very end and you are completely back to square one no saves no checkpoints nothing[/b means that almost every single time you play this game it is a complete waste of time Should've been 75 shorter and 400 more varied A giant game of nothing more than simple red light green light mechanics ad infinitum
GTFO ISN'T YOUR TYPICAL RUN AND GUN SHOOTER IT'S FOR PLAYERS THAT VALUE A SERIOUS CHALLENGE Send elite team to fight aliens and clear missions but hey to make it hard lets just give them 3 mags D it's more annoying then challenging Way to slow game play Hacking every other locker/chest/door with a 10/15 second minigame is just annoying Bullets never enough you have to sneak try to assassinate save ammo as much as you can and juggle ammo packs with teammates To much backtracking go there find door now find this find that and just run back and forth dead ends everywhere Your in a maze with random doors slapped everywhere Felt like a solid game that for some reason wants to slow you down at everything you do it seemed solid it launched everything seem to work and in my half hour didn't encounter any bugs or frame drops If you like slow paced sneaky peaky like gameplay you might actually enjoy it It's just not for me
game hard me no pass level with friends I recommend
shit ass
Sad remind me of a lot of fun games But tried 3 games never died but never beat the level I don't get it Edit I think the tutorial part of the game failed me as a new player
I was considering this game as something I would like to try on a sale but I really wasn't sure about it so before everything I really want to thank the developers for giving us the option to try this game for a limited time free TBH this is a game that really requires a mixed opinion While it is good at what it wants to be I believe its not for everyone If you're a person who likes games like Left 4 Dead and wishes for some harder challenges stealth elements this is exactly what you need While you can use bots to assist you during the mission I insanely recommend you play with a team As someone said before having friends is a MUST Even the game itself recommends its Discord server to find some if you're lonely If you want a fun experience with your friends that is not challenging at all IMO just go with L4D This game is not for you even its early missions are so frustrating that you would probably rage quit Also it's good to mention that if you're ALONE and can't communicate with other people well you'll suffer a lot Overall I highly recommend trying this game because it is literally 6 GB and downloading it won't hurt anybody aye I would like to describe gameplay elements but eh it will never be like trying it your self spoiler So in the end the choice is yours sadly I fit in the second category spoiler
It seems like an awesome game but the fact that the tutorial is extremely confusing and difficult doesn't bode well for new players more time was spent searching for where to go than engaging or doing objectives

too hard for my noob friends
Concept solid gameplay solid guns solid stealth solid defending mechanics solid All round pretty good
nah
Stealth<<<<RATATATATATA
This is a good and fun game for you and your friends but it takes a brain to actually play it as its supposed to be played
The game is a very knife 10/10 will Knife again
nice
Refunded as it wasn't a good fit for me Slow pace was bad But tap-firing while ADS had about 45 degree inaccuracy after about around 5 metres I can't play a shooter in which shooting enemies couple paces from you not full auto mode not hip-firing will not make you hit said enemies
sax
fk this game,too hard,many bugs,trash bot system
this game makes me vomit
GTFOH
best shit fr
Boring game
Can't wait to get the f*ck out
I PEEPEED AND POOPOOED AT SAME TIME FOR PLAYIN THIS
I suck but it's so good
good potential ass free game is ok
this game is so good it's kinda hard at first so don't expect to not have to learn basics mechanics and how thing work To thrive you also need a cohesive team but don't despair if you can't get 3 of your friend to play the official GTFO discord is full of people looking to play and is a great way to meet new people and to learn a bit from more experienced players
ehhhh its ok ai is really dumb and the enemies kill me way too fast

no other game has you do a single mission for 5 hours
BEM MEIO Os monstros bem TOSCOS pra falar algo pior Parece boneco de cera numa do toyStory Existe jogos de PS2 que tem monstros mais bem feitos com melhor O jogo passa medo nenhum apesar da de HorrorGame num totalmente escuro pra deixar uma de lugar abandonado com criaturas horrendas e que algo vai dar muito errado caso algum idiota da sua equipe alguma besteira que adianta tentar fazer tudo perfeitamente sincronizado pois em algum momento os monstros vir aos montes e a dificuldade de matar eles quase pra passar a ideia de que o jogo e te obrigar a fazer tudo PERFEITO Mas o que acontece que a unica vontade que tens e chegar correndo em qualquer lado metendo bala em tudo que se meche por isso eu diria.BEM FRACO

very good spooky scary game with lots of pulsating undulating gooshy little guys
game does not work just freezes at waiting for system assets to initialize
stealth stab pew pew pew you die
Don't play at 3:00AM you will not want to live after that endeavor fun
The game is too expensive even with regional pricing Released back in 2021 it has been three years and it still maintains its high price On the plus side the sound design and atmosphere are exceptional They effectively capture the horror of being in the dark while fighting powerful enemies with limited ammo The immersive soundscapes and atmospheric elements truly enhance the sense of tension and dread making every encounter feel intense and gripping However the gameplay mechanics are just fine They quite reflect the advancements expect from a shooter in 2021 instead they feel more akin to older games like Half-Life 2 from 2004 While not necessarily a bad thing it gives the game a nostalgic feel and it may not meet the expectations of those looking for more modern mechanics and innovations Overall the game excels in creating a chilling atmosphere and delivering a classic shooter experience but it might not impress those seeking cutting-edge gameplay features
Ytn
Nah
500
great game to play with friends but will scare the living sh#t out of you
muy buen juego
bir 15 20 dk bekletiyor vakit
The mechanics are simple but to master its pretty fun
varias horas e ainda nao entendi Nada Ti jogam num lugar e ti vira So presta se tiver time fechado 4 players Infosivel playar solo
dead game
Um verdadeiro desafio tanto em termos de gameplay quanto um desafio pra amizade dentre os inteegrantes do grupo FOI QUE AGGROU ELE CARALHO Mentira foi fulano que andou Uma pena que um deles tenha enjoado do jogo 7.5/10
i do not like this game
free trial dog shit
feels like its artificially difficult and that makes it not fun and the controls feel wonky
if you are easily lost impatient or friendless then this is NOT the game for you otherwise 10/10
GOD
I enjoyed it My friends did not
didnt i do it for you
Shit blew if im bein fr hella mid
trash as hell
Dookie
quality game
Not a good port for controller and that's a deal breaker for me I prefer playing FPS games with controller only It's odd seeing prompts for using keyboard keys pop up instead of controller button icons It's like the game is confused on whether or not you are using the controller
Amazing game with a lot of depth and some of the best atmosphere you will ever get in any video game There is one critical thing you must have to play and that is a group of friends Heck I have made a friend on here over the free weekend which is awesome But let me be clear THE BOTS ARE USELESS You are better off going solo than bringing a bot along with you they will get you killed If you are the kind of person who loves tactical games with friends that require time and planning this is the game for you all
Acho que assaltar um banco mais que jogar esse jogo
dude no wonder this game had a free trial its hot garbage dont waste your time
JOGO FILHO DA PUTA DO CRLH DEMOREI 5H PRA PASSAR A FASE FACIL DESSA PORRA ESCURO QUE MINHA VIDA ESSE JOGO dito isso recomendo
Tried it during the free weekend sad to say it's not my cup of tea but it definitely fills a niche for those who enjoy tense challenging gameplay Animations are incredible I really like the weapon models and the game does an excellent good job at building a tense and unsettling atmosphere using the monsters darkness and music
This game sucks
This is fucking pain unless your with 3 people and bots
very nice game wish i could play more but the free weekend is almost over devs if you see this hmu with a key
free weekend goes crazy
Moving with the controller is so weird couldn't play it
This game is great if you're a masochist Everything in this game is punishing and everything is cryptic The atmosphere is good if you don't mind turning to find your friend's model completely disappearing and seeing floating sentry guns We also had to flick flashlights on and back off before opening every door because some players could see lights that others could not Those lights still triggered enemies GTFO is fun when you are progressing which is slow but satisfying It is also rare You can make it to the end of the mission fall less than your height and lose 20 of your health that was at 40 to begin with As said before if you enjoy being punished for anything and everything this is the game for you but it sure wasn't for me
its ok
Prefiero hacer pozos con 45 grados que jugar esta poronga
I played with 2 buddies and 1 bot never seen a bot so retarded in a game wasting ammunition resources and have the worst positioning possible thank you for the free weekend so i don't have to spend a single on this dogshit game best part of the game is when you uninstall it
poggers
This game is a drag Missions are too long game is way too dark enemies are never a thrill to deal with I can understand why you'd like this but I will definitely think differently of you
making the tutorial unnecessarily hard is a sure way to repel any new player even if its free
yes
God this game is like an asylum also bots aren't completely useless use the commands
bad
This game Destiny 2 and Hunt Showdown are proof that if a youtuber recommends a multiplayer game 70 of the time its gonna be doo-doo
its spooky 10/10
its fairly easy ngl buff scouts
Tried the game for the free weekend and much like the other reviews from players I would not recommend it The game is just awful and very stingy with ammo I understand that the point is resource management but it is just completely awful with its sneak requirement
bad game
crazy!11
Excelente juego
Can't edit the graphics before the long ass intro so my game always crashes wish you could change it beforehand
i will never be the same after finally beating the first level with two friends after multiple hours this game sucks and its fucking awesome
Un bot es mas que mis amigos y yo
so glad they made this free for the weekend Let me try out how playing games as a blind person feels Do not recommend unable to see
Played for the free weekend and wow This game is really boring I didn't find it super difficult just immediately monotonous Super disappointing If you just give me all the weapons and equipment right off rip why keep playing Where is the progression Just the trinkets you find lying around and cosmetics No thanks And Jesus the main menu is just a headache to navigate Really glad you made it so stylized who needs user experience right Hour of my life I'm never getting back
Worst game I've ever played
Injugable esta wea
1 of the hardest game i've ever played u have to be on your guard through the entire expedition 1 little tiny mistake and u r done the only problem is it takes time to find a match
The Gameplay is fun with a great Atmosphere But this game has a serious progression issue you unlock nothing besides Cosmetics and some Boosters that essentially only last one round and so far have not been required but that is just me as i'm someone who always keeps stuff for far to long in anticipation of something big coming where it is needed Difficulty of this game is hard to judge for me as i played Solo with Bots and by god are they useless they waste Medikits by healing you with 3 simultaniously they don't really participate in melee killing enemys Although they never get detected anyways so that might be the reason they sometimes just start shooting even though the other enemy was just starting to get alerted and still had enough time to be killed stealthy So all in all a decent game you can have fun with if you have friends but worth the price tag Probably not
I am not skilled enough to enjoy this game but I think other people who are better at video games would enjoy it
took 5 hours to complete the first mission i dont know how i feel about this game
nao vale apena se for jogar solo
this game is like working a 48 hour unpaid shift in the ball crushing factory
Only play if you have 3 COMPETENT friends
Played it for about 20 minutes ran out of bullets and got lost
was ne UI raff garnix
Made me say lets Get The Fuck Out 10/10
fire i wish i could get game tho but i cant buy it
Its a fun game just a not exactly scary like it suggests
Glad this was free weekend God damn this game is fucking hot garbage I will never recommend this game to anyone ever for any reason This is a hard game Don't play if you like to accomplish anything Anyone better than me is hacking
best game ever i joined my friend game and won the game and my friends ale mad at me for joining for last 10seconds of game

GTFO est un jeu de tir la personne sur la en jeu d'horreur action Les graphismes sont sombres immersifs et chouette une pesante par des monstres chelous qui puent La coop est mis au du jeu demandant aux joueurs de travailler ensemble pour survivre aux hordes d'ennemisLa des armes et des outils disponibles est assez Bien que le jeu puisse exigeant surtout pour les joueurs en solo son et son immersive en font une inoubliable pour ceux qui recherchent une aventure GTFO offre une faire entre amis pour passer de bons moments comme des mauvais cause des mobs chelous pour les personnes en recherche d'un bon jeu coop et FPS
The game is really good The recent negative reviews are a bunch of winnie babies that got the game for free and didn't even played more than an hour The matchmaking is kinda confusing but the game has its own discord server with alot of people playing and using mic to cooperate The difficulty is a little high comparing to games with the same proposal but the challenge itself is worth it learning everything is really fun

gtfo i like this game
played 3 matchmaking games with my brother every game both team mates and enemies froze for me no movement yet my brother was saying why are you shooting at dead enemies and saw me moving and such unplayable glad i tried it out while it's free edit for clarity the freezes were indefinite lasted until i quit the match
Im Rahmen eines Gratiswochenende gespielt Stimmung Visuals sind erste Sahne Die Idee ist auch gut habe es zusammen mit 2 Freunden gespielt ohne zu wissen was uns erwartet Nach 3 Runden dachten wir uns Okay wird das irgendwann noch schwer gruseliger oder allgemein etwas motivierender Man startet das Game ohne Lore keine Geschichte in die man irgendwie vom Spiel versucht wird abzuholen um zu verstehen worum es eigentlich geht oder was warum so passiert Nach dem Ende einer Runde bekommt man je nach Abschluss irgendwelche Booster die irgendeine Runde einmalig verwendbar sind und ab und zu auch Cosmetics die weder sonderlich schick aussehen noch irgendeinen spielerischen Mehrwert bieten Freischaltungen im klassischen Sinne fehlen hier komplett Was meiner Meinung nach stark zur Motivation beitragen Allgemein vermitteln die Trailer ein schon sehr actionreichen Shooter diese actionreichen Momente will man aber vermeiden da die Runde sonst wohl schnell alle Parteien vorbei ist Das es ist mehr ein Schleichsimulator und bedarf gute Abstimmung mit seinen Mates um die sehr wenig zur stehende Munition nicht gleich bei der ersten Mobgruppe zu verbrauchen Leider absolut nicht das was wir gesucht haben Ein Blick in ein Playthrough der Endmission zeigte auch da kommt echt nicht mehr viel das es sich zu spielen lohnt in unseren Augen Schade eigentlich Bei knapp 40.000 Bewertungen mit Sehr positiv bewertet hatten wir als Gruppe vielleicht auch falsche Erwartungen Hoffnungen was uns das Spiel bietet weswegen ich es nicht empfehlen Aber ihr wissen
Annoying mechanics AI is brain dead guns are next to useless most weapons are zero progression Cool world tho ill give them that art style is great too Gun play would be fun if you could use it without dying Cant recommend if you value your time or money
It's ok Wait for a sale
this game is AWSOME i played it on free weekend with my friend and we sat over 3 hours straight laughing and screaming i will most likely buy it
I think im gonna kill myself

I had fun Its a nice horror exploration shooter And can also be played solo with bot companions that work passably Performance was good on my old system
I dont Like This Game
way too much annoying ass mecanics just sucks in general 2/10
the more I read the reviews the more I realise how miserable people are especially the new generation of European gamers who are numb-brained This piece is on my mind for 3 years and when you look at it it has been huge progress this game made so far Seriously considering buying it rn Solid piece of work could be considered as a serious atmosphere with astonishing graphics even the players like me who are not give a shit about anything related to graphs With its enjoyable gameplay this game has most of the things I really liked about Payday I can't make sense of absurd thoughts such as oh too difficult it's not ma CupofTea BuT Genre is very clear the description is very clear Even the sales department has indicated what the product you will receive and there is nothing terrible to exaggerate In fact modern games don't have a truly challenging and intelligent structure other than the grindy products which is stealing your time because of the demands of the player bases and demands Many of them considering the games like Elden Ring and other exaggerated pieces(exaggerated on hard difficulty make no missunderstanding as a hard but in the end if you guys really want to experience the hardness of industry i'll suggest you to take a trip on old manifactured games those clunky controls and absurd puzzles drives you crazy fr No microtransactions No paid dlc's/cosmetics other craps etc And a refined fucking fine game What you could ask more Take it or leave it fellas Jeeeeez
Mmm regular
kurwa trudne
I played it for the free weekend and by far the biggest turnoff for me is how there is no progression system You have access to all the weapons and gadgets unlocked from very start For me a progression system in a multiplayer game that's based on replaying the same missions over and over and over needs to have a progression system otherwise I get bored really fast as I have no sense of progression And the UI on the main menu is purposely vague and intuitive for the sake of the theme the game is trying to put out which is cool but it's so vague and hard to navigate that I wouldn't at all be surprised if I somehow missed that there actually is a progression system that I just didn't see But I did see with my own two eyes every weapon and piece of gear you can equip for missions is indeed unlocked from the start which sucks Also the shooting feels slightly off not very satisfying It's a cool game with lots of uniqueness to it clearly lots of love but I can't recommend it without a progression system it's pretty much a basic necessity in multiplayer shooters these days
Art is good but the tutorial does not explain shit and the UI is ass Looking at text being out of focus is not fun
Bishop makes sure you don't make it to the end of the level without getting downed at least once 10/10
shit was terrible

this is pretty awful the visuals were good the game play is awful
Lo iba comprar pero mas muerto el multijugador y la manera es jugarlo con amigos mediante discord No hay para principiantes o al menos que ir es como un laberinto
boring not scary npc shooter YES
My friend with I play GTFO said that if I post a review on GTFO and it gets 100 likes and 20 awards he'll buy me a case of beer and some vodka So I'll leave this here
Auch 2024 noch einer der besten Hardcore Horror Taktik Shooter Leider ist das Gameplay etwas in die Jahre gekommen und auch die Grafik nicht mehr ganz auf der der Zeit was ohne Mods wie True Black for OLED oder HDR10 GTFO Remastered schnell ersichtlich wird Gutes Spiel mit extremen Schwierigkeitsgrad Leider kein Upscaling wie DLSS Xess oder FSR3
Game is too hard you die in 5 seconds then there is a mass attack
I didn't like the game
uninstalling
Rainbow six siege extraction made in roblox
The tutorial made me want to GTFO
Get The Fuck Out
The game is fine not my cup of coffee i know they are trying for the more Stealth mechanics but the gameplay feels so strange to deal with a horde when the alarm happens sorry i don't think this game is for me at least the animations enemies and weapons looks really good if i want a more challenge game i could just turn the difficult high on other games like Payday Left4Dead 2 or Killing Floor Btw i'm looking forward to Den of Wolves Ulf is a great guy
Controller support is horrible Unplayable with controller Tried guides to fix the controller they made it worse Fix ps5 controller and it might be worth playing
Stealth<<<<RATATATATATA
its fun but 1 glitch can ruin it
game sucks
its a pretty decent game can only play while its free would love to get it but got kids that i got to support so thats out of the question but it is an really amazing game 9/10
There's a very good reason that most games don't put a homing projectile on every basic enemy It's not a hard game and it doesn't know what it wants from players Have fun crouch walking and holding E if that's what you like Developers are done with development so it's as poorly designed as it will be and it's gonna stay that way Please don't waste a dime P.S for all the people that think the people who don't like this game have a skill issue people like hard games there's a reason it has negative reviews People aren't going to be patient with bad mechanics if there's no skillful way to avoid it The developers have no idea what they wanted from the players If it was just a stealth game it'd be fine but they force you in to horde situations full of undodgable projectiles Finding the one spot in the room where you aren't going to get swarmed with unreadable and poorly telegraphed attacks isn't a challenge it's a chore Obfuscating information to a player with poor enemy designs is a terrible way to make a game challenging

So ein ich spiele das Tutorial,finde Munition aber wie zum Teufel man nach Mit R tut sich nichts Die Spiele werden echt immer schlimmer Geschenkt ist noch zu teuer
Please make GTFO 2 with PVP extration That would blow up so hard
Game has great graphics and good concept but some friends are too slow to understand how to play this game
The game looks really interesting and fun to play but unfortunately the white flashing rectangle that pops up right before it displays the text is literally painful for me to look at I'm autistic so I'm fairly sensitive to these things I thought I'd give the game a go despite the light sensitivity warnings because I didn't think it would be a big issue as I didn't encounter any problems with light sensitivity in video games so far But other than that it looked really well made
10/10
This is the most shity UI I ever see in my gaming life I imagine how a special person you should to be to make such a decision Every button in the game need PRESS AND HOLD PRESS AND HOLD PRESS AND HOLD even when you select texture resolution Haven't you played your own game
COOP 90 2 40
Made me sick with all the UI Not recommended if you have issues with astigmatism or any related matter
Cool lobby simulator
the story is interesting and I like the design to solve puzzles and such but the game is too difficult to enjoy without a dedicated group that are willing to play with you and re-try again and again I don't think most player have the patient to enjoy this game so I don't recommend If the Devs of this game want to make profit and have more players playing they should learn from Darktide or Helldiver it's a product afterall My advice would be start with easy difficulty let the players get hooked to the story and puzzle solving add more difficulty on after the 1st play through
The game where the hardest part is to find a fricking door leading to the right zone after killing half of the enemies on the map
RX6600XT 500 1 40
I watched the lestplay from Markiplier a few years ago and it looked kinda cool and fun but as when played it with my friends it was kinda mid and boring tbh
Lazy designed gameplay loop with a lot of stuff reused No option to kick in lobby Game gets boring quick

10/10 would turn the flashlight on again

Didn't like it so I can't recommend Graphics and gameplay felt below par kinda janky
que concepto mas guapo el de la intro pero el gameply
Co to za toporne
Interesting gameplay horrible graphics ugly gross enemys low quality engine No thank you not even if it were free2play
Is pointless playing it alone so if tou have anyone to play with even try it If you play with random people they will not play in team work I hope their next project they add a single player option that it not pointles without a team

HUD muito bonito na verdade achei bastante sci-fi o que me agradou logo de cara Gostei da jogabilidade embora seja meio confusa no O tutorial Espero realmente que o jogo tenha uma lore joguei 1h mas pretendo jogar mais Eu queria saber UMA coisa AS PERSONAGENS FEMININAS pra homem Se for eu devolvo o dinheiro mesmo gostando do jogo Se mulher joga o que eu fazendo aqui o favor devs
1 1 2 3
Overall a really good co-op fps emphasis on the co-op It's not exactly the most fun solo But if you have friends that play then it becomes an absolute blast of intense moments and funny shenanigans
game is trash the monsters do way to much damage and have way to much health the graphics are good but thats about the only good thing
Yes

matchmaking doesnt work get in a match with less then 4 people then someone leaves and the spot is never filled sitting in lobby forever game is unplayable solo or even with just 1 guy so you have to sit through that terrible matchmaking
Killing floor 2 This shit
Free Weekend Made it through like halfway through the tutorial before deciding this was not for me
belki bir hediyeci denk gelir 3 takdir ettim ama oynayacak yok malesef
The idea behind it is great but sadly I found it quite boring for my taste
not fun
Very boring gunplay looks bad Everything in fog may be creators tried to hide blurry graphics idk Enemy AI very stupid they just run to you without any tactics
h1]7/10[/h1 It's essentially a very good co-op tactical FPS stealth zombie game The only problem is that you need minimum 2 friends to be somewhat successful 3 would be ideal I don't have friends The missions actually offer variety in objectives and obstacles which is cool
Decent not scary enough
Shit game didn't even make it out of the tutorial
Boring as hell in my opinion
Great Times Friends Only
is friendly fire on we never make it out the spawn

zzzzzzzz

Fight together or Rage Quit together
playing this on the weekend with friends is very fun
ok
feels like a serious killing floor 2 but except the combat is horrible
Hard time launching once done it is nice Meh
THE GAME IS NOT GOOD LUCKY FOR ME IT WAS FREE AND A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME GUNPLAY IS DOGSHIT YOU CANT SEE FOR SHIT BAD GRAPHICS NOT EVEN REMOTELY SCARY OR ENGAGING BORING GAMEPLAY
not good cant figure out shit ui is garbage bots are garbage
3/5
its only fun with friends dont buy if you dont have friends to play with

Just boring
This game literally gives you no ammo and expects you to finish rounds by crouching like a noob no one wants to hack and slash like some sort of beta if your an ALPHA BVLL like me don't get this semen slurping game ya hear
Not worth it Movements and combat feels very clunky Playing with bot is useless Nobody joins the lobbies and if they do they leave after 5 minutes UI felt very uncomfortable and hard to read Why do I have to ping a terminal to find stuff I already do this at work The game is markedted as difficult but in reality it's hard simply because of the clunky ass movements Waste of time
im blinded by the lights
Imagine paying for this

odst but not
I dont know how to load the weapon in the tutorial Mission tryed 15 minutes and then deleted the game
You are playing a Horror Shooter Stealth Strategy game expect it to be slow trying to play it as intended Most negative reviews are coming from people playing during the free to play days they're having skill issues game play and socially wise Great game extremely hard solo friends or a good coordinated team are recommended The UI is clean and isn't distracting at all when you READ the text during the tutorial and even a mission its directly tells you what you need to find or type out Most of the time you don't even need to use the terminal if you just explore and look around you'll end up finding what you're looking for if you at least READ the objective during the mission Playing during the free weekend and so far really fun heavy on strategy and coordination with your team resources are hard to find but feels great when finding something either ammo/health or objective items during a mission The atmosphere of the game is beautiful and heavy when exploring the movement going through can be slow if you try clearing all rooms of enemies being stealthy but safer being precise is far more rewarding when dealing with enemies but having a good horde dealing weapon helps tremendously during alarm fights The Bots are okay not the worse but not the best Having people are definitely better but at times a bot can find something that you probably missed if you weren't paying attention around you like enemies/containers/doors Also making sure the Bot has a good loadout helps you more It's not the hardest to take it slow and strategist how you deal with enemies but having the people to do so is the hardest part Regardless really fun and being careless can change your peaceful situation to a dire one in an instance This is not suited for people who play by themselves and don't have enough patience or time Over all a good game that's hard and requires a lot of teamwork
devs suck 0/10
I love this game as it give challenge to player rather then a simple game that can be beaten just by gunning down everything to dead Even tho there some bug in this the game just amazing that i can tolerate them This game need player to LEARN UNDERSTAND STRATEGIZE and functional brain to adapt to any situation If you don't have this skill then safe yourself from suffering in this hardcore game There's negative review but some of it just them being dumb blaming the game while actually they just suck in this and i bet they cant even complete the easiest difficulty this game have alone
ME HIZO MIERDA EL PC pero se ve bueno
Bobo
Take Left 4 dead make it survival horror Cool idea very awkward and boring execution
3 years in and still no proper controller support Using an Xbox controller crouch is not mapped to any button Main selection button is top left bumper for some reason On screen prompts never switch to controller they stay on keyboard Movement feels like it's just keyboard controls ported to game pad Clunky and awful Doesn't control well at all with game pad Running is press and firmly hold left stick in feels like I'll break my controller so no running add a toggle key Menus are a nightmare to navigate Disabled people need controller support I wanna play your game I'll try again next year
aku suka ini
good game just need to make it so you can vault over and up stuff
I don't believe the positive reviews purely because I couldn't get past the tutorial because of how much I hated how it felt to move shoot jump melee etc Just overall feels awful and sluggish Do i even have to mention the UI or the lack of real information while playing How the hell did this ever make it
Buen juego bues graficos buen disparo buen sonido sin historia SIN amigos
i like this game like a dog
The tutorial teaches you nothing and if you use an controller the game still gives you keyboard commands At one point it tells you to use a computer terminal to ping a key card but it does not teach you what to type in to complete it and I put my controller down and used my keyboard and mouse with the same result The lack of instructions I guess adds to the realism but you do not learn the skills needed to play the game
GTFO MY PC
it was 3 days free weekend and i want my money back
Jogo e super a segunda vez que jogo ele em uma free week e digo que a proposta bem tem um porem Os lobbys com o jogo free por um tempo bem vazios o que uma pena Assim vontade de comprar Se o jogo fosse free to play pra sempre talvez tivesse alguma vida
Possibly one of the worst games I've ever touched in my life The UI was created for people with down syndrome and the game play is utter horse shit Zombie design is terrible and this game needs to be put down just like it's developers
Absolute garbage Don't move and don't use flashlight and they won't attack you Me spawns in game and stands still dies instantly The game was free but honestly feel like I should be compensated for my time Hot TRASH
game is dead
Even a free weekend didn't save the lack of a player base
Quite possibly the worst gun play I've ever felt No recoil or feedback on hits Getting hit by enemies feels boring screen slowly moves to the side and the character has a slow reaction where he lets out a slow loud groan as if he is also bored Not sure who the target audience is with this gun play but it has no crossover with any of the FPS games I've ever played in my lifetime Also bonus points for quality assurance letting through the neverending hold E for every interaction possible And for allowing the worst menu design that is needlessly trying to filter out any would-not-be pirates from entering in by going through a motion sickness test
Games made in 1996 shoot better than this game Awful hit boxes The menu gives me a seizure Tried this on a free weekend and you couldn't pay me to keep playing this game pass
fun
The noodle man touched me
Good game to play with a team however the technical issues are worth mentioning at first I got constant stutter and performance issues the solution was to install the game on an SSD some missions are pretty much unplayable with a team as the game crashes when loading the map
Muito foda
una re porongaaa lo unico de 10 calidad grafica movilidad armas bots muy toscos y imposible de jugar Meadisimo

Great concept however The matchmaking system is trash no one uses coms even when you do manage to connect to play Hitboxs r all over the shop maps are just a maze that r sooo easy to get lost in Not for me uninstall

sucks
closest thing to progression raiding you can get in a tactical co-op shooter unmatched atmosphere unique unapologietic masochist gameplay this is a good thing only downside is the discord matchmaking since the in game lobby system isn't great or just harass all of your friends until someone feels bad enough to finally humor you
O jogo em si otimo mas falta algo Os monstros meio feito nas coxas e a do jogo exigir que jogue em time deixa tudo mais complicado pq o jogo ta morto aqui no BR junta isso com uma dificuldade desbalanceada intencionalmente fica dificil pra qm gosta do game jogar ele sozinho devia ter uma de jogo mais balanceada para solo ou qm joga com bots q temos muitos jogadores Triste mas esse foi de arrasta pra cima tbm

Boring game
Seemed like a cool game Wasn't enough character customization for me since there was 0 girl character options so killed my interest
Not good
Crap game boring messes with your controls like I never experienced in a video game it literally attributes keys to actions you never messed with disabled LMB i couldn't fire next Esc key did not respond anymore because the game decided it's not attributed to Exit The shooting system is not good not pleasant the matchmaking is awful everyone leaves before it starts Game trailer is nothing like the game A game that messes up that much with the basics deserve to be uninstalled asap too many flaws tested during free weekend
My friends put me on a PC while we got swarmed I don't talk to them anymore
I HATE THIS GAME SO MUCH Anyways gotta redo R6D1 again
worst game i have played
I f'n hate myself but daaaaamn do I want to drag my friends corpses through hell and back just to see the extraction screen

Painfully tedious and just not enjoyable in my opinion

Tough challenging scary gritty punishing immersive and coordination dependent 10/10

This game is so much fun Mostly just run 2 people and a bot and thats usually good enough for a good challenge but the sound design and visuals go crazy Fear factor runs out pretty quick and sometimes the bots glitch making it impossible to do scans but overall this game is definitely a pick up if you've got at least one person to do it with Great game
i got out
Buen coop
It is a great fun teamworking game to play with you friends for some great co-op
Four more words and then I'm done
brings out the worst in me

AI
The AI is pretty terrible but if you have at least one or two mates preferably at least two this game is a blast If you enjoy games with a large emphasis on strategy communication and teamwork this has you covered

Can almost never find other players on matchmaking which leads to almost never being able to play When you do your paired with players who think you suck too much and leave which means you can almost never play the game Matchmaking needs complete rework and the community needs a gutting of toxicity
gameplay goes from snoozefest to annoying real quick
I was touched by the noodle man
Heure de la simulator
trash game
Fun game but you NEED a party of 4 the AI in this game can be either hit or miss especially on stealth portions of the game Been having a blast so far and am very excited to move on to future missions
The game is probably fun but I'm bad at it and got no friends
I will leave the cat here so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards l
rlly good
great wish i had more time
pain
the story is good but the game is full of bugs and weird glitches that the devs does not see or either ignore game crashes weird bugs black screen on monitor glitchy screen etc etc
It is punishing but very fun
Fun game and requires hella teamwork That being said screaming at friends has never felt better I also like the guns

do you like clenching your cheeks yes well let me say after playing this game you will have enough muscle to film a hydralic press tiktok video with nothing but your cheeks as you will be flexing them constantly
is hard is nice nuff said
Esse jogo insano com trabalho em equipe uma mistura de e survival horror recomendo aos gamers que procuram por algo
survival horror
yes
The struggle is absolutely unbearable sometimes when you get so far into a level but it's also so damn good If you have friends who are willing to dedicate time to learn the game it is so worth I love how difficult the game gets and how complex some situations might be The game being difficult does also make for some funny moments surprisingly Highly Recommend for those who are looking for a difficult co-op game Also possible solo
Hush or they'll hear you
Got this came not even a week ago and all ready 25 hours Really love it Overall tho jokes aside in just a short amount of time this became my top 5 games Stealth feels amazing it feels good to be an american idiot but the bots are dumb Love it tho
rare good game moment
idk
Match making does not work at all Could have been an amazing concept
I can't say this enough YOU NEED FRIENDS TO PLAY THIS do what you need to do gift them the game hold them at gun point whatever but if you play alone you won't get far get friends or git gut
good game
it is pure pain pls help my friend has imprisoned me to playing this and my brain is now liquid
On dit pas c'est nul on dit j'aime pas
Good fun tactical coop shooter game Good atmosphere
Some people take a head splitting headache to a whole new level in this game

aaaaaaaaaa
There's not another game out there like GTFO Once you've got i]the bug[/i you'll keep coming back If you don't have friends to play this with find some The devs aren't kidding when they describe the game as hardcore-cooperative this game is hard as nails and a misunderstanding or bad play can lead to you losing an hour of progress This is i]the bug[/i The game demands so much from you and failure is so punishing that you start to think about it outside of the playsession You plan new strategies with your crew IRL You think of optimal loadouts based on damage range ammo efficiency on your daily commute i]The bug[/i has you My crew probably spent six of our real-life hours banging our heads against the FOURTH level R1C1 Reconnect until we took a break came up with another new strategy re-tailored our loadouts and won Felt fantastic can't wait to see what else is in this insane game I've heard R2D2 Reactor Startup is even harder sign me up
I have a very big love hate relationship with this game it is one of the best co-op strategy games i have played the adrenaline in some levels and instances really holds this game up and when finishing a level especially with friends it is such a satisfying feeling In saying that i think the game has a major flaw i feel like the developers don't respect and value anyone's time If you're someone like me that works 5 days a week this game can be such a waste of time at moments Some missions can go for 2 hours and if you get right to the end and fail you guessed it you have to start all over again from scratch 2 hours wasted The game is so tight with checkpoints sometimes in most levels you don't even get a checkpoint which i think is pretty ridiculous I know games in general are a waste of time but if you just want to play a game casually with the boys and wind down after work i would really give this game a second thought Other then that i'd give this game a solid 8/10 I love the gun diversity i love the monster mechanics its really well constructed
Have friends
Icky little monsters need a boop in order to set them on the right path
Overrated
get the fuck out GTFO
best game ever
Game blows
good
gud luck soloing
W game
El juego es interesante y duro veo dos quejas Y bastante importantes Hay una criatura que escupe proyectiles amarillos Literalmente esos disparos son casi teledirigidos Me parece genial que exista un enemigo que sea de largo alcance lo que no entiendo es como el disparo que te lanzan te persigue es jodidamente injusto Te giras para intentar esquivarlo y el maldito proyectil gira hacia ti en el aire solucionar eso entiendo que quieran hacerlo dificil pero creo que existen muchos otros factores ya presentes en el juego que lo logran esta simplemente lo hace insufrible a veces genial que los packs de suministros Ammo pack Tool Reefil y health pack pudieran moverse de sitio Quiero decir Hay misiones en las que tener es crucial para aguantar las oleadas No poder soltar la en un lugar para hacer un seguro dificulta o incluso suele imposibilitar el de la bien que se pudiera dropear esos packs en el suelo haciendo posible estrategias Ajeno a estos dos puntos Me sigue pareciendo un muy buen juego Tiene una que me parece exquisita lograda la y la Incluso tiene el detalle de que se ve como la que usas en su cristal esta ligeramente raspado muy bien optimizado y el sonido de las armas y sus recargas molan bastante incluidos
games need some Meta Progression
Mastuburate on my DP plz
Great change of pace can be cleared quickly and quietly if efficient you can take it slow and quiet or you go run and gun with it Amazing game 10/10 would 100 recommend Random queue Isn't even bad but friends are better Scouts are horrifying though not hard to deal with but horrifying
it good
NO SEX OPTION
Some people might find this game tedious frustrating and find it even worse if you don't have any good friends to play with But for me my group of friends are amazing to play with and I've never had a game where it both Co-Op and it's difficult at the same time I love a good challenge and GTFO keeps me at the edge of my seat throughout the entire expedition whereas some can last under an hour some up to over 3 but I'm engaged the whole way through and I've been loving it In conclusion if you have a group of 3 friends looking for a fun engaging heart wrenching challenge then please try this game out It has hours upon hours of content so you won't be finishing it with your buddies in just a week or even a month at that
Great game and very interesting story though it can be some what hard to follow sometimes Watching YouTube videos can help you understand the plot better The game-play is awesome and can have moments when you're clenching your butt cheeks as you barely escape or survive a wave objective That being said it's not a casual game and involves a lot of strategy
Hardcore tactical stealth coop horde shooter No p2w or dlcs trains Active community Perfect game for certain types of gamers who like to be challenged on all fronts

tip when your teammate is sneaking up on a sleeper with a melee weapon shine your flashlight to make sure they have a clear line of sight
I love suffering
scp but good
fun game
E um jogo muito bom de horror Online👍
This game made me realise that I'm surrounded by sleepers all the time Although the sleepers I killed in my household never ever glowed in the dark when I got near them So I guess the game can be a bit inaccurate at times still solid though

sooo.whats the point of matchmaking again Need to finish R1A1 and yet I believe I've done R7B3 R5B2 R4B1 before even managed to get to see R1A1
this door
A very tactical and challenging game for sure No difficulty sliders no hand-holding just suffering It takes actual effort for you to learn all the basic game mechanics so most people just quit Only about 14 of everyone who bought it has cleared one level If that sounds like fun to you it is then by all means buy the game Only downside is that the matchmaking is terrible and the few times you actually find teammates they will rush in and die in 10 minutes max Discord and/or friends are a must for this game
cool

Came back to replay this and while I understand that this is completely intended by the developer the lack of any difficulty customization in a game that several people I've seen online have stated that You require to have tried the level once already in order to effectively know how to beat it or simply put You're going to beat this through trial and error I am sure some will enjoy that Myself to an extend can enjoy that But from what I've been able to deduct you must simply cheese the game in order to win The starting levels also apparently have no checkpoints You can scream git gud at me all day It won't change that I think this lessens the experience for me
The game is very hard i would not recommend it to anyone who wants to play a game after a stressful day at work If you like near-impossible games I recommend it but it's just not for me

I was Alt-tabbed out in discord checking something I clicked back in and shot my friend in the back by doing so This proceeded to agro everything we were trying to sneak past We died 9/10 you MUST play this with friends the Ai are useless

Nice to play with friends
Go ahead and post your laugh reacts if you want but this game was WAY too difficult for me and virtually anybody I played it with I was expecting DOOM but I ended up getting DOOM but sweatier and with more arguments between people I shit you not when I say that this game pretty much lead to two people I know falling out If you can get past level 1 you deserve a goddamn medal Because for me and quite a few others we don't have the time nor the patience This is an absolutely brutal unforgiving game And if that was their goal they nailed it Definitely not for me though I choose life
This game will make you laugh This game will make you cry It will tug at your heartstrings as you struggle to find the last pack of tool refill Just when you think you know what it going on your expectations are flipped on its head You are killed immediately
may make you shit your pants occasionally
Help i can't get out
A game of fear terror and isolation peppered with a palpable sense of futility 10/10
I just wish the bot AI was better because my friends seem to hate this game for some reason The discord is good but can be awkward because tism Great game though really tickles my itch for horror with an unknowable enemy and high stakes

Not being able to save mid game spoils one of the most fun parts of the game figuring out how to approach a rundown Lets say you have figured out how to do the first half hour of the mission but fail at a specific spot over and over due to skill issue which is fine You then have to do the first half hour all over again just to get to the part that you want to solve Just plain stupid design philosophy imo Especially with missions that span multiple hours not even being able to save and continue later is super annoying Game gets hardcarried by atmosphere and gunplay If you want to finish the more difficult rundowns prepare to watch youtube tutorials in order to not waste your own time
Not enough content in the game for it to be 40 The only difference in their enemies is the height scaling and a few minor abilities they can have over others weird hit detection with bullets and not enough to do on the game in general besides drop into area search lockers for almost nothing but useless glow sticks and long range flashlights grab sample and leave(GTFO Not a terrible game to play with friends if you have an available 4-stack 5/10
Shhh Sleepers Let them snooze

frustrating and tiring 10/10
A tactical horde shooter What a weirdly delicous mix

HONESTLY I FEEL LIKE ITS TOO DAMN HARD WITHOUT THE PERFECT TEAM GOOD GAME THOUGH REMINDS ME OF TARKOV WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF IT
GTFO is seriously intense and super fun The atmosphere pulls you in with creepy environments and crazy monsters You have to really work together with your friends planning and sneaking around to survive That being said game really needs bigger player base but discord community is awesome and it is super easy to find friendly people to play if you don't have friends who wants to play this game with you It's a heart-pounding ride you'll want to keep coming back to
Killer gameplay especially fun with friends The flashing lights warning is no joke though
kill people with guns and whatnot

Its amazing

GTFO is an exhilarating cooperative shooter with an intriguing atmosphere and deep teamwork mechanics Pros thrilling gameplay horror atmosphere and intense team interaction Cons high difficulty level may be limiting for some players Nevertheless GTFO offers an unforgettable survival experience and intense underground adventures Rating 10 out of 10

Mano bom demais melhor se tiver pelo menos mais 2 amigos contigo sozinho ou com BOT's fica tanto com menos quanto bem mais mas se isso teu ponto forte vai pra cima haha Mas sobre o jogo mesmo uma das melhores interfaces de ogo que vi gameplay bem lenta pelo menos se acostumar mais com as do game se o cara que joga CoD/Warzone e games nessa pegada pode achar meio repetitivo o jogo mas justamente que faz de G.T.F.O brilha variedade boa de armas de de objetivos Nada mais divertido que ver teu amigo se cagando depois de ter acordado um grande sabendo que ter que lidar com a horda a seguir muito bom
mbjbhjvkh
Survival horror y trabajo en equipo al Va a pedirte todo lo que tengas y Realmente no es para cualquiera Tu equipo va a necesitar no acertar sus tiros sino trabajar en refinar la toma de decisiones y tener un nivel de paciencia y tolerancia a la similar a cuando uno encara un juego de From Software pero en vez de analizar patrones de ataque de un jefe se trata de preparar y controlar terreno y cuando suene la alarma que cada bala cuente No es un juego para el que le gusta ganar es para el que le gusta una gran victoria Se fracasa mucho pero se mejora y muchas veces aunque parezca que los recursos no alcancen se puede remontar Tus son todo recomiendo 3 jugadores y cuidalos todos deben funcionar como uno Singleplayer se pueden hacer pocas misiones a menos que seas un dios de 5000 horas en el juego y creo que hay misiones que nadie en el mundo pasarse solo Si amigos con estos gustos ni duden Y sino con la comunidad de Discord bastante No recomiendo usar el matchmaking del juego para nada es horrible
wish i had frend
Hardly any ammo most kills sneak melee per area Mostly sneak and find where to go

Great game especially with friends but solo sucks I wish the there was a command tool like in ready or not to let the bots drop their turrets or even just hold certain positions while I hack a terminal because the bots will not hack if their life depends on it
Devs add ingame PING test which shows is the PING stable at the matchmake Game itself is nice good stealth missions or survive missions Runs on a 7 year old gaming pc just fine
Fun

This is an unforgiving hardcore coop stealth shooter with amazing art design that offers a very atmospheric experience Pulling off such a unique concept and succeeding with it is no small feat and I tip my hat to 10 Chambers
10 10
12/7
Playing it alone is really hard it's a tough team game that's much easier when you've got a good team with you
This game gave me irrational fear of clicking sounds while really amazing with friends i wouldnt recommend playing with less then 3 ppl Other than that be prepared to spend a looot of time just to get demolished in seconds

Many years ago I expected this from the game rainbow six extraction but I discovered what I wanted only now GTFO an engaging game with a good atmosphere for patient people for true players
get the fuck on simulator
EDIT 1 AFTER EXPERIENCING THE GAME This is a hella fun game IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS this game has almost no players in matchmaking so its better if yyou have friends to acommpany you Unless you want to wait around 20 mins for players/use discord to find someone around your age or experience EDIT 2 I've only beaten 3-6 maps at best for some reason when you try to find players it gives away your host of the lobby so they always choose either the same maps R6 rundowns or they dont do anything at all Bought the game with a friend,ACE we got stuck on the first level XD The game is fun and all but holy cow this game is hard even for a die hard fan of the souls series THIS GAME IS WAY MORE PUNISHING THAN ELDEN RING You messed a shot boom you're swarmed by creatures fucked up and did a noise well you guessed it creatures For casual player like me and him this is not the game to play we did find it pretty cool the diversity of challenges/mobs/layouts but that was it we kinda got buttfucked and decided to refund the game After a while i did go back into the refund and got the game again(the very nest day and decided to learn the game so here goes stuff for new players IF YOU'RE A CASUAL DON'T BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL RAGE ALOT/DIE ALOT This game has mechanics other than passive stealth aggressive stealth so sometimes you will need to let go of CTRL and go for risky kills before they kill you The game has ALOT of weapons combinations,weapons for hordes,for giants and turrets Use them to your ADV you get way more of TOOLS than using thy weaponry About tools we have turrets and the BIO tracker The bio tracker is a must in dark environments/locating enemies before they notice you you get around 40meters from enemies enemies will only agro you if youre close to them,5meters to be exact or kissing em Learn the maps points where you can either run to or get a advantage over the mobs The terminals are a must if you're serious about surviving,because man you will need em Enemies get way more damage if you hit'em from the back,multiplier stuff insert bitch ill break ur back meme Thats about it i'm still fairly new to the game but it is a pretty cool hardcore game Reccommended if youre into masochism
yes

Jogo R4E1 foi rumo a R8E2
Bots idiotas de mais pra um jogo complicado Precisa de stealth e sincronia os bots matam 1 bixo sozinho tudo precisa o jogador primeiro atacar e depois de uns 10s de delay eles a fazer algo quando ja precisa mais Mapa muito e sem fiquei 35m procurando um HSU que estavam em uma area gigantesca pra no final correr pra saida onde o jogo indica o caminho errado e faz uma de 1h45 ir pro lixo Jogo bom mas provavelmente de 2 se pelo menos tivesse comandos pra pedir assistencia pros bots e pra sincronizar os ataques e etc seria melhor alias pra que tem fogo amigo em um jogo co-op 90 do meu HP vai embora porque os bot mete bala em tudo menos nos bixos

It is so epic
it's too difficult and complicate to understand there is no tutorial and I cannot pass on the first level with my friends
they integrated the UI into the game world that's how you know it's peak
crazy game for crazy people enemies are annoying like shit this is a good thing i like the part when you use the terminal amazing game-play and atmosphere overall 10/10
upgraded stage 1 of squid game
Muito bom vale a pena
seria dahora se tivesse uma pequena capacidade de mexer nas arma precisa ser algo absurdo como cod mas o basico pra mudar a dinamica
Great concept with amazing tense atmosphere hold back by lack of a working matchmaking unless you are willing to get 3 other friends to buy it or try your luck with the discord Hopefully the next game Wolf of Dens will be more friendly on the matchmaking side

Very hard game or i just suck
supere fun with friends
i think this game is underrated as hell
Pretty Harsh game for someone not prepared
kilitledi
Honestly its a cool idea but I was playing with my buddy and there is WAY too much going on We got lost constantly and had no idea what to do Overall the game design is cool and the idea is pretty neat but again theres too much going on
Nothing beats cooperating as a well structured organised team showered with a sprinkle of autism This game will have you second guessing if the enemies have shot you or your own comrades With an eerie enigmatic atmosphere that will make you want to shit on your gaming chair this games challenging immersion will have you think twice before making any action With a wide variety of monsters to encounter from the towering Giant's as tall as Lebron James to the tentacle hentai Scouts that scream like little bitches when you brush against them as if they're Karen having a meltdown in your local Supermarket Tackling each unique situation one of two ways full on stealth that'll put the recent Assassin's Creed games to shame or for a more fun guns out steroid filled Aztec warrior battle hardened tactic Spear Gang For Life This game should not be played alone

GTFO Great Tactical Fun Obviously If you've ever dreamt of navigating creepy dimly lit corridors with a team of friends all while being relentlessly pursued by nightmare-inducing monsters then GTFO is your game This co-op masterpiece combines heart-pounding tension with strategic game play making it an absolute blast and a few screams too Picture this you and your squad are knee-deep in alien guts frantically trying to complete objectives while keeping your sanity intact It's like a chaotic dance of death except the only music is your own terrified screams and the sound of shotgun blasts echoing through the halls But fear not GTFO isn't just about running and gunning it's about teamwork coordination and communication You'll need to strategize with your buddies divvy up tasks and share supplies like a post-apocalyptic potluck dinner And let's talk about the monsters shall we These aren't your average garden-variety zombies No sir GTFO serves up a smorgasbord of grotesque abominations that make you question your life choices and wonder if you should've stayed in bed In GTFO the only thing scarier than the monsters lurking in the shadows is running out of snacks before the next wave hits Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor because you're gonna need it Short version Love the game more fun with friends then solo
Awesome game
Get some homies together and dive
Hentai monster do be tweakin Its just like that cartoon i like to watch
BEST GAME EVER YOU NEED 3 FRIENDS

I can def see im going to have a lot of trouble fining people to play with but damn the frist run was some creepy shit
This game is perfect The gameplay is well balanced with a perfect mix of exploration combat and puzzle solving The monsters are terrifying and unpredictable i've only played for 2.5 hours but i know this game is a classic 10/10 for sure recommend it for anyone into Horror FPS games

GOOD
Hardcore good game
Pretty good game just confusing the first couple hours but once you learn the mechanics and strategies for clearing tons of enemies without really being hurt it gets fun because you start seeing progress for pretty challenging game Not only that i love the Apparel and love the unique enemy types

This game will either be extremely fun for you or absolutely rage inducing I wont deny it it has been both for me when you get near the end of a level only to have your team wiped in 30 seconds after spending an hour in the level its pretty infuriating its a visually amazing game though since there's such a large focus on your mostly limited light sources I recommenced looking for some YouTube tutorials get used to the stealth learn to use the terminals and try to get out alive its a ok purchase at full price but good on sale
Very hard coop experience But the best coop shooter on the market

I am new to this game and I am already really enjoying it This game really needs friends though.The bots are not really great they kinda point things out but don't deploy equipment well or engage in the smartest ways They did make it that they do not trip many of the creatures so they can't make it that much worse for you I would say if you have a few friends this game is totally worth it Running it alone means you will die a great deal especially just starting

Sneak and win with tactic or SPRAY AND PRAY Both is good
Played since Day 1 Alpha and heavily beta tested the game Still one of my favourite games to exist The stress anxiousness the 2 of completion all worth it
atmoshpere awesoem game confusoin
One of the best coop games
worth only if you have friends to play with
hard game if you play only as 2 people i wish i had friend group of 4 overall interesting selection of special tools and nice that you need to make strategy not just shoot like a robot
This game will destroy your hopes and dreams I love it
why is this so hard
do you hate yourself do you dispise fun well do i got a game for you for just the small price of 40 bucks you can play gtfo and suffer
Awesome spooki zombi game
This game is a combination of so many things I like from games that it's impossible to not want to play more of it
Great Game to play with your friends Don't let the difficulty get to you it takes time
Latam The Game
gyat the frick out
THE BEST GAME
Certainly not for the easy going players but dumping all ammo on a last stand for your life just hits different XD 100 percent recommend bring friends they'll make your life so much easier
Tutorial sucks ass game feels like shit movement is bad gun fighting is bad game is bad
ballr
Played it only for like 2 hours and i hate my life already 10/10 would recommend 16hours still hate my life Still 20/10 27hours Rundown 1 is finished I dont wanna do this anymore 20/10
DATA DATA 10/10
TRIED IT ON A FREE WEEKEND SOME GAMES SIMPLY ARE NOT WORTH THE AGGRAVATION REQUIREMENT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THROWING AWAY YOUR TIME ON EARTH BY PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND SIMPLY INVITING A SOFTWARE MAKER TO PUNISH YOU OVER AND OVER IN RETURN FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF GIVING THEM YOUR MONEY LIFE IS TOO SHORT FOR THIS KIND OF THING I WOULDN'T BUY THIS GAME IF IT WAS FIVE BUCKS
Honestly one of the best games out there to play with friends if not THE best 11/10 game banger
muy bueno xd

When my son got this game for Christmas I was worried He played non-stop and I felt like I was losing him So I decided to try it too But I was clueless about what to do I asked him for help and he set up a game for us to play together It was amazing The best time I've had with him since my wife passed away This game has brought us closer than ever Now we not only play together but also hang out outside It's made me realize that fun can be found anywhere And for that I'm truly grateful
really cool game you can sneak or you can attack and have a mental breakdown
nice
Get The Fuck Out b]To:[/b THIS GAME
Level 2 made me sh.t my pants i clutched up 3 big guys with no ammo 20 hp with foggy map game make u scream ur lungs out def play it worth the price and those who are looking for a challenge

Muito bom a dificuldade do jogo peca o pouco na clareza das dos objetivos
se que es buen juego solamente mi compu no lo corre a mas de 20 fps
7/10 Super challenging game stealth is a requirement
My friend really wants me to buy this game
Really Great Game for Hardcore-Coop Fans but you will die a lot
shits nuts
GTFO get three friends
i get to look at ass all day
Game is amazing DC community is massive and a lot of people will help you or teach you what to do
Did you ever want to be in the most bleak dystopian sci-fi world with odds so stacked against you that you'd have a better chance of survival 10 feet from a nuclear blast Boy do I have a game for you
Game play focuses heavily on steal It would be a lot more fun if you could run and gun more
Esta chido
super boring
Great team game not as scary as you think but there is a bit of stress
Just listen to WARDEN Do not question anything Do your job efficiently Work together Survive Great co-op shooting game 10/10 3
This is what Darktide wishes it could be creating/joining games with randoms is an absolute mess though
A really well designed hardcore co-op shooter that rewards skill to play with 3 other people
tough game good with masochistic friends
don't play with randos
Ich mags
brutal game 10/10 would recommend for people that hate life have tried to win a level several times can sneak but get to door number one that has a alarm and fail every time
Horrendously stressful
fk sony
free to play
I HATE THE HORROR GENRE objectively a good game 21 no brainer excellent performance looks beautiful catches your attention
AAAAAYYYOOOWWWWWWWW
I'm terrified 90 of the time and scared the rest 11/10

Bom e bonito
goood
The user experience in the main menu design is so poor that it elevates your stress levels even before you begin playing With such a rough start it's difficult to expect a positive experience from the game itself
Extremely Fun especially when you get further down and fight in some crazy places
Beat the first mission without taking damage because my teammates did all the work for me while I scanned for movement the whole time Fun relaxing experience for the whole family

excellent graphics and gunplay gameplay is challenging and there are terminals that allow you type in commands essentially requires 2 other people to be enjoyable though
Didn't expect GTFO to be THIS good The missions are intense the atmosphere is great good mix of stealth and action resource management and tactics And also as a huge plus you can play with bots if you dont have a consistent company to play with So far very good I'm glad I purchased it after all For new players I would recommend to play at least 1 mission solo with bots else u won't understand anything only if u have a good mentor who won't rush the missions whom I didn't encounter lol And yeah the missions are very long and difficult from the start so it is definitely something to consider when you purchase the game

Dauda's a G Hackett refuses to do melee
Dauda be like HGHMMMMM TGhere is mosnter righht here maybe i should shoot my teammate in the brain ALL MY HOMIES HATE DAUDA whenever Dauda joins my team mmy skin starts to crawl i HATE DAUDA he keeps shooting me wHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU So basically in this game you have to complete tasks for the big guys on top and they send you into the pit with the most idiotic teamm specifically Dauda you could have ever wished for trying to sneak past the monsters fuck you i will make as much noise as possible and alerrt everyone D DAUDA I hope you die a slow and horrible death 5/7
i love ruining friendships by playing this game 10/10 highly reccommend

Big boys smashed me with their tongues
Ball-bustingly hard in counterintuitive ways not helped whatsoever by the near-total lack of a difficulty curve The game demands a level of sweat and coordination right from the start that makes it impossible to enjoy for me If you and your friends don't come from a hardcore tactical gaming background even the early levels will feel like bashing your head into a brick wall for 20 minutes This is an unapologetically niche game for a niche audience It makes no attempts at onboarding players that don't have the right prior experience You either like it from the start or you don't
You raid a laboratory stealth your way from hordes of alien like guys pick up keys to get to the next area defend while the door loads idk I just play with my friends and I enjoy it Playing this in solo would be almost impossible though but I'm no expert
the biggest problem is four players is necessary
Average downtown shift
Acceptable
Esta bueno el juego el problema es que debes tener a 3 amigos para jugarlo Los bots no hacen nada
Very fun game
o jogo tem bons jogabilidade simples mas muito mais funcional no coop/multiplayer com pessoas com bots pois a ia deles bem paia O matchmaking do jogo praticamente inexistente demorei mais de 10min para achar um e foi um cara que ao iniciar a partida tomei dc Caso tenha amigos para jogar ou saiba falar para jogar no servidor oficial totalmente caso nem compre pois o jogo longo e fazer tudo sozinho com bots cansativo Levei mais de 1h para finalizar o primeiro mapa e o objetivo era apenas ir do ponto A B procurar uma chave para liberar o ponto C e encontrar um item para poder extrair
muy bueno
Great game not for those who dont like a challenge very hard without a group bots arent good
One of the best fps co-op games i ve ever played Want a challenge well you get multiple of them you want to make em harder bcs you are just that masochistic you can Gun play is fun you have a lot of options on guns some better than others but all of them are reliable multiple mission types and new enemies keeping the game fresh as you continue through the rundowns Couldnt recommend this game more
Nice Gameplay I can see the hard work they put to making this game
Es una toxica en lo que todo esta mal pero no lo puedes dejar
GTFO is among the best of any 4-player co-op experience Each of the 80 maps now available post Rundown 8 help to evoke the highs of MMO raid progression in learning mechanics devising and refining strategies and executing them successfully in collaboration with your peers Decidedly different than other games in the genre are the absence of leveling systems or skill trees to artificially gate progression through grind there are also no unlockable or paid elements to shortcut your path to clearing content All weapons and utilities are available for use on any map and experimentation of your setup can alter your ability to succeed as you balance resources available on a given map and enemy compositions with the strengths and weaknesses of your tools for their range DPS and burst abilities penetration and ammo efficiency The skill focus extends to the way the weapons operate the weapons with the best ammo and damage efficiency have explicit limitations longer reloads larger spread shorter damage falloff ranges that significantly increase their risk to use or require relying on your team to cover situations that you cannot The levels in GTFO follow a similar philosophy to the loadout in delivering a fair and skill testing experience Total resources ammunition tool refills health per map have fixed total values but are scattered and split randomly between varying positions on the map Objectives do not change but their locations do This complements the static high-level strategy per map with a dynamic one that changes based on your situation and resources and how successful your team was at clearing tasks and executing the plan The flow per map is also dynamic in how you frequently switch between stealth or active combat and your decisions to do so based on the current objective or timed challenges stealth always the correct answer nor is clearing or engaging a room at all for its resources At a macro level the objective variety is strong with over 15 types of map objectives with new mechanics gradually introduced through game progressions and twisted and reframed to make the experience interesting and fresh The atmosphere characters and environmental lore are also excellent and coupled with low light and dense fog keep situations tense The tagline of the game together or die truly defines the game From theory to practice in the context of personal experience the game is incredibly challenging fair and the sense of accomplishment felt after spending 20 hours of attempts on an individual map is truly rewarding Hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay are present here and if you vibe with the theme and enjoy a challenge
Although I hardly play horror games GTFO is my favorite game It's really difficult and you need good coordination and teammates with whom you can do the rundowns
HARDCORE
One of the best co-op games made

Cool and good I wish I had friends
Waiting for narcotic update cant wait to do hard drugs during a level 3 scan
Very hard and very tedious Me and my buddies spent three hours trying to finish one mission But for how hard it is the game is incredibly fun and is worth the forty dollars
not much of a fan as the bots are impossible and it's not that fun even with friends but still i play it on occasion
Assolutamente consigliato Giocando con ALMENO altri due amici meglio 3 se possibile oltre a te il divertimento assicurato soprattutto se ami gli sparatutto Richiede MOLTA pazienza il gioco molto punitivo letteralmente il Dark Souls degli sparatutto co-op ma regala soddisfazioni incredibili Ingiocabile da soli non provateci neanche
1000 Hours and I'm still not done levels are fair and difficult requires plenty of team work and are near impossible without it the deeper you go If you're looking for a hardcore FPS game that will test your limits and ability to lead or follow a team into intense combat situations get this game and join the gtfo discord for sure tons of experienced and new players on there
almost as scary as interaction with woman
fail several attempts of a mission proceed to spend 2 hours on one single run get fucked at extraction by normal enemies
Wanna break from the Scout prepares to scream ooooO If you tap now to watch a short Scout starts screaming AAHH You will receive thirty 30 minutes of Scout continues to scream HHHHHhhh Yes really if you Scout's scream bursts Hh Watch a short Scout's ooo You will receive thirty 30 minutes of Scout's scream slowed ooooooOOOO
Great game
This is probably the next castle crashers killer
Game is hard please be sure you're grouping with a bunch of very patient and gamer friends
Great Game with friends hidden gem
Really challenging but fun to plan and fuck around with friends

This game is perfect in every sense except for that there isnt more of it And thats not to say the game is too short I JUST LOVE IT SO MUCH I WANT MORE The graphics are amazing the controls are great the story is great It is a great game I hope there is a second game or more dlc IN THE FUTURE
I love getting scared by this game

A tough stealth extraction shooter set in the bowels of a facility called the Complex Here you perform a multitude of tasks such as turning on machinery retrieving items and whatever else the Warden desires you to do But you better do it quietly you don't want to wake up the uncountable Sleepers after all The overarching tactic of this game is using the element of stealth as you'll be faced with odds that merely using your weapons will not help you overcome You'll have plenty of opportunities to use your ballistic arsenal throughout the game but overall this is not a game for those who want to go in guns blazing as they will be done in rather swiftly The atmosphere UI and sound design of this game is superb It's eerie immersive and it keeps you on the edge of your seat Expeditions are dark and foggy and danger could be lurking around every corner requiring you to really have your guard up so you don't just saunter into harm's way One thing that does disappoint me is the forced difficulty I know the devs have made a stance on their you have the choice of difficult or very difficult mentality but not everybody is looking for a hardcore challenge all the time Some people just want to have a more casual experience in the same universe In conclusion a great and nail-biting shooter that will turn your inside out in a good way I still wish we will see some form of compromise for players who just want to go through all the content in the game but I would still recommend it in its current state just for the whole feel and presentation of the game
It's like if someone made death enjoyable
The hardest part of this game is to not tweak while your buddy miss steps and sets off a full room of giants and chargers Also sadly no way to do substances
Awesome aesthetic vibe and designs but such a snore fest and so unfun Stink of a game
COOL
Somebody got 8 hours in one mission somehow
please add rank system
Bots killed me infront of a scout on R2D1 This is the game of all time
Wasted potential Ambitious long term vision and interesting sci-fi design devolved into lazy asset reuse presented as expansions/expeditions and mind-numbingly boring and forced red light green light stealth gameplay interrupted only by short but irritating whack-a-mole shooting sessions with extensive desync impressively even if you are a host that turns exasperating when you account for the fact that devs intentionally make guns feel lame and underpowered even in their niche The game is seriously challenging if you are not mentally challenged because after the initial novelty wears off people of supreme intellect will find it highly difficult to not close the game forever as collective smoke breaks and/or pee breaks slowly turn into the most enjoyable parts of GTFO play session Despite the game being in development for more than 10 years they also never added a lot of promised and importantly expected content such as weapon customization even though separate modders were able to create various implementations of it along with weapon silencers and gunplay alternations This absolute disappointment will fail to get praise from someone other than the regulars of the devs hugbox discord proudly standing at 210k members botted of course courtesy of tencent proud owners of ten chambers as of october 2020 and mindbroken players with 500hr playtime Walk away to save time and money
Pretty good so far
I must say this game was quite a surprise it is really enjoyable and it actually offers a good challenge on each level I like the fact that it is a ready to go game no grinding required no unnecessary unlocks involved you are just thrown into the game with all the possible tools you need the only thing you need to bring is your skills and coordination Playing this with friends its a blast it really forces you to coordinate plan and come up with solutions on the spot you are always on edge and the calmness after a battle its just a fleeting feeling before going again into a stress induced nightmare in each room I would say this is a solid 9/10 There are very minor things that I would change but indeed it is not perfect it can become a bit repetitive sometimes but there are way too many rundowns ahead I just finished the first whole rundown and I imagine it will just get better and better If you have friends you must give it a try you wont regret it
most gay game
this game gives me an anxiety as i am suck at it but the drip is worth it thanks vix
GET THE FUCK OUT
The power of the sun
Highly recommend everyone to play this especially for fans of shooting\survival games combined with a little of horror vibe
Jogo excelente Um jogo para jogar com amigos um jogo tenso ao menos quando iniciante e super interessante

Honest good game tough Especially on blind play throughs Looks extremely hard but is actually reasonable after you are used to it Would recommend but i wish it was a bit cheaper so more friends can join me Side note Have patience when playing for you will die otherwise And expect long ass games that will be 30m minimum 1h average and 2h max
I have no clue what to do in this game but this game is terrifying I absolutely love this game My best friend and I do not have people to run with so we don't play it much It's def a game you and three other friends should play with I would love to see a lore video talking about the lore of this game It seems so interesting
Slow game enemies stutter and glitch everywhere not fun
gran gioco
Love it tho it cannot run that great on my pc It's a pretty unique game and I recommend it to anyone looking for a horror game I'd compare it to lethal company if LC wasn't decades late really if LC is compared to it it'd make sense This is a evac shooter you go in you grab the goods and you shoot for dear life

A great Co-op shooter and horror game There is no other game like it out there in my opinion The dark and unsettling atmosphere combined with the tactical co-op gameplay creates a very immerisive experience At the beginning some level might feel a bit repetitiv but the narrative and complexity greatly increases with the later Rundowns Expect to see later levels many times as the missions become more and more difficult If you don't have anyone to play this like me join their discord The community is great and open to new players
Get The Fug as in what the FUG is going on here Out Game is good cuz allows me to draw penitse on the map for the whole duration of game session
highly highly recommend fastest i ever lost any of my friendships was in this game worth it tho
AIWS D
I love the game I'm not sure if I'm playing incorrectly but ammo goes extremely quickly Must play with friends 8/10
brutal challenging and i hate the fog
None of my friends have it yet sadly but looking through the achievement percentage I was shook I haven't really seen a game with so little achievement percentage Cant wait to convince force my friends to get this game soon
Great sledgehammer sim
GTFO is definitely a good game Shooting feels satisfying and powerful monsters are pretty dangerous and missions are very difficult Also this is best played with friends in a group of 4 people The game needs strategy ammo is very scarce most of the times and each level needs learning and planning You have many different tools at your disposal Expect losing each level a couple of times until you learn its layout and what you should do loot is random The satisfaction you get from finishing a level after trying it out couple of times with your friends is unmatched in this game it really feels like an achievement Note Some levels can take up to 1 and a half hours to finish if everything goes to plan so you need friends who can free themselves for like 2 hours in a gaming session

not very fun im black not based at all i want to be a white brit man
euh c'est dur
I wish I had friends to play this with
Here's my experience of playing GTFO 47 Hours Oh cool free weekend might try this one with friends It's so difficult not my kind of game Oh a discount let's try with different people this time Now I understand the basic mechanic let's keep playing R2E1 I hate this game why the dev makes it so difficult Imma skip this rundown R4E1 Well I guess that's it Time to cheese the game Still fucking failed AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I hate myself for buying this but I don't regret buying it this game is good if you have a TEAM MATE who understand the mechanic and willing to explain it to you if you don't have any you can always join the official discord server to look for one Great soundtrack design that makes every combat feel tense especially when they wake up Limited amount of supply makes you think twice about spending precious lead against the enemy and risking health for close combat encounter This game also keep putting me on the edge of breakdown I'm still on Early Rundown 4 btw that's about half of what's there probably Definetly worth buying 8/10
This game wasn't only A game but The game that made me live each and everyday
Most challenging and rewarding game I've played WOOOOOOOOOOIIIIEEEEE AAAAAAAAAAAAAA OH NO please buy it it's amazing
DIFFICULT BUT INTERESTING
What a co-op shooter should be
Esse game pra qualquer um Exige muito principalmente em modo coop Um ponto negativo do game que muito ter um bom pc para roda-lo vai entender quando tropar com inimigos na mesma tela e cair sem saber como onde e quando Ainda sim para quem gosta de um desafio e tem um pc bom recomendo
get le fuck out
200 Hours and not even close to finishing it Will probably play another 200
Are you ready to lose your mind your dignity and maybe even a friendship or two Welcome to GTFO the game where you'll find yourself screaming acronyms that would make your grandma blush and forming strategic plans that would put military ops to shame GTFO isn't your average walk-in-the-park kind of game it's more like a trek through a minefield blindfolded with your only guide being the terrified screams of your teammates From the moment you step foot into its dark foreboding corridors you know you're in for a ride And by ride I mean a rollercoaster of panic adrenaline and the occasional heart attack Picture this You and your buddies armed to the teeth and ready to take on whatever horrors lurk in the shadows Spoiler alert There are a lot of horrors But fear not because GTFO is all about teamwork You'll need to communicate like your life depends on it spoiler it does strategize like Sun Tzu and move like a ninja on Red Bull just to survive But don't let the blood-curdling screams and Lovecraftian nightmares fool you GTFO is also a masterclass in atmosphere The eerie lighting the haunting soundtrack and the oppressive silence punctuated only by your own ragged breaths create an atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a knife preferably a big one Now let's talk about the monsters These aren't your friendly neighborhood zombies or misunderstood vampires these are creatures straight out of your worst nightmares From hulking brutes that could bench-press a tank to scuttling horrors that move faster than you can say oh no each encounter is a lesson in terror and a test of your reflexes But for all its heart-stopping moments and hair-raising encounters GTFO is strangely addictive Maybe it's the rush of narrowly escaping death or maybe it's the satisfaction of finally conquering a particularly tough level after 50 failed attempts Whatever it is GTFO will have you coming back for more punishment like a glutton for punishment which let's face it you probably are In conclusion GTFO is not for the faint of heart the weak of stomach or the easily startled But if you're looking for a game that will test your nerves your skills and your friendships in the best way possible then look no further Just don't forget to pack an extra pair of pants Trust me you'll need them

EPIC TIME
So difficult it isnt even fun
2 horas numa pro jogo me mandar pra tela de de e simplismente jogar todo meu progresso no lixo obrigado GTFO
Ne diyim ki elde balyoz onlar bizi sikmeden biz sikmeye Kim mi yapan akrabalar
I really love this game as long as im playign w ith my friend super fun cool game especially the sounds you hear theyre s scary
Game is somewhat dead 500 concurrent players matchmaking is not good and LFG on discord is cringe not worth the purchase
WTF what should i do in this
play with 3 friends that get back up when they get pushed down
funny
Great for when you hate yourself
muita mas muita mesmo Pros cooperativos vale muito pra cooperar
Nice challenging team coop game Maps have been engaging although variations on a theme Really enjoyed this game in a genre that I don't normally enjoy
Very tense very scary Only coop horror game I know where friends make the experience more frightening This game can be very tactical requiring room planning as you explore and defend to keep resource usage low 84 hours in as the initial horror has subsided I am still being challenged and often the game manages to get quite tense I have cleared entire rundowns and yet I'm still finding new enemies that change how the game must be played
Muito bom uma bem cooperativa
Cooperativo bem cooperativo
Work together or die together
great game
dont be swayed by the learning curve of this game The bots are great and easily doable single player The quicker you learn to give up stealth for speed the more fun you will have and it wont feel like you hours on one mission Also if your new start with the later rundowns they tend to be easier
This game is beautiful wish I had a better computer though Game is definitely better with friends and the atmosphere is scarier than most games nowadays
It's unique and intense AF Stealth is the way to go Even with bot's it's alot of fun and manageble Can't wait for Den of Wolves to be announced
50/50
I quited the game when I saw the first zombie I recommend
If you're a glutton for punishment with a twisted sense of teamwork GTFO might just be your digital masochism paradise Picture this you and your buddies armed to the teeth tiptoeing through hellish corridors infested with Lovecraftian nightmares all while trying not to scream obscenities at each other Welcome to GTFO where the only thing scarier than the monsters lurking in the shadows is the prospect of coordinating with your friends Let's talk about frustrations Oh boy where do I start Ever had that heart-stopping moment when you accidentally alert a horde of grotesque creatures because someone sneezed into their mic Yep GTFO's got plenty of those And just when you thought you had the perfect plan to stealthily navigate through a level someone decides it's a brilliant idea to go full Rambo on a group of sleepers triggering a cacophony of chaos that would make even the bravest marine wet their pants But hey it's not all doom and gloom GTFO is a masterpiece when it comes to showcasing the fragility of human relationships under pressure Remember that time Steve forgot to refill his ammo before a big fight and you had to sacrifice your last health pack to keep him alive Yeah good times And let's not forget the classic who stole my glow stick debate that's bound to erupt at least once per session sparking a heated argument that makes the monsters outside seem downright cuddly in comparison In GTFO communication is key Or so they say In reality it's more like a cacophony of conflicting commands and panicked screams that would make a kindergarten teacher weep Shoot the big one No not that big one the other big one Who has the goddamn keycard It's like trying to orchestrate a symphony with a bunch of tone-deaf cats But amidst all the frustrations and co-op dramas there's a strange beauty to GTFO It's the kind of game that makes you question your friendships your sanity and whether or not you should invest in a better headset with noise-cancelling capabilities So grab your friends steel your nerves and prepare to descend into the depths of madness Just don't forget to pack extra ammo and maybe a couple of stress balls You're gonna need em
i love dying at the end of a 2 hour run
Fun game but play with friends for better coordination
Amazing Game Atmosphere is on point Monsters are creepy Missions are challenging Sound Design is terrifying and even though you have weapons you still have to play cautiously otherwise you'll get swarmed pretty quickly
gyatt the fanum ohio
Shhhhh Sleepers That was the last thing I heard my player character say before being straight demolished by about 45 mutated versions of Pete Davidson Shit has you on the edge of your seat swear this game be making people doo doo in their pant 10/10 might have soiled my draws and would soil again
GTFO is destined to be a very niche game for being a hardcore co-op shooter Unless you have 2-3 friends who can enjoy playing a game that requires patience careful planning constant communications and a bit of gamer instinct this game would be very tough for an average casual gamer to even begin And to enjoy one would really need to go out to read the official wiki page to carefully learn the mechanics You need to be ready for the intellectual demands of reading words active thinking and understanding the mechanics Being relentless in its difficulty is a double-edged sword for this game It makes this game very unique but it also makes it not easy to enjoy It is really exhausting to even complete a level If you don't look for playthroughs online learning even early levels and different monsters environments require huge amount of trials and errors with your homies and it really wastes time but for somebody spoiling yourselves before a new level also ruin a bit of excitement But such great difficulty is not completely unreasonable because once you start getting the hang of it you can feel the game is definitely beatable The moment you beat the level with the bois is some immense satisfaction that none compares The preps for the incoming hordes outsmarting the obstacles the final dash to the extraction The sense of overcoming a great difficulty is crystal pure satisfaction This game really needs you and ur dumb ass frds to be a person who is able to think react and learn its better if you are experienced at playing fps or ain't easily tired of repeating Even though its pretty hard its very enjoyable on the co-op part being essential and having a pretty cool aesthetic But no need to force yourself to play this game if its too hard for you After all playing videogames is about having fun instead of getting frustrated
work together or die together.die together a lot
LOVE THIS GAME hard creepy complex
unbelievably difficult game
It's all about coordination if even one of your teammate sabotages in the sneaking he would be the reason your team is not gonna complete the level
This game is one of the best horror game played and I like that you have to be 4 players to finish a level
If you enjoy playing a game that gives you that feeling of your hair standing up on the back of your head the whole time you are playing then this game is 100 for you However if you suck at finding shit in the dark good luck
Difficult but really satisfying and fun
Communication is super important but feels like stapling Jello to a tree Only play with a full squad if you can
cant fuck the flesh monsters
ilke this game
Amazing game 10/10 gameplay Wish they'd make a GTFO 2 instead of whatever they're doing now
one of the best games if you have friends to play with
Ottimo fps survival horror di squadra bellissimo da giocare con gli amici e anche per piccole sessioni in solo a patto che non si cerchi di fare missioni troppo complesse Peccato per il supporto controller limitato soprattutto per dispositivi come la legion go ma oltre a questo super consigliato per chi cerca una sfida vera e non un classico fps spara spara
I played this game two and a half years ago and i don't remember anything about it

GTFO is an absolutely amazing game because of the focus on stealth and teamwork as well as the fantastic game and sound design it's at the peak of atmospheric The environment design in GTFO is top-notch The game presents a variety of challenging scenarios and the attention to detail in the level design is impressive the swing of action is constantly changing from gripping suspense to the much undesired combat forcing you to pick and choose your fight as much as you can to preserve resources for the coming waves each enemy is unique making it important to pay attention to your surroundings and forces you to learn them so you can make quick decisions and choose your priorities Playing GTFO with friends is an absolute blast also practically required I've spent a lot of time solo but for a game like this that will only get you so far Overall GTFO is a solid and challenging shooter that delivers on its promise of hardcore cooperative horror If you enjoy intense gameplay atmospheric sound design and working together with friends to overcome terrifying challenges GTFO is definitely worth checking out and remember WORK TOGETHER OR DIE TOGETHER

Allah save me
despite seeing people attempt the stages solo and seeing other players treating it as a run and gun game i still feel this game is best enjoyed in a slow pace with a group of friends the game is very atmospheric and very challenging during early access I kind of feel the difficulty went down a little to fit more players expectation still a fun game nonetheless
This game helped me realize that I'm not the only dumbass in the friend group
Painful but very enjoyable
Play with friends it can be much more enjoyable
um jogo recomendo a quem gosta de survival horror ira render muitas horas de gameplay com os amigos
GTFO is certainly a niche game Some levels are very hard but I don't mind the difficulty and I really love the settings If you have three other like minded friends to play this game will give you a lot of content for your money

this game has already pushed me to the brink of sanity and I love it

Good felling Nice gameplay commands are good hard game
this game is pretty hard if you haven't played bot management collect the thing goal oriented first person shooters which is actually a stealth game where the last thing you wanna do is shoot I'm def gonna pour more hours into this game tho It's weird but I really like it since Steam couldn't tell if I liked it or not YES I LIKED IT
the matchmaking is mostly done on the discord server but the game is fun and gets constant updates
Co-Op action if the game devs weren't fucking around
Very fun
Schwer Aber Toll
A group of friends and I just played through the first 2 missions of this game The first took us about and hour and the second took us about 2 hours AFTER we died halfway through on our first attempt realizing there were no checkpoints anyway the game is really good and fun Anytime I hear a heartbeat I shit myself
Amazing game Atmospheric fun great balance between quiet planning and frantic SHTF action Just wish I had friends that played it
A fun stealth tactical extraction has to make you a stop in some places and plan your route though i highly recommend getting a group to play that you can communicate with instead of matchmaking
Quite a fun twist on the horde shooter genre the stealth focus really helps it stand out Overall GTFO is just a very well crafted game
You are never safe.Be warned 8/10 Also really difficult and Bots will sabotage you given the chance Edit Bots will make your life a living hell Also difficulty is scaled down with two people goes up with three or more The game is just hard.so

Ok let's make as quiet as possible D some random at running mach fuck
One of those kinds of reviews that's more of a Meh or Thumbs Side review than a negative one This is a great game I love its lore atmosphere focus on hybrid stealth and combat gameplay enemy design and level layouts Each area feels great and mysterious to explore and it's like uncovering new sections to a facility where you know everything went wrong and now you have to fix it yourself best you can following the seemingly arbitrary objective orders It's like games like Deadspace in how it feels However I have to compare it to other co-op objective mission-based shooters like Deep Rock Galactic and Helldivers 2 and I suppose Lethal Company to a lesser extent Missions in all the previous games either don't take as long or have a set time limit so you're not expected to daudle for hours in one mission You get in do the objective and fight stuff then get out GTFO is the same but the gameplay is so demanding of high skill that it's pretty much required to play with other people not bots to complete rundowns Furthermore you'll need a whole team of four for the best experience If you're like me and don't matchmake with randoms much and prefer friends this game will be hard to play consistently and with how much time you can expect to take on missions expect over an hour per each one and even then success is not guaranteed It's a slog to play games like this because they demand so much and have so much going for them but I just can't deliver what the game asks that the more die-hard and try-hard players can This is not a casual game and it doesn't present itself as that However I can guarantee that other difficult games like Dark Souls and its ilk are easier to pick up and play for me than this At least I can overcome everything without needing to rely on if my friends are available to play and coordinate with I'm also not a fan of the gunplay in this game I feel like I should be able to avoid attacks because health is scarce but I just can't ever And as another person said enemies move a bit much to make the combat feel satisfying for me Maybe you like this hardcore challenge and have the wealth of time to invest the many other friends to play with at any time or don't care much about matchmaking with randoms If so good you'll enjoy this game I'd steer clear if you're lacking time or skill for this though
very fun

This game markets itself has hard and hardcore but it's not that difficult it's just tedious Like stealthing is just walking half waking up an enemy waiting for it to fall back asleep and then moving for another one or two meters and that's like 75 of the game It's difficult in the same way that an MMO is difficult it requires mostly patience not skill Dissapointing 2/10
Fun Game I would recommend playing with a full party of four though

Comprei o jogo no dele na steam era beta ainda de pra o jogo melhorou muito mas a verdade que eu devia ter reembolsado na e n fiz pois tava jogando com um amigo Acho o jogo chato e a gameplay pesada boneco tem e de cimento curto e joguei esse tempo pois foi com a galera na jogarei de novo e adoraria reembolsar
Im 6 hours in and just beat the first level it required so much team planning and just overall skill I love this game If you have 2 or 3 friends willing to spend 40 to buy this master piece I highly reccomend it It will level up your teamwork and friendship massivley Also yes I did leave them behind at the final rush to the extraction Because thats what true friendship is leaving them in a virus monster infected facility so you can GTFO get the fuck out haha funny pun
I'm terrified and the whole of my team speaks german only
I actually though there will be more lore behind in this game Like cut scenes movies or something you know Well there is no such thing The game looks like highly modified left4dead No weapons progress mechanics no stats for equipment you earn Just hide shoot and run But anyway game is fun enough to play The visuals the sounds the challenges everything is quite cool So yeah nice game

The cruellest game I've ever played played but completing a mission is similar to doing heroin you need 4 people or you will not have fun
Amazing game Highly recommend
i brought 4 hours to this session maybe we'll get to the checkpoint of our first mission in time
very intense game Hard to find friends who don't quit but will continue to be one of the best games for the boys to spend a day on The hardest part about this game for me is FINDING PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH Mainly cause I want my friends to play but none of them want to play nearly as much as I do I haven't even seen most of the levels cause I'm trying to go in order but I am absolutely sure this game is a top tier game The idea of loneliness and challenges the players face when all they have is each other is extreme You cannot afford to waste resources sometimes and that might be your downfall It only takes 1 person to ruin it for everyone so best hope you're on your A game today or coms will be FILLED with people screaming your name I definitely recommend to ANYONE with a group of 4 friends and a love for extreme difficulty

Dead game
hammer go bonk
GTFO is an amazing game for so many different reasons Darkness is your constant companion The sound design is phenomenal with dripping pipes and distant growls keeping you on edge A single misstep can trigger an alarm plunging you into a heart-pounding frenzy Stealth and teamwork are paramount You'll need to plan coordinate and communicate effectively to overcome challenges A successful run feels incredibly rewarding because of the effort put in GTFO doesn't hold your hand Ammo is scarce enemies are relentless and death is permanent for that run This high difficulty might not be for everyone but for those who crave a challenge it's incredibly satisfying This is a brutal game that demands patience and a commitment from your team If you're looking for a casual experience look elsewhere But for those seeking a tense rewarding co-op experience GTFO is a must-play This is my favorite game and I would highly recommend trying it but make sure some of your friends pick up the game as well since playing with bots/randoms isn't nearly as fun Overall 10/10 game
y
Very good game to sink time into Fun to strategize Fun to pre-plan Make sure you have friends first nerd
Insane game The scout is a sh!tty son of a puke Reconnect is a pain in the ss I think the sleepers behind the blood doors are high on steroids The final boss is a tower
It is devastating when you lose a run But once you finish a run you have'd been trying to complete for ages it feels rewarding after the run The teamwork required are minimum as long as you are having fun playing this game
The mechanics are simple but success is challenged through rare resources hard hitting enemies and punishing mistakes These make for an experience where planning focus communication and patience are the keys to success Here every loss is crushing and every victory is well earned and celebrated Rock and Stone I mean Put some glow-sticks here
The bots are about as useful as watered down hand soap Literally the most retarded poorly coded AI I've ever seen If you like shoving hot metal down your urethra Play with bots You'll love it

Lovely and peaceful Recommend to solo players and people who like to chill P.S sike
lalalala
Dont fall for the positive rating the game is bad look at the achievement stats only 12 jf players ever finish a mission Bad things include gunplay inconsistent stealth frustrating mission design buggy as hell game can BSOD you randomly
This game is so unique in what it set out to do The thrill and immersion is amazing and requires good communication An absolute thriller If you can get 1 friend to enjoy playing this with you you will both be hooked There is matchmaking though and the community is super nice in my experience If you are a new player pay attention and ask questions People will help you out and know you may need more tips so speak up and have fun
Wish the CPU squad mates were better but it's definitely a fun challenging game
its fun to kill thjings and freinds
interesting game kept an eye on it for a few years without wanting to try it for real as expected keeps you busy even too much because you need to take care of the mission in a delicate way seems a good game won't be my favourite for distressing sessions UPDATE Usual waste of cash
Got hooked super hard One of the best co-op shooters Great atmosphere Helpful community Solid performance and flexibility to optimize the settings for lower end machines
i like it its like a peaceful game nice gameplay

Honestly a fantastic game its rare to see a game that well designed that every mission feels challenging and they don't just feed you rewards to the point that is makes the game trivial to play so you get bored of it 10/10
I have to say game play wise this game is very fun the weapons feel solid the fighting is tough as well as the teamwork aspect needed are great my only issues with the game and the reason why i am giving it a bad review is the lack of progression sure you can move on to the next level but you don't really get anything all the weapons are already unlocked theirs no real armor the only thing you get is cosmetics from beating a mission and some boosters unlike other games where you can get stuff or unlock stuff the more you play you don't really get anything nothing no big weapon to get no strong armor to last one more hit just a new gas mask or pants theirs just no real reason to suffer a hard mission with no real reward to fight for

its a very interesting game Only downfall is finding players that speak/english or speak/ATALL Not as scary as i thought Scary in a sense of you want to get in and get out alive More tense sneaking trust lastly that bloody flash light definitely a must play tho like left 4 dead got a nightmare mode Add me up if you wan't to play am all down for it

DON'T MOVE DON'T MOVE Slips hand over w YOU FUCKING MELON
the concept the gameplay the mechanics its all there just no content no progression no levels nothing to unlock other than a few cosmetics for a game that's 3 years old and is match make heavy its very bare bones the trailer is also kinda misleading i mean its accurate to an extent it happens you just wont get swarmed like in the trailers at most maybe like 5 enemies will come bursting through a door

Don't get this trash

This game is so super difficult that it's literally unplayable I have tried with friends for 3 hours to do the first mission and we just can't Sneaking is not an option as the enemies keep waking up anyway There is so little ammo that shooting is not an option either You don't even start with full ammo to your weapons/tools I once took a sniper rifle and had only 6 bullets for it

Lore Contrary to popular belief there will not be yelling at teammates it will be replaced with swift silent muttering of curse words under everyone's breaths until the swarm starts then expect prompt death to the screaming of dying comrades Then start again 12 out of 10 would buy and play People who play solo are a different breed of crazy

nice game you need many people to play

Como persona que tiene mucho sexo a toda hora puedo decir que este juego es 100 parecido a tener sexo con una mujer como yo siempre hago Obviamente este juego no me puso caliente no soy gay yo tengo mucho sexo con mujeres reales como para gastar de 15 minutos en este juego Por otro lado me recomendar este juego a la gente que no tiene sexo no como yo porque yo tengo mucho sexo con mujeres mucho como si hubiese una mujer desnuda y desnuda Ella se ve como una de mis varias novias con la que tuve mucho sexo He tenido mucho sexo soy muy guapo y las mujeres SIEMPRE quieren tener sexo conmigo porque soy muy musculoso y guapo y muy bueno en los videojuegos Todas mis novias dicen que soy muy bueno en el sexo y jugando videojuegos y siendo guapo Una de mis enamoradas me tener sexo con ella pero le dije que estaba jugando un juego de sexo y a llorar y se hizo lesbiana y se porque no tuve sexo con ella Tengo sexo con mujeres no con hombres no soy gay Soy muy cool y guapo que las chichas siempre quieren tener sexo conmigo porque soy muy cool y sexy Mi pene es muy grande A todas mis novias les gusta mi pene porque es muy grande y soy muy bueno en el sexo y lo soy tengo mucho sexo soy muy guapo y sexy y tengo mucho sexo
GTFO is not a game for everyone But for those who want a fun challenge to play together with friends and are willing to sit down for a few hour play session this is the game for you While there is a good deal of profanity and the creatures are a bit freaky at first if you can get past those it is an amazing experience The fact that the game is so hard makes finally completing a mission after countless try's so rewarding or surprising yourselves with a first try successful mission equally so The amount of teamwork needed makes you feel engaged and like you are an important part of the team as things like coordinating stealth melee kills as a team or setting jobs for each other to make sure turrets are topped off with ammo people are healed up and stocked with ammo and taking note of your teammates positions as to not inflict friendly fire damage The game is well thought out and has been a blast for my friends and I for the last few months If it sounds like your type of game or one that might interest you give it a try I think you'll find it was worth the buy If your not sure or just want to save money just wait for a sale
very good
GET IT OUT OF MY SKIN THE INFECTION IS RIPPING ME APART FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HELP ME PLEASE HELP SEND HELP DOWN THERE BREAKING IN
This game is terrible Impossible to play with bots even on the literal first easiest mission The bots are worthless and the guns are mostly useless Even with the ability to direct the bots to deploy emplacements it makes no difference I've played this game for 16 hours and still haven't beaten a single mission and I've even attempted in matchmaking coop with other people Garbage I'm going to try to get my money back Look thru my library and you'll see I'm not a causal gamer But this game requires a level of commitment that would be better applied to something more tangible Honestly horrible a terrible experience and a waste of money
fun
i like how this game is truly challenging
Got out

fun and a lil bit scary lowkey difficult so get some friends

Boy oh boy where do I even begin Scout honey my sleepy bear I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you The way you deploy your tentacles strike fear into your enemies eyes Your silky smooth touch around my rim and that gorgeous head I would do anything for you I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retract your tentacles You scream like no other but your voice never gave out You are even amazing outside of the complex you're a great sleeper and napper sometimes I even call you my sunshine I forever dread and weep thinking of the day you will one day turn black I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could allow you to anally probe my fellow prisoners with your feelers You have given me so much joy and heartbreak over the years I remember when you first became a charger variant and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you scream and wake up the entire fucking complex because deep down my glorious king deserved to be surrounded by his sleeper homies I just wanted you to blow my ear drums out Then allas you did my sweet baby boy came to me to bust my headphones and I rejoiced 2023 was a hard year for us baby but in 2024 you can make me relapse into depression You came back as as a dream where I couldn't scatter gun you without C-foam and I couldn't believe it 3 I was crying bawling even and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words oooooooo000000 RHHHHHHHH!HHHHaaaaiOOHHHHHHHhhh Not only have you changed the direction of the expedition but you've utterly fucked my runs And now you're getting older but still the goat my goat I love you pookie bear my glorious king Scout

Stealth and planning and friends you need at least 1 Don't play it like L4D2 and don't play it thinking you're doomguy or some great soldier or a soldier in general Don't shoot if you don't have to don't kill if you can sneak That's all I can say When everything goes to plan it's far more rewarding than any game I've ever played

The best COOP
Most unoptimized game
this game is very fun i enjoy the difficulty but i feel as the bots need a little more work to make solo or duo play viable i know it is a 4p coop game but for those who dont have any friends who play this or want to play this it makes things next to impossible to just try to play with just one buddy and two bots the closest thing i would compare these bots to is payday 2s friendly ai and anyone whos played pd2 on high difficulty knows those bots are useless apart from my complaint with the bots i think this game is very fun and anyone with a few pals should definitely pick it up
If you can get 4 people who play fps's together regularly I can't think of something better to try out

its a fun game sometimes but the whole weapons being really weird and scopes being bad makes the game not very fun to play anymore i like it but i wish they would just drop the guns out the game and leave us with pistols and a shotgun or smg/ar that arent dumb as hell to try and use
get me out
everybody is saying this game is hard it really isn't you just have to GET GOOD
I definitely recommend this game but I have a few things I want to touch on 1 I bought this on sale approx 15-$20 I think I might have been disappointed at a higher price point only partially because of 2 below 2 The game is insanely hard but there are a couple things that I think are bad decisions the enemy movement speed is so obviously too fast it feels totally arbitrary ammunition is arbitrarily limited and you do not spawn at 100 ammo you cannot drop items without mods and there are portions of some events or levels where they throw 10 waves at you which is far more than reasonable given the insane ammo restraints these sections require you to blitz towards the start of the level to grab resources you had to leave behind and then run back to operate a McGuffin but the resource limitations never feel fair In opposition to the above you can mitigate some problems by running a full team of friends or running mods This is fine I have one friend who plays this game and we can matchmake fine via steam without the need of discord or the in-game matchmaking which is reported to be bad The AI co-op players don't suck that bad actually but without a mod they tend to overprioritize revival over survival this is common in many games of this type but the difficulty of this game creates many WTF moments when you are trying to kite and the AI is blocking shots with a medkit in their hands chasing you instead of helping clear This is especially prevalent in the back-and-forth events I mentioned in 2 above I am recommending this game because it is otherwise awesome It is old school The atmosphere is oppressive and dark There is fog and you can't see shit The monsters trigger on light and you can't see shit At the beginning of this century when Doom 3 came out I was hoping for Doom marine meets Silent Hill 3 helplessness This game is like that It is what that game should have been in some ways It is dark and unforgiving and you will feel helpless Your guns hit stuff and they die but you will be overwhelmed Oddly for such an intentionally unfair game they do not spawn monsters directly over your head from a vent in places you cannot account for looking at you WWZ You get to set up a hold and try but you will guess wrong I assure you It is very hard feels unfair and I may never complete every level But I am not even angry although this is why I think I would have been disappointed at full price One tip the devs DO NOT want you to fully explore the levels This is a resource game and if you are not using the terminals to identify areas to prioritize important resources you will fail and some of the deeper levels take SEVERAL HOURS to complete with somewhere between 3 and ZERO checkpoints I maybe have 1/2 the levels cleared and about 1/2 of those was with one friend and 2 bots Pick your co-op friends carefully since some people will effing rage on you because of the difficulty You paid for this game but it always feels like it is stealing your quarters RECOMMEND
I can't picture a more overrated game Extremely boring gameplay that is either a sub par stealth game or a sub par shooter When stealth the movement is clunky and stilted feeling like instead of walking you struggle to even pick up your feet and move at a exceptionally slow speed through enormous and empty maps The shooting is all the worst parts of a shooter ridiculous recoil and flash along with a constant sway like your character is having a stroke while looking down the sights The AI run like crack addled spider monkeys charging at mach 7 with their heads bouncing around like crazy meaning you have the options of killing it almost instantly with a ungodly hard headshot on a target that is constanly moving with all the prior problems with the aiming or dump half your mag into the torso of one generic zombie and maybe kill that one before the other 7 beat you into a pulp as you have glass bones and paper skin so two or three punches and you are done I heard so many good things about this game before playing and while i feel that it had potential that potential has been squandered by a team that sees difficulty in the wrong light with it coming from what feels like purposefully poorly coded mechanics rather than actually challenging content

very nice this game is just like if the last of us and roblox decaying winter had a child
J'ai ma confiance de aveugle aux critiques positives aux impressionnantes ainsi qu'au concept de jeu de l'excellent Alien Swarm Cependant au final ce jeu se une majeure absolument rien n'est la hauteur De l'accueil du jeu par des aberrations chromatiques jusqu'au ressenti des armes qui on a l'impression de manier un marteau-piqueur tout est J'aurais pouvoir identifier un aspect positif mais je n'en trouve aucun Avoir terminer le tutoriel un exploit accompli par moins de 9 des joueurs a en soi une prouesse En je pense que le jeu n'a que par les 10 des joueurs qui l'ont en se fiant aux Steam ce qui explique les avis initialement positifs
The very first mission was an hour and a half of shouting A-A-A-A STOP MOVING and the realization that this game is Doom but you are NOT Doomguy I experienced pain misery and went through every stage of grief while playing this game It broke me rebuilt me and then broke me again That said the dopamine hit when me and my friends were able to not just complete a mission but complete it without any of us going down was nothing less than bliss 10/10 Play if you're a masochist or if you really just want to test your gamesense
We got the fuck out
shhh don't wake them or we'll be in deep SHIT

Fantastic co-op action stealth strategy mixed with huge consequences for failure GTFO is all about delving into long sessions with 3 other players typically 30m to 2h to accomplish 1 or optionally up to 3 overarching objective types There's a dozen unique objective types to accomplish with each having their own distinct gameplay Item collection will require you to collect objects in the level by pinpointing their locations Terminal Uplinks requires one player to enter codes into a computer terminal while teammates protect them from waves of enemies reactor startups feature even more hordes as well as traversing levels to collect codes that will help you progress further etc While some levels are more weighted than others the game typically has a fun balance of stealth and action that keeps the experience fresh and complex Stealth is largely slow but can be done quickly with experience even with hundreds of hours into the game it's still very satisfying to clear a room of sleeping enemies with no ammo or health wasted Action is at times chaotic and stressful but make victory all that more sweet this can really test your team on i]some[/i of the more difficult levels where even a relatively small mistake can spell your own doom While there's plenty of lore to discover there's not much story to the game to keep track of it's largely gameplay focused and the main fun is in simply tackling GTFO's many difficult challenges and overcoming them GTFO is undoubtedly at it's best with friends that have no experience but the discord is a decent alternative The community is largely very friendly and while it's possible for skilled players to do some of the heavy lifting that is fun to learn for yourself there's plenty of folks that are as fresh and unknowledgeable as a first-time player GTFO's has a fair share of bugs glitches ranging from completely blackening your screen for about 1-2 minutes at seemingly random one of the game's tools C-Foam can rarely shoot straight through a door which in some niche levels can essentially ruin your chances of winning terminals can completely stop working even if they're related to an objective simply using a level checkpoint can cause a slew of issues and plenty others Many of these problems have been in the game for years with no hope in sight for fixes beyond community mod patches All that being said I frankly couldn't recommend this game enough if you're looking for a hardcore co-op game it's certainly not for everyone but if you fit the niche I'm sure you'll be more than satisfied Have fun discovering all of the enemy types there's some fucked up shit to find
yuh

Tres bon jeu en coop si t'a 3 potes en plus c'est fou mais si t'en a qu'un ou deux bouche les trous avec des bots sinon bonne chance xD en plus de est vachement cool et pour a peu 17 Go le jeux est vachement beau
One of the best games ever to play with friends Do not attempt alone
Good game if you have freinds I don't I have freinds now
I CANT EVEN GET PAST THE FIRST LEVEL WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK
The game does alot of things intensely correct for only 12 of the players to have actually completed a sector and for players to still leave 46k positive reviews
GTFO of the negative recommendations and buy the game
this game is dead its in featured but sense the multiplayer died and it being a multiplayer game it kinda is impossible to play i played for 7 hours and didnt beat any level the ai isnt good enough to do the tasks to keep going you usually die before getting to the first door and even if you live you have to try to cooperate with the bot which are more of a hindrance
I love this game so much its always an amzing time D i also love spending hours to days on a single mission and driving my friends crazy i would highly recommend if you have some goobers to play with
beep beep beep tracker is best tool to lie
Only 4 hours in but I'm look forward to add a hundred to the end of that 4 Intense and quite fun Simple but interactive

An amazingly challenging game that will require you and your friends to become a great unit
This game is like if harry potter and moby dick clapped and made this absolute abomination of scary and hard me and the squad have be grinding and it took us 2 days to beat the second level and it will take another 2 for the third lowkey 10/10 would ride moby again ps
The game was mad fun but the trans discord mods were trash and they band me aka meatyloaf and dak those gay guys where trash But I still like the game
shit game
kinda need friends to play this game but its a lot of fun wait for the sale and get this game for 20 bones with some friends and you'll have a hell of a time

100 Hours in didn't even finish half the game fucking love it The lore and the gameplay is amazing 10/10 recommended This game is best to play with friends if you don't have friends recommend join the official GTFO discord channel to find a group of people that may will become your new friend to play with
this game is horrible no feet whatsoever
too hard and im too lazy to git gud
Its a fucking good horror game thats for sure
you can become a ninja turtle
Creates trust issues and ruins friendships
ooooo spaghetti
honestly it a fun gun but i can't find any health or ammo been playing with my friend good game just not enough ammo i understand you have to sneak around but in time wish i had more supply
Having a really fun time with my buddy Great game
way too slow for my liking
3 unix like 1-4 5 8
Astonishing bugs with bots AI almost each game the bot does not follow commands example 3 ppl staying inside securtiy scan where all team members needed so the bot just casually walks around doing anything NOT to stay in a circle No matter what you or your teammates ping on me"/"focus on the objective the bot keeps staying out of circle This circus goes on for hours Sometimes on restart everything works fine but in the majority of missions bots keep going wild The game itself is overall a nice try-hard coop but if you don`t have EXACTLY 4 ppl to party up don`t even try playing it
Dead game with no solo
very difficult you HAVE to work as a team i mean u can technically do it alone i guess but its much much more difficult without working as a team really cool game though alot deeper than it might look from the outside I suggest giving it a shot matchmaking is a little iffy but its great for the most part
great for making friends or just chilling out discord is a necessity if you want to play co-op because the un-optimized little used matchmaking system remember to wear your brown pants the first few time tho

It's alright
h1 My Opinion on GTFO h1 I very much enjoy this game GTFO provides a thrilling challenging and terrifying co-op experience in which the player must fight through or sneak around a variety of enemies to reach the objective GTFO's unique gameplay and large number of levels help it outshine other games in the category Some common strategies for success in GTFO include spoiler Avoid tweaking twinkers spoiler spoiler Become familiar with a variety of guns and tools spoiler spoiler Giving backshots to bigs spoiler spoiler Communicate and strategize objectives with your teammates spoiler spoiler Avoid being felt by the feeler spoiler
Very atmospheric and well designed levels Looking forward to more hours in

depends three friends ok the fk out
the only game that emulates the fear of crowds by opening a door into a room full of giant enemies
This game has no online matchmaking that works meaning you have to dig through the discord to find anyone to play with this especially sucks since this game is almost impossible with one person Get friends or get a different game Otherwise the game itself is long 20mins-1hr 1/2 per mission and difficult but overall if you can get through all the crap its good
GTFO is one of the most mature games I have played It is brutally difficult It does not hold any punches what so ever Great concept of cohesiveness between squamates Awesome tone and setting Gunplay feels tight but smooth and responsive GTFO is one of most immersive and intuitive games I have ever played Using a computer and typing commands in a command prompt blew my mind You have to query items for location then ping them for exact location WOW The GTFO discord is one of the best communities out there Easy to find a group to play with and there is always someone that plays the role of the Guide to lead the team to completion This game is for adult matures gamers who seek a challenge and complex gameplay Pacing is very slow as this is not a run gun game Ammo and supplies are scarce which leads to a majority of stealth and melee kills to not alert all the enemies Did I mention this game is punishing and unforgiving The difficulty may seem like a turn off but completion feels so rewarding My only negative is that Rundowns can last from 1 5 hours depending on the mission chosen I would honestly play more if I had more time to complete Rundowns 10 Chambers has gained a lifelong fan from this project Enter at your own risk and prepare to die

Hardcore brutal and fun This game is super unforgiving and instills you with fear not just because of the horror elements but because resources are scarce and the enemy WILL overrun you I was also surprised by how good the guns feel and the amount of equipment variety this game has You should play this with friends This game will test your friendship Playing by yourself is evidence that you are a sadomasochist
Turn off your fucking flashlight you absolute nimrod Words spoken moments before disaster I hate my friends now

Repetitive gameplay terrible game design Having failed a rundown you simply want to replay it and the game forces you to take breaks with its disgusting and inconvenient design The interface design is unplayable it is impossible to see anything normally in it and it is impossible to use it normally you can get used to it as easily as having sand in your eyes The appearance of enemies rooms and objects is simply disgusting not in a good way but in the worst sense it is dull monotonous and the laziness of the game creators is simply obvious The hitboxes of enemy hits both them hitting players and players hitting them are broken player detection regularly occurs spontaneously and uncontrollably The game has an extremely deep lore that it absolutely does not need They stole a ton of nonsense from other franchises only to completely fail to display this lore in the game itself The game is only playable with mods that increase the amount of gunplay In fact the design of the weapon and the sound of shooting are the only good things about this game but this is not enough to cover the disadvantages It felt like the developers wanted with all their might so that no one would play their game I categorically do not recommend anyone to buy this creation
foda pra krl pena q pra jogar com gringo mas pelo menos o server P2P
I want to like this game as the idea is great as well as it being fun with friends But the balance is just crazy There needs to be a slight boost to players such as higher weapon damage better stealth or more resources to work with You seem to be forced into a specific way to play which is poor Not to mention the enemies hit like 18 wheeler trucks from firing a small firefly flare at you The UI looks cool but its garbage and overly difficult to navigate The game also REQUIRES every player on the team to be on top form solo play just isn't an option and the AI bots are clowns 4/10 try harder and give a difficulty option then maybe the game would've been more successful At the moment its dead with under 1000 consecutive players

DONT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT FRIENDS The game is Hardcore and needs alot of teamwork and if you dont have money dont buy it because it is expensive for a NEED 3 friends games i was just lucky i have an awesome bestfriend who gave me 50 of the price and lucky enough i have friends to play with
6.5 hour on the 2 easiest rounds in number 1 theres until number 8 is this ever gonna end
great game
This is a great game very heavy on team focus and communication some games for one mission can last over an hr thank goodness for check points Its complex layers to maps like hardly any light totally fogged out trying to complete task to escape with not trying to wake creatures Glad i got gaming laptop one of my first two game purchases
I Like how we can be like pros but on the next game we're acting like a retard but with guns

good
stealth game to make u depressed if u happy to be depressed this is game for u
Good
Its hard the player base has dwindled significantly the only unlocks and rewards are cosmetics and temporary buffs That being said the game play loop is great The gun play feels nice and weighty Visuals hold up Grab a group so you can communicate and not have to worry about matchmaking and you're set
If you have friends to play it with or 100 and the game is on sale so you can gift it to your friends it's incredible if you have no friends but don't plan on grinding the game and finishing every level then yeah it's probably fine if you want to complete every level with only bots do not buy this game it will not be fun the whole point of the game is teamwork only having bots on the later maps might be impossible you need the coordination of actual humans communicating The game itself assuming you have 3 friends is amazing highly replayable the weapons feel great it's very easy to learn but extremely hard to actually survive it's just an incredible PvE game
yes i rec yes fun yes everything
The matchmaking system for this game is garbage I'd think it could easily be fixed by just adding a match list that players can choose a match they want to fill into I initially bought this game because it looked like a fun co-op game but realistically you are waiting for a match for about 30 mins to an hour on avg Literally 1/3 of my playtime has been sitting in lobby I bought the game on sale for 21.99 but I'd say it's worth like 15 tops If I could I would get a refund for this game I honestly can't see myself playing this game all too often just because of the terrible matchmaking system Overall the game play itself is alright It's a little frustrating getting hit through terrain and sometimes the weakspot hits appear to not hit I do like the stealth and problem solving aspects of this game particularly using the terminal which in itself is a unique feature that I've not experienced in other games It would be nice if you could customize your weapons so you could have a thermal sight on other weapons but it is what it is I did try playing solo but it's kind of questionable whether or not the bots will actually help you with your stealth kills when you need to dispatch multiple enemies as you can't directly give them orders
multiplayer game that has a poor lobby and not enough users now otherwise the enemies are tough and creepy but it required strategy AND cooperation among the team
bon fps horreur hardcore gamer un seule mots ne rien
I fucking hate this game 10/10
you know a game is sick when they warn you about playing it in the starting screen
good
Solo para gente con suficiente IQ
Le jeu est bcp trop bien l'ambiance est juste dingue Les sont mais il y'a une bonne a choisir minutieusement en fonction de chaque mission Le jeu est dure ce n'est pas un jeu pour chill il faut faire solo ou avec un groupe un minimum dans le jeu mais dans tout les cas il faudra tryhard Il y'a cependant un au jeu c'est qu'il n'y a pas vraiment d'histoire et le gameplay pas C'est un jeu sur lequel vous aurez la dans l'immersion est totale je recommande
Game is very slow paced You sneak around trying not to wake zombies and once you get close enough you melee them That's basically the entire gameplay For me that's not fun I want to shoot my guns not only use melee Unfortunately it takes a few hours to understand and get a feel for the game I wanted to return this game but couldn't because I had played more than 2 hours So if you don't like stealth games this one is not for you
Solo para gente paciente
If you like slow stealth games you would probably like this game unfortunately for both myself and this game I do not like stealth games
I cant play it it crashes at very beginning when im getting taken underground im playing on steam deck looks fun tho
very shooty sometimes spooky
10 10
I haven't been able to play this game much because you genuinely need a full team that's willing to work together That being said in terms of a horde shooter with horror elements this one is actually the scariest Enemies are daunting and completely tear through you Requiring genuine effort toward teamwork and coordination Do not buy this game and go solo it won't work You either have to have 3 friends or be willing to find people to play with through discord
No one is Going to read this review so i want to confess that i am gay
I think this is the best co-op shooter I've ever played.The co-op is the thing of the game.and missions.and beating sleeper's asses with sledgehammer.and dieing whole group from one wonderful idea to open the one door
The AI are fucking retarded you need 4 friends for anything past the first chapter
This game is really interesting and fun bringing a lot of new ideas towards the usual kill-all-the-zombie games I really enjoy playing it the only issue is that it is definitely really difficult My friends and I struggle to win the first levels And I consider myself to be pretty good at shooters and video games in general If you don't have a full lobby with friends and have to use the bots it can be super difficult to win especially endgame Still learning though
HOD
smack
Makes you feel like you're in an Alien movie or something Thank god you're not alone Or at least hopefully you can bring some friends along The level of teamwork needed is definitely a plus Very hard game but makes the successful missions sweeter
Un Extration shooter Horror ben curato ottimo per chi vuole conoscere il genere si rende necessario avere almeno un compagno con cui giocarci in quanto le mappe sono studiate per trasmetterti totale solitudine Le meccaniche sono semplici ma adeguate allo stile di gioco il design soggettivamente bello Giocato in compagnia perfetto per chi vuole mettere in gioco la sinergia con i compagni ma non vuole rinunciare alla calma insomma non frenetico ma punisce molto gli errori di strategia e comunicazione
hear me out you'll shit yourself
only if who have other frindes to play with cause the lobbies are very hard to find as solo

Stay quiet stay alive Good game
Was boring
Bought it in EA another buyer's regret to add to the list In EA they explained the lack of lobby/matching system and it was fine because it was EA Guess what it released at yet-another game where you need to head to discord find people you get along with preferably your age group preferably team players preferably you see the problem you need friends If you don't have a group of friends who bought the game AND are willing to play AT your hours then you don't play the game In fact i never played it past EA because of this very problem Why they never implemented a good lobby/skill matching system is beyond me Or maybe gaming is broken in 2024
Game gives me anxious gut feeling need to tell others about it so they can also have anxious gut feeling with me I seen a skull
I have 1 mission left and have done all the optional side content except for that missions Overall a very enjoyable game I did the vast majority of the content with random groups on the discord It's a pretty small community and easy to find a few people to play with repeatedly In my 282 hours as of writing this I've had maybe 1 troll and 1-2 really bad players most players genuinely want to progress and get better and have been good teammates You can play the game solo with bots but if you do definitely get the mod for better bots and be prepared to be frustrated by them and some levels will be basically impossible or at least way harder than intended I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge and is looking for a game were skill expression is rewarded heavily 20 for the game is worth it even if you don't fully finish it it's a pretty unique concept for a game

TLDR Review GTFO is one of my favorite co-op experiences had in gaming The strategy and tactics and butt clenching tension of running these missions is unmatched by anything played and tbh I think anything the market has to offer at the moment Its atmosphere and lore are top notch and I think if got a group of friends to play it with and like tactical shooters or scifi horror this is a must play However do note that the game starts slow and you will fuck up a lot a reason the game's tagline is together or die I personally say well worth full price but I do always advocate for getting games cheaper when you can And considering a niche game and you ideally want a full group to play probably best to recommend waiting for a sale on this game But so worth it regardless For my full written review check out my backloggd
tipp erst wenn er seine tentakel wieder eingefahren hat helfe immer wieder gern
good
hard but atmosphere makes up for it gunplay is great and weapons are different yet still cool and kinda realistic in a way friends are a big help solo is very hard but with some skill and some luck this game can be super fun kinda serious so not a vibin game as much but can be if you dont miss you shots under pressure and there will be pressure all game times are hella long tho so expect an 1 per mission with small amount of fuck ups
Great game 10/10 would recommend For any new players i recommend joining the discord server for if you run into any issues as well as needing a bit of help from someone

Not a fan of shooters but I love this game I really love using the rifle/sight weapons I enjoy the strength of shotguns and SMGs are great for when you're panicking and just need to flail your gun around And you will be panicking Because this game will stress you out constantly because the enemies sound and look terrifying the atmosphere is terribly upsetting and the pure amount of baddies as in bad guys not hot girls sorry that run at you during certain sections is pants soiling You simultaneously have a lot and very little loadout options because while there is a good selection of weapons they are unable to be customised Personally adore the DREKKER DEL P1 Rifle due to its thermal sight and long range meaning I can be the fuck away from sleepers The game also makes you a strategist because if you go into a single level without a plan you will not be making it out alive You need to be good with guns but also melee weapons and stealth It's a phenominal mix of two genres that I never would've thought paired in such a wonderful synergistic manner TL;DR I love this game and I am saddened that I'm yet to find another that scratches the particular itch GTFO so expertly does I adore this game SO much
GTFO Nightmare fuel The Warden The party
Hard game
A tough as nails and extremely atmospheric game Half stealth half shooter The pace is usually slow and controlled in a very intentional way The game quickens the pace in short spurts that are extremely nerve racking All of your culminated choices/mistakes over the 90 minute or more levels can devolve into a loss at a moments notice which results in a satisfying paranoia and sharp feeling of loss of control If you go in blind with a group of friends it has a bit of roguelike feel to it where you expect to lose the first few attempts of any given level but the knowledge you gain of the layout goals and pitfalls help empower you on your next try One of the few games I've taken notes about It also does not have any gated content aside from harder levels at the lower areas You get access to all weapons and tools immediately If you win or lose a level it's 100 on whether your team performed rather than if you were over/underleveled there is no concept I haven't played another game like it and I'm enjoying it a lot There's other extraction shooters but none that match the same atmosphere and dread this one brings Definitely hoping to find more games like it but I doubt I will
AHHHHHHHH ALARMS RUN
Game make me poopoo myself 10/10 Can poopoo with friends
really fun game to with friends
If you have two or three friends that you can rely on in hectic situations GTFO is a heck of a lot of fun Plenty of tense moments requiring teamwork and split-second decisions to make this game interesting You will die a lot but when you start to learn the mechanics of the game and your plans start coming together completing a rundown is super satisfying Graphics technical 7/10 Graphics aesthetic 9/10 Music 7/10 Sound 9/10 Gameplay 9/10 Story/immersion 8/10 Overall enjoyment 8/10
let them snorse
muy divertido y recomendable pero tiene una dificultad elevada preferible jugarlo con otras 3 personas y bien comunicados
This game has it all fear adrenaline stealth and immersive gameplay It can be very difficult playing solo but not impossible You really have to think about how far you want to explore and the kit setup between you and your team There is a decent amount of weapons support items and modifiers that you can explore using against whatever abominations come after you Although you do have the ability to run and gun your way through the map it will only set you up for failure The more noise you make the more they come after you Ammo and health are limited in the map and you will have to decide how to split it up between your team members There is a ton of levels and the further down you go the more difficult it gets Really your only goal is to complete the objective and GTFO alive
This game is litteraly Rainbow Six Siege Extraction except it's actually good and very fun
SHHHHH
Hop on gtfo
Bad to the bone through an through was a massive Cod BO 2 zombies fan and couldn't quite fill in for that fix This game does that and more the thrills and chills make for an awesome touch on this game It's also super solo player friendly and for anyone with a hunger for challenge might be just as glad as I was to snag this game
This game is freakishly hard 30 hours in and I haven't even been able to beat rundown 1 yet The first set of missions out of 8 This game is so difficult that it forces you and your teammates to take it slow meaning that most missions take more than an hour when beating them the first time If anyone messes up and get spotted that usually means game over or your teams is left standing with 20 health Everyone should therefore always be wary be strategic and most importantly stick together Pros variety of weapons feels rewarding when you win room for lots of strategy good learning curve great graphics sound and atmosphere people can join mid mission to replace bots no grinding no bugs Mixed very difficult starts off difficult from the start only rewards are cosmetics and limited use perks objectives could be more varied as there's a lot of just navigating while killing the same monsters Cons feels demotivating to lose pasing is slow very easy to lose from small mistakes bots are very limited In conclusion this is a game only for people who like VERY DIFFICULT games that take a long time It is also best played with friends unless they suck as good communication is required 7/10
Its decent
I really needed to GTFO
grab your friend cause you're gonna need em and GTFO
Not recommended its a game that you dont play All the positive reviews have less than 15 hours you cannot find one 100 hours played

my favourite co-op game
Absolutely my favorite game atm Although it is produced by a smaller company and is on the more the more expensive side it is well worth it There are around 50 levels that each can take around an hour to complete assuming you get it first try with each level forcing you to play strategically and slowly until you fuck it up and all hell breaks loose For the size of the dev team this game has absolutely incredible detail and attention to detail with plenty of lore to discover as well
pretty fun if you got friends 3
sexo
Had it when they let you play on the weekend Biggest problem is you need 3 friends or willing to make 3 friends that willing to play with you That is the bare Minimum for this game Otherwise avoid like me
SI
Fun and you will need stealth and have friend because it's hard to play alone
Deep Dark Fantasy
GGGGGGGGGTTTTTTTTTTTTFFFFFFFFFFFOOOOOOOOOOO
hardcore coop game that makes you suffer alot
Great game wish it was on on console
bad game
Gosta de FPS Gosta de terror Gosta de Gosta de jogos coop Gosta de Se sim esse jogo perfeito para jogar com seus amigos um jogo que enfatiza muito a sendo altamente recomendado jogar com amigos Se quer um jogo tranquilo esse jogo pra Mas se quer algo desafiador que requer bastante e que contenha elementos de terror e stealth de brinde definitivamente uma chance para essa obra prima Vale ressaltar que em 25 horas de gameplay eu e meus amigos conseguimos nem terminar a segunda campanha tem 8 campanhas no total se acostume com o fracasso recorrente em algumas fases Minha com esse jogo o dano de queda brutal perde muita vida ao cair de lugares relativamente baixos atrapalhando bastante por ter muitos medipacks ao longo das fases
only reason i keep playin is cuz they got ass fr
I really like this game but the developers just royally messed up this game So you can play all rundowns now 1-8 which is awesome but it wasn't always this way Having the rundowns be deleted and then a new one comes out next season is just so dumb It lead to a lot of people not wanting to buy the game because who wants to start at rundown 6 and not have any idea how the game works on a difficulty that high So you would have no content except one rundown every season until they started adding the old ones back finally This all matters because this game is heavily co-op focused and only gets like 500 players a day which I 100 think was because of the rundown model Now for the second reason this isn't good This game barely has solo play for harder difficulties I don't know why co-op game devs do not understand the importance of a good solo game mode/play style sometimes I would argue you can do most of the games content solo but there's some levels where the bots just aren't enough to help you out and because there is no difficulty scaling depending on how many real people you have on the team this obviously is a problem for the harder missions Last annoying thing that also hurts this game matchmaking is terrible and you have to use a discord server to play with people easily I really don't know how the developers didn't see these issues and go maybe we should have more solo support or a solo mode but yea now the game is not doing well because who even wants to play a game that relies on other people but doesn't have other people I will continue playing the rundowns you can do solo but it's a shame you can't reasonably do them all solo Maybe if they update bots or add more solo support or a solo game mode I'll change this review but it's a co-op based game with a very convoluted way to find players because I don't want to join a Discord server if I don't have too and matchmaking is awful So unless you're fine with not being able to realistically play solo or having to join a server to find players then you probably won't like this game It's a shame but developers just make bad choices sometimes Edit It's also not playable offline so it's also always online despite it having the option to play solo I love bad developers
This game is brutal And in VR is even better I can't recommend it enough
very nice game
Spread your cheeks for the Giant monsters good game scary but not as much as getting caught by your math teacher while playing with your Johnson in class plz I need 1,500 steam points xd
its good
One of the most fun horror/fps games I've played so far Really immersive with few friends I highly recommend if you like to play co-op games with friends and it's even better if you don't research stuff yourself to the game so everybody is new
Some amazing fun if you have patient friends
Lo recomiendo si quieres un killing floor mas hardcore y que requiere sigilo pero es uno de esos juegos cooperativos que requieren con No vas a llegar muy lejos solo con bots La mayor parte de la comunidad vive en el Discord oficial ese es el matchmaking en caso que no tengas amigos que tengan el juego Hay un de matchmaking en el juego pero no mucha gente lo usa es un juego y las misiones son largas por lo que requiere resistencia a la y ganas de aprender
not fun
incr
goooooood
mt bom so faltava ter amgs pra jgr cmg
Turn off your flashlight you dumbass
Amazing gameplay
I do not recommend if you are a loner gamer like me If you have a normal life with plenty of trusty friends to game with then sure go ahead and pick this up and have fun The game revolves heavily around stealth which I don't particularly mind at all seriously However there are no mechanics to have your bots synchronize stealth attacks which is super important in this game You can only command your bots to lay down sentry guns and use tools like trap foam The ammo you start with is low and the ammo you find if any is low as well so resource management is crucial It would have been great to have different difficulty levels to accommodate for solo playthroughs or newcomer teams alike like enemy damage amount of starting ammo/ammo found Another thing I didn't like too much was how much darkness was involved IMO i thought that there could have been a little more lighting to every map particularly the super dark ones where there is almost no light anywhere I understand that the game is supposed to give off a derelict and horrorlike theme but there are times when it is particularly annoying and honestly tiring like literally eye-tiring I guess the other thing i have to say is that the checkpoint system is too scarce and too punishing for my taste Hear me out guys I'm kissing on being 35 years old this year.the last thing I wanna do is spend 3-5 hours on my off day playing one mission solo only to die before there's even a checkpoint and then have to return to the main menu If I wanted to do that then I'll just boot up whatever Fromsoft game I have I just can't do it anymore so that being said look.if you like punishing games and don't mind challenging yourself with friends or being a masochist and playing solo then play this game It's fun despite how difficult and cumbersome it may be at times The graphics are phenomenal and the immersive creativity is some of the best I've ever seen using terminal interfaces to look for items and ping them is awesome the gunplay is so nice and overall the game is f****n cool Just be wary of what you are diving into bu dum tss
you can say every racial slur possible in chat The best games dont have filter
Boring AI just isn't I
love the gun play guns feel weighty unfortunately some of the more satisfying guns are not that great the weapon balancing is a bit off and over half the weapons are shadowed by other guns that do the same if not more the stealth is sometimes janky where an enemy through a wall will alert from a stealth kill but its sorta rare overall fun difficult game to play with friends
Is good Sneaky splats
Just when youve been screaming for a mission with ammo dumping you get one and its the hardest shit youve played only to miss the stealthy combat levels that become your next nightmare All big time fun if you have the patience and the team Play in the dark for best immersion
csapat hanem be tud szippantani A lobby kicsit bugyuta ha nincs 3 akkor random rundownokba rak be nem pedig a te folytatja de ezen nem nagyon tudok mondani annyit hogy ha botokkal nem nagyon tudod nem lehet nekik parancsot adni de ennek a nem is az a hogy botokkal
this game is just simply unfair
Dark Souls GTFO get the fuck out
Met some of the nicest people playing this game A great game for a socially awkward worm like me
This is a mans version of lethal company
👍
it gud
O jogo muito bom para jogar com os amigos e bem tenso Tem um bug para todos que 1 pessoa em ela consegue descer no elevador ficar caindo eternamente criando o lobby com amigos sozinha ela consegue jogar e consegue entrar na partida em andamento O que eu e meu amigo descobrimos depois de horas tentando foi que a pessoa que esta bugada ela tem que criar a sala e os amigos tem que entrar assim que ela descendo no elevador APENAS ELA CONSEGUE SER O HOST para poder jogar com os amigos The game is very good to play with friends and is very tense There is a bug not for everyone that 1 specific person cannot go down in the elevator keep falling forever creating the lobby with friends but alone she can play and also cannot enter the game in progress What my friend and I discovered after hours of trying was that the person who has the bug has to create the room and their friends have to join as soon as they are going down in the elevator ONLY SHE CAN BE THE HOST so she can play with her friends
I love being terminal man
This game is something else it has everything action stealth strategy hidden story that you have to find out yourself co-op complex levels and unique no game braking bugs only few visuals great voice actors its a challenging game and its not for weak minded and snowflake people This is hardcore entertainment So if you are ready to suffer and have fun suffering with your friends dedicated discord community so if you dont have friends you can make some easy what the actual fuck are you waiting for Buy it and you wont regret
The game is ultra hardcore I absolutely approve it the only downside is that you can't change the gamma settings in game so if you have an oled monitor or you just playing on low brigthness setting you are just f****d
Too many choke points that we found this to be a boring game Spent several hours playing and we just couldn't get into it and the game wants you to play with certain character setups and it just wasn't appealing Didn't want to use the NPCs because they'd all too often lure the enemies and cost us rounds
Pick up your deployables also watch out for Hackett
i hate my life
Best game to guilt trip your friends when you are the one to alert the enemies and send the hole expedition to a state of emergency with no resources
BAUM PO COMPRA
Do you have Three friends who you can con into playing this once a week who will buy it OR Do you have 100 you can plunk down and the charisma to guilt those three friends into playing the game you bought just for them If not Walk away Sorry This game is nearly impossible even with four good players who know what they're doing Going solo should be treated by mental health professionals as a form of self-harm This is a gritty dark hopeless world and you are gritty dark hopeless chumps being thrown at gritty dark monstrous enemies that will inevitably tear you limb from limb unless you use your gritty dark overpowered guns to melt their faces off The first phase of most missions consists of sneaking about gathering supplies and locating the objective The second Phase consists mostly or getting killed in one of three ways learning how the mission plays and trying it again What three ways you ask 1 You will get torn limb from limb by hordes of ravenous zombie-like creatures that want to you in the face with their Tentacle tongues and down your neck 2 You will get fragged by a team-mate or their turret 3 You will run out of ammo Refer back to 1 for what happens then This game requires patience coordination communication and trust That means you will die alot and blame one of your friends for getting you face-****ed by the horde Unless it's your fault which it will be 25 of the time Eventually every mission comes to point where you all agree it's time to GET THE OUT OF HERE Ahp they said the name thee it is and you have to run through the confusing maze of the level you just crept through If you like me have the sense of direction of a syphilitic hamster dying of a brain-swell then this may pose a difficult task This game will sap you of your will to live and make you feel utterly defeated after 30 minutes of nerve-wracking stress-filled stealthy sneaky sh*t Whether you succeed or not 11/10 Funner with Friends
I'm proud to say that in all my time playing GTFO I haven't regretted a minute of it Yes this game is not an easy one but it is not absurdly difficult It challenges teamwork first and foremost At any given moment you have to constantly reflect on your actions think about your comrades and coordinate with them The mechanics and basic principles in GTFO have been honed to perfection by the development team They are easy to understand but difficult to apply The audience of the game is as friendly as possible Everyone is willing to help each other and most players are very responsive and patient which was very pleasant for me as a newcomer at first So far I've completed 4 rundowns out of eight and I have no intention of stopping I recommend GTVO to anyone who wants to challenge their abilities and just try something new
worst exfil shooter out there
OK
mothers want me scouts fear me

Eu sou um pai de 45 anos provavelmente uma das pessoas mais velhas a jogar este jogo Sou pai solteiro criando meu filho que agora tem 14 anos Meu filho ganhou este jogo no Natal de 2021 de seu tio o instalamos em seu computador e ele a jogar o final da semana ele tinha 24 horas neste jogo Isso foi para mim pois era encontrar maneiras de passar o tempo com meu filho pois ele sempre com os amigos ou apenas assistindo ao YouTube eu decidi fazer uma conta no Steam e pegar esse jogo para ver se eu poderia jogar ao lado dele Eu comprei o jogo e comecei a jogar mas eu estava preso no que deveria fazer Pedi ajuda ao meu filho e ele organizou um jogo para eu participar Adorei pois foi o melhor momento que passei com meu filho desde que minha esposa morreu Desde esse jogo aproximou eu e meu filho novamente e agora passamos um tempo juntos fora de casa Este jogo me lembrou que em tudo e trouxe muitas felizes para mim e meu filho
One of my favorite co-op games The community is good and the game is strong I have died many times but it has always been from a dumb mistake A lot of people seemed to get filtered very early on which is a shame This game is great but requires that you actually pay attention to what's going on Going run and gun will only get you killed The tutorial is valuable and there is a genuine sense of achievement when a mission is finished
its very hard without friends but its so fun
I like
So damn awesome You need 4 people to truly experience it and it is a lot more stealth than shooting although usually stealth turns into a lot of shooting Dont wake the sleepers
GTFO est un jeu captivant qui excelle dans la immersive avoir de grosses avancer car certaines missions sont dur Si vous aimez les jeux de tir qui exigent une communication et une coordination alors GTFO pourrait un excellent choix pour vous
melo con amigos
Don't play this game Amazing game first time a game has ever gave me chaotic murder awesome stealth mechanics and a true challenge all in the same level
When they said this game was hard they were not kidding It starts out as 100 ways to get killed while noobing around but quickly progresses to being a tough lesson on how to do teamwork right I'm still excited about the way the game combines very intense combat hair raising exploration and relatively low key puzzles
ITS GOOD
game is fun but its meant to be played with 4 friends and i dont have 4 friends
There's an expedition in GTFO one of many where you have to turn on a reactor You walk up to a shitty DOS-style terminal and type in a password every few minutes between waves of enemies This is on a timer and if the timer runs out you have to redo the wave The password just appeared on screen the first few times until it didn't Instead we were told we had to find the password on another terminal and given a longer timer to do so-4:30 Caught off guard by this we run around and it takes us a long time to figure out what the fuck we're supposed to do We just barely manage to punch in the password in time Then it happens again this time with a 9:00 timer We groan And then before the last wave the timer was i]17:30[/i and involved going through a logistics maze of finding keycards to open doors Have I told you this expedition doesn't have checkpoints yet This kind of ruthlessness is what you will come to expect in GTFO It's a game that cruelly throws everything it's got at you You're always the little guy outnumbered and outgunned being forced to deal with insane oppressive conditions Sometimes the map is so foggy you cannot see anything but the glowing tongues of the various enemies swarming Sometimes the developers say lights are cringe and make the map pitch black forcing you to rely on your shitty flashlight that illuminates the center 15 of the screen Sometimes the enemies fucking play dead and then jump up 2 seconds later and attack you again If the above hasn't scared you off already you're gonna fuckin love this game h1]The good[/h1 list Every expedition looks the same until you look a little closer and realize they're all totally different Endless content Every loadout is viable Creatively relentlessly cruel Handles high ping exceptionally well list h1]The bad[/h1 list Saddest cosmetic system I have ever seen no microtransactions though A bit buggy and janky here and there Stealth system consists of walking up to enemies without vision cones in a red light green light fashion It's not the best take on stealth I've seen It's ok list h1]The subjective[/h1 list Ridiculously difficult and not only that you need i]other people[/i to play the ridiculously difficult game Communication is key Solo is unplayable Story is well IGN puts it well-"hilariously oppressive Slow-ish matchmaking list h1]Advice for the player[/h1 list This game is i]by far[/i best experienced with a group of 2-4 people who when starting out are just as clueless as you are That being said Don't bother with the in-game matchmaking Use the official discord it's quite active In said discord use lfg-beginners for as long as your skill level seems to match the population there If you have the courage to do so whilst hosting politely kick highly experienced teachers from your lobby Of course the best thing to do is to play with friends who buy the game at the same time as you But nobody has people for that right

The ultimate co-op survival experience Not a game for everyone This game will and is made to make you cry and panic If you don't want to focus and proceed through the level meticulously for hours you're better off playing COD Zombies I suggest to have a premade team of 4 people because vocal communication is a MUST Matchmaking doesn't work properly and randos are mostly weird Live together or die together

The Game
While I do enjoy the difficulty and challenge that this game offers I would not recommend this game due to the amount of bugs that can make a run unnecessarily hard or even outright end a run Here is a list of the more annoying things that we encountered Enemy attacks go through corners/walls Foam glitching through closed doors Enemies attacking through closed doors Mine triggers before a door opened therefore killing no enemy Terminal bugs out and can't be used anymore Wave spawns in the middle of the group Memory leak ending a run after 1 hour
It's an ok game if you hate yourself I enjoy playing it but I can't honestly recommend it to anyone Long missions lots of sneaking more tedious than difficult no checkpoints there are SOME but it's complicated and not much of a reward besides the agony finally being over and then it starts again in the next mission What prompted me to drop down a negative review is how a bot teammate shot my friend in the face with a shotgun for heavy damage when we were trying to sneak I assume the bots MIGHT stay quiet if you use the comms but that feels like pointless extra effort when dealing with basic sleepers and in general bots dealing friendly fire damage unless with deployables like turrets/mines just seem absolutely bonkers to me
das spiel ist eingach nur cool
fun
4 2 6
Needs 4 friends to play at the same with a good connection if not than than the other teammates with have bad desync which will make it unplayable The only good thing is that you can remove the bots and solo it Not sure if the game will scale with the bots missing but your odds of surviving are better
Boring and repetitive Alot of gameplay fixes/changes are needed Make the maps smaller and add less fog stop making the flashlight extremely mandatory make nightvision nods a thing or thermal imaging device a pickup item for a level Very annoying game in alot of aspects Not worth the price at all especially if they are going to force the npc partners to be basically brain dead Look at peoples achievements for this game and youll understand pretty quickly to stay away from the game
sheesh
These monsters really got to stop edging man every time I move they edge and almost bust kinda gay
GTFO is a great and difficult slow paced tactical game that i have enjoyed since in alpha and beta I will be recomending this game to all of my friends and dragging them into missions with me

Good game
i like it
Take your time be quiet and then shoot the shit out of them
Very interesting concept for a game and a great one
Game is alright bots randomly get stuck on stuff and will revive teamates in the middle of fighting but other than that not bad Buy on sale only if u have friends to play with as missions are 1hour+long a piece
I do not seem to understand I would like to say this games riddles my marbles First I'm enjoying busting up these STD infested strippers that sleep on the job to running across the map due to a fucking silly dance SlEePeRs LeT tHeM sNoOz fucking guy doesn't shut up after seeing every creature AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE GLOW STICK it like a 12 year olds glow in the dark birthday party up in here forgetabout it Oh yeah and my tiny food prints wake up these bitches but then a massive door the size of Harry Potters scar with a screaming midget THE BIOHAZARD SCAN IS COMPLETE does jack shit MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN SHOT OP SHOT OOOOOOOOOOOOP
GAME IS GARBAGE HARDER THAN MY ROCK COCK WHEN WATCHING ADULT CONTENT PLAYING WITH A TEAM OF 3 MAKES NO DIFFERENCE AND THE MISSIONS ARE STILL OVERLOADED WITH ENEMIES WITH NO HEALTH PACKS AROUND GLOWSTICKS GLOWSTICKS GLOWSTICKS ALL THE TIME."SLEEPERS LET THEM SLEEP FED UP OF THIS SCOTTISH BLOKE TRYING TO SOUND LIKE A BILBO BAGGINS ASS

Great and very challenging game
Developers have you cleared R8
Amazing co-op game with great visuals and graphics Verry immersive
It's always Bishop why is it always Bishop
Clunky unfinished game just boring repetitive with little to no QOL features Modded it and still couldnt even get 3 hours out of it maybe ill try it again later maybe ill forget it exists like most of my steam catalog
please turn off ur flashlight dipshit
Not bad i recomand that you play with friends it is more fun then
good
impressively cruel game edit genuinely the best co-op game ever made
fun game definitely a little hard if you're new but if you play with friends its alright
clenched my booty for a whole hour
great concept one of the better ones I've seen actually the only issue I've had is that the replay-ability gets a little stale in direct proportion to the number of times you need to die in a mission the missions are long the enemies spawn in scripted areas the weapons are all available to you theres nothing to really unlock and not really a reason to grind or play other than the enjoyment of the mechanic of spawning into the level with your friends BUT despite the flaws its definitely terrifying to play and well worth the investment if only to encourage the further development of similar titles
Great COOP horror fps Don't play with PROs coz they will smash everything for you and take the joy away play it with noobs dive into mechanics with them and Die a lot because in this game winning is not a goal struggle and dying is what its all about Don't read the guides find your own path It's not a competetive game so enjoy the atmosphere and sink in it 4 players is desirable to get full potential of this game Go on official game discord and find someone to play with if you don't have any friends you nerd So GTFO from this comment section and go play some Worth the money
Horrifying Yet the best multiplayer title I have come across in its category Be sure to have friends to play with you Communication is key to survival here If you are an always mute your mic type of person don't buy this game Check on Discord Official Server for more information and to find people to play with You're welcome
Only play if you are a massochist or if you have friends
Almost ninety hours in what are my thoughts Well the obvious is pretty clear I do recommend the game but with few things for you dear reader to think about before buying this is a 4 player game which you can play alone with bots too if you want it is going to be tough on you and will require you to have or develop a specific state of mind for the game Game is tough and it will give you an L without much hesitation if you FUBAR it you will need to approach it with different mind set which you develop as you play and adapt it for situation to situation This game will stress you with low light hostiles that are numerous have some variety to them communication is important skill to figure out what approach is the best resource management and good old aim and weapon control with a hint of experimentation of which weapons suit you best for certain maps This is all part of the experience of playing GTFO though if you are looking for all of these from a first person shooter then this is the game for you Do also understand that this is also a coop game no PvP here You can play the game alone if you want but it is recommended to play it with 3 other people so good communication is key microphone is a not a necessity but it is more or less better depending on people present of course Very few issues was encountered so far the only major one we ever encountered was our host suddenly developing a no floor syndrome and falling through the floor into the nothingness and that was only one time there probably is more small issues with the game I have encountered a few times a deloading of a room issue which has happened 3 or 4 times in total of all 86 hours And why the brit is saying a certain matters in opposite ways and to those who are reading this yes I know It is a solid FPS with hidden problem solving and pressure intense situations and I like it Well done 10 Chambers Nice Nice Nice Nice Nice I am SCOUT Three Three Three Three Sorry couldn't resist writing those
Hard to play without friends but the atmosfere is awesome
dont wake up the eepers
Even with Kaden helping me i can't gtfo so im fucked
The most stressful multiplayer game I've ever played even after they added checkpoints

It's interesting for the achievement but I don't like bot in this game sometime it good sometime he hasn't useful as capture point maybe you can edit for the bot about capture point and shoot the gun he has shoot me for a lot of time thank you for the game
good game other than my friends thinking its funny to kill me at extraction
i couldnt run it but i looked cool i guess
upd 24
A lot of rookie mistakes made by people who should have known better First off Impossible to play without a group Even with the addition of bots Some objectives require people to stay on the same spot and the bots will absolutely not cooperate Second whats the point of being a great composer if you're just going to have generic proceduraly generated music playing through your entire game Third A game that requires a group has absolutely no way of communicating with said group outside of a third party app discord Not even a way to find said group No server browser or any of the online features that have been an industry standard since the 90's That has been minimally rectified but we are still a long ways to go until we reach the features Unreal Tournament 1 had on release I could go on but I wont All of these signs do not bode well for their future game One can only hope they do not mess up again But then again they got bought by Tencent anyway so we know how that will go
crashs 8/10 of the time
Brutal game Must have friends to play with
Fun for the whole family

do not play this game
realy funny and spooky
good
Really fun Thats all
Don't open that door
FVck all the ancestors
I can honestly not recommend this game Its difficulty is artificial the stealth aspect isn't tense at all it's boring The gunplay is to be commended but at the same time the way you shoot leaves you open to be immensely inaccurate The developers have this weird relationship with the game where they are constantly working on new levels but seemingly haven't really done anything to take the experience to the next level Here's your gameplay loop Go to point A You cannot enter point A without getting Key A1 from point B Get Key A1 in point B You cannot get to point B without getting Key A2 from point C Get Key A2 from point C Now go to point B to get Key A1 Now go to point A Now ex-filtrate There must be ways to make this more exciting right I've played a few rundowns here and there and I cannot see any change or difference I'll be playing more and updating this if my mind changes but I also feel like I'm going to burn out before that point comes A great pro is that there's a somewhat active discord but the people on there are very hit or miss
MLP 6/10
Some of these levels were made by the leader of Germany from 1933 1945 and you shouldn't play them Otherwise its a good game

Depression in a nutshell
sleepers are cute
clearly designed for a party of four but the solo experience Managing resources and determining which rooms you need to clear is the crux of solo play As a result missions are decently replayable since the methodical approach to clearing rooms depends heavily on randomized resources enemy spawns and your melee skill The bots great but they actively get in the way like many other coop shooters You can clear most missions easily with bots though they seem to struggle with heavy gun-play and you obviously split up for separate objectives Honestly my main complaint is that the game seem to let you play solo without an internet connection Bugs The game can fail to launch or make lobbies sometimes I haven't identified if this is an issue with the game itself network or proton layer stuff yet Enemy animations can go a bit goofy Some maps have environment clipping Resource boxes can spawn in inaccessible places Occasionally the entire environment can get culled out for a second when going through doors which is a bit weird and jarring Bots often stand outside the warden exit scans Bots can phase through gooed closed doors which can ruin a run if it happens right before a full-team scan event had the game crash twice after completing a mission but I lose any progress or artifacts Clunk Some tools like glowsticks require a left-click charge to throw these inputs don't seem to get buffered and can be lost when swapping between weapons/tools The hacking tool can fail to unlock doors if you swap away from it after the last hacking input Commanding bots through the q menu is generally too slow to use mid-combat but I don't think there's a good fix for this as even a gesture wheel could be awkward Assuming 10 Chambers abandon this game and okay with methodical stealth into excellent gun-play this game is great
this game is like if ronald reagan distributed crack in the inner cities
Amazing game very challenging and awesome but wouldn't recommend for players who are looking for a casual experience i have failed hour long missions and died many times You also need friends for this game because the bots can only get you so far So overall awesome game if you don't have friends go to their discord
Fun and challenging Sometimes feels like bs but it's usually just a skill issue Not really that fun solo
is nice
the aliens are mean
eXCELENT
it's fun but jesus fucking christ it is hard
Payez 30e plus personne sur le jeu faut absolument 3 potes pour jouer sinon vous si vous avez des amis qui tiennent la route foncez sinon go next
One of the most fun intense and challenging game that I ever try I would recommend this game to everyone that like cooperative shooting game I like the horror atmosphere it's spooky Plus there is no microtransaction at all Thanks dev But beware this game is not for everyone because of the game difficulty It's not just hard this game was really hard And what I mean by really hard is you going to die and restart for a LOT of time There's almost no checkpoint system So if all your team die in a 1 hour more playthrough you need to restart from beginning this game actually have checkpoint system but it was very RARE I play for 20 hour and only found one checkpoint in the first mission lol So let's just pretend there isn't any checkpoint system Luckily in exchange for the high level of difficulty there is no time limit to help downed teammate So you can always help your downed teammate without having to worry that they will die This game really emphasizes cooperation You cannot solo this game GTFO have bot but we can't rely on them for most of the time So it will be better if you have one or two friend then fill the free slot with bot There's a matchmake system to find or joining random people but you need to wait for a while to find a free room most of the player in this game find a teammate from discord server I don't use discord so its quite hard to find other players So if you have friend that like to play games like this maybe you could ask them to play this game together first There's a lot weapon and tools that you can use in this game In other games usually we have favorite weapon or tools and always use it in every match Its not recommended to do that in this game You gonna need different weapons and tools to finish different mission Sometimes you need to fail first to know what weapon is best for the mission Just try some weapon until you know what is best for you Also the tutorial in this game was really shallow Lot of mechanics that didn't get explained at the tutorial So I highly recommend to see some beginners guide first at YouTube to understand more the basic things Last thing This game often got 44 discount at big sale event So if you want to try this game you can wait until this game have big discount again But if you already have the money just buy this game at full price This game very worth it even at the full price
If you want a thrilling challenge this is it

Extremely fun with friends
This game has some very solid mechanics tied together with the most abysmal game and level design decisions I've ever seen Security doors infectious fog and terminals in general all stand out as particularly baffling design choices and since every level is around an hour long you're really going to feel when every bad decision they made sends you all the way back to the beginning Weapon balancing is non-existent made worse by the ammo famine you're permanently experiencing which is unfortunate because the weapons sometimes do feel fun when you get the chance to use them Outside of that the visuals and audio design are very good and it is such a waste that the talent and effort that went into all of what you see and hear is at the service of the miserable disaster that serves as the gameplay Overall they are correct in saying that the game is challenging but what they leave out is that it's not for any reason that is fun or interesting to play through
Honestly this game is just bad and not fun at all I only tried playing it through the free weekend a year ago and it's completely trash not beginner friendly and not even worth playing Honestly I would say Empyrion is possibly worth the money than this game
hammer
Sucht kickt
I don't get what people like about this The game play is somehow clunky reloading is weird and doesn't always work the perspective FOV is off It just doesn't feel right walking around The terminal is confusing and typing help doesn't show list of commands Dies twice trying to complete tutorial It just doesn't feel polished like Killing FLoor 2 BF2142 WWZ 7DTD Deep Rock Galactic All of these feel right moving around reloading etc But this game just feels unfinished when it comes to these things It's not horrible but keeps taking away from being immersive Will have to play some more and get used to it Will update review then Initial impressions are not good though
difficult

10/10
really fun game to play
This is THE game of all time
1 10
get in the fun hole
Send nudes No Send dudes Playing alone sucks so you need friends or a veteran that will carry you through the levels This game is stress in a video game format with sneaking and shooting
if you like spending hours on one level just to lose all your progress and have to restart from the beginning then this is the game for you
maybe I don't have enough hours to judge the game properly but I can't find enjoyment in the game within the 2 hour mark its not for me The game itself looks good levels are well designed and give good atmosphere but the game play just inst fun for me The game is incredibly difficult me and my friend could not get past the first level and we were not going guns blazing mind you we went in a somewhat coordinated manner stealth killed most things I'll admit we'd screw up occasionally but we'd just get overrun in certain areas by the amount of enemies that would pile on top of us I don't understand why I'm having so much trouble on the first level If it was a more advanced mission sure I'd understand but you gotta let new players have a chance I wouldn't recommend this game unless you're a die-hard hardcore stealth kinda person
Whoever designed this game was a sadist and intellectually disabled The game is oppressively hard and completely inaccessible to most people The matchmaking system is embarrassingly pathetic so unless you can reliably play with friends or masochistically play by yourself you're never going to progress the game in any meaningful sense Also games can take hours and you can play for a whole hour just to die right before the finish line
friend got me this game so we could play together and it is such a fun game it is very very difficult and on the verge of impossible solo but if you got atleast one other person it is a blast
good game
boring as hell
FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK THERE EVREYWARE GODAMIT
joined a friend who was playing solo ended up killing us both he will never get that 2 hours back sorry
I unironicly started hearing things in the dark
good
The sadistic Warden puts your team through gruesome missions where there is only suffering Always short of ammo and health rushing is a certain death Darkness is your friend but you also learn to fear it Do you need to go everywhere or just do the minimum risk vs reward Your choice And down you go again prisoner Best with friends on comms Runs really smoothly and sounds top notch can really immerse yourself in the ambience being in a dark maze below

A Quiet Place The Game
Hard but good
It's a hard and fun mission based game that needs more than brute force It needs strategy stealth and most importantly conservation I recommend this game because it has a lot of different weapons and enemies that all require different strategies to defeat
we neeed teammates
should try nice game
It's an excellent game as long as you don't play by yourself The AI doesn't really help you at all in taking out monsters unless they are provoked making it exceptionally more difficult to stay hidden I also don't quite understand how their hearing works Sometimes you'll take out a sleeper right next to something Other times they hear it from unexpected distances All in all I like it Very difficult which is also another reason that makes this game not a good go to if you're looking to play alone It's not even scary AI need to be a bit more useful in staying undetected
Teamwork based game thats sorta scary Have to work together in order to Survive

10/10 Mi primera partida un ruso japones americano y yo 100%taco
Absolutely a must play with friends Incredible atmosphere and super challenging without being unfair game play It spikes your me and the boys against impossible odds dopamine receptor like no other game does
Fantastic game with an established group GTFO discord is a must otherwise
B O L L O C K S get ready Ingrained into my soul every time I mis-step on a pixel on a barrel alerting all sleepers the scout around the corner the big guy's ass I didn't see four inches ahead of me the IRS and the owners of WINRAR realising I still use the free version to my current location
good game
Great game Best to play with friends
Your friends made you get this and then stopped playing after a week
GTFO is an absolute blast The teamwork required is off the charts and the whole vibe is like a heart-pounding heist with your buddies The atmosphere is spooky as hell and the gunplay feels so satisfying It's like a rollercoaster of adrenaline and Oh crap we're surrounded moments If you're into cooperative shooters that keep you on the edge of your seat GTFO is a wild ride worth every second
gg
Fantastic game Great FPS but teamwork is critical Bots work well so easy enough to play with 2
Killing Floor REFUND
i can stab things and then die for not having friends
Overall its a good game but its a challenge it's not your everyday monster/zombie shooter Sometimes you need to be tactical and avoid the fight because every encounter could be your last however coming out victorious feels great and well earned when it happens Definitely be on your A game for this one I also got love tapped by a monsters ball sack so would definitely recommend
Play this if you hate yourself
Recomiendo jugar las primeras partidas de este juego luego se vuelve muy repetitivo Tiene buena con escenarios claustrofobicos que aumentan la experiencia de terror Sin embargo tras unas misiones el juego se vuelve muy repetitivo ir a tal sitio apretar tal ir a tal computadora defender una zona uno que otro monstruo jefe Hay misiones entretenidas y otras muy tediosas como lootear toda la base

Spanendes und herausforderndes CoopSpiel macht alleine auch geht aber nur bedingt in den Levels mit Bots fetzt am meisten mit 3-4 menschlichen Mitspielern

GTFO is an exhilarating and challenging co-op shooter that delivers intense gameplay and heart-pounding thrills with every step Set in a dystopian underground complex overrun by terrifying creatures this game plunges players into a desperate fight for survival that will test their teamwork communication and nerves of steel One of the defining features of GTFO is its relentless difficulty Every mission is a brutal gauntlet of danger and tension where one wrong move can spell disaster for you and your team From hordes of relentless enemies to complex puzzles and traps there's never a dull moment in GTFO Success requires careful planning coordination and precise execution making victory all the sweeter when you finally emerge triumphant Despite its punishing difficulty GTFO is incredibly rewarding to play The sense of accomplishment that comes from overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds with your teammates is unmatched creating moments of pure adrenaline-fueled excitement that will keep you coming back for more However it's worth noting that GTFO is not a game for the faint of heart Sessions can last for hours at a time and the steep learning curve means that progress may come slowly at first Patience and perseverance are essential virtues for surviving in the unforgiving world of GTFO but for those willing to rise to the challenge the rewards are well worth the effort Visually GTFO is a masterclass in atmospheric design The dark and foreboding corridors of the complex are filled with eerie lighting and haunting sound design creating an atmosphere of constant dread and tension The creatures that lurk in the shadows are grotesque and terrifying adding to the sense of unease and danger that permeates every moment of gameplay In conclusion GTFO is a must-play for fans of challenging co-op experiences Its relentless difficulty thrilling gameplay and atmospheric world design come together to create an experience that is as terrifying as it is exhilarating Whether you're facing down waves of enemies or unraveling the mysteries of the complex GTFO is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end
I am so frustrated about this game The game mechanics is really cool but the problem is there is no save system and you have to be ready to play a few hours straight to beat the single mission If you have to leave you have electricity or internet cut off the game crashes and you realizes you just completely wasted a few hours you will not get any reward for that Moreover these guys did not manage to develop an Alt-Tab support Any time you Alt-Tab or press Windows key or receive some popup the game crashes I mean this is something everybody managed to handle like 20 years ago Also the game heavily influences your background applications so they are starting freezing and lagging especially Chrome I am writing this review because I was playing a mission for like 2 hours and then 5 minutes ago the game crashed because one of my Chrome extension crashed and showed a popup which never happened before And I lose all the progress It happened to me a few times I tried I really tried but this is game is just a piece of crap This is a good example why modern graphic engines will not help when developers are a bunch of deletants who cannot release a simple save-load system or handle Alt-Tab issues It's just a shame to see this in 2024
A little hard but looks good
Pretty good but the matchmaking system is so stupid that whoever came up with it needs to be fired and never ever hired anywhere again

Definitely one of my top 5 PC games even though my friends and I suck at it
this is one of the best yet hardest games i have every played Gtfo is truly a adventure just a hard one the game play loop can be repetitive but different enemy spawns can make you feel refreshed each rundown The graphics are top notch and the environments can wither be gritty or beautiful you will need friends for this game an the ai can be stupid but it is a one of a kind experience

Amigo tremendo juego Definitivamente no es uno que se pueda jugar solo al menos no despues de los primeros niveles quienes sean profesionales en el asunto y si pero realmente esta categoria de dificultad el del rollo trabajo en equipo colaborativo y de mucha coordinacion Las se pueden casi como palpar el juego te sumerge en la realidad de su mundo muy La ambientacion la iluminacion los sonidos todo muy bien logrado Es ademas un juego con una curva de aprendizaje alta a mi parecer De mucho ensayo y error de frustraciones y tal saludos

my favorite game to die in
It's what Rainbow 6 extraction should've been Make sure you play with friends though the bots you can play with are inferior in all ways the game doesn't scale with player count and online match making is apparently broken though I've never tried it for myself Probably not worth the full 40 but when I got it it was 44 off so maybe they do major sales often Good game regardless The guns are satisfying to shoot the environment is genuinely creepy at times and there is a lot of content I do wish there was more progression and not just in terms of cosmetics and boosters temporary upgrades to your health regen ammo melee resistance etc Maybe if you started with only a couple of the guns and got them as you unlocked more levels or maybe introduce a xp based leveling system
10 10
Hard game but even if you lose its a lot of fun Not recommended if you dont play as a 4 Stack
I like challenging games but if you die at the end of the level you have to re-do the whole level And the level designs are too boring too do it more than twice Lost its fascination really fast for me
Games actually impossible I will indeed GTFO
OMFG I CANT FUCKING DO SHIT WHERE DO I FIND FRIENDS WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
one of very few games where you're on even odds with the enemies tho if your friends are retarded not so even
Great game All I need is more friends
h1 GTFO Get The F U Cking Out b]WORK TOGETHER OR DIE TOGETHER[/b 4
gawd damn this game is so good you gotta use the discord for lobbies though
this game is very good i love playing it play style is amazing i love that stealth until you have to go guns blazing i wish the game had a little bit of story explain why we are doing what we are doing but it still a great game with out I'll give it a solid 8.7 out of a 10 room for improvement but i absolutely love the game
If you want a long engaging and hard but not to the point you wanna quit immediately game to play this is a must buy especially with friends Highly and I mean HIGHLY recommended playing with friends as it punishes your team for not planning things thoroughly It's a very slow burn that after you complete your very first long mission you'll want to play the next one immediately because of how rewarding it is It's really a hidden gem of a game and I'm surprised that I haven't played this sooner
2h misje OP
mute button yeah this is the mut
7/10
This is the very best co-op strategy shooter ever dont play it
Nice
This is cinema
12/10 would GTFO again
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark than walk alone in the light
The best and worst time with your friends I would recommend this to reveal your friends tendencies
Still needs a lot of work and developers have moved on
I didn't listen to the game and failed to GTFO
Refunding The game has great potential and I love the teamwork it forces but I guess it's just not for me I played with a group of 3 and we really tried to enjoy it but it's simply too hard I think it needs a better balance of stealth to gunfights The amount of ammo you get is enough for a single encounter and the turrets are useless Might revisit after some updates
Really fun game to play with the boys especially in a really dark room
i g'd t f o D
Great game played it during one of those free weekends and it was the only game I played for that weekend.Personally would recommend if you enjoy games where you die and learn
So hard to play but it's fun

STUPID MATCHMAKING UR MOM FK
Perfectly executed ambiance tension lighting and the stress you can get from audio queues is spot on however MUST be played in a full squad of four for the full experience
good game not to easy a little bit of a challenge
Fun and spooky
One of the best co-op games out there automatically just for its unique formula of shooting stealth and strategy Tons of maps to do a nice balanced selection of weapons that are all viable and a pulse-pounding rush of adrenaline and dread that you won't find anywhere else The atmosphere and feel of the game are as immersive as it gets Only thing I can say against the game is the matchmaking is pretty much dead so either have friends or get on the Discord
h1]GTFO![/h1
Work together or die
makes my bones hurt good
Uh I actually don't have much to report on this game cause this game can't run on my windows xp dinosaur of a toaster computer literally built out of cardboard off of a homeless mans home with hints of crack in the motherboard Just by watching Markiplier play this game it looks pretty good ngl kinda sucks when it runs at 12 fps on my microwave I should probably upgrade to an air fryer by now but you know I can't afford that much right now I just got fired from my job my wife took the kids I probably should GTFO of this forsaken city
Awesome game
BOOOORRRINGGGGGG
Harder than the hills of Calabasas
Good game to play with friends Not enough co-op games these days so its a happy addition to my library
fun
When you have that friend who flashes the monsters every few seconds you realize you have one less friend
I dig this game the very little Ive played Little play because don't know a soul who owns it and Im not one to play public servers with randoms So yeah I need friends to play this with Meh
fun although takes a fuck ton of time
Good Game
I love this game
Doom but youre not doomguy
Dis Gud Game
Very fun horror co-op game
bots are biggest issue for me wish you could get them to stealth kill and to not shoot if you have your melee weapon out other that i have had a ton of fun on this game
Got to level 4 and it's too hard for me 3
Shhhh Sleepers don't wake them
This is one solid game that I would recommend to all my friends that I know the sheer game play is amazing and its graphics are phenomenal in short term I love this game to pieces 3
the scout is extremely breedable
It's terminal
takes 9 hours to finish one mission would do it again in a heartbeat Place sentry here Place sentry here Place sentry here Place sentry here Place sentry here Place sentry here Put foam here Big guy coming Big guy coming EXPEDITION FAILED
one of the best pve fps games i played in a while and is amazing with a group of friends but i must say this is one of the harder games out there but it aint as hard as trying to convince 3 people to play the same level for the 8th time instead of going to bed
really cool parkour game it even has a mechanic where you get a heart attack for jumping too much
fantastic PVE game with TONS of content while it may be missing some MAJOR quality of life elements and basic lobby management abilities its a very solid game where your getting tons of excellent PVE content for the price overall the player poulation is extremely low and the plays you can encounter on the discord are super toxic and hateful players Overall 9/10 game you just need at least 1 friend the play the game with to get the most out of it like most games
Great game to play with friends would HIGHLY recommend
scary nearly shit
Shh we got sleepers here I NEED disinfection I NEED disinfection No I NEED disinfection No I NEED disinfection I NEED disinfection No I love spamming quick comms menus
This game is harder than me around that one friend Fun to play with friends if you're mentally prepared for hours of torture

People are boring
fun
This is either not my kind of game or a really bad excuse for a game The game is hard which isn't really enough to turn me off but the gameplay and how weird the AI acted during my playtime completely turned me off from ever considering this game
Wonderfully made game If you are worried that you don't have friends that want to play with you fear not The GTFO Discord server is so dedicated 77k users that it is easier to join or host a lobby and group up with others there than the actual in-game matchmaking With this in mind the player base is also older and more mature which is an added bonus Highly recommend
not enough people know about this game it's so good
I had a bit of trouble GTFO but i managed my ass got eaten by monsters on multiple occations
its a nice balance between stealth and shooter
Great game very challenging but brutally unforgiving Not for the easily dissuaded I've played the first two runs and it's fun with friends but the lack of any progression mechanics like upgrades or gear makes losing a run which are pretty long by the way feel like a huge waste of time and effort If you complete a run you might unlock a shirt or something plus maybe some very scarce and sometimes useless single-use buffs If you aren't 100 enjoying the gameplay there is nothing there to hook you in I am enjoying it though for how much longer I don't know I'm hoping new enemies and mechanics in the later runs will keep us going But we'll see
only buy if ur friends agree to keep playing played up to r1 b2 then everyone stopped

Super immersive you ACTUALLY need to be with people you can trust WITH YOUR LIFE Communicate work together OR DIE You ACTUALLY want to GET THE F**K OUT This is a incredible experience hard but rewarding
Lots of excitement you do need friends though

fun hard the best way
heart attack simulator you WILL lose friends play with at LEAST 3 people or get buttfucked in the easy missions
Own a scattergun for cryopod defense since that's what the WARDEN intended Four sleepers break into the room What the devil As I grab my gas mask and rifle Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first sleeper it's dead on the spot Draw my Shelling on the second sleeper miss it entirely because it's smoothbore and obliterates my teammate's skull I have to resort to the shotgun sentry mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot Tally ho lads the grape shot shreds two sleepers in the blast the sound and extra shrapnel set off the scout in the other room Grap hammer and charge the last terrified rapscallion It bleeds out waiting on the scout wave to arrive since the hammer opened it's skull in half just as the WARDEN intended
Hard but fair game really incentivises teamwork stealth and learning how to use the terminal You can play single player but it's going to be a lot slower since the bots don't stealth kill anyone
Great game to play with friends Truly tests your coordination
To hard need weemod just to play it

The fog is no longer coming it is here
yes very good very nice
Good game
GTFO
ITS HARD Play with at least one friend and dash some VR mod into the mix and you're gunna have a good time just make sure to apply my control scheme Pro tip learn the knife and squat to slide to save stamina whilst sprinting lol then the game can become quite a decent VR workout too
spaghetti man
the most optimized experience is playing alone it is much harder with people
I've never gotten past the second level but I'm pretty sure it's a good game
my friends troll me
fire
Very fun
I recently started playing GTFO and am thoroughly impressed with the game and its community I was apprehensive to purchase this game because of its co-op mechanics but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the community is incredibly helpful and friendly
I do in fact meet the recommended computer requirements and exceed them in some cases and even with this the game itself seems to have issues Perhaps server connectivity maybe something else Lagging freezing and even crashing is incredibly common for most people Sometimes you'll crash multiple times in a row sometimes you'll have incredibly smooth gameplay for hours upon hours That being said with other games this almost entirely ruins the experience In the case of GTFO the game otherwise is so goddamn good that I really just could not care less You could lose one and a half hours of gameplay and progress because you suddenly crashed and you will be just as excited to load it back up again The atmosphere is incredibly consistent where you're constantly on guard Even when you logically know there's no current threat instinctively you're still wary of waking up the sleepers There's not an absurd amount of weaponry to use but still a large number to use and specialize in You're constantly reminded of what weaknesses you have and have to shore them up or be prepared for them The game is incredibly fun
Peak game but my friends and I are complete idiots and cannot work together
Spooky
I love this game its great but the matchmaking is annoying though as you can almost never find a match
Not sexy

I like it D
the more retarded your friends are the harder this game gets otherwise its a very relaxing game

game good game scary I wish my dad would stop putting cigarettes out on my arm
le jeu est vraiment sympa mais trop simple l'image qu'il je n'ai fait que la rundown
Not sure when they removed that annoying film grain effect but now this game is so much better
Do not buy this game if you own a steam deck it broke after a last update which means it is not playable Edit older runs seem to work ok and game is fun but devs said that they dont want you to play older runs on thier server which is kinda still bad like bruh fix optimization first maybe and then try to implement new lore cuz this game is awful in term of fps
Deep rock Galactic Silent hill
when u wanna exit the game it asks GTFO and Quit so i give thumbs up to this work of art
You can't press V to yell ROCK AND STONE but other than that its good
GTFO est un excellent jeu de Le gunplay est vraiment excellent et satisfaisant et l'ambiance est vraiment Les phases de sont intenses et vont vous tenir en tout du long alors que les alarmes/phase de viendront vous brusquer et mettre mal votre organisation AVANT DE JOUER des ami(e)s et car le jeu ne pardonne pas Il est exigeant et va vous demander une concentration et un sang froid constant
Play this game if your a masochist and have friends Spend 3 hours before losing all progress whilst your friends scream as they are chased by hundreds of plebs 10/10
Not a cakewalk Takes coordination and deliberate teamwork
This game is actually awesome if you get past the steep learning curve I found that it is Visually impressive Full immersion while playing Allows for down time to go poop Great alone and probably even better with friends Excellent level design Challenging yet fair enemies Insainly good gunplay and weapon variety Best co-op experience I've had so far 10/10
pretty good game very scary anyways Ingredients 5 cups cooked macaroni approx 4 cups uncooked 1 stick butter 1 cup bread crumbs 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp pepper 1tbls sugar One minced fresh garlic clove 2 cups milk 1 8 oz package Colby Monterey Jack cheese 4 cups shredded cheddar cheese Cook the macaroni until done as usual Add sugar and garlic to water.Do not overcook it Drain macaroni in strainer Place macaroni butter salt pepper milk Colby/jack cheese and 3 cups of cheddar cheese in a pot boil slow add bread crumbs Cover everything with aluminum foil and cook for 45 minutes at 350 degrees Uncover and add extra cup of cheddar cheese across the top Bake uncovered for another 15 minutes

SHHHHHHHH DON'T WAKE THEM
So look bud If you have a job girlfriend or a mother you will lose all of them before you beat the first rundown Just remember to do your taxes once a year
An amazingly difficult game Need 3 other friends to play this though as I would imagine you never make real progression with randoms
Hard but I like the fact you need to cooperate to play
Can sometimes be beyond scary when it comes to specific tasks I had nearly s**t my pants while playing Recommended
Just finished my first game with a friend The communication and teamwork you get out of that adds so much to this game The game having an attached Discord is huge for finding people I'm sure Safe to say I'll be putting in some more hours into this one VERY suspenseful LOTS of strategy and VERY FUN
Give us official native VR support or GTFO I'd buy a VR support DLC for 20 There is a VR MOD for this game but they delete your post If you talk about it in the Steam Community Forums because the DEVS don't want to support it Clearly VR works for the game DEVS should just hire the MOD team already to help them integrate VR into their game natively VR functions well and as a concept it meshes with GTFOs atmosphere and FPS stealth team gameplay The VR MOD is a lot of fun but it's a PITA to have to wait for the MOD to be updated every time a new rundown drops and more of a PITA to have to set up the MOD all over DEVS could just be nice The VR MOD has been out for years now and there is no reason no to support it pancake gaming is dead to me Negative review will stay until DEVs stop being stupid an add native VR support
good and GTFO

tbh really well surprised I'm not scared easily but the first games thanks God I was playing with a friend Positive points The strongest point of the game is definitely the atmosphere The music the feeling of vulnerability through the scarcity of the resources the stress of putting commands in the terminal in time just wow Every mission is a investigation as you don't know exactly where to go and you have to figure it out by looking for information mainly in terminals through commands Lethal company stole this idea 100 and it's much better in this game as you can have access to lore or special commands depending which terminal you are on The gameplay feels great as it is refreshing to see a coop-game with stealth mechanics that are enjoyable the fighting is pleasant too and the weapon gamefeel is great What I enjoyed is also that the game encourages a lot teamwork in order to survive sharing resources terminal mechanics which leads to qualitative communication between players Community when we started the game with my friend we got onboarded by two gentle souls that really helped us to get the game basics so as far as I know there are few players but they are really nice You also have access to the whole gear from the beginning of the game which is really welcomed the only things that you unlock are skins So better get to work for this sweat gaz mask that won't change anything to your game experience beside jokes in the lobby Improvement side the weapons would need some more balancing as there is clearly some weapons are completely useless and some others that have no real weaknesses Some mechanics of the game are also frustrating the infection system maybe we figure out how to deal with it yet and the fact that some missions are going smoothy until the last zone where you get an insanely challenging wave of enemies where you get swarmed Sarah Kerrigan style Conclusion great challenging horror game especially with friends
fun scary will test your patience Teamwork is a must to survive Better with friends tbh

Very nice but you cant be silly goofy ever
sat down to play with friends completed 2 missions 4 hours passed 10/10 would friendly fire again
Sadly no one plays anymore or at least that was the case for me since this is a co-op required game it was sad when I couldn't play it with anyone but bots This game is great but with there being no players to play with I wouldn't recommend buying unless it's with friends
threw my computer out the window cuz i missed 5 shots and failed my 2 hour expedition would greatly recommend
I shit myself
yea
3 2 1 BONKKKK
very fun with friends i found bots to be fine just a lil boring overall 8/10
the monsters are nakey P
500 hours on this game and I frankly can't stand it anymore I started playing it around R6 It was honestly pretty great for the first 200 hours good atmosphere decent challenge situations felt a bit unique each level But when ALT//R4 released it started yo become extremly tedious Even though I only have like 9 expeditions to complete I won't I'm done it's borderline a joke game design wise the stealth has been the exact same since day 1 there is only 1 battle theme and the game is heavily bugged you often just fail because the game is completely broken and you get soft locked Combine that with the ABSOLUTE WORST community manager that I ever encountered and you have why I became tired of investing time into this half baked game So much wasted potential in the end this game is a rehash fest where you'll do the same boring thing over and over fighting the same ennemies over and over dealing with the same prehistoric AI and pathfinding Would not recommend
if you are in south east asia dont buy the game there's no players I have bought the game tried to find players for 2 days then refund the game

Amazing game The risk reward is perfectly done and the ENTIRE game is immersive Even down to the way the hud moves and curves the whole game feels like 1 thing The immersion is literally next level My ONLY complaint is some of the balancing of the weapons there are CLEAR good and bad weapons Also you need some friends to fully experience it
If you're going to get this game then you need 3 other friends to play it with Why is that because there's basically no one playing the damn game making getting a game with randoms impossible and playing Solo is like pulling teeth because the Bots you get matched with are next to useless on terms of surviving defending pathing target prio or really doing anything that a player would do meaning if you're playing solo you're just done for Edit if you do really want to try it solo then expect the bots to just phase through solid doors walk to the start of level realise there's no path to you then become statue Why is this because they are incapable of opening doors or doing anything besides just being a useless walking turret Got filtered because I like playing games solo so gg wp
your screen will glitch out some times and you cant see whats going on or barely see whats going on
Really good fun game where we work together and there's a lot of content to play through it's just the beginning
dripping with thick atmosthere dastard game throws so many unexpected curveballs at you throughout missions i love when a crafted plan to survive an alarm goes perfectly i love the mad scramble to get to a safer position mid wave when things go wrong getting to that one security scan thats out of the way through a cluster of big guys the relief that fades away when you survive a tough bioscan but realizing you have no more ammo and you have to scavenge the next zone full of scouts the dread of having to hold out in a room full of fog simply gorgeous
You need around 4 fully developed brains for this one but damn it's good If you're good at midnight snacking without turning the lights on this is the game for you You're dropped deep down into a mining complex full of zombies that that hate light and sounds the goal to fulfill the objective and extract alive sounds easy huh So here's the thing You have up to 3 mates with you and your combined ammunition is around 2,5 mags but remember what happens when you pull the trigger on any gun A loud bang and a flash remember what the natives here hate Yup better get those 17 bullets ready you have around 40 enemies to kill with them so good luck The game loop is sneaking around in the dark with your melee weapon of choice and trying to take out enemies one by one sometimes it's not possible so you need to coordinate and synchronize attacks with other teammates On the way you try to manage the very limited resources of your team and kill whatever monstrosity the game throws at you until you arrive at the objective later in the game it gets even harder from there on It's the kind of game that will make you question whether if you've just doomed your entire 2,5h run by emptying that one clip That's why some people love it and that's also why some people hate it

A hoot of a time and an awesome way to pass the time with my bro Game gets tense quick and teamwork/coordination is astronomically fun even if it can be a little stress-inducing lol Highly recommend if you're fine with sinking a little more than an hour into each mission 40 bucks well spent
GTFO is a gritty and hardcore horror stealth shooter game that pits you and up to 3 friends against overwhelming odds where tactical thinking and teamwork are crucial You must work together to conserve ammo and decide when a fight is actually worth attempting A brutal unforgiving and ultra-realistic simulation of Miami Florida at 3 AM if you have 3 friends who can set aside at least 1 hour a night to bust out a mission or two and you love a good challenge this game is perfect for you
COOL
Try not to loose your friends challenge impossible
is good
The game has a solid base in terms of design and gameplay its not bad the matchmaking system is straight up garbage And worse then that player hosted servers and lobby's make the game almost unplayable and makes genuine fun very hard to come across nothing short of dedicated servers and a complete matchmaking overhaul will make this game recommendable to anyone
Difficult but fun

I think overall the game is just okay Initially I really enjoyed the game it was really unique and had a huge learning curve from any other games I normally play Though the problem I had was that I got burnt out too quickly on this game There is such a lack of variety with the enemies that you encounter that it begins to slowly feel more repetitive to me It no longer becomes a task of being too hard but just how much time and tedious effort I need to go through to accomplish a mission When playing initially as well the maps were generally stagnant and not too different from each other but thankfully doesn't stay that way with different extraction points Overall I do think the game needs a lot more to be more consistently fun But if you're in the mood for something serious that relies on a decent bit of coordination this game fits that bill
Very fun Co-op Horror game

I played this game during it's beta With it's 1.0 I feel the game has gotten much better I'd highly recommend people giving the game another shot if they haven't played in a while try jumping around to different rundowns The only problem I have with the game is the Ai teammates are pretty dumb So a much better game if you have a group of 4 friends to play
this game is fucking sick yo
Guter Ansatz aber keine Langzeitmotivation mich Alle Waffen etc sind bereits freigeschaltet was zum Ausprobieren aber die Missionen motivieren einfach nicht Schade
sucks boring waist of money
Gods be damned if I did not scream my lungs out trying to figure out how to play this game Especially with friends who are equally as dumb as you are Oh dear gods I MISSCLICKED Also during that free weekend

Un jeu difficile au moment ce commentaire mon et moi en sommes mission de la campagne en 62h Le jeu est exigeant pas de mode facile pour passer les niveaux Il arrive me surprendre et me faire sursauter son ambiance ses ennemis qui parfois discrets ou au contraire bruyants et agressifs Les niveaux sont de l'infiltration du combat des ou des missions de recherche tout est DIFFICILE Un vrai qui prend toute sa saveur avec une d'amis le jeu se joue 4 un chat vocal est dispo pour jouer avec des inconnus ou d'avoir des bots dans son Je le recommande pour ceux qui recherchent une coop fun satisfaisante mais constituant un Ce jeu n'est PAS un fast FPS les ennemis sont plus forts que vous vous avez peu de munitions et chaque balle compte recharger est dangereux en combat et la plupart des ennemis sont capables d'attaquer distance et bon dieu qu'ils visent bien Je ne le conseille pas si vous chercher seulement un

I have around 47 hours on this game I've spend 45 of those hours playing it solo And I loved it Did I die a lot hell yes but it was worth it What I like The atmosphere is top-notch Level design is very well executed Weapons Monsters they are terrifying Story Sound design What I don't like The best experience is playing this game with friends Very hard at times DARK Can't see HIT at times If you can gather a group of four friends this game is blast If you want to go solo you can do that as well Just remember patients is you friend And BOTs with turrets

Tremendo mi juego de squad de tarde favorito
im so scared my balls are not present
i love flashing my light for one second and see 30 sleepers all ready to anal probe me
I really love the guns they feel so good and meaty
I wanted to love this game but I just cant Scavenging for supplies sneaking around to avoid or most of the time kill the monsters and the environment feels great tutorial explains everything a newbie should know and do all the time But matchmaking sucks and I hate that I have to use a 3rd party system aka discord to find people to play with Matchmaking barely works the wait time is annoying too and if you find people for whatever reason they leave and you have to press the matchmaking button again Also there are some bugs like people seeing a black screen or not able to see one of your teammates The general idea of the game is great but since matchmaking doesnt work its a frustrating experience I hope they will do something about it as well fix the bugs
A game that will actually make you feel like a rookie with friends
Esse jogo vai te fuder vai fuder seus amigos vai foder tudo Po comprar

Only played for 2 hours haven't beaten the first level Solution Just get good or have friends to carry you but lets be real and not kid ourselves
Boring and hard

This place is a fucking prison and I love pain play this game if you're a masochist 10 out of Onion would highly recommend

Love restarting the same level 5 times
Great game i suck at it
Very challenging and fun Played most of the game with 2 players and 2 bots and have cleared many D tier missions Would probably be easier and more fun with more players over bots but not impossible to have fun with only 2 players if you are up to the challenge
its kinda good
Epic saus
oh my god this game i got this game when it was free for 3 days and i immediately fell in love with it while i havent actually bought the game yet i highly suggest buying this game i love fps games and ive been trying to get myself into horror things and this game has just the right amount of fps and horror in my opinion guns in a horror game makes the game less scary but this game gives me the right amount of thrill as i play it i love the graphics and the gun mechanics in this game highly highly reccomend
This game taught me to stab people who snore
yes fun very hard
Very samey gameplay camp a room clear it out type in a command go to the next room with very little variation and unintuitive UI
quiet like a cat hunting its prey
This game is very tough but fair Make sure to read the wiki so you can properly set up your load outs accordingly use the boosters required for those missions as well This game helps you develop your critical thinking and you will find new ways to avoid enemies and destroy others you might want to know how tough it is this game lets you decide how hard it can be by letting you go in guns blazing with little ammo and waking all enemies on map via scout's or letting you have a slow but methodical approach and take everything out with your trusty melee This game isn't for all and some boss fights are agonizing some enemies are insane but overall great game great fun and work together or die together is no understatement
Yes
The biggest reward about playing this game is the friends you made along the way
Soy un padre de 50 probablemente una de las personas viejas que juegan este juego Soy padre soltero de mi hijo que ahora tiene 14 Mi hijo recientemente GTFO y en menos de una semana ya jugado durante de 20 horas Esto fue terrible para ya que ya era bastante para pasar tiempo con mi hijo ya que siempre sale con sus amigos o simplemente mira videos en Tiktok que crear una cuenta de Steam y comprar este juego para ver si jugar junto a el juego hice el tutorial pero estaba atascado en lo que se que hacer Le ayuda a mi hijo y un juego para que yo me uniera Me porque era el mejor momento que pasado con mi hijo desde que mi esposa muerto Desde entonces este juego ha acercado a mi hijo y a nuevamente y ahora pasamos tiempo juntos fuera de la casa Este juego me que hay en todo y nos ha tanto a como a mi hijo muchos recuerdos felices
its very fun and the for the best experience is with friends its very skill based and also slightly luck based however that doesnt stop the game from being incredibly fun
This is a bit of a harsh no as the game looks great and playing with friends we really got into the vibe of it Very gritty with a Oh hit we've awoken the horde feeling However we have stopped playing very early as there is no permanent character upgrade It's got a sort of Tarkov element where you can take what is a slight power up into a map and it lasts once or twice then poof it's gone I don't know why they are trying to be this hardcore for you it may work for us it did not We want to have more fun in this game then sweat every level and for this we need permanent character upgrades Make us harder so we can do deeper is that what she said but yeah running the top levels over and over again because you learn the layout just to farm a 1 or 2 use item just ain't doing it for us Finishing a map should be more rewarding Simples
Really amazing game It's a must game if you have friends to play with The missions and game style is designed for you to stay hooked for a long time
this game makes me wet my pants
its shit and im gay too
fell asleep all 15 hours i played
bom demais pra se estressar junto com os migos y
Loved it when I played it for free Gameplay mechanicd graphics and story are solid One thing though it's HARD
I wish i had friends to play with just with bots is enought tho
Amazing A
its a great spine chilling coop game very few games can make me feel afraid like this can
bueno pero necesitas un grupo de amigos para jugar bien
i combust every time i see a charger scout
GTFO is alright Nothing too good about it or too bad about it Kinda mediocre but a game to play if you're bored regardless
The game is dead and the only way to matchmake is to go on the discord server However do expect to only meet the same people there all the time Then ofcourse the mods are not professional and just hand out time outs/bans without explanation Just a referral to the rules and no specification of what exactly you did wrong Then after a ban of 3 hours the ban is still not lifted after half a day Mods do not reply Nobody cares Jokesters The game itself is repetitive and all the levels get re-used Multiple times all across the various rundowns Also not a game goes by without some kind of bug or mishap that leaves you unable to proceed and lose all your progress
game gud
hard but funnni
GTFO Payday GTFO GTFO GTFO D GTFO STEAMPAY 3
sympa
Cool concept but the actual gameplay loop sucks You can pretend stealth for a few minutes but eventually you'll have to bunker down and fight fast moving enemies in strobing lights and no ammo
This game is BORING
One of a kind experience I am not joking when I say that I've made friends out of strangers just playing this game When the game puts so much pressure on the players from beginning to end it's near impossible not to develop a sense of camaraderie with your fellow prisoners I dare anybody who reads this to pick up the game find a solid squad to play with it can be friends or strangers and try to get through the whole game on their own merits You won't forget this experience I promise that
Kinda hard game if u play with randoms I also prefer to play with bots then friends sorry Zub
Jeu difficile mais pas impossible Pour une mise en main il est de ne pas y jouer seul sinon vous serez vite Il ne faut pas se si on arrive pas effectuer la mission plusieurs essais L'important est de se coordonner des et de TK sauf Bishop Une histoire est travers missions et ce que l'on appelle les logs Quelques bugs qui peuvent parfois la progression de la mission exemple le terminal devient inutilisable je recommande fortement ce jeu
would recommend if you have friend or actively looking for friend or else you will cry down there alone

Suffer as I have
If you have 4 players this is easily the best 4 play coop there is
This game gets a very strong recommend from me with the follow 2 caveats 1 You almost NEED at least one human friend who'll play this with you 2 You WILL fail and you need to accept it Its okay You'll git gud
like lfd but horror and much slower gameplay well done

One of the most tactical 4 player coop game out there Communication can make or break each run High skill ceiling with many guns Plenty of weapon choice and combinations With all the rundowns available at once a great cohesive experience of a tactical shooter with plenty of depth and plenty of lore
This game scares the living sunshine out of me and causes adrenaline run through my veins as I play If you like to be anxious then this game is a must-play Good Game Tons of fun The environments are stunning A lot of fun if you've got friends

A great game and very hard You really need 3 other friends to make it work Any less than a 4 stack and you don't stand a chance so you might as well not play I often want to play this though I rarely have 3 other friends keen to And if you have 4 other friends who are keen to well one has to sit out or you go and play another game These conditions are so rarely met so despitye this game being good it never gets a play I would recommend this if you have a group of committed friends who want to play this through with you Them knowing that it will be very hard Otherwise this game will sit in your Steam library collecting dust

Game good I shit my britches
took me and a buddy 8 hours to complete the first mission because he was obsessed with trying to melee every single enemy to death and complained that we were taking too long great game do recommend
I dont really know how the Servers work but i had frequent desynch issues Enemies not reacting to DMG Doors not opening or are already open but only for my teammates same thing with resup lockers and cases Host cant even start the game Staying behind in the pod and being stuck there The game itself is promising but the severe server issues just ultimately destroys the fun Update Just had a new bug where you cant use E to place a Sentry or to loot Because of this me and my friend died apparently this bug is well known but still to this day has not been fixed
love it 10/10 go ahead and play it

Nothing about this game is easy from the beginning If you're the kind of gamer that plays a game for the atmosphere and the challenge then this game has gotta be up there The sound design is amazing the music is tense the guns can be difficult to handle and resources can run low if you don't pay attention Even when I fail levels I'm left with what I could have done better and what I need to do next time The only thing that you can do in most levels to help yourself get past them with any consistency is improve yourself which means when you finally get over that hurdle and beat the difficult level you were stuck on you get a rush of relief and joy After the 1.0 update every rundown is now playable so you can at least jump around if the levels start getting too difficult so you can get your reps in the Complex somewhere else
Need a way to set it straight Need to go out on the edge Need to rage and get revenge Need to feel myself again Suit up punch in punch out non stop Suit up punch in punch out get fucked
ah contrary to most video games the bigger gun is actually not the strong one u really want to get the pistol GTFO incorporated is pretty woke for flipping gender norms around very good
From how little I played this game in the free demo I had I can say that this game is incredible even with its high difficulty at certain times I had a lot of fun with my friends If you want something challenging and strategic to have fun with your friends I recommend you buy this game
It's truly a relaxing game Keeps my blood rate down good for chill evenings with the boys 10/10
sometimes i think of the challenges that the devs add to these really hard levels and just think why why are you this sadistic no please stop R2E1 we thought we were entering a boss fight well Surge alarms are the boss fight o7 boys
Guys I don't know about you but I think we should get the frick outta here ya know what I'm sayin

Lots of people will tell you about this game All of them are wrong This is not a horror nor a stealth game Nor is it hard It is an aim trainer disguised as a game The main goal here is to equip hel revolver and count how many headshots in a row you can get and experience an ecstasy greater than the best sex you could possibly imagine My opinion is right and if you comment that its not I will not read it nor respond
Holy Shit I was not ready to give this game a try The graphics the story the gameplay everything is just incredible Although this game is best played with friends you can still have an amazing experience playing by yourself or with the in-game bot system Highly recommend for any group trying to find a new game to play together

True challenge coop experience There are even bots in the game so you could do it with 3 or even 2 people You can make it very far with just 2 competent players and 2 bots Lots of patience and dedication to the objective is required to make it out alive
Just sent a meme to the dev and they gave me a steam key for all the cosmetics lets go
this game way too easy
This game crashes if you press alt+F4
left 4 dead on crack and some horror aspects but play with a full squad to fully enjoy
never expected to play this game so much this game worth every penny
Giga banger de la des frissons une ambiance folle par contre les bots sont aussi utiles qu'un sur une banquise
Came back to this after a while and still really fun
very hard
Find 3 friends and trick them into following you into the depth of hell
Un juego realmente hardcore intenso inmersivo y que cumple con exactamente lo que propone no es un CoD donde puedes acabar con cientos de enemigos sin que todo escazea y lo que en un principio funciona luego ya no obligando a adaptarte a los nuevos Es un juego para un completo que es muy recomendable tener un grupo con el cual coordinarse aunque incluso jugando de dos jugadores el es mayor pero posible Una joya de FPS de terror multijugador D

Get The Fuck Out
the worst sights in any game hands down I didnt know you could mess up a red dot that bad other than that 10/10
As of writing this review i haven't even finished 3 levels of this game and even with that i've never had this much fun losing GTFO is an amazing immersive shooter horror game but i don't mean horror as in cheap jumpscares and whatnot i mean it in that i've never seen a game that can make me more paranoid and sweat in anticipation as GTFO does The shooting aspect of the game is fantastic and the sound design and weapon design bump it up a bunch for me but i am biased since i'm obsessed with futuristic weapon designs Pear that up with limited resources and you've got yourself an intense shooter that requires you to keep thinking of your ammo as you're shooting The immersion is out of this world with this game From the intro whenever you enter a level to the horrifying sound of rapid heartbeat coming from the monsters and even the door opening sound EVERYTHING about the sound designs just melts together to create from what i've experienced in my life so far the most immersive game But this game might not be for everyone especially for people that don't have a 4 man group as having one boosts the experience dramatically however you can visit the official discord of GTFO and probably find some neat people I recommend this game a bunch however if u don't have a squad you might want to wait for a sale BUT if you have exactly 4 people YOU MUST BUY THIS

A difficult game that does not hold your hands just a variety of challenging levels ranging from slightly stressful to personal masochism tests Playing with bots can be a fun or irritating challenge without bots may feel impossible yet provides a very unique experience but in the end you're absolutely best off in a squad of friends if you want a good time I don't have any tho
One of the best multiplayer experience for those who are ready for a challenge
my friends wont stop edging the the sleepers
bad not hard
Amazing co-op horror game made by the same people who created Payday The Heist and Payday 2 if you have a group of friends that would play this with you i'd highly recommend it The game is challenging and heavily relies on teamwork for success and the game is also primarily stealth based so don't go into it looking to shoot up the place there is mandatory loud sections but outside of those specific situations you never want to intentionally go loud There is also an interesting story if you find all the logs in the terminals and in later Rundowns you even have actual character dialogue throughout the missions You do kinda have to piece together the narrative based on the logs but it is pretty interesting once you connect it all together you can also just watch lore videos on YouTube who will piece together all the intel for you into a proper timeline There is also bots to fill in for missing players on the team however the bots do kinda suck so unfortunately you do have to actually rely on having human teammates if you want to be successful in most levels don't expect to be able to just solo the entire game You can command the bots to do stuff so they are slightly more advanced than the ones previously seen in Payday but they are still pretty primitive and stupid at the same time Game is pretty much unplayable unless you are lucky enough to have friends to group up with The bots will waste resources by stealing any ammo bags tool refills or medkits they find while looting and will use those things on random players when they don't really need them or they will just use them on themself and bots cannot be commanded to sync up stealth kills so in stealth sections bots will either just sit around doing nothing or begin to waste ammo by opening fire with their guns if one enemy becomes aggro on a player And also unlike Payday the bots in GTFO do function exactly like players in the fact that they will eventually at times require resources since they have the same limited ammo and limited health as players do

Sehr sehr cool aber man braucht eine Gruppe
Can be fun alone but it's really fun with even just one more person It can get a little frustrating when an infected gets alerted when you weren't anywhere near them or when you have to redo a mission you just spent 1-2 hours on but in my opinion the fun factor out weighs that
this game is shit don't buy 1 AI only troll you when you close doors some bi run throught it and run away from you when you need some coop like synch attack no you can ask them for that but its for player not AI visibility was better at alien isolation when you pick up some device you need to use later and its large and heavy you can't run drop it or switch on weapons use melee to stealth kill okay there isn't anything that developers could break bad idea when you aim with charged melee on head of laying enemy that sleep your chances to hit him vs chance to hit ground 1 2 000 result your target will wake up and alert others WTF what a b**ch developed this

EDIT Turns out there are actually checkpoints they just don't get introduced until Rundown 6 onwards So that's nice I guess Would've been better if they were present for the first 63 of the game though Imagine if you will spending several grueling hours on a mission Communicating with your team busting your a to play as perfectly as possible looting every room to give yourself just a bit more of a chance And despite some terrifying f***ups you all manage to push through to the finale of the mission Knowing how bad it's about to get you run back through all your previously cleared rooms to pick up anything you may have missed that may help you And then the audio cuts out Lag spikes begin happening to unplayable levels The game begins unraveling at the seams around you Your friend who's hosting begins madly trying any possible fix he can think of because the devs made the GENIUS decision to not have ANY checkpoints in missions So if s falls apart for the host that's f***ing it 3 hours of effort GONE All of you stay in the call as every possible solution he attempts fails And then as he's doing this your other friend gets curious He looks up the specific things that are happening to you all and he finds something Turns out it's NOT the fault of your host friend's internet or PC at all It's the GAME'S fault See your friend informs you that others have had the exact same issues that you all had under the exact same circumstances Others have had their MULTI-HOUR runs completely destroyed due to no fault of their own And then your friend tells you that not only has this been a known issue for AT LEAST A YEAR but that THIS ISN'T EVEN THE ONLY LEVEL THAT HAS THIS PROBLEM And just like that your drive to play the game anymore f***ing dies Because who the f wants to spend 3 hours on a mission only to have it all thrown in the trash due to some bull bug I actually quite enjoy this game most of the time despite the BRUTAL difficulty I can spend hours upon hours wiping on a mission with my friends and still want to keep trying even as salty as it makes me Because at the end of the day even if we have a devastating loss right at the end it was still OUR FAULT We f***ed up a play ran out of resources underestimated how bad a room might be Oh well s sucks but we'll learn from it Losing a great run right at the end due to bugs That I am NOT okay with Because that ISN'T our fault and the fact that some of these game breaking bugs remain unfixed YEARS later is genuinely f***ing inexcusable This is a 40 game that has been in development since 2017 and you're telling me that bugs that have been around for YEARS that can easily end your multi-hour runs still haven't been fixed Give me a break
I fucking love this game The atmosphere is amazing the gunplay is amazing the difficulty is amazing but the bugs are unreal I can sit down spend 3 hours on a single run for one mission and wipe cuz we made a mistake or cuz the game got us and i'll be fine with it because it's OUR FAULT We made the wrong call we wasted too much ammo we fucked a play but it was OUR FAULT When I spend 3 hours on a run almost reach the end and we get hit with a bug that has been known to exist for at least a year or more like with one where pressing TAB or ESC will make the audio disappear and game freeze or the one where you literally can't interact with anything unless you disconnect and rejoin it becomes incredibly disheartening I cannot explain to you the good-time ruining experience of the host getting a game ending bug right at the end of a run I love this game but these bugs destroy everything i love about this game It no longer becomes OUR FAULT for picking the wrong loadout or making a bad call Instead we get blindsided and lose 2 hours of gametime from a incredibly bad-timed bug It's no longer OUR FAULT it's out of our hands We can do nothing to change it we learn nothing from it and it's just the perfect kick in the sack right after spending hours trying to beat a single level This game is amazing thank you devs for making such an amazing game and I hope the next project is an absolute banger Please for the love of the meteor that killed the dinosaurs fix these bugs They ruin an otherwise awesome game
this game is gas there is a Jamaican guy

Great game very challenging and cool cooperative play Like the contrast between trying to be stealthy and shooting guns a blazing when enemies are alerted Only downside is friendly fire sucks
This is what my personal Hell looks like When I die I'll be eternally lost in the underground labs never knowing which way to go killing sleepers running out of ammo and then dying And then doing it all over again Forever

Sehr geehrte ich gender mal nicht weil joa kein bock wenn sie dieses spiel erwerben wollen Empfehle ich euch eine gute selbsthilfe gruppe rauszusuchen dieses game hat micht heute sehr dolle na wie sage ich es gefickt ich war mit 2 freunden 2 stunden in einem level und dieses hat mich mental fertig gemacht ich habe danach den drang alles zu was mir in die kam Aber sonst banger game grafik bombe und alles drum und dran auch viel beim zocken
Il fait noir dedans et pue Je ne parle pas de trou de fesse mais de ces cavernes alienesque qu'on traverse sur la pointe des pieds avec un couteau ou une masse entre les dents Quand tu sens l'odeur du souffre c'est que a quelque part Soit ton pote est vilain de la ou soit ils trop nombreux pour passer un un la masse C'est pour moi LE meilleur jeu de coop FPS car il monopolise tout ce qu'un groupe face doit avoir pour survivre Le du stress prendre soin de la team la COMMUNICATION et la synchro Si t'es un zikos dans un groupe et que tu as sur et que t'as pas super confiance en toi alors t'as la recette du cocktail GTFO qui t'attend sur le bar ha oui les textures du du jeu sont vraiment pourries mais on s'en balek car le brouillard masque bien Ils sont malain les devs
very fun game if you have a couple friends to play with

Consistently fails to launch properly If i can play a game or two perfectly fun and very challenging 4/10
very good soup
Going into this game I felt like this game was going to be a standard COD Zombies type game but I was 100 wrong For me this game taught me to think before I act and actually be stealthy This game isn't mean't for fast game players you are suppose to take your time and think over certain actions before you do them This game however is a game that mainly focuses on multiplayer so if you plan to play this game solo don't be disappointed for how boring it is you have to play with your friends or it will get to be stale Price is a bit steep but I can see why with these graphics and physics
Ass is hard clenching when you trigger an alarm and your feet goes up and down giggling and being girly all that when you see a 5 use medpacks

Really fun and tense unless you have less than 3 other friends to play this with and those friends like charging in and dying withing 10 seconds of the mission starting
its very hard and very fun but its best with 4 players
gud geme
This BFG big fun game has a lot of CP cool people in it would recommend for anyone who loves AO awesome objectively games
Genuinely one of the best co-op horror games ever made Not the scariest but by far one of the most intense
Great game only if you have friends to play with The thrill is very exciting
Plenty of challenge with lots of diverse weapon choices and strategies make for an amazing change of pace for a shooter title
sever dead lag error fuck this
I believe that GTFO is a great multi-player strategy game that is a lot of fun and generates some of the best experiences any game could provide As for the game itself and its mechanics I believe it is a really polished game from what I have seen and feels great with both how the equipment in the game functions the thinking the strategy and the way the game looks the aesthetic of this game and the story provided in little drops of knowledge really gives the game a great mysterious vibe about what actually happened to the facilities and places you traverse Overall if you have a group of 2 3 friends that you and your friends can mess around in and create great moments and memories by all means this is the game unfortunately if you are looking for story filled content this is probably not the game for you That isn't to say that this game doesn't have story but in comparison to the likes of other games this doesn't have much or an obvious story Don't fault me for being slightly wrong for my review I haven't played as much as someone who has completed the game but I hope this helps
I like slow tactical gaming and also monsters cool Need friends tho
cool
bonk
fuck gtfo
The game itself is fun but the artificial difficulty of every level really starts to get tiring So far it has just been the usual sneaking past sleepers that are too clustered to be killed typing into the terminal to find the objective and sitting through wave after wave of varying enemy swarms before ultimately dying because I have to backtrack through the entire level to extract while more enemies spawn Maybe it gets better
I like it
Help I'm scared
dont know why it doesnt have matchmaking per rundown when you put matchmaking it randomly puts you into some lobby even if you are the host and you need 1 more or 2 more players if you set them to matchmake it can transfer you and your friend to a random rundown lobby
pretty good game definitely better with friends the warning on the store page however is VERY accurate not the kind of game you want to play with people who might be stubborn everyone in the team needs to be at least somewhat flexible teamwork and coordination are NECESSARY and you need to be prepared for potentially 30 mins being lost per expedition too depending on how well you play the game(for an idea me and my buds finished rundown 1 and only R2:A1 as of writing this review and i have 61 hours there are 8 total rundowns so this game WILL take time to finish all in all it is a very good game feels great when an expedition ends and everyone gets back alive you can play with bots if you don't have people or match-make too but for a 4 person team-based game this is one of the best I've played if you don't feel like spending almost 50 on it then get it on sale
This game is a work of art truly incredible want to shoot monsters from the last of us GTFO has it want to work through the dark without knowing what is next to you knowing that one screw up could end your prison life just like that GTFO has that too Want to work with your friends to try to scrape through the game by the skin of your teeth well look at that GTFO has it GTFO is the best challenge with an insane amount of maps variety monsters and is work every penny you pay for it

game for redditors to jerk each other off over how difficult it is
This game is best played with some experienced friends or new if you want pure CBT but knowing very little going in was an exciting experience This game is extremely atmospheric and intense the enemies are terrifying at first and learning how they function is a fun challenge The guns look fantastic and have a great OOMPH to them Thankfully there is no meta for what weapon or melee weapon you should take since you now have access to every weapon in the game now you have the choice to pick and choose what looks good and what you like using best your experienced friends can also help decide what's best for a newer player to try out at first and each tool brings a new experience between each Rundown learning how to best utilize them effectively Learning how to operate the Terminal is a very rewarding experience when you feel like a hackerman querying the correct objectives and pinging those essential resources for your team to find And a bunch of other fun commands to discover Minus the jank in some places GTFO is an amazing co-op horror experience with your friends I've had a blast the entire time so I would recommend it
GAME SUCKS if ur into opening doors and doing the same thing over and over this is for u should have refunded
It sucked when it was released in Early Access And it still sucks now I sadly played 2hours and 30 min so I could get a refund
If you like horror tactical shooters and games that kick your butt you need to play this game The amount of content this game has for the price is insane The hardest part of this game will be convincing your friends to keep playing after dying dozens of times
I would HIGHLY recommend this is a CO-OP coordinated squad based game If you're looking for a co-op hoard shooter or plan to play solo with randoms I think you'll be highly disappointed However if you can get the right group of 4 people and really get into the vibe of the game you'll have some insanely tense and heart pounding moments with a group of great people
It's a super fun fear inducing multiplayer game The game play reminds me of Dead Space with how intense the combat is and how there is such a variety of mobs and objectives I really like how you can jump around from level to level so that you aren't stuck redoing one super difficult level I definitely recommend if you and your friends are horror fans D

This game is challenging Unlike other co-op games resources are scarce and enemies are everywhere Stay silent use melee attacks and avoid flashlights Waking an enemy leads to severe consequences If you enjoy hardcore FPS survival this is for you
Yes
Worst game I've ever played in my life Waay too easy
11/10 will blast again
Extremely boring generic game little ammo enemies can tank most of them so you need 2 mags to kill one oh and theres 200 enemies like most of the time you are just swinging your knife not even shooting I regret spending an hour of my life in this trash
We need to find three nice scout
Just like this hidden horror treasure of a game no one will see this review or hear you scream Co-op or die literally
Oh i remember this game They are still adding shit Cool
Watched my entire team get mowed down because 1 guy missed a swing 10/10 would get mowed down again
fun and nice base on teamwork game
boring AF
The power of the sun in the palm of my hands
I would definitely recommend this to friends and others to play team based gameplay is a must and constant communication in order to stay alive good mix of survival horror stealth and action
real life
no resources no friends and Big boi giant man licks you in inappropriate ways 10/10
We worked together and we still died together
very epic game
after playing the tutorial for about 5 minutes i can say that xavier realy likes this games
go in stealth.SHOOT ALL YOUR BULLETS.run out of bullets.STAB.then die.REPEAT
This is the kind of game that gamers look for It has a steep learning curve and requires a lot of practice and patience Thinking under pressure resource management and situational awareness become important often and most of your decisions come with consequences that could even end a run after 2 hours of hard work If you decide you hate yourself enough to try and complete every map you'll be challenged in many different ways Different combinations of error alarms enemy types surge alarms infectious fog etc force you to play differently from map to map and adds to the pressure of not letting your team down if you are seeing something for the first time As you progress you will go through skill spikes that can lead to spending days excruciatingly trying to complete a single level forcing you to get better and better until you can complete it Then you'll return to a level you previously thought was insane and it will be a breeze because of how far you've come It's really dramatic how much room for improvement there is despite the simplicity of 2 guns 1 tool and a melee weapon The final rundown has a great narrative to it and really brought all the lore to a satisfying conclusion Plus the final level R8E2 really puts everything you've learned to the test and completing it gives you the kind of satisfaction that few games offer Namely because of the journey to get there many hundreds of hours most likely The feeling is akin to beating a dark souls game or something similar that's meant to make you choose between trying for the 20th time or smashing your keyboard You'll keep trying until you MASTER the level and finally succeed except the biggest difference between this and other games is that you're relying on three other players to have the same level of skill and motivation as you The community is mostly great and very helpful especially with new players unless you drop into a level that's way beyond your skill set so try to do them in order Sometimes you find regulars to play with and you'll always remember the people you complete your first E-tier levels with This game is no easy task and it is a journey if you go for 100 completion so be prepared to get invested Also if you vibe with someone ADD THEM Finding someone reliable to team with reduces the frustration of bad pick-up groups substantially Last piece of advice please tell any pros you meet that you're good because you have less than 500 hours in game or because you've played CoD before because that makes us laugh and we enjoy it as we carry you Anyways good luck Hope you have what it takes
Boring not fun as a player only fun to watch on YouTube
Good game last rundown was challenging and fun Must have patience
fun with even one irl friend more the merrier if you played R6 extraction then you'll feel right at home worth every penny on sale
Please add sex
not fun

I would not recommend buying this game to an average player unless you specifically looking for a game to play with a team of friends Otherwise It is quite frustrating to play in 2023 as it is heavily dependent on the teammates and matchmaking doesn't work anymore you have to matchmake through discord server which is not hard but still frustrating a bit bots are there but unless you are very good bots will not carry you far In short all the positive moments about this game are contradicted by negative ones The game has intriguing lore But it is hidden behind logs on the terminals which you will not be able to read at your leasure as public matchmaking requires you to act not sit with logs and terminals The game has challenging resource-dependent gameplay But it does not feel balanced You can play cautiously and slowly for the whole session have a stable surplus of resources make one mistake with one monster at the final objective waste ammo and as a result loose nearly a two-hour game at the final extraction point which may take like a minute because several team members ran out of ammo Ok sometimes challenge is good it makes you cherish the spoils of the session and crave for a rematch But there are no real rewards for the match no rewards other than cosmetics which you cannot really enjoy all characters looks the same no matter the cosmetics No fun replayability replaying the sessions feels exactly the same as playing before The sessions are just too damn long due to stealth mechanic to feel the urge for a replay if you lost The combat is impactfull and brutal monsters have many points of dismemberment The monsters are clunky and chaotic in their movement and not in a good way Due to how challenge in a game is organized there are a lot of times great combat feels like a big disappointment when you discover you wasted just too much ammo And there may just be no way to correct you mistakes long into a match as addtl ammo resources my be locked behind optional alarm doors with a 50-70 chance to waste more ammo then is actually behind the door And list goes on and on In short I felt very compelled to play this game and each time I played it I was either somewhat underwhelmed by success or angered and frustrated at the loss If you are a casual gamer or even a gamer with a slight dip to hardcore like me but with no exact team of friends I would strongly advise you against buying this game in 2024
The game is great IF you are 4 players I really seriously wish they would make the game kind of scale difficulty down so that it could work with 2-3 players as well There aren't a whole lot of working adults that can consistently gather 4 people to play at the same time
👍
I have a very toxic relationship with this game
Post-trauma activated but it's cool This game requires teamwork and cohesion Very good for testing friendship
This game is really challenging especially if you and your teammates are not synchronized We need to plan out our way and conserve ammo as much as we can ration the resources sneak around monsters in the dark etc Overall it's a fun game to try out with friends the atmosphere are very creepy and the sound design adds to the immersion
I play this with friends and they are dumb so we don't get far but its cool because they get scared lol

One of the best coop horror games out there 10/10
I think it's one of the most underrated games of all time I remember a lot of hype in the beginning and now you never see anyone playing it I just wish it was more solo-friendly since I have no friends to play with Really limits the game for me but I've still found success in must rundowns with the bots It also appears no one has even completed the entire game plenty of 0.0 achievements available Makes you wonder if it's even possible to beat which I personally like You definitely need a team with real players for over half the game but you can do quite a lot on your own Wish there were more games like this one definitely in my top 10 greatest games of the last 10 years
Its a good game play with friends and be extra carefull
Nice
Dead Space
i did not get the fuck out
FUCKING RUN AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Really fun CO-OP game Even though they added Matchmaking to the game it is still best played with friends Lots of Levels on full release lots of fun guns to use and a nice skill curve with very challenging game play
Oh I hast been did bless with this most wondrous knife oh such grace
not a clarke campaign
my character woke up with car battery attached to the balls
You definitely need friends to make it enjoyable but man is it satisfying to beat missions in this game Hell it is satisfying to just pass some encounters alive Few games make me feel happy at the end of them and this is one
I like this game I really do Liking it comes with caveats This game needs three friends or three people who aren't insufferable to play with The bot AI is the worst I've ever experienced in any game Theres a command menu with multiple sub-menus to direct the bots but its cumbersome and not very useful when you're neck deep in monsters It's also a game that demands attention I get that you might like a sweaty game I have seven hours in and I just beat the first mission in the first arc I can hear the calls of git gud from here Well if you're sweaty enough with 3 tryhard friends SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT
The idea is perfect and the concept is ideal Start the game with all weapons and the concept for completion is just to well.you forget After being in games that require transactions and constant grinding for weapons or much needed gear its refreshing to play and remember playing to just play and have fun
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH GO STUPID AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH GOOOOO CRAZYYYYY
If you have three tryhard friends and want a game with months worth of content to bash your heads against this is a 10/10 game Definitely my favorite 4-player co-op game out there requires a lot of coordination and creative problem solving which makes it awesome for anyone looking for an experience that forces them to work smarter not harder Playing with less than 4 people is another story Bots are basically housecats They will run through doors you are trying to close frequently will not fetch items will wander away from bioscans will get stuck in the environment and will listen to commands maybe 60 of the time Later missions are often more difficult/impossible to clear without a full group of real people because of dumb bots

This game deserves the best game your bad at 100 Playing with my friends and getting through the mission just to get to the end and die in the last area sucks but damn does it feel good when you fail a mission 6 times and finally get through it after a good 4 hours of playing it This game takes teamwork and communications got a big group all sync up and take them out and move to the next group solo big guy everyone spear him This game is good and takes some time to get used to I would recommend playing with a group of people as solo runs with how stupid the bots are for someone new is impossible Having someone who can type and spell correctly helps majorly for missions Get in and complete those rundowns Oh and don't look up
teehee
Difficult game but very rewarding

if your only 2 people and playing with 2 bots nearly impossible there need to be different difficulty lvls
You would need some gaming buddies for this one but once you do it's definitely worth it
It's a great challenging coop shooter with an atmosphere that's drags you in would play it more if it didn't consistenly give me migraines
Work Together Or Suck Together
Cruel e tenso perfeito
a lot of death
very good
This is a good game This is fun but really hard You need atleast 3 friends willing to get it
Ever been in middle of a ass puckering high intense fight and half way through it you realize you got to shit bad so now your blood pressure is rising and your heart rate is crazy yea thats GTFO for ya 10/10
Fun but challenging game for sure It should be call IOFA I'm out of F**K'n Ammo
get the fuck in

Easily one of the best games I've ever played You Need Friends To Play GTFO takes alot of patience and time each level is roughly an hour or two The games entirely about stealth and progression is slow but the satisfaction of clearing a level is probably one of the most rewarding GTFO forces cooperation or you and your team just wont be able to clear rooms The main focus of this game is stealth not the gunplay even though you'll end up carrying two all the time Each level is refreshing with new enemies differing objectives and maps this also means no one loadout is good for all maps Alerting a room of sleepers or touching a squilliam tentacle is probably the most gut wrenching feelings one can experience You get only seconds to ready your defences and are thrown into gunplay Although I haven't played GTFO for long this is definitely a fun game to pick up with a few friends and play all weekend Goodluck on your journey
great game but matchmaking seems dead
At the first plays is not to hipped 1 or 2 hrs of gameplay but as you play more and more is an awersome experience and a hard chalange for you
This game trains your glutes

best party game for 4 players
Synchronize Focus the objective Prepare GTFO for me if I were to describe it to someone new is that is it truly the Dark Souls of co-op shooters A high difficulty that continues to get tougher demands ever increasing teamwork efficiency where a failure or lack of communication can result in an entire mission going into the bin and everyone returning to the menu Resources are scarce levels are long and stealth without alerting a horde is crucial to survival Failing to prepare before a scan or alarm even if a room gets awakened can overrun you and your team easily if not experienced and alert Though difficult this game has a lot of great points and a very satisfying finish whenever you finally extract out of a lengthy mission or one that had resulted in multiple wipes But as great as this game is it has flaws Very big flaws As a whole the game sometimes breaks There are bugs glitches and crashes depending on your system Players can desync despawn or become entirely invisible to you Matchmaking in public queue can be a gamble players range from skilled to new and some just cannot mesh well with the rest of the team A whole entire discord server for specific matchmaking was created which is a far better alternative but unneeded if the game had mildly more functional public abilities However this doesn't make it unplayable just frustrating at rare occurrences Besides that this game will continually push you out of your comfort zone It will keep throwing seemingly impossible odds at you and your team as you discover new places new rundowns new secrets and most crucially New enemies to face The tutorial doesn't hardly give you much of any context nor does the weapon descriptions If you're new and reading this I highly suggest giving this a go if you are patient and methodical about your playing If you want to speedrun and solo then no Even if you had seen people on youtube solo levels it isn't anywhere as easy as they show it to be You will die You will fail But you will learn over time and practice I recommend reading some guides on steam such as true weapon stats and beginner tutorials before playing In my near 100 hours I haven't met a player who was down-outright hostile to me for being new rather they helped me out quite a lot whenever I didn't know what to do Just be polite ping your resources ask questions and always say to others before starting scans to prepare If you work together you survive Otherwise you'll end up gtfo'ing right back to the beginning again Cheers
I came after beating ALT://R1C1 fourth try
You're going to need a competent squad but it's one of the best games I've played in awhile
fuck this game
fun good quality and amazing guns
So dang good Atmospheric scary challenging I think this is the ultimate sci fi dungeon crawler at the moment there just isn't much like it Some of the difficulty mechanics are ridiculous in the second and third rundowns
Getting violated by the blind has never been this fun 9/10 too much mist
seria legal se meus amigos quissessem jogar
One of the most difficult games I've ever played with little support for fresh players but once you've got your team and figured the game out it's also one of the most satisfying to finally complete Also one of the most unusual ways of telling a story but great for people who love the idea of finding your drip-fed lore full of conspiracy and mystery Here's hoping the game's universe gets expanded in the future as it's extremely interesting
Boring as hell no quick play matchmaking no progression toxic community Waste of money
Klimat i przygoda nie do podrobienia
A very fun cooperative stealth/resource management FPS that puts you and your friends communication skills to the test Hope you guys make a similar kind of game in the future
pugtime if you see this you fucking suck
It weaponizes your senses make you fear without making you want to stop but it is really good
Boring as hell
make sure you have friends or you are in the gtfo discord you need other people for this game but GODAYUM if it is not one of the best games ive ever played
This game sucks
No
You Will Die A Lot
amazing game if you have try hard friends
Moin moin schreibe sonst eigentlich keine Rezensionen muss in dem Fall aber einfach sein GTFO ist mich einfach das beste Spiel in der Nische die es will Die Developer sind sich selber und dem Spielprinzip bis zum Schluss treu geblieben Sowohl vom Gunhandling der als auch dem Gameplay ist das Spiel in meinen Augen ungeschlagen Aufgrund der Schwierigkeit dem nicht vorhandenen Metaprogress sowie der Tatsache das man die meisten Level nach dem Scheitern komplett neu starten muss ist das Spiel sicherlich nichts jedermann Aber ich bin mir sicher die Leute denen das Spiel lieben es Hate it or love it Tach zusammen
For the best experience play it with friends Never play it alone it won't be that fun With friends you can f@ck around die and still have fun from it Also you'll sh@t yourself while playin it 9/10 have fun
This game is clearly for masochists but worth and willing to play more and more with my friends in team
just GTFO
Cet avis est chaud Graphiquement c'est une bonne grosse claque L'immersion est incontestablement parfaite on est sur du the Last of Us du Left4dead le tout dans un ambiance d'Alien Les sensations au shoot sont le corp corp est punitif pas un gadget n'est laisser de et sans organisation dans votre c'est mission de mission 50 minutes minimum deux joueurs pour la en comptant un seul et sur la seconde 1h10 min sans En bref c'est une MASTERCLASS PVE ne pas laisser de foncez sans Restez silencieux.ou courrez vers votre perte
On of the best indie game I ever came accross It is a super-slow progression FPS where every step you make can ruin your mission By mission I'm speaking of a real mission a trip that will last hours four you to complete and this with no checkpoints Every stage of this complex is more and more demanding and complex You'll need every mission carefully planned
fajen
Bello da giocare con amici
Disclaimer I refunded so I played less than 2 hours Pros The atmosphere is very well done and there are some interesting mechanics to be explored like managing light and setting up defenses when a horde rush is coming Cons The game wasn't that fun I think the gameplay loop boils down to explore find a computer open doors hold from horde sneak kill people Now I realize that many games can be drastically oversimplified to the point of stupidity but none of those actions that make up the core of this game gripped me Frankly it's just not my genre apparently I would be more willing to try it out if the game were less expensive Writing this review I'm reminded of PayDay 2 another game that shares almost this exact review of being well-made but boring in most/all aspects
I wasn't into it You have to remember write down or communicate with teammates to open doors and advance most newcomers are unaware with lack of guidance its good mechanics and creates something other than a survival horror
Extremely fun with friends just having dumb ass friends pick them wisely
Yes
GOOD GAME
Fukin hard but worth it when you solve it

I don't know of any other game that has this level of Coop difficulty horror and feel to it
entspannend
lacks a lot of crucial gameplay feedback gunplay is floaty
I mean everything here looks good
nice
its great game unlike other game witch you can just shoot and open your way you shoud think about how to do the level and you need a good team work
Pro Grimdark atmosphere in the near future Playable in solo with intelligent bots Using ingame computers to gather intel Worth your money Con Most of the weapons are only for niche purposes A few misspellings like the object is Zone_100e but there are no such area in that map Too few weapon types
Got this as a gift now i am no longer accepting horror game
This game is so fricking fun but its a hard game unbelievably hard game sometimes But in the name of the holy crap it is so fun
fiya game
Great game
GOOD GAME
I'm afraid of the discord mods in the basement
would be easier if the enemies couldn't hear/see/feel/attack you
Great idea for the game interesting scenery lots of weapons cool gameplay everything indicates that you will spend a lot of time on this game but if you can't play with other players you are fated to bots And all the fun disappears Yea real shame Playing with bots is painful They die in a stupid way they interfere steal resources they even cannot revive the player because they usually die trying More complicated levels like for example R1C1 become so irritating Playing with bots is part of the game and should be enjoyable not annoying so DEVs fix the bots
This game was straight pooooooooop Hard to play UI is the worst I've seen Everyone will quit mid match Good luck trying to play multiplayer You'll have to go to the discord to find out how to set the game up
4 heures pour finir la Je pensais que Tarkov m'avais appris ce la douleur j'avais tord
Fun with friends provides a hard challenge when not prepare
So crazy bnut save ammo
Goated game W
After playing this game with friends for close to 2 years I honestly can say that it's well worth it The change of pace in each mission kept me engaged as a player and on my toes when need be I just wish that there were possibilities for single player missions for when you don't have a full 4 person party for the full co-op experience
J'ai appris aimer la douleur ce jeu 3
GTFO is a game that's all about working together and facing scary challenges This game is the definition of the word stressful The game's atmosphere is kind of creepy with dark places and spooky sounds that make everything intense and play with your nerves The levels are tricky and cool although it also can be impossible to success sometimes The game is tough and sometimes it feels like a big relief when you finally win Just remember teamwork is the key to win in this game you have to talk to your friends and come up with plans to survive against lots of scary creatures I don't recommend it for solo play but In short if you like games where you team up with friends to face challenges and don't mind a bit of stress GTFO is a must-play It's an exciting experience that'll keep you on your toes
bad optimization bad mobility bad gun play and you just crouch around half the time gets repetitive after the 2nd game
a good game but the matching system isn't that good
Eins der schwersten besten und Spiele die es gibt
the real horror is the boring stealth system in this game
Waited a long time for it got a full squad of mates into a free to play weekend Sadly dissapointed quit and deleted within half an hour Mate got a refund

there is so much game D 13hrs to barely finish the first rundown just to find out there is 7 more
AMAZING GAME now here me out it looks good and runs real good on mid to high teir equipment but it seems to be very boring without friends
A perfect blend of tactical fun and horror
get ot
peaceful relaxing game to play with your kids
Misery simulator positive
good
You can let it feel very scary or you can just duck around with your friends If you don't have any friends the matchmaking time is a little ridiculous but it more than makes up for it with great and intense gameplay I love playing this no matter the people but laughing with others is definitely a positive trait for a game 10/10 will be playing more
15 hours in other games I have a very good idea how to play 15 hours in gtfo you mean scout from tf2
monsters
The best simulation for Deep Dark Dungeons with guns
Can't sex the monster
An extremely difficult but fun game to play with friends Just wish there were more checkpoints as the game can be too punishing sometimes Recommended only to those that are looking for a thrilling challenge
game makes me sweat so much tht i cld distribute water to the homeless
spooky alien gem
This game is hard if you do not have a full squad to play with I'm by no means a god gamer but me and my friend couldn't beat the first level because the two bots kept friendly firing and wandering So not a bad game by any means but I wouldn't recommend unless you have a group of 4 for sure
Great game but you need friends/a group to play with Tense horror filled gameplay You have to play somewhat perfect along with your friends or you're going back 30 minutes to an hour of gameplay back Wish I had friends to play the game with to experience more of the game and further levels but what I did play was solid Note Do not play this game if you don't like stealth games 90 of what you're going to be doing is sneaking/not getting caught I like this but fps players may think the game is heavier on shooting and while it is there you don't want to be fighting unless you are forced to
A good and very hard game but is is fun to play with a fix team of friends I recommend it
not fun
great game however connection can be spotty with other players story is interesting so far matchmaking is not very optimal so you do need to use discord if you want to play with others however you can use bots as party members but they don't really compare to real players though that doesn't me that you can't take the through the whole story
Muito jogar se tiver amigos
too much deaths too many cries and too many betrayals yet I still wanna come back to this game
good game it remember me FORTNITE fake review just to attract more new prisoners
A truly amazing game but the bots are extremely incompetent
so fucking hard
this is a really fun and enjoyable game i love missing my shot on a scout after my teammate wakes them up
fun gam for frens
R:8 8
A maior dificuldade do jogo conseguir combinar com todos os amigos de jogar e nenhum deles ter espirito derrotista jogo onde da um proposito de utilidade para os falta a DLC com nosso presidente agora
This game is so unbelievably difficult when you and your friends are incapable of forming proper human thoughts when everything gets alerted Don't even get me started on the damn level 3 alarm doors at that point just bend over and let them have their way with you First game that actually caused me to tear my pubes out in anger 11/10
Pain without love Pain I can't get enough Pain I like it rough Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
This game genuinely takes years off of your total lifetime via stress
Ultimate co-op
Spaghetti heads
git gud err dye tryun
MEOW
I love how these creatures can live without a head just like me
The densest and most juicy atmosphere I've ever seen be it book move or a game Hmm meaby on par with witcher 3 It is difficult although not as hard and punishing as I'd hope to but I do like this feeling of helplessness when you realise it will be almost impossible to keep on going due to lack of ammo Its so refreshing that You can actually see how developers/designers put their heart into to game and thought thoroughly about all details how to make you feel more scared and worried And its pretty long At the moment of writing i heave nearly 20hrs and I'm still on my first rundown albeit we already played last map Worth every penny But its for coop only Yeah u can try play with bots but its not the same
its like skyrim with guns
Dette er ganske underholdende og
A really good and intense FPS Everything is thought out really well except how bots just can't do sneak kills a very important part of the game
I was looking forward to play this game unfortunately it crashes every time I try to load the tutorial on the steam deck
I can hear their heart beats in my nightmares

Shit game impossible to win reactor missions bots cant stealth kill and will auto shoot the moment one tiny guy wakes up 10/10 would recommend
Really nice stealth game
They in fact i]are[/i in the walls
very comprehensive coop horror/survival/shooter/Strat-heavy game best with a group of 4 you will not get far with less read the steam community guide extremely helpful
Bonne dose de certains niveaux sont faisable en solo avec les bot mais la plupart non il faut une equipe de bon tireur et surtout de mec discret excellent jeu

its a good idea turned into a bad game an unfinished product

GTFO is that kind of game where you're constantly killed but you always come back for more The game is hard Really hard You'll quickly use up all your resources and end up with a knife You'll make noises or turn on lights You'll get smacked a lot I was going to say the game is tense but nerve-wrecking is more appropriate This is meant to be played with a group working together that's the only way to survive Unfortunately most groups aren't really working together A great game to play with friends an ok game to play with bots
Yes
gtfo
Need a team When you do have one though Great game
if you see a bug that ain't a bug It's a feature
better than Overwatch 2 PvE
Juegazo ahh como a mi ex ayuda soy debil mentalmente
This game has some mushrooms in it Roach Approves
good game

hard but rewarding that's what she said
fnuuy hammer
I played this game during free weekend and I believe it's a Incredible game Never thought developers will improve in the 4 player coop formula I played single player with bots all the time and I was having a blast Yes some missions will take serious minutes to complete which makes this game an awesome journey The mystery of the lore adds a lot to the experience being a prisoner forced to to go down into highly secured warehouse and labs to research and get stuff with a highly probability of dying in the process it's very interesting Every enemy has to be engaged with caution or you risking lose the whole mission I totally will GTFO again
u Quick Sum u Awesome concepts Love the themes and gameplay Multiplayer issues I had were basically the same 2 or 3 issues everyone else has already listed Great game if you have a consistent group to vc with Terrible game for singleplayer Too hard alone and AI system just isn't there yet Not expecting the devs to cater to a singleplayer experience the game is clearly not advertised to be that way Just to me seems to limit the types of users and longevity of the game u Longer Review u Really loved the concept and theme Had a blast when I could get a whole team on discord Really only played it with my siblings and old college buddies and had an amazing experience Super fun gameplay Sadly I'm 24 and my life/responsibilities leave me super busy with very little time for video games Which is a problem for this game since olist I do not have the time to sit around waiting for players in a lobby where I have never been able to join another session or seen anyone join mine My friends and family's schedules are busy too so that isn't consistent enough to play I often do not have the social energy to search for teams on the devs discord server olist Honestly if the devs came out with a sequel game or something similar that had a valid singleplayer option or better AI mechanics then I would buy it in a heartbeat For now though it's just not for me If you're reading this do not have these issues and like the game concepts then you should def give it a try It's awesome when you can get a proper session going
Health and safety inspector simulator Abandoned underground complex not up to code 10/10 would recommend using bathroom before playing as the complex does not have any
Nah just.nah there's better games out there
Un muy buen juego donde el radica no solo en su dificultad sino en la confianza y de equipo

yippee
its intense a brand new experience I am fully enjoying myself
Dark heavy low ammunition.perfect for a comfortable evening with friends Highly recommended

Very fun and difficult Team working and planning is necessary A simple mistake is very costly perhaps even death
JUMP THE LAST ONE RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Trying really hard at this game the game's so good
good game to play with friends
I thoroughly enjoyed being scared shtless
Bon jeu
Best Three Hours Of My Life I may be mentally scared but my friendships are stronger than ever This game truly shines when you have friends running around waking everything up blowing each other up and somehow winning Also swag drip no cap
good

This game is good play it on acid
I hesitated to get this game when it first appeared thinking it would be better to wait I got it during a 2023 summer sale and its the only game I played that year with almost 1400 hours played in 7 months Now I wish I got this game earlier however I think now is the best time to pick up this game and play it to the end It's a unique horror fps that's far better than any other zombie game with teammates Other zombie games are all alike but this game emphasizes stealth strategy and teamwork You may want your own group of 3 other friends to play with but GTFO uses Discord as opposed to in-game matchmaking to play with others You'll easily find other people to play with I highly recommend picking up this game especially when on sale When you start playing play the first rundown focus on the basics such as using terminal commands like a programmer/coder to look for resources and objective items such as personal IDs hydrostasis units or keys But don't feel like you have to completely finish a single rundown as you have 7 others to choose from Feel free to switch between rundowns for the A and B expeditions But don't expect this game to stay slow or easy Eventually you'll want to learn how to pick up the pace and use your knowledge of the game to get through the more difficult expeditions By using the consumables in the game it can make all the difference between getting through an expedition more easily too There's a skill ceiling that you can work up to but its still straight forward enough that anyone who knows how to shoot can just join in But don't let that make you think you can just shoot your way through all the enemies You'll be resource dependent and you'll never know if you probably should of just melee more than shoot going from zone to zone And even though people completed difficult rundowns and expeditions they always come back to it eventually I certainly thought at first some missions were too complicated but then once I got through that metaphorical wall I really began to enjoy the game for what it had to offer and wanted to keep playing more Even if I failed an expedition after trying several times with others there's still something about trying again and again and learning how to play better that makes the game so much more pleasing If you have any questions please ask or leave a comment This game is worth the price buy it now
Like the intensity and design overall Also like that you can use the bots to your advantage by asking for their help in specific ways Atmosphere is great and multiplayer is seamless and exciting
On my first mission I planted mines near where we stalled and it boomed up everything when the enemies come over LIterally did 90 of the friendly fire damages 10/10 games
It's fun but in my opinion only with friend's I don't see myself solo playing the game
can't recommended it to play it alone playing with friends is the best option but bring a lot of time with since a run can take up to 1 hour
is fun
great gameplay loop
mas carajo que el carajo entera esta mierda vas a requerir de cualquier calma conchetumare por que estos cefalopoides no vienen con weas que es bastante complicado que te den la estas perras buenas pal sexo asi que vay a tener que hacer caso a la wea que te pida la si te piden silencio vo teni que dartelas de perkin y hacer caso chala culia por que cuestan un coco completar cada wea

Years back this was fine game but now game crashing so often that I couldnt even finish tutorial
bad
Por favor JAMAS en su vida lo compren
fun game with friends
why do I own this This is pain
Game's great but you need at least 2 other friends to play it with or be willing to make friends on discord If you have that it's a great game and there's nothing else like it 10/10 if you want to sweat
This is one of the best co-op games I've ever played full stop It demands patience careful planning and constant communication to succeed-a level of engagement not demanded by most other games of its ilk Stealth is key to stemming the slow bleed of resources in each mission and the rising tension of silently navigating and clearing roomfuls of squelching pulsating monsters is periodically released in the sweet catharsis of the loud frenzied alarm sequences where you mow down waves of the enemies you've been sneaking past for the past 10-20 minutes It's this beautifully paced interplay between the mounting anxiety of dwindling resources and the frenzied shootouts that's kept me coming back to try out each rundown Missions also have optional branching paths if you want an extra challenge which adds to the replayability Devs have also consistently updated the game with bugfixes new weapons and constantly rotating sets of campaign missions the rundowns Can't recommend it enough and can't wait for Den of Wolves to see how the formula evolves
HARD GAME BUT FUUUUUN
DoNT moVE wHeN theIR HEarT beats
complicada la cosa
good
Friends and patience required
If this game is for you you'll know it from the first few levels/tries And if it's for you then you won't put it down for many hours
Have Fun
Still wish the Allied AI would stop phasing through Closing doors
great game
E
Not necessarily difficult in a gameplay sense Gameplay wise it's actually very simple You won't need the honed skills and reaction times of Vermintide or Dark Souls What is difficult however is figuring out the chess pieces that are the maps Making the right decisions on where to go which resources to expend setting up your defense etc Very rewarding when you get it right but it does end up feeling like maps only have one perfect way of completing them so replayability is a bit lacking Luckily there are a lot of maps to choose from
its hard for beginners but its an amazing game all around personally i like that the game doesn't baby you youll die over and over and over again to get back at it tom and get to the end one step at a time
Been playing this game for a while since it was early access yet somehow I forgot to leave a review Honestly This game is very solid for a hardcore co-op experience From the atmosphere the enemies design the characters the weapons and the god forsaken difficulty that makes me wanna peel off my foreskin with a knife everything combined into a great game that is GTFO I never play this game solo but I do not recommend trying to because even with 3 other players the game is already a pain as it is unless you feel particularly masochistic then hey it's up to you
is good
I wonder GTFO stands for
Maybe the GTFO was the friends we made along the way
Undesirably screaming
GET THE FUCK OUT
really fun
esse jogo e pra ter estresse do caralho
Sweet FPS nice
Good game but the game really needs the ability to save at checkpoints as not everyone can commit to a 2 hour session to finish the bigger rundown This basically limits me to the smaller rundowns and limits its appeal overall
i hate this game
super dur mais excellent
good
AMARELO
Ok my god This game is an experience First of all game situation is that the game is fully completed 8 stages with multiple missions near 80 The game is full no dlc no skin pack to buy every weapon is unloked you will find consumable power up during your Roundown missions and if you complete the roundown you will receive a random cosmetics for your prisoner.yes you are a prisoner AI wake up you evrytime to go down in a dark science laboratoryes tunnels and more to fix the situation game is hardcore limited ammo 4 player co-op bot possibility recommanded to speak Is the dark souls of the co-op fps so good luck If you wanna feel the Alien movie athmosphere this is the right game It's a gem dont miss it Mission can be very long.and there is no save untill you finished it to summarize nothing will help you only good brothers You will make friends from all around the world prisoners now GhetTheFuckOutofmyreview
its hard but its good
Puta*n ce jeux mais ce jeux C'est dure mais c'est dure mais qu'es ce que c'est bon A croire que je deviens sadomaso BL3Shrug
This game can't be good for my blood pressure
genuinely one of my favorite games need more pve survival horror fps games in my life
Inadatto a cuori deboli richiesta molta determinazione e saggezza
Gioco estremamente punitivo fucina di bestemmie gratuite molto scarso nel fornire munizioni ma estremamente bello giocato in coop in 4 estremamente esaltante molto tattico ma richiede un gran feeling nel party Il top per un coop di alto livello Ritengo la valutazione di metacritic sia troppo bassa
you got BOYS you will never regret Buy It D
Gud 0
looks awsome and would love to play just need friends to play in but it would be cool if they had a mode just for horde defense
Este ha sido uno de los juegos que a mi personalmente me ha gustado totalmente recomendado perfecto para jugar con amigos Es un juego que si es muy bueno con amigos o con claro que puedes pero si de por si es con equipo solo Tuve la fortuna de probarlo un fin gratis y con ello de verdad estuvo magnifico viciado Si te atrae como a mi seguro muchas horas garantizadas como extra tiene historia para investigar dentro de las misiones Definitivamente es uno de los juegos que he jugado hasta ahora y vale totalmente la pena aunque espero que si lo juegas no desesperes de su dificultad porque es mucho de perseverar para ir aprendiendo a coordinarte con tus amigos a pensar y planear que hacer con cada mision que no son nada cortas
This game is honestly super fun It has a great combination of first person shooter stealth strategy and horror all rolled into one I'm kind of sad this game isn't as popular
The better payday
Why are the monsters so thick tho lmao not complaining obviously
LOVED IT
This is a really good wave extraction shooter with the right people with which you can cooperate and do missions effectively
have you tryed a stealth game relearn and come back again great challange awsome to play with friends proper voice communication is a must
Play it with your partner One character one person controls mouse one person controls keyboard It's difficult but doable and totally fun Disclaimer This play style requires solid communication and teamwork between both players We are not liable for any relationship dissolutions that may occur Or just play it co-op with a group of friends like a sane person That's fine too
1 Game devs dropped the game they won't add more content because they are making a random Payday2 copy crap this game had way more potencial if they invested in it with horror/coop/multiplayer player base increasing each day 2 Fog maps content just suck it's not like it's dark or anything similar which makes sense in this type of game you just can't see and you take a ton of damage from it Fogs that deal damage could be a feature but it's just the whole map with a fog that makes you see nothing and most of the times you can do nothing about it 3 Enemies variety 90 of the time you will face the same enemies there is a giant or scout here and there but it's still quite the same fights In harder maps some new enemies appear but the mechanics are still almost the same and the gameplay is just similar Adding maybe traps/enemies that incapacitate trap you grab you chases you everywhere breaks door sees you through doors poison you are friendly etc could be cool features 4 Progress the game has none all you get is vanity itens while winning new missions Some people like this way but others hate a few friends of mine wouldn't play because you just stayed 2h in a mission to get a mask that is just like yours but yellow so it would be cool to get new stuff/upgrades
Hardcore
try not to headshot bots challenge
Great atmosphere Great co-op experience Great game
this game is fun
very gud
solidny horrorowy shooter Gra mocno naciska na graczami oraz taktyczne do rozgrywki w mamy bardzo ograniczone zasoby Super zabawa ma do grania lubi z losowymi w matchmakingu
Thriller Game Love the emotion and the adrenaline If you are sensitive to dark and monsters DO NOT PLAY IT I warn you LOL
I haven't played much but I'm willing to play more I think this sole sentence is already enough to sum up everything I'm about to say First of all I'm your run-of-the-mill casual player I like only a few almost none these type of games GTFO is indeed one of those games which is on the difficult side I played the game in its Early Access stage before and came to conclusion of not touching it again Years later after the recent free weekend and i came to change my mind about GTFO thanks to a friend The game isn't just about being stealth you can move freely as you will as long as you know what you are doing Planning strategically or charging right into rooms it's your call and you bear the consequences of it It's still undeniably hard as I've seen my friend doing a 2-3 hours run even 4 sometimes And to be honest probably I won't do those stages XD and leave those for the hardcore players Also spears are the worst change my mind Edit This game to me is like we're both in a love-hate relationship

i am the cutest monster in GTFO
You Need Friends Sad For the most of us that makes the game impossible also sad but if you do find a way to play solo the game is very fun The Aquatic Sigma Rates This A Needs Friends/10
The best co-op survival game to play with friends no doubt
Spooky and the gameplay was engaging Recommended for friend groups that are good at teamwork
love it
good
Souls like
I have already watched Jet Li in the one and would do exactly the same sorry spoiler
omg i pissed my pants its so good
GTFO has provided some of the best tactical co-op stealth gameplay I've ever seen If you have three other friends who can work together or learn to do so lol then you'll have a great time and I wholeheartedly recommend it But there's some caveats 1 It has a horror i]theme[/i but it's not really a horror i]game[/i It's really not that scary 2 You need a party of four I wouldn't even recommend it with three the missions and difficulty are absolutely designed around having four humans I haven't played with bot companions and I don't plan on it 3 It's pretty hard and the missions can take upwards of 90 minutes with few if any checkpoints You have to be okay with losing and just enjoying the tactical challenge You won't complete most missions on the first try If those three points are acceptable to you then it's a great time The visuals and sound design are amazing Grungy sci-fi horror that reminds me of Alien The stealth mechanics are basic but effective And once you inevitably wake up the sleepers the gun fights are fun too The game doesn't really punish you for breaking stealth it's more a matter of if you can afford to expend the health and ammo The skill ceiling is crazy The only progression is cosmetic so the only thing carrying you into harder levels is your ability to improve and you will If you've played Death Stranding it's sort of similar to how you start off scared of the BTs but later come to know their tricks and how to out-maneuver them So grab three friends and go bonk some sleepers on the head And don't forget to turn your flashlights off
the name didnt lie
if you like getting bummed this is the game for you
Bad gim
Do not queue with randoms
GTFO
This is a great co op horror game It's the right amount of challenging and skill based
ASS GAME
The game is alright but the menus aren't very intuitive Also dislike the PC system but it's nice that there's always someone who generally knows how to use it I personally wouldn't recommend it though because the game gets repetitive quickly I don't care for spoken lore if there's not enough variety to keep me interested Edit Also the only way to reliably get people to play with is in the discord which is just a very bad system in general
juegazo
Poorly balanced
never played it but its probably good

Its like lethal company but deadlier
BEFORE YOU BUY This is a game heavily reliant on multiplayer My experience with it was terrible I waited 20 minutes before I ever got into a multiplayer game and that game was still missing a player This is because everyone who joined me would immediately drop the match when they saw I was a brand new player There were people in matchmaking just no one willing to play with new players To the two that did play with me thank you What a way to keep your game alive people It was pretty discouraging getting dropped on and waiting to play a game for so long I have since tried to get a refund I realized I'd never get a full lobby of people unless I had people I know in real life who own this game to play with

This game is horrifying 1st mission i do and it took me and hour and 23 mins to complete great to play with friends too love this game
I'm only getting to play with one friend so far and two other pubs who dropped The games I've played with my friend have been all kinds of fun Turn the lights off share the resources and coordinate attacks Feels good to clear levels
SSHHH SLEEPERS 0
I actually wouldn't have bought this if my friend didn't tell me too and im so glad i did Its gonna take an insane amount of time to finish this but its gonna be so worth it I think no one will ever know this game until they play it they should make a trailer thats just the sleeper mechanic because that alone pulls the entire game together without it i would not be scared although i don't know of anything past rundown 1 at all so im excited and terrified to finish this game
I really need more people to play this game It's one of my favorites The story and the environment always blows me away 3
El juego es muy pero muy bueno pero si pensabas jugar solo mejor busca otra cosa no es tan divertido solo y si quieres jugar con otras personas no encuentras partida que si uno o barios amigos lo van a comprar comprarlo adelante pero si no mejor espera a encontrar con quien juego 10 de 10 lastima tenga tan pocos jugadores activos
I died in the turtorial 10/10
Muy buen juego divertido de jugar solo y con amigos un juego bastante desafiante lo a mi parecer de lujo
Good GAME It keeps you on your toes all the time Good Graphics these mutant are fierce We could use some more rewards there and more bullets(please:D Good job developers
it kinda lit tbh
Awesome four player co-op horror themed tactical stealth shooter Comes with a large amount of levels to tackle with varying degrees of difficulty Best played with 4 people but bots can do the job for a good chunk of missions It is quite hard so be prepared to be challenged by whatever gets thrown at you
goooooood
Uma jogo espetacular pena ser conseguir pessoas para jogar cooperativo
pepesmug
El videojuego me tiene buena y maneja muy bien el tema del suspenso es algo que no todos saben hacer bien
Great game with a slight learning curve but once you get a good team together it's very fun kinda scary
Gran juego Perfecto si buscas jugar en modo cooperativo y adrenalina
GTFO can run on the steam deck LCD or OLED if you make these adjustments Another player submitted a suggestion Just installed it on my OLED 512 GB Deck Game loaded fine but starting R4A3 crashed the Deck display went black had to hard turn off On the 2nd start I changed only texture quality to half started R4A3 again and it loaded fine No idea if texture quality is related though Standard control settings with gyro are new to me but the game does work Using recommended Proton version which is 8.05 I have clocked over 800 hrs in the game 99 on Linux desktop And looks like despite the initial crash on cage drop it works well on Deck too You could try to delete the game that should clear the Proton Prefix and the shader cache Maybe that helps Otherwise the game seens to work though Unfortunately I cannot reproduce your issue on my Deck(s After I made these adjustments changing the texture quality to lowest the game performed normally on the default full screen without any issues and connected online

Gioco bello graficamente e per la perfetto Qualche bug ma niente di grave Dopo piu di 1k di ore consiglio di prenderlo e giocarlo con persone tranquille La morte su questo gioco dietro ogni porta
GTFO has quickly become one of my favorite co-op games and yes you SHOULD be playing it co-op with friends But thankfully their discord server allows anyone to jump into a game with 3 other friendly individuals and through my 500 hours of playtime I've only encountered 1 toxic player With that out of the way lets start People who are saying this game is just a stealth game their not entirely correct The game features a variety of different level designs Some having you play with little to no ammo and supplies but then there's some where you run and gun picking up ammo every room to continue blasting the enemies GTFO gives such a satisfying experience that I don't see from many games when you finally complete a level after HOURS of playing The game used to be hardcore but with the later rundowns having checkpoints it's more casual friendly so anyone can find enjoyment in it as long as you enjoy playing co-op with some fps styled combat But now that brings me to the problem of GTFO It's NOT for everyone The game is incredibly hard even with a 4 person team and it is painful after sinking 2-4 hours into a level only for your team to be wiped out near the end of the level But I dare say that makes the game more enjoyable The game kicks you in the butt numerous times so you feel triumphant when you finally kick the game in it's ass So I can only recommend this game to people who seek the challenge but there are levels and rundowns where it's more casual friendly I just played with just 1 of my friend who is brand new to the game and we completed rundown 1 together and they seem to be having fun with it so maybe I can recommend this game to everyone PS Knife is the best weapon
it's scary and hard
love
hard ahh game And thats why i love it If you want a challenge,totally recommend it
I really love this kind of atmosphere 3
Hooray In 40 hours I managed to complete the first and shortest of 8 chapters In that time I managed to list down half the team with one mine team wipe to a single giant 50 minutes into a level alert 3 scouts at once get domed by my friend's 50 cal sniper is there friendly fire in this game down half the team with.[i]suboptimal[/i sentry placement showed my friend my new outfit only to realize that he was wearing the exact same clothes list Banger game but you do kinda need friends to play it with bots are mid
make friends
20 Minuten probiert und nicht mal das Tutorial hat gefesselt
i like
After a long while i have come across a game that i found actually enjoyable
good with the squad
Work Together Die Together Repeat
Would like to be free again a great tactical co-op game
Scrathched my left 4 dead itch Just amazing and challenging
Super worth it for people that have some homies and wanna do something challenging also if u can get it on sale for less than like 25 buckaroos its super worth
Butt hole clenching but no screams 8/10
This game is so fucking awesome The mood and atmosphere the horror the story the difficulty the sheer fucking intensity just fucking awesome It has provided some of the most satisfying gaming experiences I have ever had The only issue is that you really have to have three dedicated friends to play with You can certainly find fun people to play with on the GTFO Discord but this will also result in wildly different quality of experiences I want to play this game more but I have no friends
h
Best
The game is truly exceptional with a focus on aspects like cooperation and difficulty the most important elements of the game The atmosphere it gives to the player is on another level with enemies and scenarios that don't hold your hand Not having to level up and upgrade weapons sounds awkward at first but it's definitely how it should be played Despite being known as a difficult game strategy and organization make it really satisfying to complete a level but yes you and your friends are going to die quite a lot
Au top entre pote l'ambiance est hyper cool et le jeu incroyable dur plusieurs je conseil

Well.as a single player forget it.the Bots are so bad I want to whack the bot designers in the head with my keyboard They are beyond infuriating.in fact the english language fails and I would argue you wont find anything in Chinese either As a team game with several committed mates you gona have fun But otherwise the game is tedious solo and the fun sort of dwindles Stealthing everywhere spearing things in the head gets fricking old quick.mega yawn to game play.could of offered fun exciting melee options and abilities.could of made melee decent But no Great team work game i guess.but waiting online to matchmake and what not is twatful.my main gripe is the intro trailer to this game."if you cant find friends to play.you got BOTS".LOL FUCK OFF
Played during the free weekend Even then using discord is a must in order to get a full group and to coop You don't necessarily need a mic but it's helpful for ingame coordination At least during the free weekend there were always people playing so it's not hard to find people to go with The game looks nice has interesting mechanics and if you get a good group it's real fun Don't expect a shooter game your job is to either sneak and sneak-kill or run around speedkilling things with a knife Either way a great game recommended Might buy when it's cheaper
pants are very much browner than before I played Very good
gutes Spiel

Es ist kein schlechtes Spiel und hat berechtigter weise seine Hardcore Community aber mir macht es keinen Wir werden es bestimmt nochmal probieren aber bis zur Meinung hier eine kleine Warnung mit runs meine ich die einzelnen Level nicht einen ganzen Rundown Die ersten zwei Runs haben wir ganz gut geschafft Einen habe ich nochmal nur mit Bots gemacht Es stimmt was die Fans sagen es ist schon mit den Bots Aber macht es nicht und die Chancen das etwas schief sind Wir hatten es auch das der Bot sich weigert auf die zu steigen und wir so die nicht konnten Der Run war gelaufen Manche Runs sind von den Ressourcen her so knapp konzipiert das sie nur mit bestimmtem Setup und einer Portion geschafft werden Oder mit ganz viel Erfahrung Die man im 3ten run nicht hat wobei selbst da hat man vermutlich keine Chance wenn zwei von vier Leuten sind und einen die Ressourcen kosten Wir sind alle Mann versucht also den run wieder und wieder passt die Strategie an Bis man einen weg gefunden hat wie die munition bis welle 8 reicht.(Jetzt speziell in dem besagten Run)(Viel mit Randoms Damit das passiert muss man Teile im Nahkampf was recht schnell wird Die Runs sind Puzzle Mache dies und das hast du dieses Areal und den darin enthaltenen Loot Jetzt man soviel wie leise und im Nahkampf weil wir ja sparen Betreiben Ressourcenmanagment beim Verteidigen der Checkpoints.Merken uns Punkte an denen wir Muni u co nachtanken Schauen welchen Raum wir vielleicht Richten uns Fluchtwege ein Plazieren Minen und Es gibt viel ab zu wegen An sich sehr kreativ aber auch sehr und komischer Weise trotz der vielen sehr langweilig Vermutlich weil man sich sieht immer auf Nummer sicher zu gehen und jedes bisschen Action oder Improvisation hart bestraft wird Wenn die Horde kommt wir nicht um unser Leben sondern haben Angst zuviel Muni zu verschwenden und den run gleich zum scheitern zu verurteilen Es ist ein gutes Teamspiel ein Team aus die um ihr Leben spielen einen Wettbewerb mit Preisgeld Aber eine Gruppe Spieler die nach einem anstrengenden Tag im echten Leben zusammen spielen kann das einfach ein bissl viel des guten sein Das von dem was das Spiel bietet zu dem was es abverlangt ist die breite Masse nicht attraktiv
they are in my walls
So for some reason I'm able to write a review but I don't own this game I played on a free weekend or something a while ago it was hella hard cuz I played with randos Seemed good tho lol
16 hours two levels 100 deaths great game

I suck at this game but its fun

GTFO is crazy good it is a great horror game so far i have only completed 2 levels and it took me arond 11 hours this game is cruel on you if you are a masochist this is a must have

I bought dead game for quite a lot of money If u want to play your level sometimes u will gonna w8 like 30 min to start game Gunplay has no feeling for me We will see later maybe I will comeback here
This game infuriates me on a deep and personal level I wish didn't play it I wish I never descended the Complex I wish I never heard their screams The voices would have never manifested The sweaty addiction The hours upon hours And more to come So many more to come 10/10

Great game but it's so hard to find players so I am playing with bots for now if you want to play with other player you might want to join to their discord or have friends that plays this game too

Perr4 mdre no puedo pasar el primer nivel esta bien dificil
pretty good game ngl is fun only problem that i have is that none of my friends want to play it with me but not a game problem more a me problem
It's like a intense strategic puzzle game where you shoot things It's GREAT
Do you like when your white pants suddenly turn brown Do you have too many friends and you wanna get rid of them Boy do I have the game for you No but genuinely amazing Its terrifying in a good way the UI is extremely cool and planning and being strategic with the friends is so much fun Of course depending on your friends there might be a frustration but for me I think thats all part of the fun in the experience Wholeheartedly love this game
Very good Extremely hard Original
A decent game Abit like L4D2 But more Harder and with no Mod support
Mesmo se tiver amigos esse jogo ainda muito bom Os bots ok Ajudam e atrapalham igual No fim pra se virar queria que o Bishop se empenhasse um pouco mais para colocar as minas de proximidade
good job
Playing games created by ex-Starbreeze members highlights the reasons behind PayDay 3's poor quality oh and BTW this is really fun game I died during the tutorial in just a few seconds 3
gut diese
Very fun cooperative experience if you like stealth oriented gameplay This game can go from very chill to full chaos in a few seconds if you are not careful with how you approach the levels A nice mix of FPS shooter and strategy combined into a suspenseful atmosphere Some levels can be quite challenging as well if you like games with a bit of difficulty Would highly recommend finding a group of three others to play this game with as the bots can be somewhat unreliable Overall great experience and would highly recommend 9/10
Good game but a little too hard for me and i guess i didn't play enough to leave a deep review only played it during free weekend
Watermelon
They should add a DLC to buy friends so i could play with someone
really wanted to get the F in but my friend want out just like my previous relationships
meh
not nearly enough ammo guns are as satisfying as COD
There's no combination of words that can accurately describe the kind of terror frustration and bullshittery this game throws at you P.S it's fine to use mods to make the game easier no one will judge you
i love black zombies i also like the uggly boy

don't fart In here it's too dangerous
the difficulty spike is vertical
This is easily one of my favourite co-op games Absolutely worth it if you enjoy a serious challenge and have friends to play with Tons of content excellent atmosphere good mix of stealth strategy and shooter gameplay You live and die by how well you work as a team and the feeling of accomplishment when you beat a particularly tough mission is incredible The biggest problem is bugs the worst of which can kill a run I also don't recommend solo play bots will only take you so far Eventually you'll hit challenges that the bots just can't handle like splitting up or using terminals during alarms

kool game
The game is great I've played the first 3 missions so far Ran the first one as a duo with bots and the second/third as a solo with bots Bots could be better so I'd recommend that you play with a team and you could find said team on GTFO's Discord server which is super active I'd highly recommend this game to someone who enjoys employing tactics/strategy in real time and occasionally under pressure This game is truly for those who enjoy being put into forced survival situations where resource management is key for the end of the levels which from what I've seen typically have you fending off hordes If you're not a fan of teamwork then go get the game anyway and suffer/struggle with the bots alone
amazing game incredible I'm not angry you're angry
Noice
30 of the time of me and my friend died to Hackett and Bishop
i have no comment of this game this is my taste for shure
fun and stressful
I did not get out
What if we made a game where you descend into hell with your merry band of fully-automatic-weapon wielding drug-addled schizomaniac buddies and open doors to rooms containing disfigured twerking flesh golems that will maim everything within 800m if you turn on your flashlight
more expensive then taco bell but both this game and taco bell make me shit myself
it felt like more scarier version of l4d2 it is super boring when you play alone and make you feel stifled fucking dark everywhere always lack of bullet

tres bon jeu et excellent en vr
I don't own nor have ever played the game yet here I am writing a review 10/10
Una joya que se juega en grupo
Es un Shooter Cooperativo en persona extremo con tintes de terror y ciencia Es una de las mejores experiencias cooperativas e inmersivas que vas a poder jugar Para gente que mastica gravilla y caga ladrillos Un survival en toda regla duro y desafiante Puede llegar a ser implacable con el jugador Las partidas suelen ser de larga y puede parecer frustrante si fallas al final pero si logras salir con vida pocos juegos te ofrecen la de haberlo logrado Porque amigos en este juego sino trabajamos juntos moriremos solos Worth
Great game to enjoy with friends or random players who really appreciate teamwork I experienced a sense of adrenaline that I haven't felt for a long time thanks to the difficulty of the game The fun is enhanced when you are lucky enough to play with random partners who prove to be skilled and cooperative It is important to note that this game is not designed to be enjoyed solo as the difficulty is intensified and the experience is not as rewarding as in a well coordinated team Collaboration and communication are key to overcoming the challenges presented by the game The length of the rundowns is impressive allowing you to immerse yourself for hours in the intense action of the game In addition the game's lore adds an additional element of intrigue and fascination providing a more complete and immersive experience To summarize a highly recommended game for those who are looking for strong emotions and an exceptional cooperative gaming experience
dem graphics Looks amazing very spooky lots of fun
BOMB A S S GAME
Even though I haven't given the game much time it was already clear where it was going Starts off with the scary feeling being lowered down into a cage to fight some butt naked zombies to a more slow paced action after dying a few times When reviewing the videos the game felt more alive doom like and I thought the movement was more swift Sadly it turned out to be more dry and dull I'm being chased by a horde of strange crawling monsters and walking like a model The game itself is fabulous graphics introduction mechanisms and puzzles but it felt alot like Rainbow Six Siege Extraction REPETITIVE
Exit the fucking premises
The game is just ridiculously hard just to be hard in order to get more playtime in each level It isnt good Its an unfair level of hard Also if youre solo.dont bother Bots are useless and run infront of you EVERY TIME YOU SHOOT
skill issues and skill issues aside game is fun for some because its rather niche game is pretty game is atmospheric game is cool dont let the omg the game is bad cus its boring and hard lead you away from at least trying it out once just dont expect an easy forgiving and fast paced game its neither of them enjoy 3

my only complaint is i wish the creatures were a little more forgiving about waking up cause when your teammate is having internet issues timing ANYTHING can be much harder
its hard i like
Ein abenteuerliches spiel sehr geil ihr wissen
It's a nice game if you like to try and error The first levels can be done blind and if you have some experince in games like this mostly in the first run This change extremly if you get deeper There is no realy progress like getting new weapons or so just some new outfit and more levels The real progress in this game is more the feeling of getting better and doing thinks that you couldn't even imagen in the begining You get the most out of it if you play with 3 premads Especially in harder levels it's more fun to grow together But it's also realy nice with just one other person and bots and you get most levels well done in this combination Soloing is posible and i like to do it from time to time but i wouldn't recomande it for the begining it's more a option if you have already some experince
Questo gioco ti fa uscire il cervello dalle orecchie 10/10 oggettivo
so far the game is fun worth the money discounted i have not gotten that far into the game but what io noticed is that the unlocks are mostly cosmetic where is the new weapons the upgrades the new tech the stuff to keep us all playing and making this game worth keeping alive sadly thats the only major problem i see that needs or needed to be brought into game plays well graphics are great the feel of it plays really well tbh game play ill give 7.5/10 locked into the weapons and tech with no stats ill give a 4.5/10 worth playing tho
it's not scary because of the atmosphere it's scary because it's incredibly difficult
Spoopy extremely dark and challenging half strategy half fps Teamwork is essential to survive
If you have a group to play with recommend Not for solo

my friend bought this game for me so i mean yeah it was free If you have 3 friends that like hard coop shooters and environment based puzzles youll love this game Even better play this game with 3 people you already hate and you can speed run your way to the verbal abuse If you prefer nonspecific verbal insults try playing with randos good fckn luck bro the game is hard slow and long and it'll take every opportunity it has to fk you up With a coordinated team expect it to take 4-6 hours to finish the hardest missions for the first time with guides open A lot of the guns are just bad choices and that makes end game variety go pretty stale While there may seem to be lots of weapons to choose from there are maybe 3 or 4 viable primary and 2 or 3 viable power weapons Most weapons suffer from bad ammo efficiency which renders them non viable right off the bat This is another live service done right As far as i can tell there are no micro transactions and cosmetics are earned from gameplay huge props for a dev not being a greedy pos these days one growing complaint is that the game is fairly repetitive The environment will be switched but its the same or similar situation you've faced before The puzzles do tend to be unique to the missions as far as i can tell but enemy variety is lacking

Quite the challenging game even if you've played shooter games before Very fun with friends though
Me caguei no tutorial
This game has one of the best environments and some of the best graphics I have ever seen The game is hard with no grind to get into the game It needs other people but with them it is one of the best multiplayer hoard shooter experiences on steam If you like hard game play nice graphics and have 3 other people to play with you cant go wrong with GTFO
its nice
This game genuinely takes years off of your total lifetime via stress GTFO is a great game if you want to fix your sleep schedule My friends and I at work were like almost nocturnal Then the sheer level of concentration GTFO demanded from us in just like a 3-4 hour session left us absolutely drained and we would all immediately pass out at like 11pm I adore co-op shooters in all different forms I played so much L4D2 with my friends when I was younger and still play games like Deep Rock Galactic and Risk of Rain 2 all the time However if you're like me you always crave a bit more of a hardcore experience You live for that feeling of scraping through the fight with you and your team just barely alive That's GTFO I really think it's the best co-op game I've played in a long while just something about the art the stealth the ambience and the cooperation The game feels really polished and definitely delivers an experience centered around spooky horror The game is meant to be played with friends and it delivers I'm also a sucker for super high difficulty games Your resources are scarce the enemies hit hard and the deeper into the facility you go the easier it is for things to go to sh*t The game is so punishing in so many different ways but it's very rarely ever truly unfair You'll fu*k up and make mistakes that cost you an hour of progress but you'll be smarter for it next time you drop into the compound For those who crave an extra challenge tons of missions provide optional objectives that help add to the length and depth of the rundown keeping you going in deeper for the pleasure of beating the twisted abominations the devs have thrown at you To me the game has a very natural learning curve where every level is harder than the next but each level equally prepares you for the next The game is hard been playing video games my whole life and I think this is one of the harder ones played By far the most punishing survival FPS played in years My group either quits half the time or bickers about flashlights It requires clear constant communication with execution so one player in your group just the rest There are a lot of skills and strategies to learn as you go through and if you try to learn as you go rather than watching guides or tips and tricks it is very rewarding beating levels Now true that hard unfortunately the most difficult part of the game for some of you nerds out there will be acquiring friends to play it This is a hardcore game for sure and why it feels so good to be successful Wiping on a scan after 2 hours in a level is a real risk so the whole team gets truly invested in the run and wants it to succeed Every failure hits hard but every time you make progress feels awesome By forcing players to invest real valuable time into every run your decisions really start to matter If you ever run sniper on an attempt at a hard level you know that missing a shot feels like losing a friend This kind of investment makes for great immersion You actually have to work together as a team not just all be there doing your own thing Different team members bring different equipment and take on different roles Levels like R4D1 exemplify this to complete this level you have to test adjust explore adjust and test again until every member of the team knows exactly what to do for every part of the expedition Team positioning and defensive locations tool and weapon choice sentry and mine placement speed and stealth mechanics being pushed to the limit all this comes into play and if someone makes a mistake and wakes a room early or goes down away from the group it can start a 30 minute spiral to failure extremely difficult to recover from This level of cooperation is difficult but SO much fun and so rewarding when you pull it off It feels amazing to make progress in this game GTFO takes a small number of tools and mechanics and by introducing small variations in the tasks you need to complete forces your team to come up with creative strategies that use your tools to their greatest extent to squeeze every advantage you can get out of what you have available to you in every situation In a way I would even compare this game to Portal another great game where performing tasks against your will that are administered by a mysterious voice The tools that you have to complete these tasks are fairly simple and change much throughout the game but with subtle and creative level design the way you have to use the tools varies wildly basically a hardcore horror Payday 2 GTFO is not for your casual player They've added systems to make that smoother through an opt-in checkpoint system and the boons boosters that you can equip but the game is punishing for those who don't adapt and learn to properly utilize the tools given to you But for those craving a hardcore experience that leaves chills on your arms and your heart pumping as you extract with no ammo in your guns and just 20 hp GTFO is the perfect game for you and your friends find this game will be the definition of connecting and bonding through stress and trauma 8/10
Best coop game
If you somehow get past the hit or miss matchmaking this game has the most competent randoms you'll ever get in any multiplayer game 10/10
fun co-op horror fps
DO NOT TRY TO SOLO THIS GET ON THE DISCORD SERVER AND FIND A TEAM
I have no one to play with
Oke lah ya
stealth never heard of it
good game
Its an amazingly fun Co-op game however you need 3 other friends to play with otherwise the harder levels are completely impossible to play with the bots Just make sure you pick teammates who will be cooperative and not throw your games and you'll be chillin

big thumbs up
good
Was looking forward to buying this for years then tried I the free weekend It's not my thing to put it nicely Enemy design looked cool at first but all i encountered so far was the generic enemy of the game it's large copy paste variant and generic enemy that temporarily sprouts tentacles when it stops walking Stealth broke down to crouch don't move when the thing(s glow Did like half a level with my wife my buddy uninstalled in the solo tutorial after stopping and going a few hundred times for groups of enemies that give you about half a second to walk between glowing the suspense was gone we were just getting impatient The 2 bot players were like a needle skipping on a record whispering sleepers every 2 seconds while we played redlight greenlight 100 times one bot almost woke the room early by moving when he shouldn't have Will compliment the player commands that can be given to bots though telling them to place their turret is a cool feature Died on the first alarm door waves after we ran dry on the maybe 2 clips of bullets we started with and all it felt like was the bad kind of time wasted on gaming we didn't bother giving it another go Glad i got to try it free though I'd feel pretty bad paying for what i got Heads up if you purchase this and are still on the fence half of the first level went well passed the 2 hour playtime refund period because of all the stop and go we had to do in the 4 enemy rooms Maybe it's a skill issue but my group really couldn't get invested enough to care
HOLA pinto Cuando leas esto yo estare muy lejos pero quiero que sepas que se tu secreto
The scanning laser on the sentry gun shows up in thermal scopes completely ruins immersion wouldn't recommend Get this game it's awesome
tres bon bonne ambiance
good
Excellent game strategy and teamwork focused and very rewarding feeling when successful Would definitely recommend and look forward to playing similar titles from this studio in the future
If you're into hardcore PVE with artificial difficulty frustration and with 4 players to avoid the dumb IA that make you loose this game is for you otherwise keep your sanity
This game instilled the fear of alarm into my brain
si no tienes un equipo en el que estas perdido XD
Enjoy the Slower pace of this tactical horror shooter Complete missions and escape with your friends or die trying Dark Sinister ASMR on point
this game is badass literally the definition of the best game you suck at award
There's a big dude walks too close and wakes him up big dude wipes the team with a single strike 10/10 would die again
15 1 rundown Work together or die together
if you wanna get to the very end of a map and you die because you fall through the map this game is right for you
If you love Red light Green light This is the game for you
It's the kind of game you get bored of after a few tries It's just too much effort for a game that doesn't really have any interesting upgrade system or even a progression system or tools weapons Don't get me wrong the weapons and tools feels amazing to use the gunplay it's also okay the monsters offer a challenge but it certainly not a game that you will play for any kind of progression in it However if you have 3 more friends you can play it and get some laughs or headaches But personally I don't think it's worth it if you are on your own You must play with at least 2 more friends to make it interesting Imagine a harder and slower L4Dead
Proactively getting better and better over time i highly am looking forward to some more ammo for the weapons and maybe some more combat improvements its a really good and fun exciting game to play with friends terrifying on your first play through with the new updates it has been given i can forsee alot of new players coming in as i said before though i really hope the developers attempt to make some more intense Gun Gameplay the combat is short lived with not alot of ammo id like to see it extended in a way that allows us to feel the chaos more

good with friends gift them this game then guilt-trip them to play with you my boss did that to me now i can't refuse him game is good tho
GTFO 1 👍👍👍👍
As the dude who finished Rundown 1 I feel that I do have some credibility to voice my pros and cons after being stuck trying to survive and progress for hours and hours of hardships Now this game is a serious down-bringer for those who RAGE faster than a BOILING KETTLE and people without MICROPHONES It requires upmost communication level and effective cooperation to survive Now without further ado let us list some nice and bad things about the game so far Pros This game is COOPERATIVE and CHALLENGING Involves FRIENDSHIP BONDING and GRAND STRATEGY SESSIONS Helps with your AIM and STEALTH skills requires GOOD EYESIGHT and ACCURACY Demands UPMOST FOCUS and JUDGEMENT in most situations POP and BLOW HEADS of MONSTERS with joy Involves SURPRISES and JUMPSCARES from the shadows Meet NEW FRIENDS through MATCHMAKING Guns can go BLAZING during HORDE INCOMING Cons All you feel is PAIN You cannot be RAMBO unless you are experienced and well-seasoned player Enemies can KILL you within SECONDS if you are not careful EXTENSIVE RESOURCE MANAGING you can consider it as a pro if you are good at it PROMOTES EMOTIONAL DAMAGE and RAGE if you are sensitive ofc JUMPSCARES are OFTEN if you are not careful and observant You are ONLY HUMAN after all Gameplay is mostly revolving around STEALTH depends on your team's core playstyle HIGHER CHANCES OF DYING during HORDE INCOMING again depends So far that is what I feel about the gameplay most of my time trenching and kicking through Rundown 1 Feel free to add in your pros and cons as I might have left out some factors too As far as concerned this game is RECOMMENDED to all players who wish to improve their COOPERATIVENESS LEVEL Score 8.7 10
Imma head out
molto bello di grafica e molto interessante non ho potuto provare la coop ma da prime impressioni non sembra male
Good
GTFO is not meant to solo or casually play since it requires team coordination and planning of what to do on each level If you enjoy stealth resource management along with risks here and there then you will enjoy this game Most the time stealth is the best option but when things go south you switch to gun play which is fantastic Only downsides I've personally have had are the glitches/bugs that happen especially on checkpoints and that if you don't have a group of friends then the only option is hosting lobbies on the official discord This involves playing with random people from East/West USA and even EU so ping is an issue sometimes also if the rundown is not popular or new it might take 25 min for people to join Some of the harder levels can be overwhelming when they take 1 2 hours to complete but this depends on the skill of your team and how many times you fail and have to start from scratch or checkpoint Pros No unlocks/progression on guns or equipment Good environment and atmosphere Different weapons and monster mechanics Team coordination and communication Level completion rewards with cosmetics Good community willing to teach new players No level grinding Cons Glitches/bugs may ruin the experience Long matchmaking queues Official Discord Lobby ping is rated by the host Some people might not want to talk on mics Really good game in my opinion just wish it was more popular Overall 8/10
GTFO my way review box

bad ui and bad matchmaking ruin this otherwise great game invite and play with your friends only nobody else can handle it
I absolutely love the atmosphere lore and gameplay of this game It takes focus and a calm state of mind to be effective It takes both knowledge and skill to succeed GTFO is definitely a game for a coordinated group Would not recommend playing solo or with bots unless you have a lot of time and ice in your veins The community is strong and helpful so finding people to play with is pretty easy If you appreciate a game that takes time and learning you'll have a blast killing sleepers and uncovering the insane lore this game has to offer
Fantastic game with the jump scares and the real tense moments Would definitely recommend for a friend group to dive into
Great game better with friends bots can sometimes be hard to work with
h1 h1 h1 h1 h1 h1 h1 h1 h1 h1 h1 h1 u
Ridiculously Difficult If you go in thinking this will be a cake walk hahahaha have fun dying
Great co-op shooter from the original creators of Payday Very sci-fi horror Lots of stress and tension It's been on early access for a while now so it's thoroughly tried and tested You will want friends for this although the community is good too Bring a microphone
dont touch the feeler he will rope you He will rope u bad Otherwise very fun with competent friends
Es un juego interesante bastante complicado al inicio pero muy entretenido para jugar con tus amigos
Punishing but fun co-op Definitely more frustrating than scary on the whole

Game freezes on start up Steam Deck I am unable to play
Gameplay is too slow with not much variety
couldnt play beyond tutorial because was busy but was fun
They literally buffed the sawed off shotgun's mag size from 3 to 4(but didnt change his look a weapon with a design and reload animation made for 3 bullets to have 4 bullets to shoot this must have been done on purpose and i type this review to remember this buff or an actual mistake forever
Dude the atmosphere of this game is incredible Literally every part of this game is dripping with character sometimes in the gross way
When compared to other horde shooters stealth games and games with squad-based mechanics this one manages to combine all of these features into something that firmly stands on its own without issue Enemies are well-designed in that they all have weaknesses in some way shape or form and with a little experimenting its not hard to uncover You can tell what an enemy does at first glance either through what it does how it looks or how it interacts with the environment and the same goes for tools and resources you pick up as well As you explore the level maps and sub-maps or Rundowns you uncover new difficulties and challenges that stack collectively with ones you've previously encountered the deeper into the world you go Besides that all equipment guns tools and other gear are unlocked from the start while the only things you unlock through regularly game-play are cosmetics I can't speak very well for the squad AI because its been a mix of extremely reliable or horribly unpredictable but it takes practice with the squad interface menu to use them properly Whether its playing alone or with 2 other players all it takes is a little oiling up to get used to it If you enjoy working together with others as a team science fiction horror or even just looking for a challenge this might be the game for you
Prisoners get sent to to fight the forces of evil and shit themselves doing it
2 COD MW 3 D
someone come get me im scared
fun when u do one mission of more then 4 hours with repeats
Fun challenging co-op game but does not support random matchmaking there is matchmaking but it's awful If you don't have friends your only other option is to struggle with bots or play with vets from the discord who will destroy your experience by being too good at the game that's supposed to be challenging Wish there was more tools There's 7 tools but 4 of them are just different flavors of sentries Addition edit No microtransations They could have easily sold the Rundowns campaigns as DLC/Season pass but they didnt
Tactical 4-man co-op shooter fantastic community very beginner friendly expect hardcore rules limited supplies and masses of enemies over a wide variety of missions don't expect copy pasted missions either would highly recommend voice chat and the community discord Tldr if you're looking for spooks intense fps action and an atmosphere unique to this game alone pick it up you won't regret it
tough game
A really tough co-op horror shooter Needs 4 players for best experience as there is no difficulty scaling The community is great and you can find players that way if needed Probably my favourite co-operative game right now A knock against it it does little to teach you the actual important mechanics for higher level play so you'll need to look up how certain aspects of it work to fully understand
Several really annoying bugs i came upon are 1.4th guy on team is usually not synced 2 while in preparation menu 4th guy needs to leave the game or else ready button does not appear also sometimes there are no enemies and also a bug where enemies freeze in time and dont react to anything same happens to 2 other team members while me and one of my team mates were only active and able to move also if 4th guy is not synced to you when rundown starts your game will completely bug out and you'll need to exit expedition cus everything will desync there is also bug where players loadout is not visible sometimes
yes
10/10
I like that game but you need to play it with friends who have an idea of tactical behaviour Not like mine who are a bunch of morons running around like headless chickens shooting everything at sight Then it can be fun And I find it scary nonetheless
this game makes me want to put a toothpick under my toenail and kick a wall
spoopy
Este juego es como un en la entrepierna doloroso pero sabroso
Tried this game on free weekend I love my hardcore games But this game made me realize that I like them because of all the little stuff you have to take into account to be sucessful Sometimes is just a matter of looking at the circumstances and choose the right tool Well all that is not in this game The difficulty is there just so you don't finish the limited number of levels on one go and have more playtime Just like old games back in the 90's Otherwise don't be fooled for the tacticool looking guys good graphics and style It gets old after 3h I like the labyrinth mechanic that makes you keep an eye on the signals on the wall I loved for a while the command prompter I felt a terrible sensation the first 20-30 enemies stealth killed but after a while it just a contradiction between stealth and horde shooter Let me explain Spend 1 hour going full stealth avoiding enemies or cleaning up the room just to get to a door that will force you to trigger an alarm in order to finish the level Then shoot a horde while moving around a series of points because someone thought that security means analyzed users have to move around a room while authenticating So basically is like when your boss ask you for a task and when you finish it they just throw it to the rubbish bin just because it wasn't necessary after all What about progression Well some games don't need it But this game has this game loop where is so repetitive that it just feels like a chore Finish a level after 1h and here have some pants as a reward if you don't die much because you're lucky if there is a checkpoint for the whole level Also when you finish your task before extraction for some reason the delerict sectors realize there are intruders and triggers an alarm Doesn't matter that it is abandoned or that there was a couple of shootings a fucking general alarm will trigger at the end of the level just so extraction is exciting after you clean up every enemy on your way If you die you lose you 1-2h of game and have to do all that sh1t without anything new to keep things interesting So looks good but it is really boring Also is not hardcore is just illogically unfair so you get more game time

De 1 a 10 Un 10 genial para jugar en grupo
GTFO of my ssd game made me nauseous and the combat is rather boring
2
I tried this two times and its boring i don't know why its have so high rating
refreshing and hard af coop experience
This is literary me when i GTFO
If you die its on you or the team extreme difficulty the right way
GTFO is an exhilarating gaming experience that seamlessly blends intense cooperative action with strategic horror elements The atmospheric tension combined with the need for teamwork creates a truly immersive and heart-pounding adventure The game's challenging scenarios and well-designed levels keep players engaged while its dynamic AI ensures that no two playthroughs are the same GTFO is a must-play for those seeking a unique and adrenaline-fueled cooperative gaming experience
skeri fun Great game to bond with friends and strangers DDD
i was 9 hours in and only just finished my first expedition once adding a third player great game
Great game but the latest rundown R8 broke the controller I can live with some of the minor bugs but until the controller is fixed I can't give it my approval Played everything up until R8 fine on controller but now it's broken Awful Edit turn steam controller overlay off to fix
no
i hate bot bishop
Bot Bishop my beloved
game is scary and the bots are lacking intelligence
Excelente juego Necesario si te gustan los shooters de terror
Left 4 Dead alike game But the matches take too long around 20 mins 1 hour And if you fail a Rundown you lose progress and gotta do it all over again It's kinda fun to play with friends and it's not a bad game I just don't see myself playing it alone
Its biggest problem is that most of this game is an illusion It promises to be a high-octane utterly terrifying stealth action game and its introduction really seems to live up to that standard The game literally drops you in without telling you anything all you're given is the terrified breathing of your characters as they're plummeted down an indiscernibly deep hole with ramshackle gear and a loose briefing to bring back HSU_212 figure it out once you get down there with some garbled flavor text from the last team that died The worldbuilding here is fascinating you're playing as prisoners that seem to be used by the government as cannon fodder to explore some terrible facility underground where something happened that isn't explained and you can only intuit is borderline apocalyptic The problem is that it doesn't stay this interesting after the first run or two Everything looks consistently the same the strategies for clearing out rooms stays the same and attempting much deviation from the slow process only serves to punish the players There's a lot of room for imsim elements dealing with monsters in alternative ways but the game sticks to its play red-light-green-light and hit them in the head before they alert the others formula When a monster is alerted the game ramps up to 100mph for a brief period and the tension and the guns feel pretty decent for the time they're being employed but ammo runs out fast and you can very easily soft-lock yourself out of completing a mission just by accidentally running into a monster you couldn't see and having to spend your resources on an alerted horde It perpetuates the idea of the prisoners being worthless cannon fodder by making runs excruciatingly difficult especially right at the end when the party is bombarded by swarms of monsters if they don't get out quick The problem is that the rewards for getting out don't feel very rewarding after taking such a long time generally 30-60 minutes clearing a facility and the game doesn't take the opportunity to hammer in failure very hard either Compare with Lethal Company where for once I think a game would benefit by trying harder to be a roguelike Failure just means doing the same thing again however many times it takes until you progress and progression just means doing the same thing again just this time a little harder and with maybe a new sweater or something at the end
yea it's pretty good
great game
If you're a No More Room In Hell Contagion ZombiePanic head and/or into Tactical/cool SCP this is the place to be i]bonus points for world building and style[/i Matchmaking is giga ass Shuffling the host and picking missions at random every time a new player joins
GTFO big fun
Gameplay is fun and challenging With the random placement of sleepers your strategy won't always be the same
pour c'est un des meilleur fps
Muy bueno
Just bad

GTFO is an absolute thrill ride The immersive atmosphere heart-pounding cooperative gameplay and strategic challenges make it a standout FPS experience Teamwork is crucial and the rush of successfully navigating through intense scenarios with my squad is unparalleled The game's difficulty isn't for everyone but if you're up for a hardcore challenge and love a good cooperative shooter GTFO is a must play The satisfaction of overcoming its obstacles is simply unmatched It's not just a game it's an adrenaline soaked journey that keeps you coming back for more
You're not going in You're going sneaky beaky like

Muito bom game e para jogar com amigos com calma e pensando em cada passo
bon jeu pour jouer entre ami surtout si vous cherchez une pesante et sombre Je suis pourtant pas fan du genre mais c'est toujours un plaisir quand quelqu'un sur le Discord lance un GETZEFUQUEOUTE les mecs
Muito bom mas gostaria de receber um pacote para 3 pois fica muito caro pra mim pois jogamos sempre em Marido gamer podemos fazer gameplay e ajudar com aceitamos parceria
it alright but kinda hard
One of a kind with a good story unique gameplay and mechanics The only sad thing is when it reached R8 the last Rundown they finished the game
CHARGE
the game has conversations when u take fall damage yes your friends will know
doesn't work
Fun and challenging I wish more people played this game
GTFO um jogo full coop com uma dificuldade relativamente alta apesar de ser jogar solo ou com BOTs a do jogo juntar os amigos e formar um squad em 4 jogadores pra jogar juntos O jogo bem bonito apesar de ser propositalmente muito escuro para aumentar a dificuldade O jogo tem bem bonitos e uma boa Todos os mapas bem detalhados e com a mesma ideia parecer uma abandonada mesmo possuindo a mesma finalidade tem suas em cada Rundown Dividido em 8 Rundowns chamadas de R1 R2 R3 R7 R8 No jogo um squad de 4 jogadores ou BOTs precisa acessar as e fazer as Apesar do jogo possuir a gameplay de FPS andar correr agachar e meter bala O jogo diversifica bastante com armas e equipamentos onde cada level vai exigir um loadout diferente Obrigando o jogador a trocar seu loadout e tentar passar o level novamente sim porque vai morrer Morrer e ser obrigado a refazer os levels algo muito comum visto que a dificuldade do jogo bem alta morre com poucos golpes muitos inimigos e poucos recursos que posicionados aleatoriamente quando se inicia a descida para o level por isso o squad precisa tomar cuidado e eliminar os inimigos em stealth sempre que A cada level e rundown a dificuldade aumenta e novidades strike novas formas de morrer strike surgem novos inimigos armadilhas e ambientes hostis O jogo possui uma lore e uma por de tudo mas em gameplay quase nada se quiser aprender sobre porque bem interessante legal ver algum explicando pois no jogo tudo explicado por arquivos de e largados de onde precisa interpretar e ligar os pontos strike bem vindo a gotham[/strike um jogo muito bacana pra quem gosta de e tem porque se jogar correndo e atirando vai morrer e vai conseguir passar nem dos iniciais divertido de jogar com os amigos mesmo que em certos momentos vai querer esganar seu amigo porque ele alertou toda uma sala cheia de monstros e morreram no final da
killing a scout with a knife gives infinite dopamine 10/10
Should be named BONK because you don't find enough ammo to actually use the guns First rundowns are pretty much identical not sure about later Same BONKing gameplay loop AI Did a player on the opposite side of the room stand up Well now it's time for the bot to stand up and go LOUD No savepoints in 1-2 hour rundowns Played during free weekend so excellent chance to demo No longer on my watchlist
Initially boring solo or with random players this game transforms with friends into a thrilling survival-horror-like experience The unique terminal section immerses players and coordinating with teammates for item collection adds to the fun The intense difficulty persists even with four players Recommended for those who enjoy planning shooting stealth and looting
I dont know what i expected But it wasnt this dont get me wrong its fun and all and i only did one match before refunding it but i remember being super disappointed I WOULD try it again though
boring
juegazo entretenido tiene de todos accion,suspenso,terror recomendado para jugar

Awful game terrible developer Not much to extrapolate on here Buy something else Want a horde shooter DRG will suit your needs better The extend of stealth in this game is just 5 flavors of Red Light Green Light

Quem quiser jogar so me add
Jogo muito bom um FPS tem pouca tem que saber racionar bem o que tem Fases e conforme vai jogando vai pegando a manha do jogo mesmo assim o jog se torna menos Os bixos morrem e tem horas que vem muitos deles O uso da SENTINELA muito importante
The game has a very and I mean VERY HARSH difficulty curve while you are solo'ing and is hard even with friends Now with the cons aside HOLY CRAP did they nearly nail the combat both stealth and loud combined The guns feel AWESOME to shoot the enemies f*ckin explode on the spot and man you have not felt real stress until you try to take down a Scout Game good me like
Nice Game
Not the best game out there but when it starts getting hectic it's pretty booty hole clenching
awesome game
It's coming for you
The Game is alright gameplay wise its fun and i don't mind it being repetitive But don't make the mistake in thinking its a traditional horde shooter its more of a stealth game then anything You probably spend like 30 Shooting another 30 Looting and using terminals and then 40 Doing Stealth If you are searching for an action Horror if you want a Shooter where u mindlessly just shoot everything i would recommend going to play Warhammer Darktide Game seems harder then it actually is just observe what your teammates are doing follow and take notes And you should be fine My one and only problem is actually the community and the people that play the game i can best refer to some people that play this game as Mentally Challenged troglodytes in a wheelchair Lets take a look at the loop of GTFO 1 Pick the first level because you are new 2 Wait for lobby to fill up or matchmake 3 Get in lobby and either type or tell everyone you are new 4 Either you get cussed out for being new or maybe on a rare occasion you wont 5 Play the level 6 Get cussed out for doing not well even tho you clearly stated you are new 7 In the After game lobby get cursed at by Mentally Challenged troglodytes in a wheelchair 8 Reconsider if this community is not just filled with all of those If you are lucky to have actual functioning humans on your team then congrats you will probably have fun On the opposite end if you are unlucky you will get dipshits with 9000 hours playing the FIRST LEVEL and not taking in account new players will play the FIRST LEVEL OF THE GAME i mean in my head its pretty logic but i guess logic don't come to everyone in this world
pretty good
Fun with friends Tense tactical Haven't tried with randoms but I'd love to play with more people
Macht Richtig bock Endlich ein Freund gefunden mit dem ich es spielen kann Super und geil gemacht Endlich mal ein Ego Shooter wo man mal ein paar Gehirnzellen einschalten muss Wir haben 6 Stunden die erste Ebene gebraucht Wir haben es erst zu zweit probiert und dann mit Ki spielern Ich hoffe es kommt ein 2ter teil raus oder es kommt weiter content
really great game wish i could play more tho

Get a new pair of shorts upfront and let you drop into your nightmare
Gravity Coil
good shit dude
It's a well made game but you really need a full group of friends Me and one of my mates bought it and we couldn't progress much it's very difficult and it made us lose interest If you're down for a steep learning curve and punishing game play then i'd recommend If a more casual mode gets added it would bring a lot of players back
GOOD
Good for you guys that enjoyed this game not my cup of tea tho Feels too repetitive other than that the atmosphere and sound were immaculate Recommend playing on a free weekend first before purchasing it and btw thanks for the free weekend dev very cool
Very Very fun game
Too much bugs unplayable by matchmaking Crossplatform and mobile bot spammers You say English espagnol you get faker You say French and english you get Please switch mission/server You say and Akan probably will never play one game You say Does i have to think like a bot to play this Game 1-0 game over They say game is good I agree I can't play it i use free week end to unlock R8 got 100h since then Good game unplayble on my side of view
teamwork is key but we need the key in zone 13 that has class 10 alarm stick to it
the sound design in this game is a gift from the heavens
Pretty fun game Its really fun when your friend keeps shooting things in a stealth shooter And who could've known that was a bad idea
someone gift me this game please i played it for free but not worth 27 dollar
Duo bot-less Last objective room Alarm room on accident while stealth killing to save some ammo Go back to gate Shoot some sleepers to hold them back with a precision rifle Friend places sniper turret behind you it 1 taps you Friend comes to help you You see the orange beam of death aiming at him No checkpoint Restart rundown while speechless Realize we got 0 downs by sleepers and 2 downs by turret in the entire run fun game can't wait to restart the rundown

Great game it's been one of the ones I return to pretty consistently since early access with a static team and occasionally with randoms Feels like old-school co-op games your very first run you have access to everything and consequently everything is about learning and improving your own gameplay and understanding The only forms of progression are cosmetic unlocks and finding consumable boosters that last for 1~3 runs each A lot of the fun is finding the best way to handle anything thrown at you both personally and as a team and occasionally push the limits and do really silly stuff stacking boosters It has matchmaking if you don't have friends but I would recommend forming teams via the official Discord server and as much as I hate having to join yet another Discord server for anything you end up with much better players who have also passed the filter of the minor inconvenience and also beginner's resources It can be unfair very unfair if you're on a first blind run of a level and suddenly handed a terrible curveball but that's part of the point The better you get and the better your teamwork gets you'll be surprised how fast you adapt to those surprises on the first try or you can do some looking around on how other groups approach those moments since the only randomness is in enemy and object placement The encounter and level design isn't always perfect but it typically feels very intentional and there's plenty of moments where you open a room or punch in a terminal command and just immediately know a developer set it up solely mess with you for the fun of it If you fail you just aim to demolish it the next time Ammunition economy can be very important and you're expected to do a lot of sneaking in most levels to alleviate the starvation especially when first starting out As you get better you begin to realize just how much you can get away with in melee and begin to question the need for sneaking and maybe shooting outside of alarms at all sometimes The feel of the actual shooting is good in my opinion it might be rough starting out as it's very deliberately designed to reward good shot placement and controlled bursts to consistently stagger and kill Some weapons have a much easier time with handling if that ends up being an issue As you get better you're more efficient and have more ammo to dump in the emergencies that will happen less often As for complaints/shortcomings for networking stuff the lobby system can be a bit janky but creating a new one or switching hosts typically fixes issues Since it's peer-to-peer hosting sometimes latency issues crop up but I've only ever personally had egregious issues over very long distances or specifically bad hosts I've had progress not save to the master server maybe once or twice over the years and had to rerun a level those times For gameplay stuff Rare bugs can crop up with objects becoming uninteractable or players being stuck carrying objects with a possibility of being softlocked for that run and having to restart It can be a real buzzkill but it's happened less and less often as time's gone on I still make sure I drop objective items during a checkpoint scan one fear The first go-to solution for most issues is having the affected player leave and rejoin provided they're not the host Overall been a blast and the latest set of levels has been really fun with the types of shenanigans the devs are pulling If you have the time and patience for it give it a shot
Uncompromising is the one word that sums up everything about this game the levels your objectives the foes you will face the Warden which sends you down again and again and even the Complex itself which you are sent down into You unfortunately must be the opposite you must learn to compromise with your comrades for the best of the group and for the objective you must learn to compromise when your situation becomes less-than-ideal a common experience during your expeditions into the Complex and you will compromise yourself to meet the demands of the uncompromising Warden No cost is deemed too great to reveal the mysteries of the Complex I've played this game since the first rundown during Early Access and while I missed an entire rundown and partially missed another I did get to finally fill in the gaps when the game properly released My admiration for it has never abated and I will forever sing it praises for being uncompromising during an era where game experiences are more often than not compromised for a population that refuses to meet a game on its terms This is not for the faint of heart those who seek a less demanding experience or those who refuse to work with others If you can accept that and meet this game on its terms it's one of the most memorable experiences of its kind Get in work together don't die and Get The F Out
Big Commit but pretty fun with a squad Bots require a bit too much micromanaging in certain situations which is most of them Like i shouldnt have to tell them to go quiet everytime i sneak around something else they start blasting it or anything near me when im going for stealth
I no longer have friends
Ti is a good game for sneaking and lots of fun because is it scary for some point a lot of customization fog gun and good graphics
only get this game if you have a group of three friends willing to spend a afternoon this game is not very solo friendly
10/10 will die again
I played this a while it was free to play for a weekend I found it pretty fun sneaking around and the terminal mechanic is unique and useful If you plan on buying this 1 Don't play with controller It doesn't work in settings or in general You need a keyboard for the terminals anyway 2 Play with a friend The levels are long and quiet and you can't coordinate with bots Only use a bot for a bio scanner
I was busy on the free weekend
Jogo e bom
You most certainly must work together because if you dont I can guarantee everyones dying regardless of what level you are on
muito bom o jogo gostei muito mecanicas e gameplays otimas um jogo unico nao nenhum outro igual maravilhoso
AHHHHHHH
Game is super fun It's very hard and pretty unforgiving you might spend an hour working on a expedition only to get wiped and have to start over so be aware of that and consider if that's something that would frustrate you or if you'd enjoy the added challenge and pressure the high-stakes Also it isn't a horde shooter I think many people have the impression that's what it is but it isn't the game involves stealthily clearing out areas by patiently sneaking and using melee weapons while gathering resources and objective-related items punctuated by segments of heavy action with gunplay I've read a lot of people saying they had issues with the in-game matchmaking system but it's worked great for me and I've never had an issue finding people to play with using it I only got into the game in December of 2023 so maybe they've fixed the matchmaking issues others who played before me have reported It is best to play with friends but if you don't know anyone who plays you should be able to get pickup groups together that are adequate So yeah I'd recommend it with the understanding that it is difficult requires patience and deliberate stealth a slip-up might send you back to the beginning of a run and it isn't a horde shooter As long as you know and understand that you should have a good time
I try and I fail Cool game though
I did not in fact get the fuck out I died a lot Discord is a must join their server full of fun guys and amazing gamers Can't wait to get back into it once I can and complete everything again
Guter Koop-Shooter weniger Horror aber gute Man sollte das Game allerdings mit 2-3 Premade Kollegen spielen die mental leidens und sind Ressourcen sind meist rar was es notwendig macht Gegner leise mit Nahkampfwaffen zu und sich vor einzelnen Missionen abzusprechen wer welche Waffen und Werkzeuge mitnimmt Die Level sehen meist ziemlich gleich aus da die Entwickler viele Teile recyceln Auch bei den Gegner sieht man 95 der Zeit immer die selben 4 Typen Allerdings gibt es auch Monster mit anderen Schwachstellen oder z.B unsichtbar Insgesamt aber klare Empfehlung
C'est bien
pendant le Weekend gratuit ma seul critique manque de contenu armes mob etc sinon on s'est vraiment c'est pas facile et tant mieux
Arguably the most stressful yet fun PVE game I have ever played This game is hardcore af If ur the type to give up easily then it's not for you Teamwork and communication are crucial

Love this game
Game itself is good however it is almost impossible to play solo due to the nature of the missions and im ok with it but at least give me decent ai bots but no seems like im asking too much if you have 3 friends with this game ok if you don't dont even bother buying it

I really had fun playing GTFO these past week when it became free to play loved and enjoyed the game aside from the little hiccups of bugs and glitches its just a little so no worries Though to broke to buy it right now
1
I personally enjoy it more then Left 4 Dead Totally different types of horde shooters but I prefer the more punishing mechanics of this one Definitely one of the better coop shooters i've experienced
super fun and spooky but dont play with bots they will cost
its amazing
Unforgiving Uncompromising Unrelenting You will not consistently succeed You will fall You will slip and it will cost you You will try again And again Your teammates will need to be alert 24/7 This isn't Left for Dead Its not Call of Duty zombies You need a team with the coordination of a raid You need to think You need to plan You need to make sure every shot heal and action counts It punishes you And all you'll want to do is try again Amazing
Pros The graphics look nice The performance is optimised Cons No lore or cut scenes Constant searching for loot just to get garbage items that dont help fight waves like flashlights glow sticks and lock breakers Always running out of ammo Weapons just dont have 1 hit potential Headshots dont do extra damage for mobs that have the most health it just incentivizes spraying the mob in the body isnt satisfying to kill Lack of mod varity just the same ones over and over again Fog viability is horrendous cant see an inch infront of you in most rooms Fall damage barely jumping off a small height Menu is mediocre learning curve to it The text in this game has a double vision effect to it just makes it harder to read the objective The objective doesnt overlay when using the console This is the one time you need to know the exact item you need to copy it in the terminal requires you to memorize and go back and forth in the game to just type it in Deploying turrets is slow and you have to stand still for interacting with anything zero movement skill is promoted Music blasts you on startup every game does it tbh Also why does switching the game to another display require restart I never had to deal with this ever

Sleeper aint sleeping bruh
Excellent to play with friends plan strategies and iterate 10/10 would recommend
20/10 y god
this game is so bad that every time a free weekend comes up my friend mentions it to torture me
I love it but holy hell is it difficult 10/10 game I hated it
yes
Pew pew
i never got the fuck out
it'd be awesome if i had 3 friends who wanted to play it
barely scratched the surface just came off free weekend but very enjoyable niche coop shooter Punishing shooter with hints of stealth secondary careful resource management and complimenting loadouts One of my favorite parts of the game is that you have all weapons/tools unlocked from the beginning so you can play around with everything and see what sticks update at 60 hours i still have no idea what im doing man but the game is fun

I am ashamed to say that I have even downloaded this game

This game slaps enough said
Devo ter morrido umas 25 vezes na primeira fase

Play it with guys who are not drunk Took my group 3 days to win a single mission Cool game tho D
very good gmae yes very pwew pew kablooey there goes the zombie that turns into black poo and and i like how the um melee can kill and not sometimes notify the other enemies which i like and also hoiw they dont hear doors cases and lcokers open so free loot and escape yipeeyyyy
This game became one of my favourites I can absolutely recommend it to you It may seem a bit hard in the beginning but when you figure out what weapons you like and mechanics of this game it becomes quite easy with the right team The communication is the key Matchmaking is dead so just go into the discord in LFG chat and find playmates The things I like Lore Art style and level design Enemies Stealth mechanic Some weapons are quite fun Exploding heads of sleepers
I only played this game because it was on free weekend but this is cool The game is really hard and punishing since in the 10 hours i epxerienced i didnt win a single expedtition I recommend playing with friends since this is a game about stealth and communication most of the times

jogo PUTA de bom recomendo
It's like super mario bro's nintendo wiiu but really easy
It's fucking hardcore and I love the atmosphere but you absolutely need friends to play
The atmosphere and experience that GTFO provides is a testament to the abilities of this development team The cooperative experience that tests each member and the whole simultaneously is incredible especially with a core team of friends that love a challenge The dread suspense and horror of the rundowns is palpable The way you are quite literally plunged into the environment and lore of the world left to crawl around learn and explore its darkest secrets is exquisite The interactions of players in this game are honestly a breath of fresh air I have genuinely enjoyed interacting in this community Lastly the Devs have done a fantastic job throughout the early access faze and continue to listen to the community and provide solid substantial updates Also the engagement with the community and communication overall has been an example for others to live by 10/10

The Best Ending for a great Game
Duro como la p*lla de un cura en un patio de colegio 9/10
Got it when it was free went to play it again a bit later and it wouldn't open cause I never bought it Load of horse shit
i need more content like gun modifications or more guns or put down the big flashlight btw fix your shotgun it feels like a blunderbuss
It is a fun game but it gets boring pretty quick because of missions i don't wanna search the whole damn place for 12 ID cards bruh i would love this game if it had actually good missions
muy bueno Lo recomiendo si jugas con amigos Si no amigos no te lo recomiendo
This game is really fun and pretty difficult
The stealth is boring and its 90 of the game at least in the first couple of missions i played with a friend It consists of a red-light green-light mechanic The intent was suspension but its so easy and flat that its transformed into a chore One reviewer mentions it gets more action-y later on with harder missions but after stealthing around for 7 hours i got tired of trying to have fun Also the second mission i tried was so obscenely long we spent almost 3 hours on it just running around the map looking for keys and opening doors There's potential in this i just cannot recommend it based on my own experience P.S The game performs amazingly Magic No stuttering
PAIN
muy chulo me recuerda un poco al left4dead pero mucho currado a nivel de todo un poco serio a nivel de sigilo y estrategia pusieran alguna oferta para comprarlo porque solo lo y me mucho

Al jugar este juego con tus amigos te recomiendo poner reglas al abrir las puertas para que no te dejando sordo al gritar APAGUEN LINTERNASSS NO TE MUEVAS NO ABRAS ESA PUERTAAA Este juego requiere de mucho sigilo y la es oro y un solo error te puede condenar por el resto de la partida A mi parecer es un juego que requiere paciencia pero lo que mas me encanta de todo es escuchar a los tontitos de mi grupo gritar a todo y que de vez en cuando se empiecen a disparar entre si
my laptop use amd ryzen 5 6600H can not handle the game the fps too low to be enjoyable even with low setting thankfully i downloaded the game when its free for a few days so i am not losing too much
good
Ce jeu dans ma wishlist alors je me suis quand j'ai vu qu'il free pour le week end Ma joie s'est le jeu est sombre trop sombre les serveurs Inexistants pas de gentils Mr ou Mme pour faire des games les bots sont stupides souhait on a des armes mais on ne va jamais s'en servir bref de la wishlist
I'm writing this review at 2 AM and right after a 5 hour session with 4 players one play swapped another since they went to bed so technically 5 Be warned in my honest opinion this game really requires friends to play Randoms can be fun but the amount of coordination and communication required to succeed would make it very difficult to play with people you don't know If you want a challenging co-op horror shooter that feels fair and BS at the same time This games for you I will update this more as I play but so far I have completed roughly 5 missions and each one has been extremely diverse fresh and enjoyable with no two objectives feeling the exact same Each mission has its own unique objective and for the few that share the same objective feel completely different with unique level design and varying puzzles to conquer The slogan for this game is Work Together or Die Trying and they really mean it This game even with 4 friends using discord requires so much planning setup and coordination it feels extremely rewarding every time you extract from the mission with everyone alive If you just try to rush in with no planning you will die horribly If you don't try to sneak and work together to take down large hordes you will once again die horribly Not only is it a phenomenally difficult co-op game but its also extremely fair and respects your time Every time you complete a mission for the first time you are granted with a random cosmetic item Every time you complete a mission in general you are rewarded with a randomly selected perk that can give you buffs with some can even be so strong the can hinder stats IE More turret damage and faster reload but you take more melee damage Which allow for even deeper build diversity and deeper strategies All in all I would rate this game a solid 9.5/10 Sometimes the melee can feel jank and the darkness can be a little annoying but good god this is one of the most rewarding games I've ever played with friends

This game needs heavy balance what the dev's think the game is and what the reality The grapic engine is not nice Honestly Almost not average.even of full of everything Rog strix scar 17 with ryzen 9 and rxt 4080 bla bla bla I played only one game after the tutorial so broken The run turned into chaos There is always a tension carried by the levels As you progress the tension raising Simply couldn't get into the feeling of the game because it wasn't optimized What The tension Tried things but i didn't have enough time to figure out due to the mates who running ahead constantly There was no chat surface to tell them iam new and need some time to realize what is what and how to feel comfortable with things i don't recognize immediately The game should warn us that we doesn't have enough ammo to just shoot to everything The environment didn't give back the feeling that we are in dark so needs to be aware of the things lurking in the shadow They're just coming and done There was no sign of the wave strength or i just didn't see it There was no feeling at all to enjoy the wave which coming at us Needs heavy optimization at how the waves are being tailored Needs tension optimization such as which wave considered as the warm up and which one is the final challenge Warn us to important things such as team work at carrying items for the teams sake Warn us to be cautious about how to play a wave and gives us recommended settings or game style to let us enjoy YOUR GAME So the most important part if a game looks absolutely average like GTFO does then the game itself should have the most powerful play experience to harmonize the weak part of the game itself in return Look at counter strike A team based game Absolutely focusing on team based game style where your life matters In CS if you die for nothing or being a total dumb your risk the whole team fail and you will be kicked out of the game in no time In GTFO there is no surface for the team management but you advertising its a team game HOW In a team based game i want to see my mates I WANT TO KNOW WHO IAM PLAYING WITH I WANT TO KNOW WHOM I HAVE TO RELY WITH This is A FUNDAMENTAL CORE OF A GAME WHICH OFFERS A HEAVY TEAM BASED GAME EXPERIENCE Every aspect of the game whispers to me that core thing in the DEVELOPERS HEAD is simply not clear to how build up an experience where we are related to our team based ACTION'S THIS IS A CORE ELEMENT Absolutely missing Totally felt that this is a non existent thing I didn't feel that iam playing a team game where WE ARE A TEAM at all So the grapich thing the darkness have a meaning works fine with enough light sources LET ME EXPLAIN THIS as you know the horror element/part of the tension i was talking about earlier simply doesn't applies when you turn the game into darkness The horror part of game is not because there is darkness in it We should clearly see that dark areas what covers something/corners or the spawning entry point of the wave invasion and not the entire game Light stick's doesn't have enough potential to simply even worth to thinking on using it DOOM 3 The darkness worked because we had enough time to react to each pre-programmed events and enjoy the horror what lies ahead In this game the horror DOESN'T WORK Not for a second I see nothing or barely anything the light sticks gives almost nothing and the flashlight is just something if almost like nothing A team SHOOTER GAME in horror play style Don't try to force us to feel the horror during the wave progression When the monsters are gone just use your tools to build up the tension by creating a RICH AND DETAILED ENVIRONMENT I SAW NO DEAD FOLK'S to look at.nowhere What if not the dead bodies gives the feedback to you in the very basic of our instinct to feel your life is at risk No empty magazines on the ground bullets Nothing I SAW BASICALLY nothing which let me feel that iam in the middle of the horror what the game offers Almost empty rooms almost empty game This is not all about the engine Even if a game engine is average or less you can still can create a rich environment using things what absolutely fits to the dungeon environment THIS TOOL IS FREE ITS BEING CALLED CREATIVITY I think its more than enough to cover the weaknesses and gives the right feedback to a game such as this one My opinion/final verdict if you want to create a team based monster/zombie hunting game where the team actions MATTERS you have to reconsider the core elements of the game MORE ROOM FOR MISTAKES OUR MISTAKES NOT YOURS MORE ROOM TO FEEL THE GAME ITSELF MORE UTILIZATION FOR TEAM UI surface for the team management Yes i'am aware of using voice chat is what matters in nowadays Chat surface is not trending MUSIC Well if there is one or more just simply didn't hear it or forget that immediately due to other things
hay ocasiones en las que es es realmente frustrarte pero cuando completas una realmente es satisfactorio en esa sabiendo que si cometes un error y todos mueres perdiendo con eso todo el progreso hay encanto
this game really difficult u need to have a good teamwork to clear every stage
Its Joever We're so Barack
Pretty hard but if you're decent with strategy and you know vaguely ai how the works it's not super hard Bots are decent but useless for stealth save for an occasional bum-rush if you fuck up Defs wanna have friends to play with though because it does get a bit bland playing solo Really fucking fun though especially if you enjoy difficult games

Tried the game out for the free weekend and loved it The creepy cyber aesthetic is well crafted into all parts of the game most surprisingly in the intro and lobby screens A lot of work has gone into crafting its surreal and cohesive style High quality game and great multiplayer fun definitely worth it
hard but fun
my friends told me to GTFO but i didnt realise what they said until i played the game
In my opinion The game is very good and quite fun difficult but what I like most is that you must play as a team and you must also plan a strategy very well so that you and your team come out alive since I thought that the The game was easy but it is not and despite not having had the opportunity to play more I recommend it for those players who want a difficult challenge and who want to learn what it means to work as a team
good
This game is loaded with content and is a blast to play with friends No micro transactions or unnecessary grinding to unlock weapons Atmosphere is awesome and immersive as well Thank you devs
I thought the game looked good like that you were able to load out the 4 man bot however you liked We were short a real 4th man Did not like that I could not change controller button mapping So on that note I'm gonna thumbs down Refunded
got it for free on the 10th now I can't play it waste of gigabytes fuck you
the quality is good the horror is there storyline is amusing(ish but this game is not for me the stealth is little bit clunky i don't like how the equipment(ammo health etc gimmick is presented here every ranged enemy got magic missile the gunplay is leaning toward DMR stuff automatic and shotguns weapons are pretty weak the overall it's more like annoying rather than hard potato pc friendly btw
10 10
Tbh the game is fun but even when y'know what you're doing it could still take an 2-3hours just to finish one stage
fun
stealth is for pussies
Played during free weekend Boy do I have some opinions about this game and almost none of them are positive Right into the nitty-gritty I'll start by saying that this was possibly one of the most boring-out-the-gate co-op games I've ever had the displeasure of playing The atmosphere seemed so good The weapons looked so neat And then we actually started playing Eugh If you approach this game using stealth it is hours of crouch-walking up to enemy standing still when they light up then whacking or stabbing them when they calm down That's it That's the whole gameplay loop until the game locks you into shoot-out sections at doors that trigger alarms and then proceed to send waves upon waves of mooks after you as you are forced to either scrunch together which is frustrating due to friendly fire or spread out and stand on individual buttons which sorta defeats the point of co-op altogether considering you're kinda boned if you chose to build around being supporty After some research it seems like the popular way to play this game is more like a quake-esque movement shooter but with hammers If you don't know or simply can't b-hop and kite effectively Well sorry dickhead get good It's completely antithetical to the feel and presentation of the game yet it seems to be the most effective way to play To get into some more specific complaints/observations 1 The guns don't feel consistent Even with low ping no packet loss no rubberbanding etc I found my guns damage to feel completely random What would kill an enemy in one hit would sometimes seem to take entire clips A shotgun might paste one sleeper and then just tickle the next A sniper rifle might tear a an enemy in half in one shot then take six shots just to visibly wound the next 2 The enemies seem to just decide they're particularly pissy sometimes On several occasions my friend and I would do the stealth shuffle up to an enemy wait while they imitated the Las Vegas strip then they'd thwack us before they'd even played their get-up animation Or the whole room would suddenly jump up and swarm us Nothing in particular caused it No one shot a gun No one was walking No flashlights on No alarm went off It just sorta happens 3 Consumer-hostile design elements I'll be blunt with this one Heat-seeking projectiles from enemies Frame one damage from enemies Extremely long attack ranges from melee-oriented enemies Attacks that seem disjointed and actively misleading It's all here Every obnoxious element put to a video game enemy All in one package Astounding 4 Absolutely no sense of progression It's been said you start the game with access to everything except the artifacts Artifacts are single-use buffs that for the most part genuinely seemed worthless Maybe my friend and I just never actually found one of the good ones This might be fine if the gameplay loop weren't so shallow In summation my time with GTFO really helped explain why this game seemed to drop off the face of the earth Frustrating unbalanced annoying It gained a niche community of speedrunners and that seems to be all it wants
Great game Difficult AF but with 3 friends is a blast Game graphics look awesome and the atmosphere is amazing I just hope that there is a way of reducing the difficulty when playing solo or less friends
This game is hard af Boy
O jogo bom mas na minha ele poderia ser um pouco mais
its gud
intense
yes
Ta bueno
70 10/10
One of the hardest games out there but I keep coming back for more pain
Played it during the free to play period and found it enjoyable to play with friends plan on buying it soon
Im out
get the fog out
this game is gud very detailed
Free Weekend Baby
Soft no I actually really like a lot of what this game has It is genuinely tense Until it isn't because it's genuinely repetitive in a way that you can barely vary up between avoid crouch-to-smash or walk-to-smash forced fight The individual elements are all really great They just don't tie together into anything compelling for a co-op experience overall This game would be be better suited with sleepers who somnambulate about sometimes the spawning is randomised but incredibly static the enemy design demands constant waiting and trying to position all members of a team just to do a co-ordinated strike loses it's panache when that is the only ideal thing to do If they do a GTFO 2 I hope they address these issues That or we'll have to send them a box of glowsticks
Played the free weekend it is an enjoyable game for the most part The ambience is fantastic and is quite a challenging game to get to grips with in a good way It is a bit buggy with dsync issues in game lobbies where the ready up button disappears and infinite drop screen loading There also needs to be a vote kick function in lobbies as there seems to be a few time wasters getting their kicks not readying up Would play again but not at the current price
o jogo absolutamente excelente graficos incriveis jogabilidade boa cumpre o que promete
Tried on free weekend Repetative kinda boring Maps are not procedurally generated as i've thought only loot objectives and enemy spaws are Gameplay emphasise using stealth a lot but it's very clunky and feels unfiished Also my E button bugged in 1 game so couln't do anything Heal interract place turret Online found out it's atleast a year old Was expecting more from this game Atleast the visualst and style are superb Meh not buying
super coool
silly silly fun
I HATE this game
good
me and 3 friends tried this game on a free weekend I liked it 2 guys said meh and the last one disliked it Because of that he didn't keep stealth and we always got in fights and couldn't complete first mission after like 6-7 attempts I decided to buy the game and play with randoms from the gtfo discord 2 absolute new guys and one decent guy We clear first mission first try quickly and mostly stealth I now like the game even more Would recommend but you need a 3-4 player party with voice chat
Very fun and challenging game get a group and play Has a bit of a learning curve play the A tier missions first if you're new
So you have made me an addict over the free weekend trial and i sadly will not have enough to get this masterpiece you MUST feed me with more this cannot be a first times free T-T
I'm ready to die
just let me know when you guys are ready to sell this for 10 cause ain't no way i'm getting 3 other people to buy it for any more then that I've been waiting since 2019 and I will keep waiting until it is Thanks
banger with friends impossible without 0.1 of players have beat the tutorial according to the steam achievement tracker
Great F Game
Very fun and has a good type of spook
Bloody punishing A challenging but satisfying game for those with incredible patience determination as well as the ability to communicate and co-ordinate Cave heads in and shoot unsightly monstrosities with your friends or unadvisedly strangers Prepare to spend most of your time creeping around in the dark saying I'll get this one and Three two one Probably not for everyone but once you understand the basics this game becomes very addictive Subscribe to the discord and find people to play with as using the matchmaking option should be considered a form of self-harm
Sneaking around is gay then when the enemies come you run out of ammo after 2 waves game is trash Uninstalled that crap weeks after is came out haven't played since over hyped bull shit I like scary sci fi shooters this one is dark and annoying
7 Hours to complete one map 👍
If your friend says they play video games to relieve stress and they play this THEY ARE LYING
good
Took me 9 attempts to finish the first operation 10/10
h1 High maintenance tomboy goth gf h1 Absolutely amazing theme and immaculate atmostfear wink wink Tis a shame that the high skill floor and somewhat frustrating gameplay loop makes it frustrating to stick around and learn the rope Good thing tho everything is unlocked for you since the moment you load in so the grind is non-existent thus the only thing you should look forward are the runs themselves It filters casual players like me and thus ultimately miss out on an otherwise impressive rare feat of a coop shooter A true horror coop shooter Every rundown is an intense encounter The game makes us feel like we are truly the worst scums of the earth being sent down to our demise Suicide Squad be damned Looking forward to their next game Den of Wolves
my brand new addiction
Ir a lo loco no sirve
Muito divertido pra quem disposto a primeiro ler um tutorial online de como usar os computadores E o tempo de carregamento de cada super demorado frequentemente mais de dois minutos Fora isso um demais
Del cristo del cristo del can de Dio
the game is fine nice graphics BUT the game is not really for solo players and just want to have some fun the game is crazy difficult im not talking about fighting difficult but the mechanics itself and synchronization and teamwork is a must and you can't get that if you are playing with random players me and my friends beat the very first stage for like 2 hours or more xD and imagine like playing the first map for almost an hour then died at extraction all progression is gone and you have to start on the beginning again and that's terrible scks so yeah this game is for hardcore players only xD
funny zombie game make me sheit my pants
I played this game in a weekend when it was free with a friend and we loved it We were not that good at the game and had to restart the mission a lot of times but we made it through the first one The aesthetic of the game is amazing and we became a bit anxious when we went down the first time and the second time and the third time.Okay it was scary a lot of times The enemies are great although we found it irritating that they were crawling so they were harder to hit They still look like humans wich makes them more terrifying Once we were dropped into the facility we had already tried to theories what the lore would be because the games makes you currious For me the game is very hard but that is the point of it It is hard to survive from these monsters and that makes it challenging That is why we came back after our first night playing Overall this game was realy fun to play and me and my friend enjoyed it very much
either you're quiet and survive the loud encounters or you stumble around shooting anything that moves and make it out with only 2 HP either way its a fun time
i didnt get to play
Aufjedenfall mega geil Taktisch und Stealth vorgehen so wie man erwartet hat Wenn man ist reicht 1 Mission mit Freunden am Tag KEKW
Even though this game was only available for free the weekend I played it and I was terrified the entire time This is a good thing The concept is very interesting and my dad remarked that it reminds him of the game Stalker it's fun and replayabilty is at a medium considering you can get new looks for your character The sleepers are scary and the scouts are scarier may you get the fuck out
Very epic
rly fun game actully to play with friends also not that ez need to work as a team and yeah its rly fun
Jogo para jogar mas o server cai toda hora ou trava e volta p inicio do jogo
VERY COOL VERY SPOOPY friends required levels are hard and bots are not smart enough
If your idea of a fun shooter is trying to shoot as little as possible then this game is for you I am not that person
The only time u don't have to PRESS AND HOLD is when u uninstall this garbage
I've played my fair share of 4-player co-op shooters all the way back from Left 4 Dead and Borderlands up to and including Payday 2 Killing Floor Deep Rock Galactic and Warhammer 40,000 DarkTide and never once have I experienced a game that is as openly hostile and hates its own players as much as GTFO GTFO much like the previously mentioned shooters throws you and three other people into a mission where you have to accomplish a specific goal while at the same time trying to survive against waves of inhuman horrors who want nothing more than to eat your face What sets GTFO apart from the others however is its unwavering commitment to punishing players for even the tiniest mistakes The basic premise is that you are one of four death-row inmates who are being sent into an underground facility overrun with sleepers eyeless monstrosities that are otherwise docile but can react to sound and bright lights and uses a strange echolocation twitch to try and spot you You are therefore incentivized to crouch and sneak around and take out these creatures with melee weapons like knives spears or hammers but even those weapons create noise so if two or more are right next to each other killing one can alert the others and so you have to work together and kill them in sync There are also bigger variants that require several hits to take down so you need to have more people hit the same enemy at the same time but here's the catch missing any of these even just by a little bit will cause them to shriek and alert every other sleeper nearby and this cascades into forcing you to use your firearms alerting even more sleepers and now you've spent a considerable amount of your preciously scarce ammunition Getting hit also takes out considerable chunks of your health and the only way to gain health back is to patch yourself up with med-packs which you also have to scavenge from lockers and lock boxes Speaking of resources You start with only a fraction of the ammunition and tool charges you can potentially carry the rest you have to find scattered across the map They consist of ammunition packs tool refill packs and med-packs but they aren't full either and can contain up to but rarely 5 charges and 1 charge only replenishes 20 of a given resource That in itself isn't a bad thing but here's something that really pisses me off You cannot stack the charges if you find two of the same kind AND you can only carry one pack at a time You also cannot leave the packs on the ground which means you cannot stock up on these extremely important resources in locations where you know you're going to need them You can either spend them on yourself and your teammates or swap them out for another resource sitting in a locker or lock box There's no way to stash them anywhere and what you get is pitiful to say the least So if you get hurt pretty badly in a firefight and you go from 95 health to 35 health you can't spend a med-pack to get back to 100 you can spend ONE charge to go from 35 to 55 which is worth like 4 hits from a sleeper Making a mistake in GTFO is unbelievably punishing because it will consume significant amounts of your resources and it can even end a mission Missions that I need to remind you can take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours or so I've been told My friends and I decided to try out GTFO during the Free Weekend in December 2023 and only ever managed to get to Rundown R1C1 which I think is probably the one mission that will deter most people from playing this game It's a wave defense mission where you have to protect yourselves against waves of sleepers as you try to restart a reactor The problem is that this takes a long time and the game throws an unreasonable amount of sleepers at you and gives you almost no time to recuperate and restock between waves and when the waves are finally over you still have to return to the exfiltration zone which is quite far away and the mission will still throw enemies at you all the way At this point we were all running on 20 health and basically zero ammunition in any of our weapons and we managed to get overrun a few meters away from the exit 30 minutes down the drain It was at that point that all four of us seasoned shooter players with many hours in shooter games decided that this game was being unfair and we collectively uninstalled the game The reason I'm giving this game a negative score is two-fold 1 For all the care and quality put into this game which both looks sounds and feels great to play there are still a lot of gameplay design decisions that seem straight up stupefying and designed to deliberately dick over the player like the aforementioned way the resource packs work and how punishing the game is for even the smallest mistake The enemies hit too hard and you can hardly even patch yourself up if you manage to survive the onslaught 2 Unless you have at least three other friends who enjoy intense and tactical shooter games and are willing to spend 1 hours on it with matching time schedules you are going to hate this game as you do NOT want to play this alone or with bots or with random people you find on a Discord server somewhere unless those other people are already seasoned GTFO players Because teamwork is not only necessary it is paramount for you to even have the remotest chance at success And looking at the player count for this game and it hovering around the 500-ish daily players that is seems like a very small selection of people who are probably all in their own private matches anyway The game has potential but it also just feels like the game hates its own players guts and does everything in its power to deter anyone but the most hardcore masochists
Play with friends.the A.I is in kahoots with the sleepers
4 Stars game Smart and unique NOT scary tho but Challenging Matchmaking is BAD and nonpunishable Hard to learn
a game that requires you to be social and not only is it really fun its also extremely difficult
This is one of my favorite games I really love it
GTFO is a game where you and your pals have to work together for real and not just two tap that one friend like in DRG like you HAVE to work together or risk getting rip a new one also be sure you know how to com and not blast smoke alarms via soundpad 10/10 great game if you have 2 or 3 dumbfucks to play with
Das Spiel ist der Hammer
its fun
Game is fun
You are not the player you are the prisoner and this game will punish you The game is unnecessarily complicated with mazes like map layouts command prompts like terminals and a trial-and-error style of learning to win The complexity doesn't add depth and gratification from problem solving instead it makes for a slower game For example the command prompt is neat and I like it but it can be confusing at first without more hints there are many commands to remember and it can be too time-consuming I'm not asking to be spoon feed but it could be simplified a little like having a universal terminal instead of having to use a specific one for different sectors By the time you get the hang of the game such as knowing how to efficiently take out sleepers and other special enemies using the right tool for the job in order to conserve health ammo and time the game feels repetitive since the tasks are so similar as are the dark dingy maps I don't think i'm the only one who is sick of having to backtrack their steps because we hit another dead end and now we have to walk along all the walls of the area to ensure that there isn't a door out of sight that we might need otherwise we have to walk back across the map to a door that we had to skip earlier A team can use some tactics but it's a disappointingly limited amount for a hardcore game Even then it doesn't matter that much The stealth component is important part of this game but it is basic and overused way too much Just crouch turn off the flashlight and knife them when they aren't glowing Yet you can still get what feels like random argo alerts from anyone in the room There is no skill in this stealth it's just being patient and doing it the correct way After doing it so many times it becomes boring and you just want to waste your ammo and shoot them all instead The matches are long enough as it is I don't want to be crouch walking that much Matchmaking never took me to maps that weren't dark uninspired underground maps so that got tiring Matchmaking in this game can be a pain as it's difficult to find a full team You have to keep manually going through the menu and clicking search after it stops on its own You have to keep searching over and over again until the game finds a full team of four Even then it's hard to find a team that knows the winning formula and won't quit There is a nice option in the menu that if someone does quit the host can replace them with a bot if you know where to look for it in the menu Although the bots aren't as smart as a real player Having the right teammates and the right gear are important components of winning Not having the right item on your team can determine if you can win There's a good selection of gear but it can be difficult to differentiate the essential gear from the non-essential for newcomers If you don't have the right melee weapon then you can't eliminate sleepers without getting caught or if you don't have goo then you might not be able to prevent getting overrun on a huge rush and so on Also I don't like how its always a surprise if its going to be a big wave or a small wave so you can't prepare accordingly The game is hardcore but where is the softcore mode It isn't fun if you can't find players who know how to win a difficult game A casual mode should be an option at least for new players A classic run-and-gun mode that doesn't feel so slow isn't so task-oriented and you don't have to worry about ammo supplies or getting shot as much Why so serious Do yourself a favor and read a guide on how to win so you don't have to take the time to learn the hard way The game is okay but I would rather play Alien Swarm which is made by Valve and its also free
God one of the best multiplayer games out there
10 10
Game is real fun but from the crazy amount of bugs totally overshadows that part Since most missions take about 30-60 minutes to complete getting a bug such as extraction area not existing is extremely frustrating Another bug we've occured was simply dropping a battery on the floor and then not being able to pick it up When these bugs happen you get softlocked and can't continue so you need to start over If the developers would fix their game I would recommend it
Tried the demo of this didn't find anyone on mm waited 30 minutes and was on the top level as the further you go down the harder it gets My main issue that I have with this game is doors opening a door you get a slight delay in audio but then a door is being closed even if you are not looking at it or near said door you get a slight fps and audio drop until the closing animation is done Now this could be due to me running on a 2 year old laptop not to sure tbh Lot of people have brought up that there are some optimization issues but take it with a grain of salt This game is hard and I think that is good because it really shows if you arent thinking about what your doing such as positioning focusing on certain enemies based on their threat and such is important I would recommend trying this if your into tactical shooters and bring three friends with you
you either play 3 hours and get bored of it then never return or you play 200 hours and dont want to stop spoiler make sure to bring friends or make new friends at gtfo discords spoiler
kinda felt like a free to play game empty and not very fun
Banger game man will purchase it when it goes on sale again had the best weekend ever with the free weekend yesterday Just the communication that me and my team didnt have made it so much funnier

Really loved the aesthetics but the game itself is kinda clunky I hope it gets better

Solo
GTFO is a broken lobby simulator finding players is a pain and when you do find them chances are coms will brake player 1 will hear others but player 2 might not hear player 3 and such Some times i even had invisible players in my games and the best part is that some times a button to ready up would just pack up things and leave the screen good luck starting the game Oh and imagine after spending 30 minutes and finding 2 more players you sit there and chat while waiting for the 4th guy he join and it turns out to be a troll no mic ignores chat and wont ready up no problem right You just kick him but you cant there is no such button you have to leave and make a new lobby If you have friends then its a decent game but not worth the full price since it has no progression or random level generation it dose have cosmetic unlocks but i would not call that a proper progression system Just wait for a huge discount
its good for a co-op experience but as the about this game states bots can only fill one or two spots It discourages solo play so much that its nearly impossible to complete more difficult levels The only 2 solutions for the player is either to get their own friends to buy and play with them or go on the GTFO discord to matchmake with others
Take clickers from The Last of Us take some insertion/extraction idea from Deep Rock Galactic take some dark corridors from Aliens vs predator 1999 take some new idea of terminals and programing language Ok now spawn move slowly place autocannons near closed doors rinse repeat No real progresion in equipment after 2 hours some trausers and shirt unlocked with no stats noice Well not worth full price right now 7-10 it's a fair price for this game Not more

Macht Bock und ist Bock schwer
Do not bother with this game if you are not going to get a full premade party The game is unplayable with randoms or bots This game was designed for premade parties only and nothing indicates that this will change GL finding 3 other people who are willing to spend over an hour on one level and have the willpower to play such an unfairly unforgiving game The actual problems Occasional game-breaking bugs(E use prompt bug the one that I got can softlock the game you need to rejoin the lobby to fix that and desync issues Ghost lobbies showing you that you are in a lobby with people when in reality it is empty and you cannot matchmake for a game Can't matchmake for specified levels you will only get random ones in the same difficulty range Making it next to impossible to properly learn the game and memorize the maps for new players Since the map is bugged and doesn't show you reliably which lockers were looted opened or replaced with other items you need to keep rechecking them in the dark Some containers/lockers don't show on the map The cons The whole stealth mechanic is a red-light-green-light minigame That's most of the game except for brief horde shooting or specific levels The HUD is lacking and hard to read you need to keep tabbing to see the stats of your teammates Melee being next to useless outside of stealth and a lack of a dodge movement you can only dodge by strafing makes for a very tiny comeback factor or carry potential Varying degrees of fog and spicy fog which are an actual difficulty mechanic The game doesn't look that much better on the highest settings Some of the guns feel and sound like peashooters It's hard to see what the special abilities of the guns do in-game since it's so dark making it hard to get decent feedback from the guns you use and your shooting ability Some guns are not very distinct and feel kinda the same Problems for casuals/new players/randoms To mitigate the difficulty of the game and to actually have fun you need to invest a lot of time into it which is not that rewarding and is too much for most people Slightly too harsh fall damage is not fun people would fall repeatedly and would rather deal with the damage than adjust to the bullshit environment and fall damage Running around with a flashlight that only illuminates a few steps ahead of you to look for vital resources is not fun You need to find a gadget to fix that but it might not even spawn in the level You need to shove your nose into the walls in order for the map to reveal edges of the rooms making the map really hard for new players to read forcing you to memorize most of the map You can't ping enemies only items or usable environment Not being able to ping enemies is a problem when stealth is most of the game No turn off lights or stop moving voice commands You cannot trade items between teammates making it very difficult to play with randoms or bots No tips or recommendations on what to do or not in-game The pros Some of the guns look feel and sound good The horde shooting can be fun sometimes Unfortunately you can't see the designs of the guns very well in-game but most of the sights look pretty and fit into the environment Most of the environment looks good but gets betrayed by poor texture quality if you get close and shine a light on it which you will be doing a lot Typing commands into the terminals feels cool The game is not scary partly due to some poor looking graphics and lack of spooky sounds in the environment Minecraft cave sounds are scarier than this game Satisfaction from good teamwork You get to fight in chokepoints which you can defend with gadgets and turrets Almost a decent game if you have 3 other people to play with It would be a decent game if the bugs and QOL issues were fixed
THIS GAME SO GOOD I KILLED 3 TEAMATES IN 1 RUN THIS IS SO GOOD THAT I LIKE TO CUMM WHILE KILLING FRIENDS AND THEY GOT MAD BUT IS OKAY BECAUSE THIS GAME SHOULD BE GAME AWARDS NOW I NOMINATE THIS GAME TO THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL TO THE MAX NOW PLS VOTE FOR THE GMAE TO BE THE MOST TEAMMATE KILLABLE GAMES OF ALL TIME
riktigt roligt
Basicamente Argentina 2023 Sorprendentemente similar a Lethal Company pero con armas Me encanta el manejo de la luz y el gameplay con toques de supervivencia pero por lo menos por lo que pude jugar esas 3 horas tengo que decir que en momento me entretenido el sigilo si bien es funcional al ser en multijugador si molesta
This was actually a good game which I really enjoyed You have to have online friends to really enjoy it to the fullest and can do without that terminal thing that they put it the game it makes it more complicated beside that the graphics was stunning and gameplay was non stop action
game hay free hay lz
Good and terrifying game
Tried the game during a free weekend To me definitely not worth 40 Eurodollars It looks nice the atmosphere is great the overall sound design is good but to me it falls flat in a number of ways The stealth is mundane and offers very little challenge Most enemies are static when not alerted and are easily avoidable and easily killed Even the bigger ones and moving enemies pose little threat if you and your buddies don't absolutely drop all your spaghetti simultaneously into a deep pit Even if you do accidentally alert one they can be killed before triggering other enemies Melee combat is alright but the gunplay is lackluster overall Some weapons feel good others not so much due to a combination of animations sounds etc Enemies barely react to being hit and are suprisingly bulletspongy elevating the sense of mediocrity Sometimes it feels like shots don't even connect even if they do Enemies don't seem too varied and interesting But then again I don't know what the game throws at you down the line Most are melee units but some of them shoot their glowy tentacle at you and others shoot their glowy seed at you Both equally personal-space-invading They also seem to be unavoidable homing attacks Yikes When going through a mission you will typically move to the next room stealth-kill all enemies loot everything valuable and move to the next room This combined with the mundane stealth results in long stretches of time where nothing really interesting happens And you don't want to go loud if you don't absolutely have to because you will need the little ammo you have when you do encounter hordes Those typically appear when you open alarm doors or during the extraction sequence An interesting aspect of the game are the consoles that you interact with You will type in commands to locate items or to do various other things Reminds me of the input minigame in Helldivers which I loved Unfortunately it doesn't really do much in terms of gameplay as it seems to rarely happen that you're under any pressure goo creatures nibbling on your eyelids when using them Sense of progression is pretty much non-existent in the game Weapons and equipment are all available from the beginning The only things you will unlock are cosmetics and boosters that give you temporary buffs when activated during missions Weapons/equipment items are not modifiable in any way and there isn't really any synergy between items or somesuch to explore sadly Also if you are a UI/UX designer that thinks every single thing should be click-and-hold I hope you will never escape Samsara
Fun game with friends
engelli ise sorun Feci
i felt like i was playing for a minute and an hour has passed this game is so fun
I enjoyed the concept and I'm curious about what these developers could achieve if this game were AAA and had more content The idea is fantastic and the execution creates a captivating atmosphere GTFO stands out as a unique cooperative horror experience due to its game-play design one that I am fully relishing even after countless deaths and failed runs This is the best coop horror game i ever played

pretty good they weren't kidding about the team work one mistake is enough to get you all wiped Not the traditional kind of fun more of a i beat this really tough team work assignment kind of exhilaration Got it for free for a weekend ill be buying it afterwards
Ich dem Entwickler das kostenlose Wochenende danken Diese Geste ist keineswegs und bietet uns Spielern stets die Gelegenheit interessante Titel zu testen In Bezug auf das Spiel selbst muss ich bedauerlicherweise feststellen dass es mir nicht gefallen hat Der Aufbau wirkte monoton und es gab viel Wiederholung Das Leveldesign war stets identisch und der Ablauf der Missionen wiederholte sich ebenfalls Nach drei Stunden hatte ich das das Spiel bereits durchgespielt zu haben und empfand zum Ende hin Langeweile
GTFO
Great game original story I like stealth and quiet games and one of those
Get The Fxxk Out

I shot a glowing chungus I died shortly after 10/10
You are forced to play with either completely dog bots who waste half their ammo trying to shoot enemies through walls and obstacles or straight up aim for the farthest enemies while monsters standing in front of them keep hitting them Or You play with re randoms who'll play this game like L4D and keep shooting enemies till their ammo runs out Then lose the game and alt F4 out Or You play with discord's over competitive community where the guys order you around and expect you to have military level tactical proficiency where you are supposed to take perfect head-shots of running enemies I would rather read a book than playing this s***show and i don't even read books

FUN I'd like my friends to play it with me
very hard game i love it
This game is ass go spend money on something else 10/10 would not recommend Games i rather play and would recommend Alien Fireteam elite Warhammer Vermintide Back4Blood Killing Floor 1,2
Game ni susah xtentu pasal BODOH
So hard i rather play genshin all my life
a really good game to play with your friends
Esta bueno las cosa es que tenes que tener amigo para jugar o gente que concuerdes para jugarlo porque es raro poder jugar en una sala no hay casi nadie si podes jugarlo con amigos mejor
Jogo do krai kkkkkkkkkkkk
3/5
realy good game stealth is not a option
Worst game play ever Bots are morons Your forced to play with human children Not fun Refund policy fails to account for adults that need more then 2 hours to learn game mechanics
Ich habs gratis getestet und ich bin wirklich bis auf die Grafik erinnert alles an ein Free2play Es ist einfach unbefriedigend zu spielen alles an diesem Spiel ist einfach unbefriedigend nach jeder Runde frage ich mich einfach wieder was das jetzt eigentlich war jede Runde dauert Ewigkeiten und dann kommt man raus und sich noch leerer als in der Runde selbst sehr Schade denn ansich scheint das Spiel viel Liebe abzubekommen von den Entwicklern
I only played it during the free weekend in December 2023 and I enjoyed it very much Game It's brutal and unforgiving very very deep in exploration mechanics but fairly straight forward when the action ramp up and boy does it ramp up Best to play with a solid party you can play with 3 bots but it's just not the same The feel is definitely more tense than L4D a lot of stealthing and anticipation as you can't really look ahead in most closed areas and don't know what you are going to get once a new door opens and there's a lot of really dark areas although that's surely intentional I GOT ONE COMPLAINT the text font why the hell is it so tiny you realize how hard the default font is to read on a steam deck screen Other than that I definitely recommend if you enjoy vermintide or L4D type FPS games Certainly a future buy for me
O jogo de primeira muito imersivo porem se tiver 4 amigos fechado fica nas de Randon que nao sabe como o jogo funciona mesmo com amigos o jogo extremamente e repetitivos Gastar nesse jogo uma pode pegar 11/12 cells e faltar na ultima zona GG
Pace meio estranho e confuso Legal pra jogar com amigos
That was a great stealth horror game that I ever play So fun to have it free play at the time to the last trial play
good game
Solid gameplay fun with friends and a lot challenging would definitely recommend if you were looking for a challenging multiplayer

I played it on the free weekend and would give it a 6/10 Since the game is at its Final Chapter I assume the gameplay will not change I come from games like Vermintide 2 L4D2 DRG and I liked the core idea of GTFO like using stealth while having limited ressources but I feel like some things arent well executed The game is annoying to play solo cause the level difficulty doesnt scale with the number of people you have limited ressources True the bots arent 100 stupid but they would trigger monsters when you dont want them This pushes you to use matchmaking and play always with 4 people not the main issue tho I will add that the communication wheel is nice The game gets repetitive pretty quickly You have like almost identical loop of gameplay and enemies vs DRG that has variations Plus you dont even have an extraction animation you just get straight back to the lobby I also feel like there should be something more to progression than just skins I know you farm artifacts but I didnt feel rewarding I guess its cool that everyone is equal and everyone has access to everything in the loadout but no mods and no customizations the gun is fully built already It does say in words what each gun does but I would like to see NUMBERS And there is many more things that didnt feel right like the door hacking sequence where you have to stand on circles and the flying projectiles that are almost undodgeable I liked some things like the atmosphere the interaction with the environnement the console the doors lockers with ressources I also liked how everyone is forced to work together but I hope for more asymetric cooperation like one team does A while the other half does B Anyway I am just looking for a different execution of this idea and I would be happy to see more games with these cores mechanics but with a better gameplay
Yeah It's pretty good not too difficult Just the right feel for a good survival horror game

Sorry interessanter Ansatz im Spiel mit Nebel Zombies im dunkeln den von Mitspielern einsehbaren Eingabebildschirm mit Dos-Befehlen Wird oder macht die Mission leichter Gegner die auf und direktes Licht reagieren Ich hatte in meiner Zeit verschiedene Echtes 4 Player zusammenspiel alla Soldaten Disziplin erforderlich Taktisches Vorgehen ist verlangt Bot's sind Schott Das man hier Strategie hat setzte ich sehr in Klammern Da man eigentlich keine Auswahl des Vorgehens hat beim betreten der alles killen wenn Pech am Schuss keine Munition Oder durchschleichen durchschleichen und leise alle Gegner killen Letzteres ist sehr anspruchsvoll Sehr anspruchsvoll kein reines Gegner einfach abballer Spiel Manchmal sinnlose Aufgaben wie beim verteidigen sinnlose Scann-punkte im Raum aufsuchen um den Schwierigkeitsgrad zu Schade das man Alarme nicht umgehen oder ausschalten kann Spieleranzahl war sogar an dem freispielen Wochenende nicht wirklich hoch Aus dem meine Bewertung stammt Bezweifel dass es danach besser wird Waffenauswahl zu 80 schlecht nicht dem Einsatzgebiet angepasst und nicht Spieler individuell verbesserbar z.B gibt keine oder die auch nicht immer helfen nicht immer Wenn ich Host sein will ich Host bleiben Man wird zu Nahkampf um leise zu sein Die Gruseleinleitung zu beginn des Match wird nach dem 2 ten mal zunehmen ich neutral geht nicht gut reicht es nicht Ich hoffe ich konnte euch helfen Und die Programmierer noch was wenig Hoffnung Mit ein paar Anpassungen man daraus was machen Das Tutorial man ja als Demo anbieten und Schwierigkeitsgrad finde ich zwar ein Witz zum Spiel aber es scheidern ja schon welche daran Dann das Spiel sicher nichts euch und Ihr wert eher eine Belastung als eine Bereicherung das Team

I've had the game on my list for a long time and now I've tried the free weekend unfortunately alone because my friends are pu**ies P The environmental sounds are good the gameplay is excellent finally something slower no constant running and sliding it can get hectic but only if you build shit or the door has an alarm Two rounds with random people first level tried and died after 45 minutes each but it was fun Third round alone with bots I managed the first level in 30 minutes I'll definitely be buying it in the next steamsale soon Also very important if you can't READ forget the game That probably affects quite a few people I am shown that I got the game for free which is not true I got it in the sale

Played this game during free weekend and do not plan on buying it The atmosphere in this game is amazing and the environment is highly detailed however that's where it ended for me Having all the guns right off the bat is great but it takes away a potential grind from a game that already has very little grind in the first place There is seemingly very little story although I did not complete the game due to other reasons that will be mentioned later The only incentive to play this game that I could find was cosmetics earned by completing levels but that was it Trying to be stealthy will only get you so far after which it becomes boring or out right impossible The next option is to shoot things I found that shooting was also problematic as it often alerted every enemy in a room and left us overwhelmed and running out of ammo despite exploring the entire map and looting everything we could Despite it's detail the environment is incredibly empty with over 90 of the shelves and whatnot merely existing for the sake of existing There could easily be more loot placed around the map which would likely solve my previous pain point Another major problem I had was dealing with the bot I went in with 2 others and a single bot I did not expect the bot to be some sort of god simply another player to use as either fodder or as a saving grace when someone went down near the bot Instead the bot would often trigger sleeping enemies and nearly ruin a run I can only imagine how smaller squads playing with multiple bots would feel My final point is minor but still an annoyance nonetheless Fall damage in this game is stupid with a tiny 2 foot fall leaving you with a chunk of your hp missing All in all I will not be purchasing this game any time soon however I do believe that it has a great base to build upon and I may reconsider in the future in the case that the game sees an improvement

its hard i love it
Played during the free weekend and was surprised with how good the game was you have to have a group of 4 people though because the game is SUPER co-op oriented Takes a lot of planning and prep before each mission figuring out what everyone is going to do and a backup plan because ur first plan is gonna go right out the window once shit hits the fan hahaha
A MUST HAVE 100 I just wished i had more time to play this past weekend
This game is awesome is you have some friend to play with intense co-op and epic fights
iyi
2 hours of Free Weekend Demo Unfortunately I haven't played much of this game and I only did 2 sessions with bots Which co-op is part of the core gameplay so take this review in a grain of salt This game has a great experience with suspense and overwhelming dread The map levels have great atmosphere and ambiance increase the horror more so with lurking enemies in the dark Speaking of enemies they are challenging they react to lights and sounds and with many types from ones that crawl ones that spit and ones that are so tall they smack you taking somewhere 1/5 of your health and I heard this is going to get harder you progress silence and stealth is your most valued ally I haven't tried all of the weapons tools and boosters But I've tried a few and they have great functionality than fancy design More so there no leveling system and microtransactions that have to earn nor buy any weapons Helmet apparels can be earn by completing the levels Again no microtransactions and leveling system Plus with limited ammunition and searching for said ammunition tools and health Leaves more thinking and planing ahead of your routes to your objective Shame I have not explored the co-op part of the gameplay but if there's a chance for another shot of this game weekend demo or purchase And also friends I would do so play it
Great game played 4.4 hours to get my dick spinning
This ain't it chief When people sold this game to me as a stealth focused spooky hardcore L4D-like co-op FPS I was immediately sold on it which is why I tried it during the free weekend with some friends The stealth part which the trailers really want to point out is super important is also extremely tedious other reviews don't exaggerate when they say it's almost exclusively red light green light occasionally having enemies whose stealth works slightly differently and sure failing the stealth can trigger a horde of enemies towards you but what should feel like a misstep that triggers panic in the players instead feels like a tedious ugh ONE enemy didn't die from the melee attack because the hitreg is garbage and the guy next to it got alerted Stealthily clearing rooms of monsters means slowly and sluggishly killing sleepers one by one until the room is clear which is fine and dandy but it gets very old very quick Sure it's intimidating for the first few seconds when you walk into a massive room with a lot of sleepers knowing that waking one would mean fighting off that entire room of nasty monsters but you then quickly realize you have to choose between either clearing the room one by one playing red light green light to get where you want to or just saying fuck it and fighting the horde off The terminals system is quite fun I like how it can give you info about items in the world and help you find them They work like a windows CMD with their own commands and some missions have special interactions with them My only complaint about them is that the continuous ping stops as soon as you step off the terminal even if the window is still active which essentially means someone has to stare at a screen doing nothing while the rest look out for the ping location Having a tactical map is great and all but drawing on it is pointless when the drawing vanishes after just a few seconds and you can't place your own markers as far as I'm aware The gunplay feels nice In fact fighting hordes off is probably the only positive highlight of the game besides its setting there's a good variety of weapons each with their own pros and cons and killing enemies feels great It does feel a little strange that you can choose from all the available weapons from the start and that the only unlockables are buffs that only last for a single mission and apparel gear that does nothing besides making you look cool or like a clown Speak of the hordes I really just don't like the door unlocking system with its security checks that requires you to stand at different locations to turn the alarms off While it's an interesting idea to force players off their comfort zones to await the horde it essentially just means that every single time you'll play a tower defense game with turrets foam and mines while you speedrun the security check to turn the alarm off as soon as possible else the alarm and thus the horde is infinite Again interesting concept but it gets very old very quick and kind of uninspired The level design is tedious and tediousness is a very recurring theme in this game's design Almost every single mission consists of the exact same thing find a terminal to find out which direction to go on You go in that direction until you're told you need a keycard You go the opposite way where you came from to find a keycard fight a compulsory horde or two in the way You get the keycard you go back to the keycard door you fight another compulsory horde And there maybe and just maybe you can get to your objective The looting aspect is sad Most of the loot is located inside glowing orange boxes or lockers and sometimes out in the world in some shelves and whatnot It is nice that you can find these things with the terminals but it also means you'll be extending the time the mission takes any time you're looking for a resource you're in absolute need of since pinging things one by one is slow This game just turned out to be disappointing and so is its community and devs any criticism is received with no you're not playing the game right from people that have sunk in hundreds if not thousands of hours in it and that changing literally anything about it including the snoozefest that is the stealth wouldn't make the game as hardcore as it is and that you can't handle it Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but your game isn't hardcore it's just kind of boring and underdelivering
Esta bueno el juego pero no es para mi xq es full cooperativo Y yo no tengo con quien jugar

Press and hold buttons in the UI instead of just clicking it I play on PC why would you do that on PC Minor but annoying Textures are terrible Washed out blurry nothing feels crisp Weapon handling is bad compared to any other high quality shooter I played Recoil feels bad Distance to sight feels bad Recoil probably feels bad because not the weapon model/sight moves upwards but the entire screen moves upwards It should be the exact opposite Eye sight screen is stable and the weapon moves This goes for the Y axis of the recoil movement Then again the z-axis recoil of most guns is just completely over the top Here the gun moves but the gun model and sight move so much it feels they hit you right in the face when shooting Getting-Hit feedback feels bad Never have a feeling how hard I got hit and from what angle Hitting-enemies feedback feels bad Shots don't feel like they connect Tactical shooter without any lean functionality You cannot drop equipment for your mates e.g dropping a large flashlight but have to find a locker to exchange equipment When opening a secure door a percentage number rised from 0 to 100 During that process hordes attack and red markers appear that you have to stand on for the door to continue it's process to 100 open Next to questioning the design decision of this mechanic.(just why it makes no sense stand here then stand over there then stand over there again.for a door to open Why?).the markers are hardly visible in all the fog and blurry scene It's a pretty frustrating experience Enemies shoot flying yellow glowing balls at you that neither make a sound when they are fired don't make a sound when they approach nor make a sound when they impact you Sound feedback is such an essential that feels underdeveloped in this game Anyhow enemies sending yellow glowing little orbs at you just feels underwhelming and unemotional What kind of fearsome attack for a horror shooter is that Stealth is based on a binary system that is really rigid and getting stale fast No dynamic You are allowed to move freely and you must stand still when the enemy glows ON/OFF Yes/No No stealth game indicator that rises no visibility indicator that changes Nothing that would make you feel the edge of being close to being detected That feeling of rising suspense that you know from other good stealth games Here if you move while the enemy starts glowing it is instant combat Someone called it Green light Red light mechanic like at a traffic light I think that sums it up pretty good So clearing a room of sleepers as they are called has zero dynamic It feels like work because there is no movement no change just a room full of enemies that stand still and periodically glow which translates to Stop Just wait Then move some meters then wait Move some meters wait If you ask me the concept idea as a baseline could be really interesting but it's just way too basic in it's current form to create any kind of dynamic gameplay Ammo Now stealth wouldn't be such an issue if the game would allow more of the shooter gameplay Though it is clearly intended to stealth A LOT EVERYWHERE as balancing for ammo-supply is very scarce so that you are pressed to conserve ammo whereever you can In turn promoting the stale and undynamic stealth system to a mandatory experience Melee attacks can be quick or strong attacks by holding down the mouse button longer before release For whatever reason devs decided that preparing a strong strike automatically is released after a while Completely stupid cause this is not street fighter where such a mechanic is needed When I pull my hammer back to swing it should't automatically do the swing after 5 seconds for no reason The best part about the game are the voice-overs Actors sound real intonation is good There are not that many lines they speak but they are delivered very very well Overall at the standard pricepoint I cannot recommend this game in good faith It's just not up there in terms of FPS weapon handling shooter feeling stealth dynamics or equipment unlocks
pogyu game
GTFO stands for G-e-T yourself some fucking Friends first Or else
10/10 Bishop best boyo amazing game
I played the 3 day trial If you like solving problems with realistic military tactics than this game is right up your alley Its kinda similar to strategic squad games like ready or not Arma 3 and Tom Clancy Games Except its with monsters set in a dark and gloomy world You play as four prisoners who were ex military personnel who descend to their demise in an underground mining and research facility to redeem their sins Their objective is to fulfil the wardens missions A highly advanced and self-aware computer Kind of like the Red Queen from resident evil This game is definitely not for casual players that have no previous experience or understanding within this video game genre and may be inclined to criticise the difficulty of the game as players are quite venerable to the enemy if their squad fails to cooperate The enemies are well balanced but the difficulty depends on your ability to think tactfully and cooperate together
10/10 Game if you complain about difficulty go to LoL,valorant or watch some tik toks

b GTFO Parfait personne ne vous entendra GTFO est un jeu intense qui force les joueurs travailler ensemble pour survivre dans un environnement hostile dans des tunnels sombres et effrayants les joueurs doivent accomplir des objectifs tout en de se faire submerger par des monstres terrifiants Positifs Essentielle GTFO ne se joue pas en solo La est cruciale pour survivre face des ennemis impitoyables Chaque membre de a un vital et la communication est la du Les tirs amis sont ce qui ajoute une tension chaque interaction Exploration Intense L'exploration est au du gameplay Chaque mission plonge les joueurs dans des environnements sinistres remplis les ressources sont rares Le jeu ne propose pas de grind inutile ni surpuissantes juste le strict pour survivre ce qui augmente l'immersion Adaptative Le jeu n'offre aucun checkpoint rendant chaque erreur potentiellement fatale La est par la de que par la puissance des ennemis ou des armes Chaque niveau offrant des chaque tentative Direction Artistique du jeu est une vraie Les jeux de les ombres et le brouillard sont magnifiquement une oppressante Les des films et d'horreur renforcent cette immersion La bande-son maintient une tension constante de survie Absence de Mode Solo Le jeu clairement pas pour en solo devient rapidement lassante et frustrante pour les joueurs qui tentent de jouer seuls car la est au du gameplay Quelques Techniques Bien que le jeu soit globalement stable il y a encore quelques techniques notamment des crashs occasionnels en partie Ces incidents bien que rares peuvent frustrants Animations des Monstres Les animations des monstres peuvent sembler un peu cheap ce qui peut nuire Cependant cela peut que le jeu est par un studio avec des moyens IA des Ennemis L'IA des monstres manque parfois de dynamisme Les vagues d'ennemis arrivent rarement de surprenante ce qui peut rendre certains moments moins stressants qu'ils ne devraient Une IA plus aurait pu renforcer de terreur constante GTFO est un jeu pour les joueurs patients et amateurs de intense La de travailler en une exploration stressante et une ambiance immersive en fait une unique dans le genre survival-horror quelques tels que des animations de monstres un peu basiques et une IA qui pourrait plus le jeu brille par son et sa impitoyable Ce pas un jeu pour les sensibles mais pour ceux qui cherchent un GTFO est une ne pas manquer.[/b

What I find most rewarding about this game are all the non-action elements Even though this game has a tutorial much of what you need to know have to figure out yourself i.e how to use terminals going to be a lot of head scratching moments That is however the special DNA of GTFO and because of that this game gives you some cool gaming moments you get from other games This is not an action game In fact you are essentially punished if you try to play this game like an action game I would be okay with that if it for the fact that this game also forces action down your throat Unlike a lot of stealth games you cannot beat a level without going through hordes of enemies GTFO has alarm doors need to open in order to progress And in these sequences there is no stealth As someone who thoroughly enjoys action gameplay I have to admit the action here good On a surface level the guns weapons etc feel very good to play but the punishment you are forced to take from the action sequences without any alternative without any existing mechanic to work around some of these dreadful sequences takes away from the experience and the potential that this could be more than an action game What it done was give the players more freedom in how they wanted to approach the game And that means there needs to be an alternative for alarm-horde sequences certainly an alternative to forcing you to stand still in red scanning spots in those moments a lot more I could say a lot of goods things I can praise the game for the co-operative aspects and making you feel like someone who knows how to hack into a system but also some things could be better It should allow us to ping anywhere not just objects and give us a screen that shows the health and ammo of teammates because right now the font size is ridiculously tiny and virtually impossible to read the teammate info if not completely still for at least 5 seconds just some suggestions I wanted to like this game but I because the worst part of this game which is the action drags it down If in the market for a good stealth game I'd point you to better alternatives Or if you want survival horror point you to Resident Evil And if you want action this game isn't it
ochko
Played during free weekend Playing with friends that know what they're doing is fine I would not buy this game and play it on my own I wouldn't even want to really play this game if I received it for free permanently unless my best friend really wanted me to play with him Game is quite buggy which makes it inconsistent when it comes to sleepers detecting your movement which is a BIG part of this game Also very repetitive which some folks might like but it's just not my cup of tea Also the only game that has consistently crashed on my pretty decent gaming PC during the 3 years I've owned it Have heard of similar experiences with other users but not from my friends I played with which is super annoying lol Gun-play feels clunky and weapons are generally underwhelming The reticles/sights on some of these weapons are absolutely atrocious and get in the way of where you are aiming in an already dark and foggy environment Movement is frustrating especially when trying to strafe and dodge attacks and sometimes the map geometry doesn't make sense There are invisible walls in places where it looks like you can walk through while trying to be stealthy Which again is a big part of this game The fall damage is annoying too Never sprint while going down stairs The game design is pretty rough and feels incomplete in some places but the graphics are pretty cool 3/10 Would rather do homework instead
This game is gruesomely criminally difficult and it truly has no patience for you understanding the mechanics It's very fun but the learning curve is a 90 degree angle and the game truly doesn't respect the player's need for resources The devs need to implement a gradient difficulty setting for teams that do not have a full 4 stack because the bots are lobotomites that don't understand how to even use their gadgets

Ran out of ammo 10 minutes into round my friend Oilyliver went well its over However It really was not We then proceeded to only use sledgehammers for 15 minutes straight and made it far somehow 10/10
I find this game to be incredibly fun even with just one other person but I personally recommend having a total of 3 people in a party and 4 if you can Yes the game is difficult but when I introduced one of my friends to it this weekend he learned how to play the game very fast We let him experiment with guns and what not and he found what he liked and what he didn't By far the most important consideration for this game is do you have people to play with If the answer is no then do not purchase The game is way to difficult as a single player game and is not designed to work well solo So in conclusion buy this game if you have long periods of time without major interruption horror games and most importantly have people to play with TLDR TRADITIONAL FRENCH CASSOULET 1 pound 454g dried cannellini beans 3 tablespoons 27g Diamond Crystal kosher salt for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight 5 cups 1.2L homemade or store-bought unsalted chicken stock divided see notes 3 packets unflavored gelatin 3/4 ounce 21g such as Knox optional see notes 2 tablespoons 30ml duck fat optional 8 ounces 227g salt pork cut into 3/4-inch cubes about 1 1/4 cups 8 ounces 227g boneless pork shoulder cut into 1-inch cubes 4 skin-on bone-in chicken thighs 4 fresh duck legs or 4 prepared duck confit legs Freshly ground black pepper 1 pound 454g garlic sausage divided into 2-4 segments if sausage is large 1 large onion 12 ounces 340g finely diced about 1 1/2 cups 1 carrot 4 ounces;113g unpeeled and cut into 3-inch sections 2 ribs celery 6 1/2 ounces 188g cut into 3-inch sections 1 whole head garlic 2 3/4 ounces 80g 4 sprigs flat-leaf parsley 2 bay leaves 6 cloves STEPS 1 In a large bowl cover beans with 3 quarts 2.8L water and add salt Stir to combine then let stand at room temperature overnight Drain and rinse beans set aside 2 Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to Place 4 cups 946ml stock in a large liquid measuring cup and sprinkle gelatin if using over top Set aside In a large Dutch oven heat duck fat if using salt pork and pork shoulder and cook over high heat stirring occasionally until browned all over about 9 minutes if not using duck fat cook pork with no additional fat Using a slotted spoon transfer to a large bowl leaving rendered fat in Dutch oven and set aside 3 Season chicken thighs or duck confit with pepper do not add salt and place skin side down in Dutch oven Cook without moving until well-browned 6 to 8 minutes Transfer to a plate and let cool to room temperature 4 Add sausages to Dutch oven and cook turning occasionally until well-browned about 2 minutes per side Transfer to bowl with salt pork Drain all but 2 tablespoons fat from pot 5 Add onions to Dutch oven and cook stirring and scraping up browned bits from bottom of pot until onions are translucent but not browned about 4 minutes Add drained beans carrot celery garlic parsley bay leaves cloves and stock/gelatin mixture Bring to a simmer over high heat Reduce to low cover Dutch oven and cook until beans are slightly softened but retain a bite about 20 minutes 6 Cover cooled chicken or duck and transfer to refrigerator Using tongs remove carrots celery parsley bay leaves and cloves from pot and discard Add pork and sausages to pot and stir to incorporate Beans should be almost completely submerged Transfer to oven and cook uncovered adding remaining 1 cup 237ml stock halfway through by pouring it carefully down side of pot as necessary to keep beans mostly covered until a thin crust forms on top about 1 hour 30 minutes 7 Break crust with a spoon and shake pot gently to redistribute Nestle chicken or duck into the Dutch oven skin side up Return to oven and continue cooking stopping to break and shake crust every 30 minutes until crust is deep brown and thick an additional 1 hour 30 minutes Serve immediately

If youre dedicated enough you CAN play solo I mostly play solo and have beaten quite a few rundowns Definitely one of the few games where the devs care
repetitive pathetic crouching simulator where every level looks exactly the same and you have to do exactly the same thing in every level clunky controls atrocious flashlight some sort of meme probably the games core mechanic is stealth but in the middle of the game surprise 30 alien creatures swarm you because an alarm was triggered somehow get one slapped and youre down but gotta waste the whole mag just to drop a low level mobster this game sucks it really does it's trash
I played the weekend free trial and I must say that I really consider buying it with my friend to play it more It's fun to try sneaking with friends and then fail

Amazing Game
I love this game because the developers know exactly what they want their game to be They're also willing to make the sacrifices to make the game shine at what they need it to shine at GTFO is an incredibly immersive game and sometimes to a fault The UI isn't the most user friendly and the volume of the game and its ambiance noises are incredibly loud But damn does those faults make it incredibly immersive it's fun nerve-wracking difficult and each level you conquer feels like an achievement A true test of teamwork planning and resourcefulness
Very peaceful Would study and sleep to 👍
Game hay
This is a suspense-horror game focused around high team-synchronization with almost no room for error from the start I think that this is an excellent example of Work Together or Die Together gameplay done right I know that I'm late as the game has just had it's Final Rundown which to my understanding is the final update but I sincerely hope that others will see this and consider this game with friends Thank you to the devs for giving me the chance to demo this game for free this weekend I most certainly plan on playing again when the next free weekend comes around until I can just buy the game of course
very solid game has good scares in forms of abominations from the depths of the underground fruit gushers from chernobyl Spiky abominations from the depths of the underground And more abominations from the depths of the underground that are just.BIG 10/10 Would die with friends on Plus I get to play birdbox with my friends who don't know when to shut up

I love Massive dudes snoring around me while I pummel their younger siblings into mince meat
In all honesty it's hard as hell If you don't cooperate you're definitely fucked it's great and just an experience when playing The rush you get when you mess up is great I recommend it
I really want to like this game but every chance I get to play it I don't last longer than a few hours before dropping it It's way too stealth-centered and it gets repetitive very fast The game may improve after the first few rundowns but I'll never know
mt bom melhor ainda com amigos jogar
While the game has potential you're best off playing with a party of players The AI teammates have the IQ of bread mould with constantly standing in your line-of-fire standing around daydreaming of rice pudding or blocking your shots just to heal you or replenish your bullets AI needs vast improvements before the game can be considered enjoyable outside of multiplayer
Great concept love the atmosphere and the gameplay when it works I played only for the free weekend and had 2 matches actually work properly Kept loading in only to not see my teammates or everyone would start running in place or this would happen to a teammate requiring us to leave and reset Gets really annoying when you're 90 through a super difficult mission only for your team to freeze leaving everyone trapped until you disconnect Me and my buddies lost so many missions to this bug that we just said screw it and decided not to buy Like I said great gameplay if they ever fix the bugs I would 100 buy the game But it's just unplayable right now
Hardcore coop tactical game O
el de mi amigo un asalto sin que un setup perdimos y nos dio paja jugar de nuevo juegazo pero exageradamente castigante al error
Las pocas horas de juego que le tengo a este juego han sido por fin de semana gratis La dificultad del juego es bastante castigante sin un equipo entero pero mientras mas juegues mas llegas a la de que la mejor estrategia es crear un set-up antes de iniciar una pelea pero aun asi este juego no acepta solo error a la mas inconveniencia puedes morir y tener que reiniciar todo Lo recomiendo porque es divertido pero no es para todo el mundo es frustrarte pero recompensante en su esplendor
Se tiver 4 amigos jogue vale a pena a IA dos aliados especialmente no stealth ficam correndo na frente dos bicho e alertam o resto

This is a first impression for the game played during the free weekend and going through Rundown 1 six main missions only How it translates to later levels I know Recommended with a huge caveat Play with a group of friends or you'll have a not so good time Can it be played solo yes but the bots are super trash so not recommended With randoms probably be a frustrating experience The game is mostly trial and error and experiencing these with the same people matters a lot learn from your failures together and take that experience and do better next run Now we liked the game but just see ourselves dedicating any more time to playing it Not only is the game hard and incredibly punishing it's time-consuming A level can take upwards to 1 or 2 hours to complete and all it takes is one mistake or something your not ready for to end a run And as far as we can tell Rundown 1 is supposed to be the easiest 8 Rundowns with increasing levels of difficulty I can see why people like the game cause there is something satisfying going back to a level you just failed and beating it the second time around by planning better and knowing what you can and cannot get away with Stealth is pretty much required for a majority of the time due to the low ammo economy really only one way to do stealth and it gets incredibly dull over time Sneaking consists of ctrl-ing towards an enemy not moving if the enemy vibrates to detect movement and doing a charge melee head shot Once we realized we could set up turrets at an entrance to fall back to in case stealth failed clearing rooms became much easier However this strategy is probably level dependent because in R1C2 those spiky bois are tanky af If you have a dedicated group and all of you like failing a lot learning from it and spending possibly hours on a level then this is for you
gud
I cant help but feel like this is a well crafted game but at the same time its very tense and I don't like it well I was able to complete the first wave or map I believe after maybe 4 hours total time is 7.1 hours Played through on easy mode with 4 players I remember the beta over a year ago for free and they changed the star of the game dropping to solid black it used to be the trippiest part of the game feeling like your falling but the whole game is bizzare in a way that seems evil Moving through the menu makes me feel disoriented how it shifts and most of the HUD has double vision when my vision is already bad from computer/phone screens The flying octopus looks like the game Doom which in a way is demonic I feel like at the beginning I am in a test chamber water suit for hundreds of years then like Portal 2 I am just out to solve the maps puzzle Kinda bizarrely evil something about the technology and the mark of the beast 6 6 6 A LOT of the time I felt like I shouldn't say anything and overall I think there is a negative feeling The zombies are some of my favorite part because they are like the ones from The Last of Us In a way I think its realistic I found the rifle's blue triangle sights disorienting and the Large revolver pistol to be better in sighting and shooting I feel like this is a well made game but I just don't like it if I could I would leave a in between line I dont like the game or dislike it really but I going to end up leaving a dislike after tying this If the game was about zombies Left 4 Dead would be better but I am not sure what the game really is about Maybe getting to the surface like Portal 2
Mas que levantar la Argentina
si jugalo ta bueno
i love the game but im broke
Repetitive game-play loop where the only progression is git gud Which is fine until you reach the second map where fog gets introduced and it destroys your eyeballs I get it it's supposed to be spooky because you can't see anything but the fog is so bright it's like staring into the sun No thanks
pretty good
This game can kick your ass easily
GOOD game
Good guy
repetitive after the first mission
una mierda de juego
Jogo excelente principalmente para jogar com amigos Muito Vale apena na 29,90 no Rodei em um Ryzen 3 com video integrado tudo no Aqui rodou sem bugs
If you take raw sewage vomit game development and combine them you end up with this game
One of the worst games I ever played Broken matchmaking system expect to wait 10 minutes to start a match if you are lucky Ridiculous difficulty I've been playing for hours at easiest difficulty with randos and every match lasts until the first or second alarm door where we get wiped and have to start over from scratch Boring stealth gameplay Each time you seen enemies sleepers you need to slowly crouch walk around them taking pauses so they don't wake up Usually one rando gets bored and starts shooting so there is no point Boring exploration Basically you travel around ugly boring grey underground corridors until you find an alarm door and face swarms of enemies until you either die or lose nearly all your health
noice
good but very hard
GTFO And let them sleep
Kind of okay but crash without warning after 30 min Not recommended until is fixed
has terrible coop
shitty

GET THE FUCK OUT OF THIS GAME
pp
No se entiende nada espere 30 minutos para iniciar una partida que asco
Enjoyed the game for a couple hours I would give it an average score if I was rating it GTFO has potential But after a while it got a bit repetitive I don't think it has a lot of longevity unless there are more scenery changes and enemy variations added GTFO out has a cool atmosphere in the menus and as you initially drop in The ability to draw on the map screen with team8s is the best I've seen in a shooter Using the computer terminals was confusing but my friends who have real-life computer jobs picked it up easily The team8 bots were not too terrible They would heal us and resupply us occasionally as well as revive us
GOOD BUT A COMMITMENT
Good But it is not worth more than 15 euros
Awesome game loved every second of it
Probado en el fin de semana gratuito No me ha terminado de convencer a un precio muy inferior y con amigos
Great game the mechanic can be a bit overwhelming for new player but after 1 or 2 game you pretty much understand how it work I wish there was a bit more ressource available during mission but i guess the lack of control is part of the experience I didnt get to experience the game to it's full content since i'm only playing for the free weekend promotion they have but form what I have seen it's very promising
I am so glad I tried during the free weekend I would have been P'd if I paid for it It sounds like the kind of game I enjoy Been looking for a good co-op so the free weekend was perfect The first time I started it it crashed Started it back up and let it slowly load The game-play graphics were nothing to be impressed by It did stutter a bit here and there but wasn't unplayable I played threw the introduction and one AI assisted mission not for me I will say the companies that offer free weekends of the full game are awesome

Bastante repetitivo y el 90 del tiempo te lo pasas agachado atacando a melee no disparando oleadas de enemigos como anuncian Es mas parecido a un juego de sigilo que shooter
muito bom
Pensa em uma bomba agora explode ela e joga os
Thanks for the free trial this game is trash
Please step into the Biosc SHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHIT

Good Game Play
lo probe gratuito con un amigo y apesar de tener una pc de gama baja pude jugar con todo al minimo me parecio muy divertido pero complicado recomendadisimo
GTFO es un juego donde el y la rapidez de que resuelvas las cosas te van a facilitar mucho el trabajo siempre en equipo Muy buenos espectacular y el sonido no nada mal El sigilo y la oscuridad pueden ser tus aliados pero no siempre antes de salir a la experiencia y procura no morir en la primera puerta Descifra y desbloquea accesos busca objetos y pero la Es una pena que este juego no posea el modo VR nativo porque es una pasada como se ve y lo fluido que funciona claro que equipo pero la cambia por completo Tanto si te gusta jugar en plano como en VR con mod lo recomiendo
fun
Game so buggy
Ton of fun
bom demais
great hardcore experience very very very hard game for the slow and steady player type if you see this game and want to shoot some weird stuff in a weird place with some weird guns keep in mind this is a hardcore shooter
Not hard at all
insanely boring
not great
thought this was a horror fps but really its just a stealthy game where you can barely shoot basically if you shoot a bullet your game ends not my type of game
This is the first time I give a game a bad review but I don't recommend to play this game if you can't play insanely difficult game play IT'S SUPER DIFFICULT TO PLAY
fun
I'm confused why people are leaving negative reviews when they've only played it for 30 minutes on free weekend If you don't like it don't buy it The UI is a bit weird but you'll get used to it very quickly you'd know this if you played the game for more than an hour Bottom line if this looks like your kind of game and you have a couple friends to play with buy it
this has to be the worst game i think ive ever touched
This game has no mercy I love it
nie ma chuja to przejdziesz
scary big men go raghhhhh then i go sad sad and die
Lo unas horas gracias a que lo pusieron gratis por unos y bastante bueno lo malo es que es muy agresivo con los jugadores nuevos por lo que puede llegar a ser de entender provocando el abandono para aquellos que les gustan los retos terminas saliendo adelante y no toma mucho tiempo agarrarle la mano solo se necesita un poco de paciencia
For those who wishes to play this game in single player mode it is extremely hard to do so because the bots cannot sync with your actions and you have to command them for certain actions like planting turrets This game is very tactical and you'll need friends to play with if so this is going to be a fun game to play with
UI is terrible I don't want to interact with it just to enter the game and I don't want to waste my time holding the keys to go around the menu The first time time you start the game it looks cool but it starts to become real annoying after the second time It's also terrible in navigation aspect I still don't know how to kick players from my lobby and how to play only with friends Just setting the lobby for friends ONLY is a lot of frustration as the lobby is insta-filled with random players which you can't kick If you are fast enough you can invite your friend and then he has to be fast enough to join Or you need to be fast enough and set the player to bots AFTER the server is up and running and randoms can join If there is such functionality as the above then it is not obvious and if there is not wtf were the devs thinking Gameplay itself is kinda borish and repetitive but still decent I guess Graphics are good We encountered several incredibly annoying map breaking bugs such as player not being able to pick up ANYTHING including his sentry gun which made the end map horde fight much more difficult Overall Game is way overpriced for what it offers It's good to kill time but only if you're prepared to lose your nerves due to terrible UI and huge bugs I do not recommend buying this at full price I played it for FREE weekend and I almost regret it If I bought it I would definitely ask for a refund
Best shooter i've ever tried
best game of the year that you suck at run and GTFO
Downloaded for the free weekend but I had to stop because of how terrible the hud and menu text is Text is small fuzzy and there's a damned mirror image thing behind everything so I have to strain my eyes just to read the settings Then on top of the text sucking in general there's the fact that the menu moves around as you move your mouse cursor When you move it to the right then everything on screen moves slightly to the right This makes it so that my eyes have to refocus on whatever I'm trying to read and it's miserable trying to read through the settings while looking for a fix There apparently is a setting for the text pixel crap but it does nothing for the menu text Very cool I don't really want to play a game that is actively trying to give me a migraine
Never enough ammo health or light in this game Not to mention half of the time you have no idea where you're going or doing Just open door fight horde nearly die run out of ammo and health actually die REPEAT Stealth is dysfunctional and the fact you have to stand in random circles to progress is ridiculous It's like the game wanted to be an arcade game but realistic at the same time but forgot to implement any actual fun factor into the recipe I doubt even with a full team would this be nearly enjoyable enough to justify spending full price or on-sale price Glad I tested it out before making the mistake of wasting my money on a game that looks better than it plays I would not recommend this game to anyone I know that actually values their money and mental stability My suggestion to whoever reads this in search of a new game keep looking through the store there is far better options out there for you
fun with friends
Depresator
Deep Rock Galactic for adults The challenge is real Try to discover mechanic on my own without tips and tricks video's this makes it way better Free weekend was a good move Everything works solid but playing Solo with bots not so much The inviting of friends does some weird things and doesn't always work
Thanks for letting me play for free I am sure there is allot of players who like this game but i am sadly not 1 of them 0,03 of all players got the badge not get downed during an expedition/mission Yes i got it but i think this game is realy hard its more work then fun Uninstalling
Shi h dost nahi hai saath khelne ko
STFU I got glowsticks
quick unprofessional and uninformed 6 hr review Visuals and audio are good Atmosphere is a bit repetitive but still quite good in 3 words DEEP DARK FANTAS-i mean facilities Gunplay is quite serviceable Made up scarcity feels cheap like you can find a locked chest behind a lvl 2 alarm door with nothing in it or you can find used medpacks and ammo packs in locked chests but there are no other humans in the game Tools and weapon combos are relatively good but you won't find out until you die a lot with your buddies Stealth kinda sucks heavily unreliable Melee weapons suck ass but this isn't Vermintide so whatever Navigation is hell there's no way to mark where you've been what door leads to what where you left enemies untouched etc we thought chem lights would help us mark places but they disappear entirely not just the light after a couple of minutes Interactive map is kinda cool but it does not account for height and there is no legend so icons are subject of speculation for the group there is no permanent marker or eraser Using terminals is fun for the first 30 minutes then it's more of a boring routine same with hacking Scanners will purposefully lead you to your death this feels incredibly cheap as they are made this way intentionally so you can't pass the first time without knowing exactly where they gonna be waves of enemies are endless until you fully scan Speaking of scanners make absolutely no sense there is no scanner or camera or any type of physical input device for it only a couple of lines on the ground were you must stand and wait as the hordes destroy your entire team Enemies feel a bit boring it feels like you are fighting against guys with smart guns in cyberpunk 2077 their projectiles are slow homing spit-balls that you can dodge every now and then melee seems to be fixed so you can't dodge it enemies will crawl in the middle of your group without apparent pathing they can sometimes clip inside you and leave you stuck while getting killed Bots are detrimental to humans they don't use tools chat or even use their guns at full ammo to clear rooms only when a horde comes they feel more like shitty meat turrets with low health Enemies never kill you you can only be downed so you can cheat a little by sending kamikaze players and picking them up after with fixed health regen up to 20 There is a tutorial it was mostly useless You WILL need to watch a 1hr video explaining the basics or die horribly every time There's supposedly procedural generation somewhere around the game i guess the name of the item you are collecting changes some times but other than that it's always the same paths and locations you need to visit everything else is there to confuse you Overall it feels dirt-cheap-difficult its made for you to repeat the same mission over and over again until you learn all the patterns of every scan where exactly to put turrets and which doors lead to what 5/10 Average at best This game wishes it was PvE Tarkov but cannot erase it's l4d2 origins no matter how much Alien Isolation merch they wear
Ich habe nicht mal das Tutorial geschafft und nach dem zweiten Mal sterben war es mir zu Schaut euch mal die Errungenschaften an das sagt doch alles aus
Consider this a mixed review I had this game sitting in my backlog for 2 years and I finally got around to playing it with 2 friends over the free weekend We only played for one mission so please take my criticism as a new player's first impression which didn't go too well To my understanding there is no place like a shooting range to acclimate to guns and equipment The times we performed stealth it was hit or miss There were the obvious mess ups that could be attributed towards a player moving at the wrong time Other times we had cases when a player not remotely near an unaware enemy would alert it Rooms that had more than 3 enemies huddled together proved to be difficult We couldn't tell what we needed to do in order to clear out the room One of us got stuck in place because the sleepers were continuously searching without a reasonable pause to move The larger enemies are what we had the most difficulty with I was just told while writing this exactly why they proved difficult We had 2 hammers and one spear me we consistently were aiming at it's head not the dark portion of the body like I have just been told The game did not communicate well that we had hit the wrong part of the large sleepers body Either we would wipe upon attempting to kill it or at least one of us would go down Don't get me wrong I love the ambiance this game has unmatched tension and the sound design is immersive and grotesque We ran into a bug where tabbing out has a chance to fire your weapon if equipped The game doesn't have the smoothest optimization and lacks the swathe of graphics settings found in other high fidelity games Tldr the game is great in creating an atmosphere but it falls completely flat when telling the player if they did a game mechanic/system right Feedback from being damaged is also lacking I might come back later and try playing with people in the discord I won't write the game off completely
awesome sauce
Played it on the free weekend Great game in many aspects My main takeaways Fully functional automatic matchmaking I played seven matches with total strangers over the course of two days Got full teams within 10-20 seconds each time Now this could of course have been because of the high player count 15k CCU In game voice-chat I dont get it why so many CO-OP games lack in game voice chat At least in this game it's there and it works like a charm Albeit the game actually has a range of game voice commands that you can activate and it has text chat so shy ppl can still play with success You get access to all weapons and gear from the get go No reason to grind to get better gear For casual players like myself that's awesome Great atmosphere in the game gunplay is satisfying Missions do get repetitive sneak around find items open doors hold off hordes return items type commands in terminals goto next door etc but at least mission items appear to change location from one playthrough to the next so that's a good design Impossible to play solo with bots unless you go 100 stealth The game will pretty much require you to go stealth If you and your team wanna Rambo that will work for five minutes then you're out of ammo and out of luck So if you like constant action the game is not for you it requires patience and taking it slowly This can of course be a positive thing for many but I put it on the minus since I like to shoot stuff in games There was a ton of stuff in the EULA I had to accept I didn't read it so maybe they now own my soul I've had a high number of crashes mid game I have basically never had any other game crash so something going on there
ROCK AND STONE TO THE BONE
it funny
No un joraca tenia que hacer me una hora tratando de entender y nada esa es la mera neta
game is really hard but the HUb was crazy bad
I don't know how this game is supposedly acclaimed for its atmosphere when the lighting shadows are so frickin jank In Soviet GTFO the game logic likes to assume that light is the absence of darkness and will often give your optic nerves a mini stroke and blind you with shadows when approaching sources of illumination with dark pockets cause it gets confused but still feels a perpetual need to shove its grimdark edginess down your throat Don't even get me started on the fog Like seriously GET THE FOG OUT Oh Now I see Whilst somewhat interesting and rather quaint the game is priced way too high to be this jank wonky Especially when the difficulty is designed to be brutal with zero options Infuriating bugs that cost me entire runs aside I once spent 17 minutes and all the resources in the map trying to get my Artificial bungling bot teammate to reinforce a bloody door every which way to no avail as he sputtered his disgusting pus-coloured blobs of C-Foam all over the place literally everywhere else but the door During said fiasco another bot kept dancing circles around me while constantly reminding me in a strong Irish accent to keep my hands off my i]male domestic fowl[/i So.yeah For real Buy some friends before you buy this game Also why does everyone's ass gotta be all ruptured and full of giant pulsating haemorrhoids That's just i]nasty[/i
The game is great every detail is important
i I've mined minerals on Hoxxes fought hordes of chaos on Atoma Prime and gathered scrap on Rend but this job has been the worst by far i Over all the cons outweigh the pros 6/10 I'm glad I was able to try this game for free during the free weekend after the 2023 VGA I've had my eye on this game for a long time but the price always held me back from what the internet described as hard L4D 40 is way too much for this game It has a steep learning curve it's difficult in general and it requires people to play with Expecting a group of 4 friends to spend a collective 160 to play a game like this is wild h3 Pros h3 The presentation style and design are amazing Very visually impressive The gunplay is smooth and satisfying I didn't feel like I was constantly fighting against recoil The sound design is top tier and really lent to the feeling of firing a real weapon It's worth mentioning that the AI teammates are not useless I thought it was nice that they will ping lockers chests and doors for me h3 Cons h3 The UI and DOS-style menus are stylized to a fault It's hard to understand the information I'm being given when it comes in with a flash is typed out quickly and then disappears as quickly as it arrived Immersive menus are cool but not when they take away from the gameplay A great example of this are the terminals Sure the DOS-style UI fits the setting but typing out commands over and over felt like pulling teeth just to get vague information The enemies I was very disappointed in the stark lack of enemy variety in the game A horde of monsters is practically the same model copy-pasted 20 times Fighting them is also very frustrating The melee ones have a strange snake-like attack that's hard to anticipate and it i always i hits The ranged enemies shoot projectiles that home in on you and they i always i hit The big ones are the same as the small ones they just have more health The combat The guns look really nice and sound punchy but they fall short of being effective Enemies can tank an insane amount of bullets and they will do an equally insane amount of damage to a player About 5 hits and you're dead which doesn't sound like a lot until you meet a horde of both melee and ranged enemies that i always i hit A general lack of direction The first few times I started a mission I found myself asking okay now what So I ended up watching a guide on YoutTube I feel that relying on some outside source to understand how to play the game is a red flag Lack of Content I was surprised to see that there wasn't a cosmetics store or any kind of currency that I could find which is a good thing for a 40 game But I played for almost 8 hours and I only unlocked one unremarkable gas mask I felt like there was no progression in that 8 hours like I was just playing the same level over and over When I play Deep Rock Galactic I always feel like I'm progressing towards something and I will unlock something new and excited every 1-2 hours GTFO has been out for 2 years For a 40 game it should have more than this Lack of focus What is the point of this game What's the fun part It has stealth mechanics not fun it has guns and hordes of enemies to shoot too hard and it has looting not rewarding There wasn't anything in this game that I was genuinely excited for Lastly the game is very repetitive Each mission is a cycle of start find locked door find key open door with a standoff loot objective leave To be more accurate the cycle was normally fail stealth die GTFO is a lot like a raisin oatmeal cookie that's disguised as chocolate chip It looks great it has AAA presentation but after taking a bite I'm only left with disappointment
Game blows im just retarded I run out of ammo and my team shoots at me like i'm a wanted terrorist The lights are so bright I feel like im seeing Jesus my eyes were tearing I was really excited to try this game but it was a major letdown The graphics were outdated the controls were clunky and the storyline was so predictable I could guess the ending within the first few minutes It felt like a waste of time and money Save yourself the frustration and skip this The bot even tried to crack a joke and let me say it was disappointingly the joke fell as flat as a pancake left out in the rain It was like watching paint dry while expecting fireworks The punchline lacked punch and the setup felt older than dial-up internet heard better jokes from a malfunctioning robot trying to be funny Steer clear unless in dire need of a snooze fest
awesome game creepy critters and i shat myself when i realised it was behind me the whole time D
Naja komplett unspielbar ohne feste crew
OK where to start tutorial blows ass i have no idea how to find ammo do i need to learn python programming also when i press search for ammo it says theres none so theres no ammo on any map zero health zero ammo GTFO more like get the fuck out and never play this game better off getting a phd in engineering then learning this complicated ass game suprised markiplier didnt shoot himself in the head playing
ilk defalarca sonunda sadece sessiz
i played it on free weekend its a fun co-op shooter were playing with friends at max group is for sure more fun then machtmaking but that is still fun tho i would buy it if is on sale but hey that is my opion other thing is talking with your team mates is a important thing to have defetinely when there a alarm doors asking for horde wave coming to your location and need to defend it
It is a fun experience but is very hard to get into It is definitely for a more hardcore fan base which isn't necessarily a bad thing I had quite a lot of fun with the few hours I played it but don't purchase this unless you know you are ready to die I personally had a lot of fun and will probably buy it after the free trial This is basically a dark souls experience with a Left 4 Dead twist I am a huge Left 4 Dead 2 fan so maybe that's why I love it
This is the kind of game that wants to flash you its full butt-naked package with its difficulty expecting to impress or shock you but you just sit there and think to yourself Huh To elaborate this is a co-op horror extraction shooter akin to similar titles like Deep Rock Galactic and Warhammer 40k Darktide This one however is quirky Quirky in what way Severely punishing with difficulty How so Well you see the guns do more than enough damage to dispatch every threat without much effort HOWEVER how the devs decided to balance this is by making ammo not exist which is very obtuse and annoying To continue melee has a deceptively short range which is once again obtuse and annoying You have to physically sneak up to enemies to melee them however they will sporadically go into a echo-location state in which every movement will start to set them off so you end up having to wait for the toddler to stop spazzing out so you can actually go in for the boring kill Good luck doing this in a reasonable amount of time if there is more than 3-4 enemies close to each other they WILL do echo-location sequentially with very little downtime in-between and you WILL like it Have fun pressing W for 1 second at a time every 30-40 seconds Gunplay Solid I like it I don't have much to say about it The atmosphere is good however it is WAY TOO DARK you literally can't see anything and you can't change brightness or gamma settings Your team is REQUIRED to have a Bio-Scanner just so you can see enemies reasonably Idk overall pretty trash game that wastes your time Boring
Having four dumbass in team is perfect for this game
2SPOOKY4U
I shid mysel
Weder Horror noch Taktisch Die Trailer sind vielversprechend aber das Gameplay ist langsam und langweilig
a ia dos aliados e da pra jogar em qualquer lugar que tenha nevoa
very challenging game
GET THE FUCK OUT man ansich gutes Game
This is a bad shooter wrapped in a fancy package
This game looks a lot more interesting from it's Steam store page but it really isn't that graphically advanced nor interesting gameplay wise The Gun combat is lacking and feels junky and laggish while the graphics are mediocre at best the entire game feels like Killing Floor but as an extraction shooter Another good analogue would be the budget horror version of Deep Rock Galactic with outdated enemy design and graphics from a custom quake game mod Overall everything is junky in the game the textures the UI the menu UI is trash tier the enemy AI the bad lighting the gun gameplay the enemy movement and animations
no me gusto
Free weekend player Take that as you will My number one issue with this game difficulty The game is admittedly difficult but for the wrong reasons Rather than making combat itself difficult the game encourages absolute preparation for every encounter by making resources scarce and enemy attacks devastating I like this approach to difficulty but it lends itself to issues The game does not allow players to move more than a morsel of resources around making forced encounters difficult Moving around resources feels like trying to gain the system and resources don't stack JUST LET ME CARRY MORE DAMMIT Turrets are not easy to use precisely and waste ammo frequently Yes the bio-tracker can mark targets but that's useless when A a huge hoard is approaching and B It has to recharge for longer than 2 seconds Seriously who decided to make the recharge so long Why does it recharge at all Isn't being without a weapon enough of a debuff Animations are poorly done and enemies will stagger for far too long and even attack while in a stagger animation Enemies do not telegraph their actions well and often key body parts are obscured why do they crab walk that's stupid Both of these points lead to most firefights to be panicked with far more ammunition than necessary being used An especially negative point in a game about resource management Enemy melee range is ridiculous and enemy projectiles are cheap as they follow the player It is my opinion that any game that wishes to be considered skill based should let skilled players leave every encounter unharmed Usually this is the case but with major events such as door scans and reactor startups this just isn't possible The UI is vague giving little to no information about weapons and tools High ammo capacity really doesn't tell me much I'd rather you gave me mag sizes and max ammo amounts Charge-up is dumb as hell across the board ESPECIALLY on LMG's That's all I'm going to say about it As ever this game has potential and I'm perfectly aware that it is being made by a small team I just don't like it's approach to difficulty Cheesing my way through every encounter isn't fun That isn't to say everything should be scripted I like having options I like experimenting and I like seeing what works and what doesn't But as Dunkey says What sucks is when you find out what works just isn't that fun
s
this game is really fun tbh you just need friends that's it
god
polecam
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren spart euch den Speicher und eure kostbare Zeit mit unfreundlichen Ein Mann der dieses Spiel hat und sich um seine sorgt
Excellent game that requires a good deal of teamwork to navigate the challenges and combat ahead very cool aesthetics

Very cool very scary really fun to use weapons and tools the raw sort of no hand holding the game does with the difficulty and figuring stuff out with terminals is really interesting enemies are awesome I just wish there was more variety especially early in the game If you have friends to play with then BUY THIS GAME NOW If you don't then I would be cautious because you will have to use the discord to try find people and if that is too bothersome for you then I would hold off on this game for sure
el juego por la buenas que pero me un chasco al ver que para encontrar jugadores a tu partida debes esperar al menos 10 minutos Una espera muy larga para unos minutos de vicio ya que cuando todos mueren la gente se va de la sala tedioso la espera cada vez que necesitas encontrar jugadores para tu partida El juego literalmente muerto te obligan a buscar jugadores a un enlace externo de Discord lo cual me parece penoso tener que ir a buscar jugadores para tu partida a las redes sociales cuando ser algo inmediato y Apenas aparecen jugadores en sala y no puedes jugar con bots o meterte en la partida de otros jugadores avanzados Te obliga a jugar las rondas desde el comienzo haciendo que la de jugadores sea complicada Es un juego que NECESITAS SI o SI DE UN EQUIPO O AMIGOS con el para jugarlo sino gastado casi para un bonito Si no cambian el planteamiento de partida no le veo futuro al juego es una pena porque la y la jugabilidad son buenas pero las largas esperas para buscar jugadores en tu partida arruinan por completo la experiencia Lamentablemente no lo puedo recomendar si siquiera ahora que gratis cuando termine el fin de semana a tener 4 gatos en Ni siquiera puedo poner gameplay me paso tiempo esperando en la sala que jugando Tiempo y dinero perdidos

DINGUERIE Hors norme terrifiant dans un premier temps apprendre ce jeu est une aventure Une fois qu'on le connait mieux il prend un tout nouvel aspect une dimension presque fun parfois on laisse la peur au placard et on se affronter ce qu'on connait Ou pas GTFO un Horror Shooter comme il en existe trop peu Qui un incontournable du genre CRAZY Out of the lines terrifying for the first times learning this game is an adventure itself Once we know it better it takes another shape sometimes almost fun we leave the fear behind and we get ready to fight what we know Or not GTFO is a Horror Shooter like few else It deserve to be a classic of the genre

AMAZING
Don't you dare let them see you
This is my kind of game finna main it after i buy it 100/10 This did not go well at all.1001/10
It's just not for me Repetive levels same-ish mechanics no character/gear progression often just simply frustrating
One's enjoyment of this game is going to be dependent on who your partners are It very much requires cooperation setting up defenses not alerting swarms distributing resources navigating well pinging objective locations from a terminal so others can find them The matchmaking system is pretty buggy and I spent most of my time trying to get a full room and another portion regretting being in that room However a few good rooms showed the potential of this game If you can find a good team either some friends or maybe the official discord I cant think of a better modern co-op game
i like to see improvement in this game ngl its good but the menu is pain
Es un juegazo aun que obvio si quieres pasarte las misiones tienes que coordinarte bien con los demas algo que a veces se complica por que la gente va muy a lo loco pero sin embargo se puede hacer aun que e tenido un problema en el que con una squad completa luego no me carga los personajes de la gente y luego cuando estoy en la mision se traba el juego como si perdiera la conexion con la partida pero mi internet va bien no se si sea por que mi pc no sea lo suficiente para los requisitos o si es por un bug
I've never been so motion sick and visually overstimulated in my life Terrible UI and extremely boring this isn't a 40 bucks game

too poopy
Awesome game to play with your ride or die friends
dont download this game if you have friends Didint get passed menu cause its impossible to make a party
I love dying because a bot shot me by accident 10/10
If your teammate triggers entire room or scout make sure to magdump their ass
Prepare to lose sleep and sanity This horror shooter is a relentless onslaught of challenges GTFO is not easy and somehow the most achieved achievement has a 0.4 completion rate but this game is awesome I've been playing all the levels solo with AI teammates and have been having loads of fun This game is extremely difficult but I got addicted to the challenge I like this game
game baad sorry gues this not my game
This game is a stunner in terms of atmosphere created by outstanding visuals and audio and a unique gameplay that reminds of so much yet nothing in particular It is a refreshing FPS experience too being a mixture of well known and new mechanics But it is spoiled by a huge flaw right at the game's foundation it's matchmaking system It is broken beyond comprehension given the level of development and game's popularity Long story short this game can only be played as a co-op you can hardly run around by yourself Since getting 3 of your friends to hop in is a tough task you often have to rely on randoms out there willing to party up But you just can't unable to can even Matchmaking feels pre-release being infested with bugs and missing core features 1 It lags a lot Often it just terminates itself for no reason or boots you randomly from lobby 2 It's not user-friendly it is user-hostile It takes time and effort to understand how this thing supposed to be simple works Which button you have to press to achieve what goal You will also get booted from matchmaking while trying to figure this out as mentioned earlier 3 Hosting is a societal menace You can't identify the host you can't kick AFKers from lobby You will host a lobby for a specific mission start matchmaking to fill the 3 player slots and then you are suddenly reassigned to a different lobby with a different host that chose a different mission Or you are lucky enough for the host role to just get passed to another player after you find that last guy for the squad And he won't see it Because the game just doesn't tell you you have to find out for yourself whether you are the host or not by checking several options 4 Connection issues I can only assume that the lack of a region-lock of some sort is the reason behind the connectivity issues you'd get every now and then i.e a huge delay that renders you helpless Like when you get a player from Asia to host the game while playing from Europe Or vice-versa I doubt that multiple instances of the above-mentioned could be a coincedence 5 Matchmaking options don't work Want a specific mission tier No you'll get a random one Language choice Random too Want to host Chances are you won't be the host as said above So there's little to no sense in customizing your matchmaking it just doesn't work And all this happens in cooperation based game meaning you literally can't play it or well you can but it will take a painstaking amount of time to just get into a mission in which you are likely to fail Other than that the game is almost fantastic The map UI could be clearer and there could be a haven for newbies like Rundown 1 lock for new players but these are just a trifle compared to the matchmaking issue Hopes are high it'll get reworked someday
boring garbage
very cool
I wouldn't recommend this game to those who do not have people to play with Online matchmaking is lackluster to say the least and it's a lot easier to complete a mission when you have some actual coordination going I played on a controller At one point in the tutorial gyro was suddenly enabled Make sure you disable it entirely in Steam's controller settings Personally I was unable to remap the crouch button which is set by default to the rightmost face button of the controller I had to crouch by reaching over to my keyboard and hitting Ctrl This game's not very difficult to jump straight into as a newbie The missions definitely feel tough in the ways that they need to The more of the game you play the better you get at navigating its challenges You can really see how neatly things will go once you're accustomed to the weapons range gadgets etc I like the weapon variety here but there are definitely some that are WAAAAAY more useful than others I believe that the game could do with a bit more flair here and there Gun charms would be neat and wouldn't break the immersion whatsoever It would be nice to have something to chase while you finish the main objective The character cosmetics are definitely a step in the right direction but those are a very slow chase The mission format definitely feels a little stale in some regards Searching for 12 keycards in a massive map just FEELS boring when you spend 15 minutes of your game time legitimately just walking to and fro I do not like how thick the fog gets in this game I feel like the lights just make it worse There should be an option to head to a room in a facility repair/restart the dehumidifier and clear the fog out The downside would be that you lose valuable cover for sneaking around a lot of enemies but the upside would be that you can actually see what's going on Aesthetic is very cool
som fan
P.S
played this game while on free weekend deal Game is very cool allows you to coordinate with other players especially with friends high risks very unforgiving hardcore experience Its a very niche game for those people who are into what described
GTFO is a Coop-based PvE Hardcore shooter which requires Teamwork Good communication Patience Gunskill Clear mind in hectic situations for not getting overwhelmed in stressful moments critical thinking Most importantly actual friends/teammates Note this is only my experince so far and what I think u need the most in the majority of the time while playing this game Take it with a grain of salt and try the game out urself Opinion will vary U can play a team out of 1-4 players and u can add bots to ur team aswell Its highly recommended to pick up other players via the discord server or calling some friends of urs since its a communication heavy game This is also where the most fun comes from in my opinion Now some info for the actual game In GFTO u and ur teammates are prisoners that are being sent down into a facility/complex filled with sleepers mutant-zombie-like creatures U have a main objective to accomplish as a team U can equip urself with various guns and tools These are all unlocked by default so theres no grind other than the levels Rundowns to complete U get sent into the complex with not enough ammo and tools to begin with so u cant just run in and kill every monster U play stealthy with ur teammates quietly eliminating enemies to get closer to ur objective Ur plans will definitely go wrong sometimes and mistakes cannot always be avoided Thats the moment where u have no choice but to awake a swarm full of sleepers and shoot down every single one of them while ur ammo and health will continuously get less and less U gotta use strategy and keep reminding urself that theres no better and worse teammate Everyone is in the same boat and equally important to execute ur plan to success And thats what makes this game intense and exciting It surely is a energy draining game but holy shit does it make a good job Let me add that u cannot simply spray out ur entire mag in hopes it will hit enemies u gotta make sure it hits atleast somewhat The only negative side is that missions can be very long make sure u have enough time on ur hands missions can easily take up to 1h or more Overall the time to complete can vary if u keep things in mind like amount of teammates first run in the rundown experienced or unexperienced etc Missions can be under 1h long Other than that I dont have anything else to say other then if u like difficult shooter games which require u to cooperate with people then this is worth a shot I will probably update the review with further detail
It's Sucks so bad You can't even get passed the first mission Avoid playing this piece of trash
KAPI
I didn't even get through the tutorial and menu's without hurting my brain Not sure how this is even played by people

Needlessly awkward menus objectives and navigation Wondering from one lifeless steel room to another until you run out of ammo and team wipe Terminals requiring BIOS like commands for what could have been a one button prompt Multiplayer and stealth segments never mix Tedious gunplay Too difficult in a not properly playtested sort of way

Played during the free weekend The game is expertly made there's no doubt about it The aesthetics setting and feel is absolutely fantastic The game serves up tension not found outside outright horror games and you share in that tension However the game's design is so difficult as to be unfriendly Despite playing with three competent friends on comms we kept losing usually on the exfiltration run which is a really frustrating and unsatisfying feeling Additionally for all the game's immersive qualities it has some idiosyncracies that seem to be there only to screw over players Things like being unable to stack resources and shut security doors as well as the twitchy movement of even hibernating sleepers screwing over your stealth attacks are glaringly unfriendly in their design If the hardest of the hardcore is for you and your three friends then GTFO is too Otherwise this is not for you
If you can manage to navigate through the unnecessarily convoluted lobby and matchmaking system then manage to make it to the midgame point without anyone leaving the lobby and thereby handicapping your team as the game does not adjust the difficulty level and then not encounter the famous can't press the use key bug then maybe you'll score a chance at winning a round It isn't even that it is hard it is just not a well-made game A big resource hog on top of it for such little graphical payoff Steer clear of this one unless you're a fan of wasting your time

os players desse jogo piores que os bots isso quando tem player por que o jogo ta meio morto mesmo com ele ficando na e 3 dias de infelizmente tirando isso jogo
Onpa paska videopeli en suasittele is shit video play me not reckoment
love this game super strategic and just overall fun and addicting
Played this when it was free to play for a short time Played with bots died on the first big wave of monster sad face Played with full team of randoms the level froze and i had to exit stage sad face Played another with randoms 2 left the game don't know if game froze or just left Slugged through with a party of 2 died on the last wave surprisingly happy face Hopefully it was just some random problems with the matchmaking since the bots are useless Note this game NEEDS COMMUNICATION AND PATIENCE THIS IS NOT A NORMAL SHOOTER DON'T PLAY IT AS SUCH Overall i will buy the game and i do recommend this to others
hella good stuff man like frfr

GTFO just didn't do it for me It's got this repetitive game loop that gets old fast You're basically doing the same stuff over and over again and it gets boring real quick
Not my cup of tea Difficult learning curve Players keep quitting prematurely during matches The fact that this COMMERCIAL game is another LIVE SERVICE trap does not help matters

Bot AI is very bad sniper turret doesn't shoot for some reason weapons are not very impactful only thing tactical about this game is that you don't have a lot of ammo and you can attempt to sneak I do however appreciate lack of dlcs and microtransactions
the game over all is great but the price is too high and i think its not worth,maybe if its 15 or lower i would buy it
1/4

Playing on the free weekend game is good fun and tactical It requires alot of effort on single player but most maps will require people to complete them as the bots just dont cover all bases Recommend with friends but playable on solo
trash game

Nudniejszej gry nie ani to trudne ani straszne nawet dobrze wykonane nie jest wystarczy tylko aby dostrzec bugi Te pozytywne recenzje chyba kupione a ta cena to w na sali wyssana z palca nie idzie za i kontentu 2/10 nie polecam
Great fun unbelievably hard though
I played a few hours with my friends and I suppose I should of watched more gameplay From what most Youtubers and such show of this game is the high action fighting and barely surviving on the extracts What they don't show you is the other 90%ish of the game that's stealthing around enemies trying to not wake them up 2 hours of that to find ID cards as the mission objective hope you don't miss one One of the biggest things was I was playing with the bioscanner Why can't you mark sleeping enemies and only moving/aggressive ones That seems like a bit of a missed feature Most of the guns feel like you're shooting spitwads at enemies as well no weight to them at all If you have a game that focuses on stealth and when you HAVE to shoot your guns make it feel worth it Could be a good game for some but I'd really urge anyone to watch some full mission playthroughs before buying the game Also you NEED 4 people to play this game The bots are worthless they just stand in place tanking hits until they go down clip through the map all over and don't follow commands accurately in the slightest Had a 3 man and one bot bot shot the foam on the wall next to the door instead of ON THE MASSIVE DOOR Glad this was on a free weekend I've been on the fence of buying this game for ages
Fun to play and since the bots don't do stealth kills or go to security scan points without you being around is extremely challenging to play solo
Haven't been even able to play the game due to it crashing when trying to connect to Steam servers so
Oyun esenler Oyunda esenler katman katman iniyorsunuz bi yana Oyun zor hissi harika yere de ise yerler ve kemikleri falan sesleri ve Grafikleri atmosferle ve sanat oyun harika tam hak ediyor FAKAT oyun ama zor Adaletli bir var ama cidden oyun affetmiyor verebilecekseniz tavsiye ederim zamana ve paraya kesin ama herkesin bir muhtemelen oyunu fazla oyun vaad ettiklerini hayliyle veriyor ve buga falan da nadir
Lame gunplay lame mechanics repetitive crap
Only tried it when it was free during a weekend fun at all Difficult gameplay both in trying to survive and to know how to progress the level opening doors terminal commands etc

Fun with friends dead alone some randoms are nice havent tried discord MM just the standard in game MM i havent tried bots but my rule is never try bots with these types of games some little bugs or glitches like the animation of one of the crawlers were just sliding across the floor instead of running which did break the immersion but only happened once i think personally friendly fire is more of a hindrance than an enhancement of the game as you will be running and panic jumping when they come at you in hordes so it makes it hard for your team to give cover fire because you just end up losing them in the middle of the horde and shoot them aswell yes i shot my teammate i'm not proud of what i did overall i think the game is good and can still improve it still needs more development/refinement just know that this game was intended to be played with friends playing with randoms wont give you the complete experience same with solo so either play with randoms in hope of befriending people and getting a squad or just the discord server and hope to get regulars to play with who arent toxic

Sneak around clickers from the last of us then GTFO
Holly Molly First impression interesting dark creepy creatures stealth COOL After 1,5 hour boring the same the same boring boring The main shit is menu itself The second main shit is u didnt know nothing abot guns The third main shit is drop search extract repeat
Good Rainbow SIx but PVE
There are better quality games This game is really bad because It also repeats itself a lot and foggy parts are nauseous
Now I know why only 4.6 of people complete the tutorial and under 4 of players complete a Main Sector a single mission This game is boring the enemies are reused and all you do is click your left mouse button This game is the Tik-Tok equivalent of a monster-shooter

this game sucks scopes are bad cant see a shit

fucking terffyingly fun
The game is really fun tho quite difficult but what ruined it for me was a couple of bugs a black spot that suddenly appears on the screen and doesn't let you see anything and worse after our 4th attempt at completing a stage we cleared everything on the map and we just needed to get the item and extract to complete it but the item didn't spawn the terminal said it was on a specific area which we searched thoroughly as well as the adjacent areas and the item was nowhere to be found Just a shame cuz I really liked the game and the atmosphere and presentation are just great but that kind of bug ruined it for me and I'm not willing to go through that again If this was a small indie game in early access that would be acceptable If the devs manage to fix this game breaking bug i would give it another shot
Impossible to play without friends random lobbies are full of AFK players/hosts
First I just tried the game thanks to the free weekend It is a fun one it might give you some nightmares but that is fine Just my opinion but the game would be more friendly if there were something like a test arena where you can try out weapons and practice against enemies Oh and the online match making need some more options like which map etc As for the general performance the game is stable works fine for me
hardcore de engem az ingyenes megvett Spancival fun
intense gameplay
El juego bien pero no aporta nada Hay muy poca variedad de enemigos tampoco logra dar sustos ni terror y todos los mapas son iguales en un vacio y con puertas infinitas para buscar al objetivo La son misiones muy repetitivas y lo unico que desbloqueas avanzando en el juego son cosmeticos El juego parece entretenido y tiene un gameplay sencillito pero a las pocas horas te
esta muy bueno pero no tengo plata para comprarlo
Just yes

The game overall plays quite nicely especially considering its indie origin However there are a few quirks that could be improved and are beyond my comprehension because the devs have experience with the Payday 2 development One major issue is the matchmaking system Instead of letting players choose which maps they want to play the game randomly selects a map from 8 campaigns Just like in the L4D series one campaign is made of several maps This is extremely frustrating for new players who need to learn the levels and objectives to improve their skill The randomness can also lead to situations where players are thrown into maps that are too difficult for their skill level discouraging them from continuing giving up on the game and never returning The devs's intent was most likely to encourage players to experience all the different maps but it's severely detrimental to the learning curve and overall player experience There needs to be a way to select specific maps or at least choose a campaign to play through when using matchmaking Imagine my case just one friend to play with so we are forced to queue to find an additional 2 players and during our first 5 hours we always played a different level without having any clue what to do The average Joe will get frustrated and never return back You can choose which campaign and map of it to play if you host a lobby But the moment you decide to queue use matchmaking the choice is overwritten and a random map from the entire poll is chosen again If one needs to use a third-party service aka Discord and LFG to play a desired campaign it is just bad game design Overall the game is worth a try but the matchmaking system needs to be reworked to address the issue described above otherwise the size of the active population future and longevity of the game remain questionable But hey it was released 2 years ago yet having more players than Payday 3
It keeps freezing and crashing on the steam deck even though it has a playable badge
Buggy piece of shit game can't even initiate a match properly
matchmaking doesn't work buggy shit game
If you have friends this is good fun Dont bother alone
glad i chose to wait for a free weekend plays worse than killing floors from years ago not for me
Jogo meio merda armas ruins pretensioso demais Muito cheio de obscurantismo pra um que um Doom piorado Hunt melhor e uma bosta
Why do you have to hold down a key to do literally everything in the game Including changing settings REALLY Just makes everything feel so tedious

NOT FOR SOLO PLAYER!.It's to difficult.And Hard to find party
If youve been recommended this game as something similar to Left 4 Dead or other games like it ITS NOT THAT It's a sluggish slow game with a tedious gameplay loop designed to work against you that requires a hefty amount of time If you want fun and actual co-op horde shooters just go play Deep Rock Galactic Darktide or just Left 4 Dead If you're a masochist go for it anyone else just buy something fun
Meilleur jeu d'extraction 4 joueurs Aucun autre jeu du genre ne met autant l'accent sur la
Boring ugly and difficult
Una ballena un amigo me dijo que este juego hecho en Unity yo recordaba que en Unity estaban hechos esos juegos 3D todos pedorros y no algo con tantas shaders
Cool UI but horrendous gameplay Why would you buy this
One Two One Two One Two One Two One Two That one dude in your lobby
fome la wea simulador de dar vueltas
The terminal is really confusing Why not give it a GUI so non-programmers can understand it I can use it fine but my friend has to wait for me to wrestle with the terminal to find the information they had nothing to do while they wait Game is too punishing for new players there was no low-difficulty maps for beginners to try out or if there is the game did not point to it at all I'd rather have more handholding tutorials or customizable difficulty Now my friends dropped the game and whether I enjoy it does not matter the only options left is playing with public and it sucks
Cool game

Whoever approved of the main menu parallax menu items move around as you move the cursor should have their mental health checked This shit gives me full-on motion sickness I don't even get when playing VR There is no option to disable or lessen it holy f
Awesome style awesome atmosphere and awesome concept I like
oh my god it is so fun i cant wait to buy this when i am nolonger broke
Hmmm Where is the fun in this game when game will become interesting
GTFO
It's unique well optimized It's easier to play with friends but you can get through it alone too

GTFO More like get the fu out of my Steam library Feels very cheap and old not playable with controller
I played KF1 KF2 L4d1 2 and i like what GTFO has to offer It's a more realistic approach to zombie genre limited ammo and medkits,melee is your best friend It is something unique but at the same time i gotta agree that it's not for everyone You get punished real fast Keep failing until succeed
Interface esquisita esquisita acredito que valha a pena com tantos jogos desse mais consistentes
Don't listen to Astrovolt he said it was a stealth game There's parts where you have to set off alarms to open doors and it requires you to stand on small circles in the open and defend until the door opens which is the exact opposite of stealth It's meant to be challenging but it would help if the combat was fun and didn't disguise jank mechanics as difficulty
This game is insanely fun for something so unforgiving It took us 5 hours to complete the first level and I now need a break because OH MY GOD GET THIS GAME
After six hours of playing we finished the first level My heart is pumping I need a breather 10/10
free trial would not work on the deck i tried 5 times turned off gyro reinstalled verified he download all that every single time i hit the bottom of the shaft in tutorial it would lock my system up and would have to shut down manually this is great i was going to buy this not cool so i guess im not going to be buying this unless someone knows a fix

TL;DR An excellent FPS dungeon crawling co-op sci-fi horror game that wakes up and rewards your ability to learn act with patience and careful planning and obviously actually cooperate If you have that ability A four person squad of prisoners is dropped into what seems to be a mine shaft to reach a facility some few hundred meters below the surface with a very specific objective It could be to retrieve some data DNA sample deliver a given specimen to a particular device or deliver and install power cells in certain systems and so on In the facility we encounter sleepers who seem to be some kind of humanoid mutants/aliens/weirdo-morphs There are multiple kinds but all of them seem to be sensitive to movement sound and to some extent light Each prisoner is equipped with a melee weapon two guns and a tool The default tool is an auto-turret There are dozens of melee weapons and guns to choose from and few kinds of auto-turrets as well also some kind of life-form detector tool to see the sleepers through walls/doors The melee weapons are important as they don't require ammo The teams that start shooting sleepers from the get-go when they could finish them off by sneaking up with insta-kill sledgehammers they usually run out of ammo during a following encounter at the alarm-door or when someone accidentally pulls an entire room worth of sleepers Then they die You have guns and they are to be used of course Some situations are impossible to solve with a hammer and it's better to set up turrets to form a killbox on a chokepoint and lure the sleepers there Then again some doors are wired to trigger an alarm when opened This attracts a horde of sleepers that basically swarm you until you disable the alarm Disabling the alarm requires you to stand in the scanning circle There could be few stages where scanning circles appear in different locations near the door some of these locations will be outside the cone of fire of your turrets You will need ammo to survive the required 10 or 15 seconds in that scanning circle when the sleepers are running at you by the dozens Navigating around the map requires you to read what is written on the door number of zone the door leads to and often numbers of zones reachable further on through that zone so you can move towards the zone where your objective is Consecutive number zones seem to be next to each other so if you're in zone 39 and you need to go to zone 42 you probably need to go through zones 40 and 41 Quite often you will also be required to work with the terminal The terminal can basically list all the the loot and mission-related items on the map with LIST A you can find out details about an item with QUERY ITEM_NAME or you can ping an item which apparently makes somehow visible to your teammates you can't see it when working with the terminal by PING ITEM_NAME T if you're in the same ZONE as the item in question Even if you're bad at shooting and tactical planning but you might be at-home in reading objectives and long lists of letters-and-numbers you might actually be that one member of the squad that unblocks everyone else by locating the items required to progress with the terminal This would be probably more awesome to play with your friends but there is a matchmaking system and an in-game voice chat is by default under ALT In general all of the above makes for quite rewarding coop experience if you have people in your squad that actually care about cooperating and know wtf is going on One trigger-happy overstimulated individual that is pushing all the buttons they see and shooting all the sleepers is enough to wipe your party as they will always pull too much aggro to comfortably handle and will make you expend all your ammo trying to survive and then die anyway Then that individual leaves the party During my first session during the free weekend I played for 7 hours Did maybe a dozen matches all wiped sooner or later Then at some point I got matched to a squad with two reasonable dudes With the level of coordination that is usually seen in the hardcore mmo raiding groups with many close calls and near-wipes we've managed to actually complete a scenario At the time of writing that is a 0.9 have it kind of achievement Let that sink in
i want it to buy this eerier but i dint and i regress not boobing it
The game has can very challenging and it requires a team to work together GTFO is designed with a four player team in mind so its best to bring some friends or pray for some good randoms with mics or who communicate My first few hours were honestly pretty brutal and meet with several failed attempts I managed to get a very well coordinated team with a mix of mines bio scanner and sentry guns who managed to make successfully through a level Con My biggest complaint has to be the length of the missions Its not a game you can pick up and play for a casual 20 minutes I'd expect 1-2 hours for a successful match The one victory I've had so far took 1 hour 30 mins If you like an intense tactical shooter this could fill your niche
It's just a mix of bad shooting bad stealth and it repeats forever Keep doing the same thing but in a different colored room Never feels satisfying to play The developers hate freedom and fun Walking in the dark all the time is as exciting as taking an eye exam GTFO my hard drive
Tried this during free-to-play weekend You have to have mic to coordinate with teammates You have to have real players to for a chance to clear a stage PuG sometimes works But at the end of the day I want a game I could play with randoms like without need for constant communication and instinctively know what to do next I'd rather play Ground Branch and Ready Or Not instead of this I expected this game to be more like Warhammer Vermintide
shit gay ahh
GTFO Downloaded played for 30 mins with my mates and we GTFO Main menu is obnoxiously loud UI is obnoxiously confusing Matchmaking is obnoxiously obnoxious One of our teammates could not make use of the Interact function due to a known bug Very generic game
I hate my life but after playing this game for a while I hate my life even more
bruh stopgame
Update Met a veteran player that has more than 500 hours This veteran was very nice and guide me through the game Apparently the recommended way to find a team is through discord and not matchmake Sadly my wooden PC could support discord in the background with the game open Great weekend trial highly recommend you try this out if are looking for a challenge Gonna check out the game on Christmas to see if there is gonna be a bigger promo Original Great FPS horror themed game though i'm only trying it for the weekends i would still recommend this game Highly recommend new players to DO THE DAMN TUTORIAL AND NOT GO JOHN RAMBO CAUSE THAT IS SUICIDE The game is just missing some features like 1 Booting or vote kicking players 2 Allowing players to join lobby without having to matchmake every time 3 Weapon spec for your loadout 4 Have servers instead of P2P hosting 5 Check your ping when you join a game with a ton of delay cause host has poor connections 6 Maybe an option to select the region Still a ton of improvements needed but still a pretty solid game 8/10 Note to devs would suggest you FORCE NEW PLAYERS TO DO THE TUTORIAL
great game i guess but too fucking hard
GTFO is basically an Ultra Hardcore Left 4 Dead game that is 50 times scarier with 50 times fewer Ammo and totally worth the price on Sale many would even argue it's worth the standard price off sale I got it on free weekend and within just 1 hour I went and just straight up bought this game because it was sooooo good The reliance on Melee gives me some of that Warhammer Vermintide DarkTide vibes but with far more stealth all of these games mentioned are all based on Left 4 Dead it's essentially the same formula but tweaked The install size is tiny as of writing only about 15GB space and as you would guess all maps basically look very similar visually but has different layout off course It's only 15GB so assets are reused on each map nothing wrong with that tho Weapon sounds are freaking incredible the effects everything looks so real and immersive it has a really unique look to the game the music is amazing every step of the way Some moments thanks to the sentry are quite reminiscent of 1986 Aliens scene but it's cooler because it has this really nice looking green laser scan the sentry does there are different types of sentry also burst shotgun sniper etc and there are other options besides a sentry that you can choose from The Discord community is amazing it even has the link right ingame discord groups are quick and popular and you will definitely prefer it over in game MM once you try it This game is crazy scary like games such as Resident Evil has nothing on this as this is on a completely different level Wipes exist similar to an MMO I am NOT a huge fan of this mechanic but it is also what makes this game so good I am also NOT a huge fan of the fog but it is also what makes the game so good as you can choose to carry a thermal scope weapon to counter this every aspect of this game was very carefully thought out This game is an example of human greatness that can only be achieved after billions of years of evolution one day alien life form will visit this planet and will declare this to be the Game of the Universe yes it is that damn good I would give this game a 9/10 in all honesty and I think that would be a fair score With more content added wider variety of weapons and wider variety of more unique looking maps and stuff this will easily be a 10/10
Nobody will read my review so I'll just say I'm gay
pretty gud
better than payday 3
1 5/10
Great game Love the computer hacking mechanic although should be added to unlocking doors so your team is required to defend the party member typing codes into the door instead of randomized checkpoint loading
waste of space Do not play this shit
walk press tab to view map walk press tab to view map walk press tab to view map walk press tab to view map walk press tab to view map walk press tab to view map repeat until you're at objective but i liked that i could draw derpy faces on the map
Not bad not good
this game made my hairline recede and my asshole pucker hard enough to make a diamond 10/10 best co-op game ever

this game is kinda tough you really cant afford to have the funny guy in the squad as part of the crew which is a major downside
Lost my interact button on my first play apparently it's an old bug that they didn't bother fixing for free weekend Flashing nauseating boxes Distracting menu
ho giocato durante il weekend gratis il gioco veramente bello sfrutta tutte le quelle meccaniche che normalmente verrebbero trascurate in un altro gioco per offrire un'esperienza veramente unica in particolare amo il modo in cui viene gestita la luce e come si sia costretti arrancare nel buio se si vuole sperare di non venire individuati

This game is no joke like left 4 dead with the difficulty on some real strong cocaine or something lol But if you can communicate with your teammates effectively then you can progress through the sections and that for sure will be a great feeling as currently i haven't gotten passed a section lol It is really fun though and as a fan of games like this i highly recommend checking it out
PC above spec just straight up doesnt work lol crashes my entire computer instantly when booting into tutorial or any game it feels like a gamble whether or not the game agrees with your computer or not
free
Rock and
garbage
Cool multiplayer dungeon crawler If you have a good group this is hours of fun
like dis game
Juegazo 10/10 pero no puedo comprarlo
Fun game with butt clenching moments and intense atmosphere Playing with friends is more fun but even if you are a lone loser you can still enjoy it
This game is challenging rewarding and requires teamwork I recommend picking it up if your'e into cooperative shooters If you have friends to play with it's a great experience I have enjoyed my time with the game and met some great people while playing it
Crashing like anything 2-3 games it will crash 2 times Else game is very good Need to optimize for the PC base
Nunca pudimos encontrar la puerta 52 igual buen juego
Good and frustrating game Mission succeed after 8 hours in game
Hardest Coop shooter on the market If you want a challenge be prepared to die over and over again
Demasiado complicado y muy aburrido
Es un juego distinto lento lento y mas lento con un RNG de la perra pero si eres idiota como yo y mi amigo te va a gustar porque porque es distinto a todo
ya deje el lol
Tongue boy licked my friend and got disgusted
it get's boring after a few hours because every mission mostly looks similar
Game was janky and laggy maybe if it was 5 dollars it would be good
I honestly loved playing this with my friends 10/10 the graphics the story and the challenge you have to go through is honestly so good Play this game if you want to stratigize scream and start panicing
Game is pretty fuckin hard but pretty fuckin good if you do it right 8/10 Good game with smart friends
Its ok but its very challenging My friends and I just got done getting our heads kicked in and never made it past the first Rundown lol This is clearly a stealth game that forces you to FPS at specific times If ammo was not so scarce we all might have enjoyed it more Would have enjoyed the ability to have more firefights with mobs on our own terms and not be scared to use ammo the whole rundown FPS Games are not fun without ammo same issue with 40k Darktide We are not trying to play Melee Simulator Yeah we all had fun playing together for the time that we played in a 4 man squad but its clear.none of us are buying this Sorry GTFO
No solo no paraba de crashearse sino que no recordaba los cambios en la por lo que me tocaba volverlos a meter cada que entraba y al final me toco reiniciar el computador completo porque se quedo congelado No se quien programo este juego pero que lo manden de regreso a la escuela Desperdicie media hora del escaso tiempo libre que tengo intentando correr esta Fue un desperdicio de tiempo de espacio el disco duro un desperdidio de todo Es que lo tenga gratis y aun me sienta estafado
Meh felt lacking
The gameplay is way too slow The enemies aren't challenging even with their strategic placement The ammo is too scarce and I feel like the sniper turret doesn't work well against bio-marked enemies I'd like to see how the game evolves but won't be buying it anytime soon It definitely has potential
Gracias por dejarlo gratis siempre tuve sobre y ahora estoy seguro que es una la movilidad y las armas no me agradan y la pase muy mal para ser un juego y no la pase mal por miedo ni nada de eso es frustrante las y el entorno No lo recomiendo ni gratis
GTFO wydaje klimat z Aliena z Residenta ale dobre szybciej Interfejs to wszystko lata i Ale to co zabija to crash za crashem z graczami to czekasz a po do serwera wszystkich graczy zawiesza To i jeszcze raz Tym razem na pul;pit No to restarta Steam i jeszcze raz I znowu do pulpitu To nie jest gra to sito Chyba wiem co mieli na akronim GTFO Get The Fuck OUT of here Co niniejszym po 20 minutach I Wam to zalecam Strata czasu Rada Gra ma tylko 14 tys graczy podczas free weekendu Niezbyt jak na fpsa Gracze pewnie szybko Steam Kurator Fidelio de Krytyk

W Egg Fried Rice Ingredients You only need a few ingredients for egg fried rice Day-old rice Eggs Green onions Salt for extra flavor you can add a touch of chicken bouillon or MSG as well
Really want to like this game but matchmaking can be annoying no one uses the proper queue prerequisites use voice English etc Everyone uses Discord for a better experience No one really knows what they're doing nobody plays stealthy Some of this isn't exactly the game's fault but it's my experience with the game Wish I could leave a mixed review but that's Steam for you Overall I'd say not for me but if you got a group of friends try it it out Edit I queued up again till I found people with mics explained all I knew to them and it was a MUCH better experience the two runs we had It's definitely a gem but only if you have the right people It lives by its motto Work Together or Die Together I'm glad I went out of my way to learn more to give it another chance It's currently the cheapest it's ever been I'd say it's worth 20-$25 It's a unique experience Pick it up or GTFO
i didnt get out
my friend shot in the air thinking there were no more aliens and then 10 chargers appeared out of no where and we died but 10/10
Bastante buen juego divertido solo que si no tienes amigos estas jodido
Honestly for the short time me and the boys played it it was wonderful The atmosphere was always tense and the combat was never boring Safe to say I'm gonna buy this now after enjoying it for free
tired the free trial with my friends and we enjoyed it enough to buy it
Bad
not sure for everyone but 1st time 4 of us played over an hour for 1 mission and it`s no completed yet ammo are too scare objective not clear no way point not gonna pay for it
The design and feel of the environment is really cool The cinematic dropping is also cool it gave me edgy matrix vibes However the game play was a little dull Fighting enemies was kinda boring as it was just a rush of creatures but stealth killing them was also boring I'm no game designer so I don't know how they could make the actual game play more enjoyable but the base is good I enjoyed the game for the few hours it was free to play over the weekend
lot of potential if you enjoy extraction games
SI
heat
Has some neat ideas and was fun for an hour or two on its free weekend but generally left us pretty bummed every time we would get trapped with no ammo and no escape Ran into several bugs in that time too some players not able to interact or use their tool until restarting the round getting stuck when AI wouldn't come join the group to unlock a door etc
I don't think I've enjoyed any part of this experience I played it on a free weekend Sneaking around the enemies isn't particularly fun especially when there's multiple together that take turns being alert The melee combat doesn't feel good I can't see anything beyond 30 meters but enemies will shoot their little glow orbs at me from way beyond that When shit goes tits up the shooting isn't particularly entertaining either And to make all of this worse you gotta deal with having very limited resources If you like crawling around and getting kicked in the balls this might be the game for you but it's not for me
fuck yes
GTFO GIT DA FAK OUT I only played for the free weekend
O jogo simplismente muito enjoativo e muito demorado e enrolado compensa
Played this for free with my buddy and tl;dr we were impressed with the game's atmosphere but ultimately felt pretty frustrated with the bots and map design This one is really hard to tackle though because a Co-op horror stealth shooter is a really neat idea that could work wonders if it had more polish there's potential here but sadly it seems that the game is on its last legs Some things that annoyed us were unpredictable enemy behavior and attack pattern unnecessarily long maps some taking two hours to complete bots being bad in general by not shooting sometimes bots shooting enemies when we tried to quietly melee a tougher enemy or bots stealing supplies which is another BIG problem because some rundowns require you to switch supplies around to reposition them to your convenience this could be solved if you could simply drop your supplies on the ground These small things outweigh the pros of this game unfortunately which is why I can't recommend it it just does not respect your time Although the free weekend is appreciated we had a little fun
With the newest additions this game has come a long way I've had it since it first released in Early Access a couple years ago Playing with a full group of 4 people who know how to communicate and work together is essential and also extremely fun Highly recommend
lo gratis y me la pc juegazo
me sin balas el juego
played for 4 hrs now stuck in a loop of Not Having network connection while im talking to people playing the game in discord which is great
P.S
Local population has the worst case of hemorrhoids I have ever seen Need a doctor asap
5 5
I died as fuck until i realize the game actually is stealth
Great game i got addicted after about 5 minutes of black screen i was so into it i forgot to get my son from daycare its been 3 days and my wife is filing for divorce
0/10 would not play
Tem que ser bom
Watch me do sick shit You're gonna fail continues to fail and alert the whole room and loses the run Great game
UMA
Amazing game well worth the price tag Addictive and engaging perfect combo of stealth and full on combat No friends No worries amazing and friendly discord community Highly reccomend
2-3
Nice game but laggy server pls fix asap
Very funny game
The actual game is fine The gun play is fine The graphics are good enough The game-play loop is entertaining for the first bit That's all the positives I had to say This game is not bad per se but it is full of so many small gripes that I legitimately think they all add up to make this game completely overshadowed by doing literally anything else with my time I'll just list my gripes with no particular order The graphics are over-rendered with so many effects fog lighting artifacts and motion sickness movements that instead of looking really pretty and impressive it just feels like a headache in a box with such little visibility I actually felt like I'd have better vision with a normal fps without all these annoying dark moody lighting systems on a 144p video The menus require click-and-hold on everything EVERYTHING From changing settings selecting missions quitting the game inviting friends it seems like everything in this game is just meant to feel clunky and annoying The enemies are not very varied I mean there is plenty of enemy variety but all of them are the same thing essentially Fleshy person you shoot at and kill as fast as a L4D zombie The special infected type monsters completely blend in with the rest of the enemies both literally and figuratively The game is incredibly simple in its complexity while entirely being so lacking in info to the players that you can't easily just do what you need to do Our first game had us running in circles completely not having fun and when we did figure out what to do we just kinda though Oh That's it This game is one of those games that builds itself up to be very skilled complex and strategic but in actual gameplay it's nothing like that You just walk into area shoot and move on The only thing that's hard about it is that you have as much health as a tissue box and resources are scarce The health system sucks You don't really have a lot which doesn't work in this game full of hits you couldn't avoid from how hard it is to see due to the way it's rendered as well as weird instances of friendly fire and other quirks that make you lose your health pretty unavoidably The medkits are rare and don't even heal you fully With how easily you lose health there's basically no reason to heal It's such a rare resource that you lose so easily it's practically worthless Made doubly true by the fact that once you're less than 20 health you just auto-regen health So We spent 90 of our game just at 20 and regen health which is not fun to do but also there's really no alternative I really wanted to like this game The Free Weekend I got to try it on was exciting at first but we were with no exaggeration so bored out of our minds that we just all quit the game early before even playing longer than an hour Does that make my review unfair since I haven't really experienced much of the game Most definitely Does the fact that this game I was interested in before is so boring that I didn't even care to play it long enough to form a fair opinion show pretty clearly how lack luster clunky the game is Most definitely
dope
very gud
Great spooky thrilling skillful game Great with friends

Online focused stealth Games are the dumbest idea possible Especially when one failed stealthkill is the difference between an easy win and complete team wipe The Netcode is awful aswell and as a bonus it's fkn boring for most of the time Also whoever had the idea of having the enemies attack with weird insta damage tentacle shit F U M8
de la perra me casi 5 horas en pasar solamente el primer nivel
It's a pretty good game
Finally At long last a game on the horizon that is more challenging After beating Dark Souls Pong and tic-tac-toe on the highest difficulties all amazing games with extremely deep lore I have been depressed since I couldn't find a game challenging enough to satisfy my turbo-autism I am certain I shall beat this legend as well Comments are disabled for this review

2 1 4 10 2 5 9 10 2 8 245 4
Gun game play feels unnatural there's a slight delay to bullets and I can't stand it The layouts are confusing and it's easy to get lost Try it for free weekend and see what you think i'm not for it Over hyped in my opinion
amazing game worth every penny
You play a lowlife spooked prisoner sent to do a dangerous job in an industrial hellscape Amazing dreadful atmosphere gripping UI design smooth performance nice sound plenty of amazing guns But after 4 missions it feels like we experienced 90 of the game It gets stale very quickly as the enemies and gameplay don't vary enough The enemies are sleeping/blind you can approach them freely as they sleep but look out for the light then you have to stop moving stab them in the head clear the room if you get spotted during the light they alert all enemies in their proximity varying from 3 to 10 enemies not that hard to deal with Some doors force you into a short combat encounter so you actually have to use your guns and turrets while walking from a glowing cylinder to a glowing cylinder thats how you unlock the doors The finisher for me was playing the reactivate reactor mission open 4 doors in a straight line with barely an challenge yawn put down the turrets down on a SINGLE CORRIDOR stand back and blast for 15 minutes innovative gameplay After that yawning experience Im rewarded with an apparel style that ads a red stripe to my clothes yawn Most of the games from bigger studios during these times are so bad that not having microtransactions grindy mechanics you own everything from the very beginning unoptimized visuals put this game into a very positive state but the gameplay itself is mediocre at best tedious at its worst I may give this game a positive review if I really wanted to persuade my friends to play this with me and i didn't want to look like a sucker for spending 30E on a horde shooter with 4 enemy types that all look like a raw chicken that ate a flashlight TLDR fun for the first couple hours with its Intriguing atmosphere of being a prisoner sent to industrial hell and plenty of cool guns to switch around then it turns into a reptetive tedious yawning simulator
goooooooooooooooooood
Felt like a really bad half life mod that tried really hard to reinvent the FPS genre UI is horrible and things that should be fast simple and convenient are tedious and annoying
i even edge to GTFO I exploded immediately Clean up on aisle MY PANTS
Es war sehr schwer es gab Checkpoints es ist ein sehr guter Shooter es gibt gar keine Munition es ist ein Nahkampf mittelalter spiel mit Zombies die lv 10 Gyat haben und sehr dumm sind Also wenn ihr ein shooter wollt ohne shooter,horror und hardcore dann holt euch dieses ERBARMUNGSLOSE Spiel
32 minutes de jeu ca inclus le tutoriel la dessus quoi 6 minutes pour le tuto et 26 minutes a attendre 2 gars Online qui ne se son jamais mis beau match making nous ne voulions jouer ensemble mon ami et moi mais on doit avoir 2 personne en plus qui n'ont jamais rien fait pendent tout le temps qu'il nous fesait perdre
how do only 1.1 of players have the tutorial achievement of this game 2 years after release game is fun idk about the pricing but it surely is worth playing Edit after reading reviews and playing some more I can see why some find the core game play repetitive and i can imagine that the game can lose its appeal after some hours depending on the player however the vibes of the game are perfect to pull an allnighter with friends and/or strangers being scared of these mutants in ur dark room it was perfect non of us me my buddy and a Brazilian duo of players knew what to do so we learned along the way which made the game even more fun the atmosphere and everything was perfect and felt great even if presumably these strong emotions and wow effect only last a few hours this free weekend gave me an amazing experience and even if you pay to get the game I can only recommend it even if you only have the experience for the first 4-20 hours or how ever long based on ur character you will enjoy that time greatly
This game is really fucking good but you better have at least 2 friends if not just use the discord
DUDE HAHAHA THIS GAME IS SO BAD NO WAY ANYBODY LIKES THIS GOT INTO THE GAME BLURRY UI AND POOR LIGHTING OVERCOMPLICATED MENU COMMANDS AND OBJECTIVES ALMOST NO PLAYER DIRECTION AND NO TIPS i would much rather play chess for a month straight than play this trashy game no way this has that many reviews y'all are tweakin
What even is this game such a weird game The HUD and menus make this unplayable too
One of the best looking games of all times I die just looking at the lighting in this game Music i die in this game just taking in the music of this game Sound mix i die in this game just to the sound mix But how it makes me smile Hey this game is not for but wow how it makes me die with a smile Even after an hour in one map failing Game is amazing Hey hallo have Q3 headset so have not tried the vr mod yet this will be my death
tutorial was garbage so i quit and uninstalled
Only buy this if you have 3 friends to play with or don't mind searching for 3 other players This game needs a 2 player mode with adjusted difficulty until then 2 player difficulty is extremely high
It Ok
the only hardcore game I tolerate and I love it when I don't have to set my resolution to 420p just to run the damn thing think I beat the last main mission of one of the mid-late rundowns like that my sound broke by the end too don't ask how I managed I didn't
stay low

press and hold for every menu option ffs what is going on in your mind extrem poor made console port or made by console players i do not know when you play you do not have ammo why to rush a base with 1000 enemies and only go in there with 20 ammo this is crazy do not buy this scam no fun
Holy fucking shit I wasn't ready for the kinda of shit I would be getting myself into

If I wanted a shit UI and constant loss of time I would just go outside and live
just buy darktide
very fun in vr don't buy if you dont have a team of 4 the bots suck
this game is spectacular

Vine a cagarme en los pantalones y me acabe cagando en la virgen
Este juego no me corre me anda literalmente todo menos este juego se crashea en el menu aveces cuando trato de juguar el tutorial se crashea apenas entrando no se que sucede no es mi pc porque tengo una buena torre con buenos componentes no se si esta mal optimizado no se que pasa con este juego
doesn't come with friends
To mechanik tej gry jest trudna a sama gra jest i nudna
If you like being able to play your game this is not for you This shit is impossible Fun but impossible
Glad I played for free and didn't spend any money on this Haha It has potential but they severely limited their audience by making it difficult I think if they had an option to change difficulty increase checkpoints more ammo etc a lot more people would play it Even if you take it slow and complete a round its like what's the point The rewards aren't work the effort
if you have friends who are not pussies and can execute the plan somewhat perfectly play this if else dont
If your brain actually has more than 2 cells it can be super fun Can be successfully played with no mics and random squads which is pretty nice Yes you will die if you try to play it like Call of Duty Good Don't listen to some TikTok brain kiddies this game is good
the negative reviewers for this game don't seem to understand what this game is lmao
soooooo difficult
pfff algo tan simple como recargar las balas es rarisimo
bizarramento tenso
the general public that youll play with is completely braindead but if you play with bots its actually great so funny all the negative reviews complaining that a game with hardcore in the description is too hard get good noobs
h3]Not your typical shooter.[/h3 More like an FPS Stealth Dungeon Crawler with aspects of DOS/Terminal systems Quite fun in a company of friends but can be quite challenging and judgemental if you screw up once it can go quite smoothly but then you screw up your disguise and see your whole team getting wiped out by monsters The only cons game seems to be going way too basic gameplay doesn't really change maps are practically the same in the end you're just doing same things over and over again but for a few hour gameplay ain't bad h3]In overall[/h3][list Stealth Hacking Shooting Gear collecting and dungeon looting Gear management turrets health flashlights etc can't carry everything list
Muuuuuuuuuuuuito chato e enjoativo
Free Weekend I LOVE this game too bad my money short The game was rlly long on my wishlist and i did receive what i was guessing even more gameplaywise and lore wise i really recommend if you are in combat/stealth/horror game
Awful controls
Awesome game incredibly unforgiving and easily the hardest game I've encountered that is still fun plenty of mods to add or take away pretty much whatever you want but nothing beats the vanilla levels Despite the crazy bullsh*t this game throws your way the hardest part remains getting your friends to play
After getting fired from the deep rock galactic mining company i took a job for The Company It was quite too lethal so they threw me in this weird stasis pod as punishment and now i fight strange monsters Almost makes me miss the Company but at least as a prisoner i get weapons so thats a bonus
Boring even the tutorial was boring and hard to understand not very new user friendly
tried it during free trial weekend but I only managed to play 2 games as after that everytime I was dropping to the zone the game kept crashing for some unkown reason Seems the speed at which the elevator goes down causes a crash but idk thats just my guess Couldnt play a single game after and even verified data Honesty the game not scary at all from what little I played so I wont bother to try to fix it anymore I would play it free or for under 10 30 for this seems a bit much
tem como esse jogo ser pior a interface poooooooooooooooDREEEE e o jogo condiz totalmente com ela pooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooodreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Good with friends 3
Way too hard Questionable gameplay choice DO NOT BUY
Sorry but not my boring wandering back and forth but thx for free week
I could be standing still crouched lights off and staring forward and the enemies would still get angry at me The AI companions will jaunt around randomly and alert people too Going loud isn't an option for how punishing the combat is at times Playing with any less than a full lobby feels like a punishment I thought the game would be fun after watching others play it but when it was my turn it just felt punishing in every aspect Maybe others would enjoy it but my friends did not
FUCKING SHIT SHIITY BOOTY HOLE BLOOD SHOOTING ASS TRASH UNFAIR GAME THAT enemies take a good 5 blasts with a CLOSE RANGED SHOTGUN to the CRANIAL REGION to die even then sometimes they're still alive game spawns u with little to no ammo you never find any missions are 4 hours long every single enemy in the game can spit that deals 18 health on the FIRST MISSION the bots just stand there get them selves killed shitty game i wouldn't accept this if my life depended on it
You can't vote kick inactive players without a mod I didn't need to go any further than the first game to know this game is rotten Literally the first game I tried to play had an inactive player and we're sitting there with our thumbs up our asses for 10 minutes cause Dad left to go buy a pack of smokes and never came back GTFO indeed
I liked the game and I love Dungeon-run type games like this But the terminals are too difficult to understand for newcomers and the common zombie enemies having homing ranged attacks are too unforgiving The game is a good game so I will recommend it but do not recommend it for people who don't have a lot of time to learn and play the game
nice
is like a 10 year old game nothing new install play tutorial and unistall
boring generic extractiom shooter with nothing to do
Game design sucks circles to unlock door is just next level shit

Not for me Its hard and thats okej but the lack off checkpoints and the lack off resorces makes you replay the maps alot and you have to take it slow becuse you dont have ammo so its just not fun to replay the maps over and over

playing in a coordinated stack this is one of the best co-op experiences around Play with stealth and know that you are just a squishy little ant in a hornets nest and its just so fun
This game is pretty infuriating you play for forever and in the end despite all efforts you die The graphics are pretty sick but all in all I personally don't think it's worth the money
Que cosa mas dificil por dios
meh game Has great visual and an interesting idea but it feels off Terrible UI and match making system Also you can get stuck behind objects

GTFO a game for players that value a challenge The only challenge is hoping the game doesn't bug out and get you stuck in a 2FPS checkpoint loading bug to the point where it crashes soon after That's the challenge
Snorefest simulator
A co-op game that I can't team up with friends on Thanks for wasting my time
Play this game if you have keen interest in not having fun I had more fun cleaning the faeces from my pants when iIaccidentally did doodoo in my pants
It was an interesting game of it's own When you get used to it and you know what to do without wasting time doubting you can play and clear it with not THAT many difficulties however if it is interesting will depend on a personal taste But in the beginning it can be VERY confusing especially the terminal and in any mission it will lower the fun when you don't know what to do and enemies keep swarming even the easy mission isn't very gentle at introducing you to the game I played it with my buds during the free trial but I wasn't very impressed it felt a bit repetitive as a lot of such games do we had difficulties with tools as some tools were absolutely useless for our missions however we kept receiving them as a majority while missing the actual tools we needed I do admit that the missions themselves were interesting and in general the idea and concept of the game is interesting Overall I don't have strong positive or negative emotions me and my buds reached a consensus that we would play max of 3-4 games before never touching it again so we are glad we tried it for free But I can definitely see how this game would be interesting for others maybe better at such games than I am

Game is well optimized and quite fun but you need friends to play it lmao solo experience is a bit painful as you need real players with YOU cuz bots wont do much dont get me wrong a bot in your squad is a bit helpful as it rushes to help you when you get downed but you cant rely on them during the whole expedition so i hope they add modes for solo players OVERALL a good game if you have friends that own the game or friends in general lol
4 0
Gun play felt clunky UI in the menu is hard to read and moves around enemies have weird hitboxes
My god what a piece of garbage I'm so glad for this free weekend Better to spend my money elsewhere
anyone who says this game is badly designed is just saying that because this game is very difficult almost all of the mechanics in this game are incredibly designed and playing with friends is always a blast in this game but if you're lonely you can summon bots who are really well designed and can be a massive help it should be noted though when they say this game is difficult they mean difficult I recall hearing that there was a 17 win rate per attempt 1/6 and even the tutorial has a 50 win rate that said if you're looking for a challenge to play with friends most co-op games are not very difficult this game is great

The game kept crashing over and over making i unplayable
I don't have epilepsy yet this game's UI is doing its best to assassinate me

this is for badass hardcore co-operative horror shooter gamers tried at free weekend hardcore but fun cleared the Main Sector
h1]Lobby connection lost simulator[/h1 Spent almost 2h on attempting to actually start the game and even succeeded once Network code here is extremely poor For a co-op game this is an essential part therefore game not worth even a quarter of stated price
Too low on ammo raw game redo it and make it playable
Awful game repetitive and not fun at all Brainless chasing of objectives go to x spot and loot this thing Kills don't feel rewarding and a godawful amount of ammunition Don't buy it
not worth the price if you buy it

This game has come a very long way since I started playing it during restricted/alpha access nearly four years ago Checkpoints bots tutorial and many other general changes have made this game that is digestable for the average gamer It's no longer a super-niche hardcore game only for the most maniacal gamers I absolutely love this game and the care that the developers have demonstrated by continually updating and improving the game is testament to what this game has to offer the gaming community GTFO is a must-play title for anyone that wants to experience what a truly next-gen game experience should be
GTFO ilgi bir hikaye vaadiyle dikkatimi ve hafta sonu deneme oldu Ne ki oyun oynarken kendimi zaman zaman hissettim Oyunun bozan ve seyrek canavarlarla dolu bir harita botlar ve ilkel bir sistemi var Canavarlar ise basit ve tek bir sahip Bu eksiklik ve edilmeye gibi Silahlar ise ortalama ancak his pek tatmin edici Genel olarak GTFO'un vaat potansiyeli tam yerine
gtfo is me to the game when i played it hahaha as in gtfo of my steam library hahahaha
pretty cool game I like slicing and dicing the sleepers with my knife and voice chatting SIR GET DOWN SIR GET DOWN
I wish I hadn't discovered this game so late What an amazing experience I hope they add single player offline with difficulty scaling before the servers go down in 10 years
Top e hardcore
Match making with randoms works fine This is a game that requires organised team even on most easy difficulty via friends/discord LFG So it is not a game where you can dive in casually end of the day to relax Simply put can't play with randoms due to nature of this game requiring coordinated team work and weapon balance loadout between players Very limited ammo so completely stealth focus crouching walking alot Stop when aliens glow move when the glow is off etc Coordinated team melee on multiple targets It is very very slow paced You won't be blasting away alot mostly tap fire conserving ammo and setting up tower defense style turrets to support horde situations Good thing is there is no progression Straight from Day 1 you have access to all weapons/equipment completely skill based gameplay no builds or perks etc I can play organised with friends/discord if I want to But most of the time I want to just jump in and out with randoms and game doesn't accommodate this even on most easy difficulty But sneaking around for an hr gets boring
Lindo juego lo me gusto pero no tengo amigos para jugarlo que solo por eso lo F

bon jeu il faut comprendre la et les mission une compris c'est que du bonheur
Game doesn't even seem fun Empty environments UI looks far too complicated for what you are tasked to do Most enemies act alike no ammo constant low health seems like there is 0 progression Each rundown is pretty much the exact same enter loot the same lockers and boxes grabbing the same items over and over opening doors that have alarms fighting the same enemies with no ammo placing turrets in hope they do most of the work game is super vague in terms of explaining everything I'd rather just go and take a nap
I shouldn't have to spend more time trying to figure out why the game is crashing at launch than actually playing the game happy I tried it for free and didn't pay extremely disappointed
doesnt just hit the same
chwile na darmowym weekendzie ale Gra ma strasznie nieprzyjemny model menu wszystko sie rusza i trzeba jak wszystko Tak samo in game hud jest ogromny i wszystko sie rusza to w ustawieniach cokolwiek in game walka jest w klimat jednak samo z UI hudem i strasznie niejasne polecenia w misji toporne terminali zdecydowanie nie do dalszej gry to nie przeszkadza to zdecydowanie polecam niestety nie dla mnie

Terrible menu where UI elements are swimming away from you when you hover your mouse over them Terrible HUD where words and numbers are doubled and mirrored as if you are on an old and broken PC Poor shooting mechanics Not fun to shoot Big TTK Bad Netcode Slow gun handling though enemies are fast-moving Very dark maps You will break your eyes playing them Even the brightest flashlight you can pick up is still not good enough Furthermore the flashlights of your teammates are hindering your view During sprint the flashlight shines in the lower-right corner of the screen and not in the middle of the screen Boring gameplay Crouching across dark corridor-caves opening and closing gates WOW strike exciting strike

It buggs a lot and matchmaking sucks If it works correctly it can be really fun Wouldn't recommend at full price 3/5 rating
very boring and too much going on in the HUD

Es ist wirklich Sackschwer und ich bekomm Panik mich nicht frei zu bewegen Die Steuerung und Technik ist recht hakelig sowohl Keyboard als auch Controller Wie sind Nonstop auf dem leichtesten Schwierigkeitsgrad an der Masse gescheitert da bin ich zu Low Andere werden es feiern dem gebe ich auch Recht nur ich brauch Klassen wie bei Killing Floor 2 und 3 Wenn es so abgespaced ist wie Destiny oder Warframe bin ich eh raus Ich brauch Welten da reicht mir auch Sons of Forest Danke Gratis Wochenende aber ich bin da raus Da bleib ich lieber Days Gone treu PS Angst und Panik hatte ich im Tutorial also alles auf Solo zu spielen no Way

Dead multiplayer game Playing with bots is not fun
Nvidia 3060
Its design is hauntingly beautiful immersing players in chilling environments that keep you on edge throughout The game demands strategic planning and precise execution The blend of stealth resource management and intense combat scenarios creates an adrenaline-fueled experience that's both challenging and immensely satisfying I would recommend this game for everyone

It's very tedium and annoying the tactical aspect is cool and all but the actual combat feels unfair the environment is actual fog town where you can't see things not fun to play go play SWAT if you want tactical stuff instead

The game is very confusing there's a lot of story information for a multiplayer game that just muddies the understanding of objectives and how to accomplish them The hud is filled with sprites words and GFX very over saturated No one used any in-game communication And many times important mission pieces are picked up unknowingly so there have been multiple times I just leave after 15 minutes of not completing the first objective
and ball torture From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia at en.wikipedia.org and ball torture CBT is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals This may involve directly painful activities such as genital piercing wax play genital spanking squeezing ball-busting genital flogging urethral play tickle torture erotic electrostimulation or even kicking
It is fucking boring
another trash/crash game made on worst engine ever
All the screenshots shows that they are aiming or firing But the game is mostly melee And you have to switch your weapon to a melee weapon not even a weapon bash
w darmowy weekend Nie ani razu ekipy bez discorda do znajdowania ludzi nie ma sensu No dla mnie nie ma sensu

Ik heb het geluk gehad om het spel gratis uit te kunnen proberen Het is geen aan rader De game zit niet echt logische in elkaar
I've played this game twice now with friends Its clear the development team is very skilled but I find this game incredibly boring You have long drawn out puzzles/quests where you're walking back and forth across a big map When you open a door there's enemies who've fallen asleep before you have they're just there to slow you down even more and drain your magazine Sometimes the visibility is bad so you have to press F to see something whats the point You've finally opened a door after 10 minutes now you can fight a horde of bottlenecked zombies for 10 seconds using automated turrets This is meant to be the peak of your excitement yet I've not taken a single hit in my first hour of playing Even if someone goes down you can revive them to get a free 20 hp back We ended up charging zombies with hammers and reviving each other so we didn't have to scavenge for loot This game is 2 shooting 98 walking I can only recommend it to DayZ players
You won't find a better co-op horror experience then this

It's the ugly mix of the last of us and the extinction mode of COD Ghost The fog element is so poorly designed that it is no longer a scenic element but a real nuisance it doesn't allow you to see absolutely anything and to overcome any level it becomes more of an exercise in memory of the map rather than the ability of a player in shooting Truly obscene

I wanted to test this game out on the free Weekend because i wasnt sure should i buy it Even that i had a lot of fun with this game there is one particular reason why i dont give it a thumbs up and dont buy it It has nothing to do with people who dont know how to play or whatever i could say i dont bother a lot for this i enjoyed it so far What bothers me Is the matchmaking i never experienced something more bad then this I played a lot of horde shooters or cooperative shooters that had one easy thing together what i think makes sense and helps bringing new players to the game I CANT SEARCH PEOPLE FOR A SPECIFIC RUNDOWN I wanted to play Rundown 1 all 6 but i cant find anyone who i can play with because when i host it no one joins and when i push the button in my hosted game to search for players it gets me into another random Rundown that im not interested in Then when i try it with bots specific that one where i need to start a Generator its almost impossible because the bots use up all supplies on the get go when you drop under a certain percentage Then you dont have enough supplies for a lengthy encounter like in this mission Or the Bots doesnt recognize a Scanning area where you need to stand in to progress you can deactivate them that you can stand alone on the area to activate it but in this process they loose all the supplies they picked up and you need to get new supplies But you can say there is a Discord server of the game search there for Players and there is a Button in the game to join it When a game goes this way that i can only search for specific rundowns over a Discord server then theres something not right and destroys in my eyes the purpose of a Host game and a Player search button in it And Rundown 1 is in my eyes the best way to learn the game the maps arent that huge and easy to understand But with this system you get thrown into way bigger Maps where you need to navigate more it gets more complex and more confusing for new players Let me pick what Rundown i want to play in the search system lot of games did it before and it works very well is it that hard I worked through all the mechanics of the game by myself the most and can play it pretty decent but that matchmaking system makes absolutely no sense to me and makes it way to hard and almost impossible to play specific rundowns and so it gets frustrating when you want to go for the unlocks behind it And when a Player search Button needs an explanation because it does something i dont want it to do not good a UI should be like a good joke when you need to explain it is bad
the voices are so loud and they're telling me to query zone 52 ID cards again
THE FOG MISSIONS SUCK BUNS
Weird but not good choices UI is a weird but not a good gameplay is weird but not great Why can't i just restart and have to go to lobby every time i fail(yes i know checkpoints exist but when you just start the game having to go to lobby 10 times bc you only have 1 friend to play together with and don't wanna play with bots makes it hard to go to first checkpoint why cant i ping anywhere i want etc Game is hard yes but not in a fun way its just painfull and makes you question why are you playing this game It has technical problems too Its not going to get any updates anymore and it doesn't have offical modding(a little search and it shows developers don't want you to mod it will result on this game dying fast and did Overall play this only if you have 3 other friends(bots suck ass want to destroy your day and waste your time

Rubbish Game Positives game was very stable didn't have drops or crashes The drop into the level is spooky as and sets a clear tone that the game is going to be spooky Negatives The menu interaction require alot of click and hold to adjust settings then click and hold on the save strange thing to be annoyed about till you try it It appears that all the weapons in the game are given to you at the start could be wrong didn't play very much felt like nothing to unlock I only saw one map it seemed to be some kind of mine This was built by humans I will assume but there bearly any lights anywhere There are also rooms that have 2 or 3 doors that all loop back on the same room with no map easily available we spent a large portion of going in circles As soon as we started encountering enemy's all of the spooky feelings of the game disappeared When I saw a humanoid mutant with a venus fly trap head naruto run past me then a bigger version of this All I could think of was attack on titan We cleared all the rooms as we went left no doors unopened we then went to open a door with a key card All 4 of us and to stand next to the door this triggered a wave where were they coming from Why did all 4 of us have to stand there then slowly push out and stand in specific spots for the door to open The weapons we tried felt clunky the giant hit boxes were over the top especially when you kill something and get an extra large hit box There isn't enough ammo forcing you play a stealthy slow moving melee-athon Final thought really disappointing game a friend was really looking forward to this there was a few times we almost paid for it We would of been refunding it I'm glad they made it free I don't understand why it has such a high rating on steam If your into a very slow moving stealth melee with a little bit of gun play and wave defence then this might be up your alley
High quality visually stunning terrifying like no other Not very new player friendly you'll need people to play it with and a mic is required It does what it sets out to do and does it extremely well

Accessed on Free Weekend This game definitely aint for me I'll explain later but dude I had a blast while it lasts You will F*CKIN DIE Not just die but F*CKIN DIE with capslock and emphasized This feels like Space Beast Terror Fright if it was made with a higher budget On to the game The game itself feels pretty similar to Deep Rock Galactic without mining Explore get the objective extract The game only has random spawn/loot/objective generation while the maps are manually designed by the dev and I think it's cycled periodically The difficulty is about.idk Deep Rock Galactic's Elite Deep Dives Your guns would feel like peashooter while melee mostly does one-hit-kill with the downside of it being slower So it's preferable to do missions being sneaky One loud bang can fck you up real bad The aesthetic goddamn I love it It's like Barotrauma and Dead Space made an unholy child Progression is more about self satisfaction than anything Everything is unlocked from the get-go The only half determining factor for harder runs are gadgets some sort of booster Now on to the things that turned me off 1 Clarity Issue goddamn dude I spent 15 minutes in a room to take a sample from a FCKING BARREL with a small text written on it Idk what did I expect by Take a sample from xxx but surely not a barrel The next one is item boxes Maybe it's intentionally not telegraphed but I didn't expect these boxes to be interact-able sometimes 2 Playtime The pacing is so slow due to the risk of death hence the lengthy playtime It's subjective it's just not for me However I'd still recommend it for people who want better R6 Extraction mingled with Ready or Not I'll stick to brainrot zoomer shooter I guess
I get what they're trying to do it's got a really clear vision of what it is But it makes a BAD first impression It's outright hostile to new players in it's structure and mechanics Playing this feels like looking for a black cat in a dark room and you're not even sure it exists I could have gotten into this but I absolutely know my friends wouldn't like it so I can't recommend it to them and without them to play with I wouldn't buy it for myself
Repetitive and boring Graphics from 2014 no skills no char development no progress Just sneaking+sleeping until you put turrets in front of a door But why you should sneak 90 of a level when you automatically trigger alarms at checkpoints/doors and so on ZZzzZZZzzz
I feel At least with my more recent experience with the game that this game hits it's mark really well I can totally understand your viewpoint of the game and I won't deny that the gun play can be seen as lacking a tad but I really don't think this game was going for a shooter style Not that you can't have satisfying gunplay even if you're not always using guns you should always have satisfying gunplay This is a stealth game where if you do everything right theoretically you should only use your guns at alarmed doors and when you and your squad GTFO at the end I adore the atmosphere and the teamwork it's a super tough game and I love every second of it I think the monsters are fine nothing wrong with them I guess they could be more creative but it doesn't take away from the gameplay and there are a few cool classes you encounter during the missions currently and I have no doubt they'll add more I guess what I'm trying to say is that this review paints the game in a very bad light and I'd recommend watching online gameplay and even buying the game and returning it to steam with their below 2 hour return policy to see if it's right for you You need good teamwork Be prepared to talk to each other in every game be patient and don't go in

Had my eye on this for a while now and installed it to play it over the free weekend The game looks fantastic and the atmosphere is unreal but that's where the positive review ends Match making is a bit of a mess when people leave you don't have the option to match make again and only have the option to invite a friend really annoying when people leave all the time Loading into the match sometimes takes several minutes and when you finally think you are getting somewhere you get kicked from the server Out of the several games I've got into I've only had one with no issues If the match making got sorted and the servers were stable this would be one of the greats I am going to recommend this game however as the issues I've had might stem from the free weekend event
Get The Friends Online is a nice co-op experience Unfortunately if you do not have a group to play with you will find it hard to enjoy it as team work is essential
cool
0/10
Fell asleep playing
Less ammo/health/tools for 4 players enemys are too strong the gameplay is not suitable the bots are not intelligent the guns are useless,we need a lot of ammo to kill a monster
Don't buy it if you don't have friends
It's okay I wouldn't buy it though
hange
Good game sadly it doesn't come with friends
Awesome game beautiful too
Game sucks
Matchmaking is terrible main lobby menu is too minimalist tutorial is basiclly the whole gameplay loop but thats all you really do Sneak type in terminals security Twister game doors Discord LFG is basically a requirement for this game and extremely not recommended solo This game is not for you and it sure aint for me
Poor Graphics game play hampering visual effects no character progression that being said if self torture TURNS YOU ON then this is the game for you as they say whatever DING DONG s your SLING SLONG

This game is not an easy game it takes a good team with good coordination to make it past the levels Managing supplies will keep you stressed throughout a level that you haven't played before
Love the idea of this game Everything was perfect for nailing the atmosphere and the uniqueness of the story But for the love of god why is literally SEEING the hardest part of this game I'm just going to kinda list all the things that make this game impossible for me to play Aiming As a guy heavily interested in firearms this makes me cry and puke and cry some more I like how the guns all have holographic sights i can see that being a common thing in the future of guns to just have them integrated already BUT why do they have to be the hardest things to see through I swear its like I am looking through cum covered stained glass that my hot breath fogs up constantly WHAT THE HELL AM I SHOOTING AT Ammo im sure we can all agree that maybe the resources around the map could be a bit more plentiful But its just sad having a shotgun and being dropped in with a handful of shells and my maximum amount is just another handful You're telling me i have to split this one ammo pack that i found already 20 minutes into this mission with a team of 4 I swear the game devs SO BADLY want you to use the sneak mechanic Even with their good abundance of unique guns that are really cool you are severely limited to use them i have only been using the Shelling 549 handgun because its the only gun that you could have a decent amount of ammo for Darkness Even though its the key feature in this game i think its just too much Especially paired with the fog flashlights become actually useless Most the enemies that can hit you from a distance just hide wayyyyyy back in the map in the darkness in the fog sometimes shooting through a part of the wall/furniture and you cant do d!ck about it because looking through your sight just blinds you flashlight doesn't reach and the aim flinch when youre damaged is like your character is getting whacked upside the head with a baseball bat by your angry step dad Also just want to point this out i hated when Rust had this before their combat update but please tell me WHY my character decides to run with the flashlight pointed at the GROUND Edit the glow sticks are actual garbage They last so shortly and are so dim For being set in a futuristic tone why couldn't we get futuristic glowsticks I cant prepare for an upcoming battle by placing glowsticks everywhere with the little amount of brightness it does give off because by the time i start the security sequence ITS ALL GONE Gameplay I am so tired of running around and trying to find what door goes where which zone is this going to which zone the 1 out of 3 keys go to that inevitably will unlock a door that leads to nothing All that while i am expected to crouch walk the entire way to adhere to this games stupid ass sneak mechanic I got so immensely tired of this game at R1B2 because of how bored i was My head hurt from squinting and my back hurt from leaning into my screen just to see anything Edit please for the love of god can you give us an option to turn of the fucking hold down E for everything we interact with its SO annoying What vast gameplay difference does it make for us to wait 3 seconds for everything we touch This is just MY criticism of how I feel I'm not saying this game is bad or not cared for by any means I just can not play this game Don't get me wrong i really want to play this game As much as i hate it i love it and I've only played this game for a few hours I'm sure others have the same problems and others don't But some people also like having things shoved up their ass This game just isn't for me Will i come back if like 2 things i talked about is changed Absolutely But I am not paying 40 bucks for this shit I'm sorry
Tienen potencial pero tratamos de jugar con unos amigos y en 10 minutos nos 2 veces al loby

This game makes me feel like Helen Keller with the amount of people that I can't see

ta medio caro
This game is actually fantastic do definitely have friends to play with though

I can look at my feet in this game
Get The Fuck On the game
Gameplay is deep but the level of coordination and challenge is a bit more than I'm up for
Muy buena experiencia con amigos estresante frustrante y divertido casi 6 horas de juego y apenas vamos en el nivel 3
Rundown 8 L4D Killing floor Rundown 8 Match making
follow the game's title and never play this heaping pile of pewp
Get in silently then GTFO
game SUCKS i go to PAYDAY
You can't win if playing with random guys You definitely need a mic to play It's not easy to understand if you hit an enemy everything looks blurry and you can't just turn it off Difficult for new players to find out where's the zone you need even with map
una re poronga m4tense todos en especial vos ulf sueco m0g0lico
SUCKS theres no reason why i shouldnt be able to toggle more ammo great otherwse devs you suck yeah its stealth but i shouldnt have 25 shotgun shells on start lmao
This game is really cool gammon worst game in existence the funnest part was uninstalling it
I had a great time playing with a friend and the two bots were surprisingly well behaved and we were able to complete missions with them The strategy and pacing makes the game intense and lots of fun All that said communication is key and I would not recommend playing this alone as the game really isn't made for that Great Unity based title too it ran smoothly and looked pretty solid Played this during the free weekend and will be purchasing the game

Debut impressionnant mode geek et hacker a fond va kill dans les moindres recoins sombres de ce labyrinthe
this game is amazing from what i've seen if you like this style then its a game for you
Great four person horror shooter The long and unforgiving runs where you are almost constantly low on resources are absolutely devastating when failed but keeps players coming back for more pain This is by no means an easy game and I highly recommend it If you like more simple objectives and game play that is a bit easier still not that much the A-C sections of each rundown are great As soon as you reach D and beyond sometimes C more mechanics and enemies are thrown at you creating a nightmare of a situation if you and your squad are not prepared
I have a major skill issue and cant beat any level but was fun
Beat-to-beat gameplay is too boring for how randomly difficult it becomes Sneaking and stealth takedowns are not satisfying because sleepers can randomly aggro and then the whole room is active Objectives UI hides when you go into a terminal so you have to pop in and out if you forgot the exact name of the key or objective to ping Has a single dev played the game for 5 minutes This is immediately apparent as a UX issue We finished the objective by finding the subject next objective is to escape but no indication besides music queue after the fact that there would be a horde spawning after us the whole time Got swarmed immediately with no chance to stabilize or get our bearings
NGERI AMAT MAK GAME INI
nah man not good man
I was looking forward to this game but the unnecessary access terminals that have no rhyme or reason to it and the aggravating lack of the ability to see and having to use glow sticks or flashlights which do not readily drop in for use I feel like I am moving around in the dark at the beginning and it is annoying and impossible for me to like this game and continue Uninstalled I am glad it was a free weekend because I do not buy games without a bug-free demo or free tryout I do NOT recommend this game It is NOT fun AT ALL
I loved the vibes I loved the gameplay but it's simply too hard and inaccessible I've played with a full team of friends and after a few hours of playing it even though we were enjoying ourselves and the mechanics were fun we've never managed to finish the first mission The game suffers a lot by not having difficulty options or by at least having an option to start with more resources Unless you're a gamer god with superb team coordination after trying to finish the same mission over and over it just became frustrating A shame really because the mechanics and vibes are great If you're a player with median fps skills or even if you don't have a full 4 player team of friends above median skill I do not recommend the game
I found out a few weeks ago about this game and was curious Sure enough steam had a free weekend First impressions are quite good Graphics music gameplay exc are all done really well The game is very difficult and you need to get into organised groups as you will only die in pubs I enjoy the difficulty of the game Some wont I do enjoy the stealth component to this game Its a very fresh take in the genre with other similar games such as vermintide and left4dead where it is just run and gun
Ist immer das selbe langweilig
Cons 1 The controller support is not that great My main reason for quitting You can't type commands and it doesn't show interface properly 2 The graphics are serviceable Pros I think its a cool idea
1 20 3 alt+f4 I played a couple of games do not pump the garbage do not spoil your nerves the is very toxic You will wait for 1 game to start for 20 minutes and as a result everyone will leave the match and you will merge Match 3 the game froze I just pressed alt+f4 and deleted it DON'T DOWNLOAD IT CAL
Finally a game where every aspect of it feels horrible
Pretty boring Nothing was impressive
So great concept But unless you have friends to play with don't even bother This game absolutely depends on communication and when joining random games I could not find a single person who spoke and the rare time they did it was not in a language i understood Then we have the issue on finding a game Even on a free weekend i could never find anyone to play with Anyways great concept but like i said unless you have atleast three other friends with a mic don't waste your time
is fun
Stealth survival horror game Not much else to it but the amazing visuals paired with the insane difficulty makes it a worthwhile pickup Certain levels definitely have your work cut out for you while others are a little more vague making for a fun challenge whilst evading hordes of critters
Game is good when it works but every time my friends and I tried to play a game one of us dropped or had a game breaking glitch Can't recommend
ehh just dont hit right
o jogo parece massa mas da para jogar no BR se tiver amigos fiquei 30 minutos no lobby e encontrou partida
A great game maps need more checkpoints tho with how long expeditions are Unfortunetly only playable if you got a group because bots are useless
Pretty game with a cool aesthetic but it feels like you can experience everything in 40 minutes Feels repetetive
Incredibly good and unique game teamwork is truly the one and only mechanic that you need this game deserves a 10/10 for me after playing only for 4 hours Beautful game
feels like early access 20 buckaroo title
Downloaded it to test out with friends on the free weekend Pointless tutorial Every time we launched a game to play together one of us or all of us crashed

Glad I got to try it on a free weekend This game may have been released years ago but is definitely not finished b]I love[/b the idea of it the atmosphere terminal stuff I wish one could do more with the Terminal but also have easier methods available for players who dislike it I like having to stop and think for a moment to close doors behind me and reinforce a position b]Not bad[/b yes it's not badly executed It could be worse But it could easily be much better There's a lot of basic stuff missing you would expect Like any form of progression there's many different weapons but what's their purpose any form of specialisation someone bringing a medkit someone else for hacking someone a turret instead everyone has a defensive weapon b]Multiplayer[/b is the core essence of the game yet it is horribly implemented Host leaves the lobby Everyone leaves the lobby now because the migration doesn't happen Right now is a free weekend and it's nigh impossible to find just 1 person to play the game with I have found in total 4 people today and was more successful with bots b]Privacy:[/b The game has a neat option to copy a lobby ID and anyone who has it in their clipboard automatically gets an invite button ingame cool feature huh That also means the game scans your clipboard every time you are in the main menu without notifying you Cool feature b]Animations:[/b This one puts me off the most Most are fine and there's a even a 1st person playermodel But your steps don't connect to the floor Neither do those of the enemies They just glide and slide over the ground Come on this is just so bad haven't seend that since L4D who decided to go to release with that Adjacent issue to that are combat animations Sometimes shooting/hitting enemies doesn't seem to have any impact compare this with games that do it right like L4D2 or Vermintide/Darktide I would consider playing it just for the coop value missions and atmosphere But definitely not spending big money on a half finished product And especially not planning on getting this game just for myself
Couldnt even fing start the game infinty loading screen great game
YES
5 horas y media para completarme el tutorial no que Juegazo 10/10 Ir solo es completamente imposible es requerido tener amigos o con los bots
b Le ponen los logros a la wea cuando ya estoy que chato del juego Son bien como el pico b Es un juego y su dificultad radica en maximizar la eficiencia de cada herramienta que dispones mientras te coordinas con tus utilizando el sigilo como principal Al menos en la Porque en la una vez que dominas el sigilo el juego ya no es Ni tampoco plantea grandes La verdadera dificultad cuando una vez te acostumbras al sigilo te toca una que cambia radicalmente la formula fuera de tu Como jugando a algo para lo que no preparado porque el juego no se que trataba de eso Esa es la verdadera dificultad En toca adaptarse a esa formula Luego volver al sigilo Hasta que toque adaptarse a una nueva formula Luego volver a sigilo Y Hasta donde aguantes Lo recomiendo Es sendo juegazo hasta que se torna cansino entonces ya no lo es tanto Pero hasta ese momento de verdad es sendo juegazo
Intense Unforgiving Fascinating
nice
my favorite part is when they say erm guys we gotta gtfo
Loving the game
Premissa boa mas 1 repetitivo 2 mal otimizado 3 muitos erros em partida online jogue seu dinheiro fora
After giving it a fair chance of 41 hours it feels more of a chore to do the objective in the game rather than being tactical and stealthy which the main focus of the game is supposed to be Level design The game will tell you to go to X and do something there so you go there but you will always stumble upon a door that you are missing a keycard for going to the objective so you have to explore other doors in order to get the keycard In the end you pretty much explore the entire level to scour for supplies so you can survive Half of the levels are filled to the brim with infectious fog that will make you lose health and reduce your max health every second you sit in it the game will offer you fog repellers to deal with it but they are very limited in terms of usage range and runs out very fast so unless you throw them at the right spots you will have to deal with walking blindly in the fog and get next to no health for the remainder of the level If that isn't bad enough there are monsters in the fog your visibility is actually so limited you can't even see 1 meter in front of you until you bump into a wall or an object so unless you have a teammate that is willing to talk 24/7 and have a bio tracker equipped It tells you the location of enemies and has the patience to tell you if you are facing the right direction or not you are screwed More often than not you are screwed anyway because the game always puts clusters of enemies right nearby each other so even if you quietly kill one the nearby ones will automatically aggro so it is up to team effort to take them out all at once before one of them alerts the whole room Going loud moments If a monster hears you making enough noise they will start getting up and alert the room so your only option is to sneak up to them and melee them in the head a lot of times it will go wrong because either people fail to execute killing a cluster of enemies in 4 seconds or the monsters are just so annoying doing the schizophrenia movement that one of them wakes up because every single monster has a separate timer that makes them scan nearby movement and sound every 8 seconds or something for 4 seconds long and it fastens if they hear nearby sound/movement So it is already annoying to try and get close So they get alerted and you start going pew pew because all monsters apart from the basic type one or two are deadly to confront with melee All levels has alarm doors you will have to do at least 6 of them in every level and you have to do them if you want to continue to get to your objective You can be as tactical as you want with setting up turrets at the right positions behind doors or mines but bullets are definitely getting spent It is basically wave defense while trying to secure areas in the room the alarm door is in Not much of a problem other than if you run out of ammo you are basically dead because they just swarm you over otherwise Ammo It is the single most important resource in the game and there ain't a whole lot of it you don't have enough for an alarm door because your teammates shoots like a stormtrooper Did they coincidentally also loot all the ammo bags for themselves and you didn't find any Good luck surviving It is already scarce if you go perfectly stealth so imagine all the other scenarios Because it doesn't matter if you hit every single headshot if your teammates miss that will hurt the whole teams supply
Achei ruim
Sembra interessante ma continua a crashare durante l'avvio del tutorial spero risolvano
Game display in first person view is terrible where they have your ammo stats on no wonder it's free You have to look up top right corner to check your weapon The main menu setting is so bad it just make you quit don't even buy this game Everything is confusing
Left 4 Dead
good game would be better if i had friends to play with
bel gioco
Super ambiance du bon contenu une DA exceptionnel GG pour se super jeu
Overpriced game when you already need to get 3 more people to get it Love the aesthetic nothing else like it on the market sadly but It's just too difficult and repetitive doesn't keep you engaged
the r1c1 is bs played it 3 times and lost due stupid ammo mechanics and 1 sec off from starting the next wave but stopped Also apparently cant progress without doing it so bs
GTFO more like get the fuck out of here with the stuttering on a high end PC
os controles no gamepad ficaram desregulados depois desta ultima e nao esta dando para fazer a personalizacao dos controles
Every level is basically the same
um lixo total
DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO WHIP A PUG INTO VICTORY SOLDIER
This game is supposed to be hard I get it but do the tutorial and controls have to be so convoluted
It's essentially a stealth game where not one but four players can make a wrong move
Can't find a single match without idiots can't chose the mission which I want to go meh boring ass crap
sexy
giving ridiculously few ammo to the player is not the way to make a game harder its just frustrating af lots of lockers full of glowsticks stand in random circles to open door small enemies destroy door on 3 hits come on alien swarm and helldivers can give you ammo and still be hard
Boring ahh game even with friends wouldnt recommend
This game get boring quite fast as the gameplay is pretty much repetitive Well at least the game have lore I couldn't recommend to anyone if you tend to play with other player It just suck you need to join their discord to find player quickly
good game with good execution but gameplay is boring
good game it lacks visibility
Fun
There is no option to queue for a specific level The matchmaking is abysmal Training should be mandatory I don't play a game that mainly relies on discord to find a party
cool game
if u want to suffer i highly recommend amazing game
20 MINUTOS Y AL CARRER
ta weno el juego pero ta dificil chuchatumare
Are you phucking man enough
The visual and audio feedback of this game is terrible If you shoot your gun at some point it's just empty No audio cue that your weapon is getting low on ammo no indicator in the UI just the gray ammo counter in the rest of the gray UI tucked away in the corner of the screen being at 0 Then you try to shoot your gun goes click and an enemy blasts you in the face with some nearly invisible projectile in the almost pitch black room you're in losing you a significant portion of your health The map screen is confusing and doors indicate things that don't make sense and the UI is very poorly placed and has absolutely no contrast between elements Enemies aren't guaranteed to die when you shoot their heads off I can kind of get this for the tougher larger ones but did they really have to do it for the tiny crawling swarmers as well And why are so many of the things you find in crates and lockers flares They light up next to nothing and aren't going to do you any good for finding a route back to a specific place either the map screen is more useful for that despite the confusing room indications I'd much rather have a health pack or ammo pack that I can use to recover a bit from the random hits I take and shots I miss while fighting in the game's mostly pitch-black areas The graphics are good enough though visual design is bad it's simply too dark for this type of game and the performance is good too Overall it is absolutely not worth in its current state maybe at or lower if you're really into this type of game it'd work but even then imo it's simply not fun so regardless of the price I don't think I'd buy it There's potential but the overall design has to improve to make it work especially when your weapons are low empty and some way to light things up somewhat so you have literally any visual indication of enemies coming your way so I wouldn't recommend you buy it
I didn't GTFO
Buon gioco
holy shot
Good luck actually connecting to a game

I was looking for this title for a long time Checked it out during the free weekend I usually like PvE FPS action games Vermintide Darktide KF2 L4D etc but this one just didn't click with me Too few enemy types all of which behave the same just like weapons Confuisng in-mission progression 4 new players confused about the boulder key is it in terminal somewhere in the map Maybe it changes later in the game but I didn't have energy to check other ones
Total und viel zu schwer

The game you want to play forever I love everything about it The only problem is that you can't play it with people that don't enjoy stealthiness
I get 2 grand a month and cant even feed me kids
Doesn't FUCKING work multiple hosts tested could only join an active game Within which most players were unable to interact with any items Absolutely cheated out of the fuckall I spent on this pile of shit
Nein
slow and boring
Tried this game on a FTP weekend Trying to get a full lobby is wayy too hard I like the options you have while queuing but that doesn't make it any less difficult when as soon as you have 4 people at least 2 of them leave instantly The stuttering the game has during it's cutscenes/loading sequencies is very jarring The guns also don't feel powerful I do like the art direction though and how stealth is sometimes an option Unfortunately this isn't enough for me to keep playing it though I would rather play better games in the same genre

The fog makes a good section of the game impossible to see It's not fun to be blind in a horror shooter I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea but they should be fired
GTFO teaser coordination teamwork actual conversations trying to be sneaky Actual gamers so anyway I started blasting
I like running in and going boom boom This game is more forward crouching slowly and going sshhh shhhh
i better GTFO before those monsters fucking get me

My friend who I play CS 2 with said if I post a review on GTFO and it gets 75 likes and 30 Awards that he will buy me a RTX 3070 and 1 Kilo of Lemon So im just gonna leave this here Help a brotha
ALMOST THERE
Boring
Worst UI ever created Also gameplay is meh I'm not sure how this even made it to a very positive score On a free weekend I put 46 minutes in with a buddy and we both quit and uninstalled immediately after
Eclatax UI vomir
HARDCORE GAME
I FUCKING HATE THIS GAME it's so damn difficult for no reason at all but I had some good laughs with my friends so it's cool If you lack patience DON'T PLAY THIS GAME but play it tho it's funny being enraged for a day or two because you can't take a beating
i just got 5 ammo refills and peed my pants

Its Mostly Playable controller support is garbage It's MOSTLY unplayable with controller The mouse is too sluggish and I shouldn't have to go in before I even play the game and correct commands and mouse speed in-game Keyboard commands aren't ideal either The game's tutorial is tedious and boring and inputting commands isn't fun and just makes the game annoying Good this was a free to try weekend and I didn't have to waste money on it to try it out Basically played like 15 minutes then uninstalled The graphics are ok and the monsters were interesting but if you want a new player to be hooked you can't have them guessing at what's what control-wise The puzzles aren't complicated and the sneaking is literally the worst I've ever seen in a video game

Sinceramente lo sto riprovando di nuovo in questo fine settimana gratuito e non riesco a farmelo piacere un titolo unico nel suo genere che non ha mai registrato numeri record i motivi diventano abbastanza evidenti dopo pochi instanti dal suo avvio L'interfaccia atroce poco chiara e con decisamente troppi tasti da cliccare e mantenere cliccati Steam non minimamente integrato e non si possono aggiungere giocatori rapidamente alla lista amici Il matchmaking questo gioco il nemico numero uno dei giocatori singoli Con un afflusso di nuovi giocatori come in questo fine settimana mi aspettavo di non avere problemi a trovare nuovi giocatori Invece no il matchmaking non in grado di abbinare i nuovi giocatori tutti insieme e metterli in missioni di livello basso Mi ritrovo costantemente nei rundown missioni di livello alto con gente che ha appena preso in mano il gioco come me Gli ultimi rundown nemmeno dovrebbero essere sbloccati per un nuovo giocatore La gente dice di usare discord ma discord un programma esterno il gioco deve avere un matchmaking interno funzionante e funzionale Inaccettabile dire di usare discord Dal punto di vista delle ambientazioni di gioco devo dire che mi piace molto Atmosfera assolutamente fantastica peccato che il tutto venga massacrato dal gameplay Soporifero non rende l'idea per non parlare della Vai al punto A scopri dove si trova oggettino X vai a punto B recupera oggettino X torna al punto A Il tutto silenziosamente se no i mostri ti massacrano giustamente gli sviluppatori vogliono che sia un gioco stealth e quindi se ti azzardi a usare una delle armi facendo rumore scoprirai che in hai degli spara popcorn come equipaggiamento Altra grande pecca sono mostri i mutanti o come li si vuole chiamare a me sinceramente non mi dicono nulla Non fanno paura non hanno un'estetica originale sanno di visto Sono solo brutti da vedere Non hanno nemmeno una IA particolarmente memorabile dormicchiano in mezzo alla stanza non ti avvicini troppo o fai rumore a quel punto ti attaccano Non un brutto gioco con quattro amici sicuramente godibile ma pieno di problematiche che non verranno mai risolte e modificate Lo sviluppo terminato stanno infatti lavorando al nuovo titolo non mi sento minimamente di consigliare l'acquisto Io personalmente non lo
UI is soooo terrible you get motion sick before starting a mission and there are just too many better games in that category save your money
Boring feels repetetive People leave lobbies and games out of boredom Confusing as duck unsatisfying combat
The Fuck
I got the fuck out
Meh Looks amazing but gets boring whac a mole all the time Need 4 people Matchmaking Nope use discord Also questionable devs

Das Matchmaking ist gar nicht so einfach wenn man schon Leute braucht die verstehen dass das ein Hardcore Shooter ist Oft hat man auch Leute dabei die kein Mikrofon besitzen sodass diese dann wie Rambo durch das Level gehen und dabei alle anderen runterziehen Das Spiel ist sowieso schon sehr schwierig aber diese Elitegamer machen es dann unschaffbar Schwierige Genre aber eben noch schwieriger unter den

Have been playing since early release alone but due to the fact that it's free this weekend I will finaly enjoy playing with friends I have around 60 hours and every rundown that I have completed I have done it solo with bots nonetheless It is an amazingly fun challenge to put yourself in a level alone without bots and tests your knowledge in the game as well as your abilities to adapt to what you have to do as well as managing your supplies very well I recommend this game to whoever is looking for an actual challenging game and not just a hack and slash type of game With friends it becomes amazing without friends it becomes a nightmare and it's the nightmare part that I absolutely enjoy
Trash game Horrible UI game for retards
c
La experiencia mas tortuosa y aburrida en mucho tiempo un intento de left 4 dead pero claustrofobica y que te obtener 4 diotrias de en serio es horrible que cada nivel totalmente en la absoluta oscuridad y que por si no es suficiente puedas entrar en zonas con un gas verde donde ya si que no ves absolutamente nada Movimiento muy tosco y jugabilidad muy plana que te obliga a jugar en constante sigilo para que no te violen el culo cada 5 minutos aparte de que debes estar 24/7 esquivando proyectiles que te bajan cada uno un 10 de salud sin tener en cuenta los gigantes que te puedan tirar de un golpe Por lo que he visto todas las misiones son iguales ve caminando durante infinitos pasillos sin perderte intentando buscar determinados objetos en cada caja de loot que encuentres todo el rato pudiendo estar 2 horas para completar un nivel Hace falta ser masoca para gustarte esto Honestamente a menos que te guste sufrir este juego es de lo peor que he visto

Bad performance
Low-framerate the game
Even my character has problems in this game he keeps hitting his head
A highly immersive co-op shooter there's nothing else like it on the market atm not great with less than 2 players(the bots aren't the best but if you can get 3 people together and play it's one of the best tense coop shooters

Gave it a go was a lot of getting lost and opening doors and walking through doors Only about 15 of my game-play actually involved any combat and when there was combat there was far too little amounts of ammo and I just don't care for melee combat in this game Also extremely unfriendly to modding and the single-player lifestyle none of the mods I tried worked so Fuck this one Trailers give the wrong impression of what this game is about Maybe it gets better idk but they lost me at the dullness of first levels

que un juego parece un virus te cierra los programas y te cuelga el pc tuve que forzar el apagado para poder reiniciarlo totalmente roto e injugable no se lo recomiendo ni a mi peor enemigo
WTF is this joke?!And they want money for that
kaum munition
buenisimo pero en mi pais sale 20 dolares en oferta
Jogo completamente mal otimizado temperatura de Gpu chega a bater 100 graus
I would be happy if I could play the game itself Freezing when loading the tutorial and nothing happens but eats 8.2gigs of ram 0 CPU and GPU activity I only hear the character breathing in the intro squence Btw the concept and the art world is awesome SCP and outer world like I would rock with it for sure

Normally I would play more of this game before reviewing this but I want to get this out right now because its a free weekend and sale and I don't want people to feel pressured to buy Overall the game is actually competently made and polished The atmosphere is great My issue with the game is that it requires at least three other real players to play preferably four players who are really good at tactics and dungeon crawling A combination of stupid friendly bots extreme difficulty and how annoying the main monsters are The main ghouls you will be facing run fast attack in packs using pack tactics are small shoot homing projectiles that can go behind cover and are extremely spongy where they can survive getting their heads blown off Basically everything annoying you could possibly make an enemy being a common foe you face Now if you don't have a dedicated team you can always try matchmaking but it just takes one person in a team of four to completely botch the mission and its random people so expect that a lot Of course this was during the free weekend so I don't know how good people are usually once everyone gets filtered out I really want to like this game but it's too reliant on having a dedicated group to play with

7/10
8/10 imo
could be cool but another game where you have close to 0 ammo all the time
Idea is pretty nice knife/gunplay sucks And why play a shooter where fighting if you have to at some point is not fun at all
I deserve a 2 hour wank for every hour of this game
Tried to play for the free weekend Game is not fun and the AI voice is super annoying
Free Weekend sayesinde Oyun konsept olarak ama zor bir FPS oyunu yoksa oynamak pek keyif vermeyecektir Oyuncu bulma konusunda aksine oyuncular cana ve vakit Birlikte another day another slay diyerek defalarca kez ancak oyun cidden yordu beni halinde hareket etmezseniz ceza yiyorsunuz Yani Trolleyen ya da az saf olan oynamak onlarla sonsuza kadar gelebilir En ufak bir bile maalesef Oyunda gizliden gizliye ilerliyor ve daha alt katmanlara inerek bir ama tam ne oyunun sonunu Oyunu iyi bilen bir ekibiniz yoksa almak Atmosferi baya gerici ve bu baya Tek pek diye Uzun indirime girmesini bekliyordum ancak Free Weekend olsun bu oyunu oynayabilecek almama hafta sonu bitene kadar lobide denk gelen insanlarla sonra Ekleme Oyuna gibi profile gelip yok oldum yok gtfo oyun kesin ne oyuna ne oyun dedim Oynayacak kimse oluyor dedim oynayacak bulursam elbet Oyunun ama neden belirttim insan gibi amk gibi gelip yorum Az pencereden oksijen da o zaman belki
Graphics wise its bad ass Co-op wise its bad ass BUT it fails in a few areas The limited ammo is a joke The previews and trailer show people shooting and blasting LOL yea right thats about 30 seconds of game play and your out of all your ammo lol This game should have options to play on different tiers like start with alot of ammo and such and then you can try harder modes Its not a run and gun and shootim up its Its a 10 shooter 50 running around looking for doors and 40 resorting to melee Nevermind if you invite a bot to the game it just points at ever door and tells you right there Took a vet player to explain to us after 3 games that the bot is basically dumb Ai bot will shoot during stealth missions runs infront of your fire Shoots through all the ammo before the 3rd door or fight The game should be marketed differently and explained it never once in one trailer or video official states your have limited ammo so you better reserve and go to melee Your start off with like maybe 60 rounds or so for a full machine gun You start of with like 40 rounds in a shot gun and between 4 people there is nowhere near enough ammo packs for your weapons The game needs a major update or option for ammo adjustment for different play styles

Its better than back 4 blood compared to lore and gameplay straightforward to action

elimize silah geberiyoruz geldi sessiz gitmek silahlar yaramaz tutorialdan bile bir bunu scp 5k al cok daha iyi var
I've played this game for three hours so far In those arduous hours I have Taken fall damage on accident Accidentally woken everything up by forgetting my flashlight Missed six out of six shots with my revolver Taken fall damage on accident Coordinated with my friends They woke everything up by forgetting to crouch Missed six out of six shots with my revolver Died Finally gotten to the first alarm door Missed six out of six shots with my revolver Walked in front of an angry turret Matrix dodged a twelve-foot-long tongue Died Coordinated with my friends Holy we did it guys TURN YOUR LIGHT OFF Died Finally switched off the revolver Oh my god another alarm door WHY IS THE TURRET THERE Died Switched back to the revolver There better not be another damn alarm door Taken fall damage on accident Boss battle Died on the way out Coordinated with my friends WHY DID YOU TOUCH HIM Missed six out of six shots with my revolver Finally beat level one Had tons of fun
Hold E simulator
10 min of tutorial was enough for me Thanks for the free weekends uninstall
fun but u need friends
Ich habe nichts gegen schwere Teamshooter Aber dieses Sucherei nach und Zonen und Ping hier und da ist mehr als nervig gut sein aber eine Schnitzeljagd mache ich im Wald Dazu generische Klonumgebungen spawnende Gegner die Mario-like umherspucken denen man nicht ausweichen kann Ernsthaft Immersion adieu Dazu ein UI aus der wie kann man einem Gamer sowas antun wohl zur des Games dazu Work together in GTFO or have fun together in another Game Overhyped Fail leider
I played for several hours on the free weekend it was fantastic There were some things I didn't like Their menu system to select things is a little wonky and an acquired taste and the fact that I have to weapon swap to melee irks me I should be able to bash things heads in with the butt of my weapon especially considering how little ammo you have in this game which I'm not complaining about I love the scarcity of resources aspect I just hate having to stop fighting swap weapons then bash the bad guys Also on a preference note you can't use the bio scan thing unless the enemy is moving That's dumb how does the device see them before hand if it can't mark them until we're desperately running for our lives Despite all that and getting my booty handed to me on the first level repeatedly over approximately 3 hours of gameplay I still loved my limited time with this game
DIED IN THE TUTORIAL 10/10
If you don't have friends don't play GTFO Randoms are horrible and there are no cool encounters I'll stick my guns to R6 Extraction instead
I can't even find players for one game during the free weekend lmao

6/10
3-4 P.S
Everything about this game feels extremely slow and clunky Movement is terrible aiming is terrible recoil is terrible loading in takes forever every mission is the same the map design is garbage alot of back tracking for no reason can't move fast enough to avoid enemy projectiles bots are braindead played this for free and don't wouldn't even continue if it stayed free
Good game even without spicy mayo

schit those lickers like to lick my a A LOT TLDR Feels like hell and back to hell Haha and its fun
Wow That was scary Died 5 times Would love to try again Victory will be sweet
I would try to love this game but I just can't this game is hard for being the sake of hard The game force you to use melee or at least the majority of the game It's fine if the dev doesn't want the game to be a shooting gallery but the melee gameplay isn't fun or interesting My friend and I can only do this because we just laugh when we fail our coordinate attack The playerbase or at least the vocal one will berate you if you just want more ammo but that same playerbase is fine if 4 player is running turrent and make the enemy go in all 4 turret killzone which is very hypocrite of them I wrote this review during the free weekends who knows if they change it or not in the future
Really difficult and hard to see highly recommended

Impossible to invite your friends to a server Lame Edit finally got it to work Game needs to communicate better to players that once your friend's lobby number is copied into your clipboard only then will you see the red button on the left to join their lobby Game is fun
Fun game if you are looking for something that requires great coordination among friends Sometimes it can be repetitive
A very Hardcore experience for fans of the Genre I have always loved PVE types of games and when I saw this was the true hardcore experience i was willing to give it a shot The game does not hold your hand at all in fact it will punish you for being a noobie and trying to complete any level like you would any other game That is the beauty of this game You have to be precise and accurate in your moves and plans and you WILL fail That is also part of the game as you learn the should and should not of the game you will master each level since its hand crafted to put your coordination and ingenuity to the test I highly suggest finding a group of friends to share this with
yes
Most well optimised game I've played in 5 YEARS
i enjoy being abused 3
Ironically this is a game I want to hate because I am so bad at it But I am bad at it because it blends several genres absurdly well There is simply no game like this one You might think Oh its just Left4Dead but no the extended stealth segments and emphasis on caution rather than speed create much more tension than Left4Dead ever has Some might say oh its just another multiplayer horror game but no the combat is fast paced and visceral much like Left4Dead and Vermintide thus the common comparison without becoming an endless slog where it just feels like a casual shooter after awhile It has everything I love about survival horror such as limited resources unforgiving darkness and fast lethal combat Paired with everything I love about horde-shooters meaning functional shooting+melee combat along with numerous enemies to tear through Or in my case torn apart by
👍
Apesar de achar a proposta intrigante notei uma certa no o que poderia comprometer a No entanto que minha pode estar totalmente embasada que ainda tive a oportunidade de explorar suficientemente o produto Vale ressaltar que a com amigos adiciona um componente muito positivo
zzz
This game is borig af if you like shooting enemies then this game isnt for you because ur supposed to be a cuck that doesnt shoot and just sneaks like a goblin Apart from that no progression no real reason to play id rather play deep rock galactic or payday its challenging and fun while this game is just challenging and a giant maze for no reason
Tremenda basura de juego en el propio tutorial me dio un pantallazo azul y se me reicinio la computadora no lo recomiendo para nada hay otros juegos coop del estilo mucho mejores ni gratis lo recomiendo
THIS PLACE IS BEEG
10/10 So much fun and funny clips
me partieron el an0
Si
no ammo
dope game
nice
In my opinion the best game of all time The game is surprisingly balanced solo despite what the negative comments say and once you learn how to work with the bots you can get extremely far on your own It takes me roughly 20-30 hours to beat a difficult mission but the learning and planning you go through makes it all worth it in the end when you use everything you know to finally win If you have friends Even Better The most fun I have ever had in a multiplayer game to date not only does this game bring out the best in your team and everyone's skills but is hilariously funny too You will never appreciate your friends in another game as much as you do in GTFO Over a thousand hours of gameplay great character and loadout customization the best of stealth and shooters 10/10 Highly Recommend Get when on sale for 20 and have a decent PC
tres bon jeux a recommander
Controller support is non-existent you can map controls but they don't work Unable to crouch and do any stealth related tasks on controller Don't download this game if you want to use a controller
Not my jam but if you enjoy games where you creep around a dark musty alien environment killing them or sneaking past them in order to find stuff with your bot buddies or your real buddies this game seems fun
Paia
Not much of an blast as i were told about Not much about skill,not very scary,not so thriling Reward?random skins,random boosters Mission objectives are about typing some random stuff into terminal or just going ahead with rush B and finding the objective without having to solve random ass puzzles Overall Gameplay lame Difficulty is like playing generic dungeon crawler,even skyrim bandint hideout clearing was more fun and more scary,this game is overhyped and sad
TREMENDA PIJA JUEGO INFUMABLE
The Menu UI is odd The matchmaking worked for the first round then when someone left I tried to rematch to add and it removed everyone from the group The gameplay is alright You need actual communication or friends or you won't get to far
Meh
um lixo
Es una pinga no explican nada dan poca en resumen una pinga no lo compren
Nice with friends a bit expensive but it's definitely worth it Just pay attention to naruto in games no joke
Good but trust me don't play it with your dumb friends
attack on titan
Fetch Quests over and over and over Again Few Enemy Types 6 Commons and 10 uniques that are connected to special Missions Poor Gunplay but wide variety of weapons so it's not that bad as i could say if u wanted to buy this game give it a try umo it's better to play Darktide or Deep Rock Galactic Hell even L4D2 is better
ainda bem que gastei dinheiro com esta MERDA Att
good
trash
game stinks
difficile J'ADORE
good
fun
Tremendamente adictivo si lo jugas con los pibes Se van a hartar de morir pero te divertis bastante Optimizado y se ve hermoso encima 11/10
First thing I notice is the menu UI is horrible trying to figure out wtf is going on at first glance is a nightmare and why do I have to hold each button not to mention you can't back out of menus with esc Alright I can work past that go to matchmaking and sit there for 10 min can't find anyone to play with A quick google search tells me that I have to join the discord and make a lobby from there Completely unacceptable to release a game with broken match making I am here on a free weekend and I will probably not sink another minute into this mess I would not recommend buying at any price hell if the game was free I wouldn't want it in my library
nunca vi um lobby complexo
Aptal bir sahip 50 tane yere yine indiriyorlar sessiz 5 metreden duyup yine 3 tek ha bide illede kafadan yoksa 30 merminizin 29unu tek bi tanesine zorluk madem oyunun bu sen koy bi kolay mod aq ama bunun nedenini oyunun cesitliligi bk gibi herkezi cutur indirseniz kolay ve olacak bence tek sebebi bu sorunu
Jogo ruim nao perder tempo
kein gutes Spiel
very boring
GTFO
hud from hell
This is a game that's 2 years old and still feels like a beta No way to test weapons Equip and hope it's a good one Unclear pro's and cons high ammo count Great Are we talking 20 round mags and 5 mags Or a 100 round drum mag Every mission is the same Go find A bring back Don't die Random generated levels won't change anything if the mission is the same All maps look the same Because it is so gdm dark why even bother with design Flashlight's O no those attrackt monsters so keep in the dark Great for environmental design Sights are so bright and over compenssating i can't see what i am aiming at because there all in the shadows No idea where i am being hit from Very unclear You would think we had perfected dmg indicators YEARS ago But guess they found those to clear Why change character looks It's all in the dark 9/10 Even if it is light the light is or SUPER bright or so low you can't really see detail anyhow Yet a other of the same type of run and gun hord shooter games Like Vermintide and L4D L4D at least was original back in the day This is just a copy with a new skin and some pretty lights And ppl seem to be blinded by it Can't blame them All games these days seem to be re-skins of the same old sh*t Ppl are thirsty for something good But have convinced themselves that sh*t games are good games forgetting the quality we used to have
one silly mistake and game over solid game though best tapi tak habis-habis might be a skill issue on my end who knows
PING killed it
GTFO is definitely a must play with friends it requires lota team work and stealth Very creepy setting and those zombie like creatures are super fast making it more challenging if not played stealthy
good game

vyzkouseno a nezaujalo
Nah nothing special 5/10 10 minutes of playtime and you know if this is the fun and scary or no
bons jogabilidade dificuldade alta exige que a maioria dos jogadores tenham trabalhem em equipe de forma coordenada e usem o tico e o teco A parte ruim ter servidores exclusivamente Br o que na maioria das vezes te coloca com jogadores americanos russos e por ai vai dificultando UM POUCO a e entrosamento da equipe
Einfach spielen und nicht aufgeben Um so tiefer es geht um so wird es Neueinsteiger ein wer Horror und was Schwieriges mag Nicht aufgeben
This game is a fantastic drop into hell If youre smart and prepare a little you can play most beginning maps on your own with bots Having at least one friend makes it a lot easier though
cara por incrivel que pareca eu gostei desse jogo apesar dos aliens feios da game play dificil da falta de recursos como balas e vida um jogo da hora de ser jogado porem no modo solo dificil creio que com amigos fique bem mais da horinha de jogar e um tanto quanto que mais facil mas ainda sim game play da hora graficos bonitos e que ainda roda num pc meia boca kkkk gostei e aprovo o game vale apena a experiencia de game unnica coisa assim que acharia mais da hiora acho que melhoraria seria colocar modo XP conseguir evoluir o personagem pra ele ganhar algum efeitos tipo mais vida mais velocidade armadura etc ertc e tambem aqueles cristais poderiam ter mais ultilidades tipo usar em uma loja para trocar por itens e tals outra coisa o PC poredia ser usado para comprar recursos tipo acha um dinheiro na estrada e usa o pc pra comprar coisas etc fica a idea ai mas ainda sim vale apena jogar joguei full solo ainda nao deu de juntar a galera pra jogar coope
This is actually a good-quality game The atmosphere here is terrific in both ways People often say that rewards at the end of the missions are hilarious the game is too hard and rundowns take too much time Well that is not their favorite type of game then This game is unforgiving and rewards you with story progression which is well hidden GTFO encourages you to cooperate with teammates and make decisions This game has resonated with me and my friends and we enjoy venturing into it I would not recommend to play it with bots only In simple terms if you don't have at least one person to play GTFO with you'll have a negative gaming experience
Great co-op experience for those who like chalanges Atmpshere is top notch and gameplay is really addicting Totally worth it even at full price
Very fun and relaxing game for the whole family until someone moves a little too quick and a simple A to B to C mission turns into a violent horrible massacre with half a survivor
play this with your homies to hear them scream louder than you have ever heard them scream before LMAO
I deeply enjoy this game even though it has ruined several friendships
My favorite games my friends complain is too hard The atmosphere the gameplay the sound design even the freaking UI come together to make a tough as nails L4D like
Work together or die alone
Open sneak bonk them on the head
This game is wild Brutally difficult oppressive fantastic atmosphere and overall a blast 5 hours to get through the first level without watching a tutorial or anything Numerous tries 3 tries into Level 2 and still no luck
Watched it when Markiplier Bob Wade and Jack played it back in the early stages of development and have always wanted to play it since Once I finally got around to playing it for myself and a friend it did not disappoint Playing Solo with bots is not the most thrilling but the more friends you have join your game the better experience I've done solo to a full squad and in between and each time we do more than two people it just adds to the experience and the pure chaos of fights This has been a long awaited game to play and I only have one regret with this game Not playing it enough
4 1-2

Fuck you Bishop
nagyon ott van
ted kaczynski was right
Jogo muito foda A do jogo foi o que mais me ganhou Ele passa muita bem esse terror de estar no escuro com monstros e fazer tudo minuciosamente bem para sair de o mais um jogo bem tenso porque ele pode ser bem punitivo ao leve deslize de alertar inimigos sem querer no escuro ou negligenciar o uso dos suprimentos Acho que a coisa que pega nesse jogo que se torna bem jogar sozinho Felizmente eu tenho amigos para jogar junto e dividir a adrenalina do jogo Mas quando pego para jogar fica complicado lidar com a IA dos bots pois eles matam furtivamente e muitas vezes ficam mal posicionados dificultando a mais ainda Ainda mais que o jogo tem uma comunidade forte no BR e muito achar um lobby para se juntar com outros
No item/level grinding required to actually play the game as it was meant to be No pointless difficulty options instead there are easier levels and harder levels Everyone is on the same playing field Refreshing coming from other co-op games and their bloat There's a lot of content with the 7 soon to be 8 rundowns totalling 70 levels While each level can be hit or miss in their enjoyment the highs are very high and the lows are acceptable Once I figured out what the game was going to be like part way into Alt Rundown 1&2 the game clicked The act of learning became an enjoyable process until the levels themselves became the highlight with some really fun tests of individual and team skill later on The game is a shooter foremost with stealth sections as a side note Later missions make this clear but the earliest ones tricked me and my team into thinking taking 30 minutes to stealth clear a few zones with spears was OK It's not it's boring and it doesn't work later on The levels have time pressure scenarios thrown in now and then with some understanding of fast stealth being a critical skill And in the end most rooms in most levels can be awaken and shot as long as shots connect and resources are collected It's not a count your shots type of game despite it having that aesthetic One downside The game is super opaque in almost all of its systems Stealth mechanics enemy spawning mechanics during alarms weapon/tool stats and their use cases are all things that are worth looking up While most levels can be played blind without encountering something seriously unexpected with proper terminal usage and planning occasionally a level will throw a curveball that you couldn't possibly know or prepare for sometimes ending the run This and the fact that you get a few words worth of hints in a mission description to try and guess the theme of the level usually resulting in a suboptimal team loadout means the game isn't very blind run friendly Clearing levels may rely on scouting runs to gain knowledge when starting out less so when more experienced Game is good with 2-4 players despite enemy/objective count not scaling down Some levels feel bad with 2 players due to mission design assuming 4 players but all are doable with and without bots Bots are borderline infuriating to play with but will greatly assist a 2-3 player team regardless Solo with and without bots is not a good experience
12.11 12.8 12.5
Good game to scare your friends in
its fun
Big Chungus approves
Good
Harsh place to find out your friends don't know what standing inside a circle means
No pretty uWu girls
fucking goty still stuck because no friends but best game ever
I rememeber 12 hour and longer dungeons in MMORPGs this is the same xD
A thrilling intense and a very challenging COOP game It focuses more on coordination and thoughtful maneuver than mindless horde shooting Communication in this game is vital thus it's best experienced by using the game's Discord server
awesome grim and dark PvE shooter too bad my friends don't play it no more probably because the game sessions are quite long and stressful
this game is cool
Literally cannot play this game unless you have people to play with And matchmaking is ass on this game And the bots Worthless as all hell They literally just blindly follow you around and hardly do anything like any other game with terrible AI coding I can't count the amount of times they have gotten me killed because they woke up the creatures by just shooting them for no damn reason They don't strategize and are brainless asf The concept of the game is great with the exception of the fact that a lot of the levels feel very repetitive But good god is this game unplayable if you are by yourself
incredibly fun and intense even though i have yet to beat the second level will end or strengthen your friendships
its fun but its hard
This is a hard good game
Explore Die trying Learn form it Plan and Try again I give this game a 10/10 WARRING THIS GAME IS VERY HARD AND VERY SERIOUS This is the game that make you feel pain to gain adrenaline so you can always get excited and have fun Totally fun just get yourself at least one friend and play with two bots you'll find out you're having great time with this game
Daddy is so Hard
AWESOME
Game hay
good
I have no one to play with the servers are empty
TL;DR Worth money fuck yes i was originally going to call this the left for dead 2 or some other ground breaking era defining game but tbh i think this is beyond any left for dead in exponential amounts Somewhat more indepth info and experiences from me Compared to a lot of other low-man co-op multiplayer games that ive played recently SCP 5K Escape The Backrooms Lethal Company Deeprock Galactic GTFO is one of the best Its a perfect combination of strategic stealth and conservation of ammo and then out of now where bam some sorta mutated degen gets pissed off and now the entire floor is after you Single Player Actually really fun you have complete control over the 3 teammate bots and what they do and they function pretty well on their own when you're too busy to do so Multiplayer Matchmaking is not recommended but they have a very VERY active official discord which is great to see Community from the individuals i've played with have all been understanding and accepting to new players some even willing to run multiple missions and give guides and advice Shout out to Dumbass Cat and Ali's Son Levels and Replay-ability Most if not all levels are unique There is so much variety that it makes sense that every level is a complete new environment with different interactions I cant spoil too much but just when you think you start to understand everything something new hits you in the face Later tiers of harder levels have multiple alternative endings/objectives that also push the barrier of what you and your team are capable of with marginal benefit In game cosmetics when i first heard this i thought that it implied DLC or micro transactions but as it turns out cosmetics are randomly dropped from completing levels which gives players more insensitive Money where your mouth is The devs have already stated they are committed to not having any micro transactions in GTFO and that content releases and updates will be free Im sure everyone is aware that there are hundreds of examples of companies falling back on these kinds of statements but i would like to believe that this kind of standard and prestige that GTFO has will be upheld to however long they can.a Performance I run GTFO on a 3070 Ti and an i7 12700k with 64 gigs of ram so i cant really complain about intense usage or resource tanking However i've never had any issue with the game at 165 HTZ on a 2.5k 2560 x 1440 monitor with visual or audio bugs UI or in-game glitches nor anything deloading unredering or just straight up not working The only issue i run in to is if someone has an unstable connection When someone is lagging the game kind of breaks in some funny ways But the way they set up their connection and networking due to this is very good This way keeps all players synced and connected and there isnt really any chance of desycning
ahh
great teamwork many monsters nice atmosphere
Stay strong and get your underpants ready for a change
This game is fucking amazing I've never had to work this tightly together as a team before It takes a while before you get the hang of it but holy shit is it worth it Great game to play with friends 25 hour update Game is still amazing and they even added a new level and quite a few new weapons

muito bom doi ate o enquanto jogo e morro igual bot
The hardest and most extreme part is trying to stay awake playing this snoozefest
This game is very hard The people you play with will make it even harder Good luck
Fucking mint
I cannot describe the hatred I have for this game I played many years ago and I still cannot get this game out of my head I wish I could take legal action for the mental scars this game inflicted on me I WISH I WAS JOKING Best way to fix this game devs is to throw it in the fucking bin Accept the loss and go back to developing stair-lifts for the elderly even then you would probably fuck it up
Dont touch the feelers
with friends only
Awesome unforgiving game
funy gambia game
boner
Awesome Horro Enemy runs like naruto
Very Hard D
damn tense
prepare to die a whole lot
has anyone found the exit yet
no hay jugadores el juego es bueno pero el online esta muertisimo
It's all fun and games until the scout gets freaky
My best advice get a group of 4 good friends find a well-isolated room and THEN start playing If all else fails run and gun
After eleven and a half hours I'm still wondering when the game is going to get interesting The game-play loop is nearly exactly the same in each Rundown You enter the facility with four group members total stealth kill enemies scrounge for supplies activate alarm doors that call hordes grab main objective leave Very repetitive cycle on each and every mission These missions can also take anywhere from thirty minutes to two hours depending on the experience levels of you and your crew as well as the size of the map\number of encounters You also have all of the weapons and equipment as soon as you start the game Cool I get it Though that leaves less room for a sense of progression in an already stale and unrewarding title The gun-play is decent though most weapons feel underwhelming There aren't many good thing that I could say about this game therefore I cannot recommend it
So good with friends
Bueno en este juego el tutorial y en la primera partida GTFO es un juego shooter cooperativo HARCORE quieres hablar pasito por favor apaga la luz ha me mori otra vez asi sera tu vida en GTFO siiiii lo recomiendo TAKE MY MONEY
Get Tacos For Obama
Refunded this game after only finding one game in within 4 hours using it's own matchmaker The devs even recomend you in the game UI to look for other players in their discord really is not worth the hassle A pity because the game premise is very interesting but the execution of this game's online functionalities is terribad more even when the game is purely online Not even bother playing with bots my man useless and sucks all the fun from the experience
Quite difficult with the bots I strongly rec playing with friends

Esse jogo uma uma hora ele me bate outra hora eu apanho e quer saber de uma coisa eu gosto.EU GOSTO KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKAAAAAAAAAAAKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK FEITO PRA GENTE DOENTE QUE QUER SOFRER mas o combate muito gostoso a dos tiros acertando os montros o impacto das balas dos golpes corpo a corpo o impacto que cada monstro tem quando te acerta.acredite tudo nesse jogo te incomoda desde o ataque de de um gigante que tem um alcance fodido e te tira 30 de vida de a linguada dos sleepers normais que 9 de dano mas fazem sua mira como se estivesse com PARKINSON TUDO VAI TE FRUSTRAR E TE FAZER SENTIR SEM a escassez de suprimentos vida tudo isso vai servir pra te deixar mais imerso nessa se sente esmagado e acuado o jogo te faz se sentir como a presa embaixo se acha que vai ser o predador e chegar matando todos os monstros facilmente terrivelmente enganado RESUMO eu RECOMENDO esse jogo se for um masoquista como eu que gosta de ficar imerso num universo que quer te ver morto se estiver disposto a passar 3 horas em cada nova por que o jogo pega na sua se estiver disposto a ficar 40 minutos numa e falhar e uma nunca vi nada igual nota 9.5 com selo de BDSM de ouro
BE WARNED This game is extremely difficult The hardest thing is that there are moments when enemies are on alert and if you move even a centimetre the whole room wakes up on you That means your team can screw everything up pretty quickly if even just one of you slightly move at the wrong time This game shouldn't even be advertised as a shooter IMO it should be advertised as a stealth game Me and my friends expected a more hardcore version of Left 4 Dead but this game is not that at all Ammo is insanely limited and It's a lot of creeping around and stabbing sleeping enemies in the face I had the patience for it but my friends didn't which is why my play time will probably forever stay at 24 hours unless I can convince them to play again one of these days The game is nearly impossible solo There are bot teammates that you can order around but they aren't smart enough and can harm more than help sometimes as they take up a lot of resources like health and ammo You can play without bots by yourself but that slows the missions down and can have you in a run for an hour or two just to die with no progression to show for it It took me and my friends about 4 to 5 hours just trying to complete the first mission through trial and error TLDR It's a good game with great atmosphere just make sure your friends are patient and are up for a brutal and unforgiving challenge because without friends to play with you're screwed
Exit hypostasis units Hey guys What does this big guy do over here Greatest 2 minute mission I've ever played 10/10
Really fun and Hard game but you need few friends to play it bots are terrible and teaming up with randoms can be even more painfull If you like challenge and have 3 friends that also like it this game is great
If you like spending hours dying over and over again until you succeed with a run just to unlock an even harder one then this is absolutly the game for you
Oyun bu ve sniper tareti kim efsane taret etmek saat bekliyor bizi ediyor taret hayla sonra beklenen an geliyor ve taret ediyor Onu da ve bize yapmaya devam ediyor
This game is so hard but when you eventually complete a room it feels so good
Good co-op game

Game is OK but really hard to have good teammates
cool idea but floaty as fuck gameplay OMG SO COOL 3 2 1 MELEE because if u use guns ur griefing so cool and epic guys omg you unironically will be doing the same thing for hours on end if you dont enjoy the first hour why dont expect the gameplay loop to change at all inb4 Jester Jester Jester instead of actually engaging
MAKE SURE YOU TURN OFF YOU LIGHT
Its got a fun loop and very cool ideas but its just not re-playable Give it a try
suffering 10/10
no he jugado mucho pero si te gustan los juego de suspenso y coordinacion en equipo este es un juego para ti En juego es dificil asi que preparate para morir

Fun to play with friends Endless hours of fun and frustration The mechanics while at first were hard to wrap my head around proved fun Would recommend
This game is definitely scary and I loved trolling my friends
enemies are fun gunplay feels good sound design is amazing Proximity voice chat would be big plus
goofy ahh sleepers
yes
yes
This game makes you beg for completion but my god is it fun and worth it From great gun play to the eerie environment it's all here for a fun horror shooter
I feel bad about this game for many reasons but I can't recommend this game mostly cause it's expensive I'll give more details in the review Why is it impossible to complete the game right now This is a 4-player coop hardcore fps game and when I say hardcore it's an understatement You'll mostly have to learn the hard way about how to survive and deal with enemies there is a little tutorial at least You have to acknowledge that you'll not complete the game cause you need 3 players that have at least an hour or more to play They need to be patient They need to learn from their mistake which are already too much to ask for cause the game has reached 3k players in the last 4 months Considering most of these players have their own friends/groups and never look for beginners this is not a criticism but 3k players is really optimistic There are also modded players so yeah Good luck finding people How's the replayability In my opinion the horde shooter genre's biggest weakness is replayability so for the game to be worth 40 it needs to honor a good number of hours To be fair the game has a lot of levels right now a decent amount of enemies but not enough variety in weapons unfortunately cause most of them feel underwhelming to me Is there much content to expect Unfortunately no They are working on a new game and you'll have to count on the modding community for them to deliver new content which is funny cause modding is prohibited on any official GTFO discord server And not to long ago you could get banned on site for even mentioning it oh banning your most dedicated community sounds fucked up to you Yeah I kind of agree with that Long story short certain updates made the game unfathomably worse the devs don't understand their community the game will only have few last updates it's too expensive etc Although the core of the game is great it is in a bad shape Don't expect it to get any better for the years to come Hope this helped edited
its not good its not bad its not fun its the most mild experience eating wings with no sauce no seasoning no spices no nothing is a lot more exciting
Work together or die together It's not just for show or to sound cool That phrase is the very core of the game Unless you are bored and have too much time on your hands and spend it to learn every single mechanic so you can solo even the hardest of levels only for the bragging rights But since the chances of that happening are abysmal lets focus on the more likely stuff you'll die You'll die and die and die again You will screw up or someone else will you will get swarmed and will die Another time you may accidentally wake up an entire chamber full of enemies you will get separated from the others cornered swarmed and killed You may run out of ammo or you may fall to infection or other mechanics of the game You may become a very good player yet because of a single mistake made by the rookie you're carrying you will die Welcome to GTFO Just to recap GTFO is a multiplayer hardcore supposedly horror 4 people/team coop first person shooter where your enemies are quite different from what you see in most games of the same genre You will have to learn their behavior in order to survive in the complex and accomplish the seemingly endless list of tasks the WRDN assigns you To this game there are two keys One is patience You will need it so you don't give up on the game because it's too hard The second key is a team Let me explain this more in depth There are 5 ways to make a team be the team solo it You can do it at 1000+hours maybe I believe in you maybe one day I will Bots They are a thing but it takes some time to get used to commanding them Personally I never use bots I prefer to try and solo it even if I know I'll fail Matchmaking It is a thing If you have the patience to wait And then the patience to learn chinese or persian or russian or french Or whatever language the people you are matched with speak And then you also have to hope they are not trollers cheats or plain obnoxious etc Discord The game has a discord with LFG Looking for Group channels where you may find others that hopefully speak the same language and live on the same continent so you don't have to play with a 1000 ping ally on the team Friends my advice Try to find someone you know IRL and buy the game together It is more fun and you are sure to have a teammate from which you know what to expect It's probably the best way to play this game Now taking all this into account there are a few more things to say First is the way the levels work The general idea was that the game devs would release a set of levels a Rundown which would last 2-3 months After that they would be completely removed from the game Forever Lately however they did a thing and made a sort of remaster of each of the old Rundowns starting with R1 to R6 Next is R7 which is the last remaster on the list During this time ALL OF THEM remain playable At least until R8 What will the devs do after R8 I don't know Maybe they'll delete all of them and go on with R9 and so on The point is are you fine with that You the reader of this review Take that into account when you buy Second do you know the words the chase is better than the catch Well this game is a chase with no catch The only reward you get for completing a level is a victory theme a screen that says you won and a few cosmetics And while that may sound bad it is not The tension built up during the struggle your team put up in the level the many times you barely made it all of that is suddenly released when you hear that tune play and see EXPEDITION SURVIVED on the screen Result Pure satisfaction But then again this might not be for everyone I know of many who dislike games where you can't see your own evolution reflected by shiny cosmetics and more digits in the currency bar Which is one of the reasons why I like GTFO No flashy cosmetics no in-game currency no microtransactions So do i recommend it If you're not a kid have patience like hardcore challenges and loosing a lot have who to play with or believe you could make it work with total stranger then yes
Great game for you and your friends
Great game but I can't still kill the scout cause I'm bad GG
The game has a unique atmosphere and the graphics are very high quailty It sets completely new standards in both coop games and survival shooters For those aspects I praise this game from the bottom of my heart Unfortunately some levels are simply too much to bear for someone who doesn't want to spend an entire day playing GTFO and learning ever single optimisation technique The atmosphere isn't enough to justify wasting hours and hours of game time just to unlock another level and get a new pair of virtual pants or a gasmask Settable difficulty levels would be VERY much appreciated
Mas conquistar a tu amor imposible que pasarte 1 nivel de este infierno llamado GTFO
Game is hard Friends will be a greater danger than the enemies Good time
fps
I'm sure I would love this game if I had people to play it with As it stands the friendly AI are kind of useless and it is beyond me why the in-game matchmaking is almost non-existent A discord server really shouldn't be the quasi-official official game lobby So unfortunately despite really wanting to play this game I haven't really been able to

Honestly such a great game to play with friends fun but absolutely terrifying for the first times playing levels Its the perfect amount of challenging where you need to band together and have a strategy in the harder parts

Buenardoooooo

Oh God They can hear you
Challenging

Good FPS horror if you have friends to play with In case you play alone it would be difficult to pass some levels If you want to understand the lore then you have to watch a YouTube unless you are a detective who will note each doc and dialog in short you are a prisoner who was put into a hydrostasis and sent here to deal with problems in bio lab which are full of monsters(all of them are mutated people Also the main phrase of the game Work together or die together represents the whole gameplay If you will not COOPERATE you DIE Have fun

Wonderful high tension missions that force you to communicate and work together well A
i fun
Having to dodge and weave through 3 Scouts and just barely escape detection by hiding behind a box and seeing the tentacles grow just inches above me is one of the most exhilarating things I've ever done while gaming In times like that the horror of this game is truly unmatched Also the lighting Oh my god the lighting I don't know what it is with this game but it's SO INCREDIBLY GORGEOUS screenshots just don't do it justice Anyways Long Range Flashlight superiority
This game is awesome 9/10

No es no te lleva de la mano la historia la tienes que buscar a conciencia pero no hay otro juego como este en cuanto a hacer que TODO te meta en su mundo Desde que abres el juego te metiendo ya en elementos de la historia la sepas o no Y si vas investigando y descubriendo cada detalle viendo esas conexiones Aviso Puede llegar a ser frustrante Tienes misiones que duran hasta un par de horas y si fallas al final has perdido ese progreso pero cuando en una de esas largas y logras salir vivo pocos juegos te hacen sentir esa de haberlo logrado Por lo tienes misiones para largo Tras todas las ALT tienes 71 misiones por hacer y falta la rundown 8 que en breve que horas de juego tienes
best game to test your friendship 11/10 would recommend to friends
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
This game is scary me and im is do mistake sometime and is die team

GTFO is the sleeper hit of the ages Regardless of the problems you may have it with the fact is that it's a highly refined stealthy extraction shooter The goal is usually as one does in an extraction shooter to grab various important items for the higher ups that just yanked you out of Cryosleep Why You gotta find that out buster Quietude is king here You can get extremely close to the toughest enemies and a couple don't even respond to your movements i'll let you figure out which ones just make sure you really practice your hacking minigame Loud gameplay is tense and you and your team be they bots players or a mix of both need to come prepared You will be massively rewarded if you understand how to utilize choke points c-foamed doors and controlled shootings in rooms Terminals ask players to be a little computer savvy and have team leaders Having someone chase down a key item with repeat pings makes precision a lot easier to achieve and is one of the prime reasons one would want other players on their team That's largely the basic gameplay loop don't worry much about other basic mechanics everything looks good and feels good and that's what matters Don't pass this one by and drop by the discord we always need new blood to keep the game alive
very cool game with a very cool idea and atmosphere
Get in Kill monster in sneaky beaky like be happy teammate activating biometric scan without letting anybody know all ded
Well do the thing and GTFO cuz your ammo Kinda hard game
GTFO is payday for GOTHS Thumbs up
9/10
Oh great we woke up the whole family Load up Won't take em long to find us They sound close Get ready That is not a good sound Yes I hear it I hear it too well tearing the bloody door WE GOT ABOUT FIVE SECONDS BEFORE THAT DOOR GIVES
decent game it kinda feels like left4dead with more mechanics but the price is outrageous for what you get game feels like it was meant for the xbox 360 if you can get it for a good price and have friends to play with its pretty fun
SO FUN GOOD CHALLENGE GREAT TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS RECOMMENDED IT TO A WORKER AT JB HIFI AND HE SAID HE WILL GET IT 10/10
It's insanely hard lmao 10/10
GET THE OUT
Better than Mariokart Doubledash
One of the most challenging games I have ever played also one of the most rewarding The devs are constantly changing balance and slowly adding more content to the game to flesh out the story and maximize the games potential
good
It took 4 hours to beat the first level because that bastard Bishop kept freezing up near the security door 10/10
Frank slammed my friend in a corner 9/10 would slam again
This is one of the best co-op games I have played It is very challenging but very rewarding when you beat the level you have been playing for hours Would Recommend
Muito bacana o jogo
NOT FOR KIDS
This is an awesome game with plenty of challenge I enjoy this great game because of its challenge It really puts your skills to the test each time you dive into it
Fun and difficult game to play with the Lads

Brutal af Requires serious planning and communication Absolutely thrilling 9/10
fun and cool
Difficulty GTFO is known for its steep difficulty curve Some players appreciate the challenge while others find it too punishing especially for those who are new to cooperative shooters Learning Curve The game has a complex set of mechanics and the learning curve can be intimidating for new players The lack of a comprehensive tutorial can make it challenging for players to understand the intricacies of gameplay Communication Requirement Effective communication is crucial in GTFO due to the game's cooperative nature Some players find it challenging to coordinate with teammates especially when playing with random groups leading to frustration Limited Content While GTFO has received positive feedback for its atmosphere and tension some players feel that the available content such as maps and enemy types can become repetitive over time Solo Play Challenges GTFO is designed as a cooperative experience and playing solo can be particularly challenging Some players have expressed a desire for a more tailored solo experience or the option for AI-controlled teammates Resource Management The game's emphasis on resource management including limited ammunition and tools can be polarizing Some players appreciate the tension it adds while others find it frustrating especially when playing with less experienced teammates AI Behavior Some players have raised concerns about the predictability of enemy AI behavior Variability in enemy actions could enhance the overall replayability and unpredictability of encounters Visuals and Atmosphere While many players appreciate the atmospheric design and lighting some have mentioned that the graphics could be improved Enhancements in visuals might contribute further to the overall immersion Community Interaction Community interaction and engagement from the developers have been points of discussion Players appreciate active communication and updates and some express a desire for more transparency regarding the development roadmap Limited Narrative GTFO focuses more on gameplay than narrative and some players would like a deeper exploration of the game's lore or more story-driven elements to complement the challenging cooperative gameplay
Yes yes yes
Greatest game to play with your friends
Good game
makes u wanna kys
Very nice and challenging game Some missions are a bit hard if you're not a full squad But having a blast playing it with friends
GOTY
It not a bad game its just that NO ONE PLAYS IT i have spent hours on matchmaking and hosting matches and i have gotten no living people to play

Amazing game with amazing co-operative gameplay Best to play with freinds

Work together or die together
GTFO playes in an amazing atmosphere and has some pretty tense gameplay it is well designed with a lot learning and to let players discover how to overcome the challenging missions This game delivers on making players feel isolated stuck in claustrophobic environments surrounded by the deadly sounds of monsters GTFO stands out as a unique cooperative horror experience due to its gameplay design After countless of deaths and failed runs you always come closer to the EXPEDITION SURVIVED screen with lots of relieve and emotions

wonderful game tactical good with friend hard thumb up
best difficult game to play with full co-op team 4 peoples I think
Genuinely one of my favourite games the level of design and love in this game shows and it makes me so happy to play it
The game is atmospheric but not scary it's not a horror as someone could think Levels are pretty balanced except of items generation one time you can pick helpful stuff out of boxes another one only glow sticks or lock melters that's annoying Also every level has it's own mission And development of levels keep going In general the game is worth to be played with friends and only with friends because bots ruin in critical moments need more smart hands
I hate all my retarded friends

i like when the big boys lick me up and down
Absolute blast with the friend group heaps of different weapons Game respects your ability and will not hold back on it's difficulty which I love to see I do wish they implemented a better way to save your progress if the game crashes but overall really enjoyable experience

You know it's the best coop game when you retry 32 times the same lvl with the same friends and you dont get mad at it
Definitely one of my favorite games to play with my friends Every move you make makes you really think with some weighted consequences if you mess up but that's also good because it means you get to improve on those mistakes in your next runs Guns feel really good just overall with an amazing look to them and everything feels really well balanced including spawns for resources and the guns themselves Seriously if you have a group of friends looking for a hardcore game to challenge you this is the best pick anyone can give you hands down
meh
i SHHHH SCOUT STAY CLEAR OF THE FEELERS i
Great game to play with friends or alone(if you're crazy enough Challenging in all the right ways almost addicting Highly recommended

Grape game it can go from spooky to an amazing FPS in just a few seconds
Une super de survie entre amis L'ambiance oppressante se fait rapidement sentir si elle se un peu une fois que les de jeu sont et mais le jeu continue de poser un challenge sur ses niveaux les plus durs La du bestiaire peut laisser au premier abord mais les additions succintes ne se font que mieux ressentir En somme une aventure avec un jeu qui ne nous fait pas de cadeaux pour passer un bon temps entre amis qui veulent du challenge et une ambiance relativement lourde

i Bonk i R2E1 hurt my feelings
Play it and have Fun
This game takes patience and great teamwork Call outs are the best thing possible Love it and have to 100 each level
Played a free weekend of this game was very cool I like how it doesn't hold your hand compared to all games nowadays You have to actually put in effort pay attention manage resources and use teamwork to make it any kind of distance which is really great As soon as I can convince 3 other friends to play it I will buy the game
good game if you have friends to play it
super hardcore coop game ever
I like game
Geiles Game sollte aber am besten mit Freunden ohne Bots gespielt werden
Excelente Juego para jugar en equipo y dar unos gritos jeje Ahora las diferentes etapas bien niveladas y es necesario de todo el equipo para superar cada nivel Amo Las partes que necesitas usar la consola
Complicado pero entretenido
For someone who likes a good challenge this peaked my interests It ain't so easy to speed run this game is specifically designed for masochists so if you complain it's too hard for you then move along because it sure as hell ain't for you
It's got everything I want in a game Cooperation Lots of levels and a very friendly community In order to play the game you need four people but the discord server is perfect for making new friends That's how I managed to defeat some levels and nearly complete the game
O jogo FODA Mas sem amigos pra jogar triste
Shits hard
This is what co-op horror is meant to be It's confusing It's dark It's scary It's RIDICULOUSLY difficult It's meticulously crafted and profoundly disturbing It's perfect
squad basedd shooter make sure you have friends to lobby with
Absolutely a challenging game for a group of friends Great FPS and sneaking mechanics Kinda wish they added a wave mode where you needed to defend a site from attack
Fun game to play with mates It's fun to be at the back and watch your pals drop one by one
i literally have a heart condition now
bozuk
Buggy as fuck
Intense and awesome If you can't find friends just go to the gtfo discord to find lots of nice people to play with
The game is ok I recommend to play it with 3 friends or join the discord group The online activity is very low I would not buy it again gl hf
I want to like this game the idea is great but a bit lacking Machmaking is dead Only way to play with someone is with at least 2 other friends or via Discord And im one of those people who dislikes joining Discord lobbies if i don't already know someone there Playing this game solo without at least 3 players is a hassle If you play it solo your only option is to use cheesing and sneaking past every level of the game Also there is no sense of progression in this game completing the levels felt quite unrewarding You get nothing out of it other than a lousy buff you can apply before the next level All in all if you think to solo or duo this game with just one other friend then its not worth it It will be a hassle
WOW

This game is for people who want a horde shooter that is ACTIVELY TRYING TO KILL YOU plan ahead carefully and learn your tools if you wanna just survive
time to get the fuck out
fun game silly creatures 2 hour long levels ruined cuz bots jump in front of you
I love this game Genuinely it's likely one of my favorite games ever It's challenging but without being too heavily aim based which is fantastic for me since I have some issues making it so I can't aim very consistently The sneaking the planning and the awareness I have to have is my favorite thing about games and this one does it so well Avoiding enemies the alert levels of them learning how to avoid and kill things without waking everything up It's all done beautifully Also they added subtitles Which is extremely nice because I had no idea what was happening for a few levels without them The one downside You need a full team of four to finish certain levels Now it does let you play with strangers and team up However if you're like me you may not enjoy teaming up with other people which means you end up stuck with a team of full AI or in my case one friend and two AI The AI order controls aren't exactly easy to remember if you don't play often though I would say they're fairly good at their jobs of helping you without carrying you Genuinely that's my only issue I just really dislike being forced to play with strangers in order to finish all the levels and unlock new ones.And while I could certainly use better aim no amount of me being better is going to fix enemies coming from multiple angles when all my AI are dead If you're thinking of getting this game I completely recommend it But maybe get a friend or three to also commit to it
GTFO is AMAZING D U will get Drepressions from it
intense friendship killer a mistake cost a lot love it
The best game you suck at D
i fucking hate acidic fog 10/10
You'll shit your pants and bust a nut at the same time
The game is amazing unique and intense mechanics perfect visual and sound design but don't get fooled the hardest thing about this game is finding people to play it with
Se voi e i vostri amici non avete un gioco co-op da giocare compratelo Probabilmente uno dei difficili e impegnativo titoli co-op da giocare con il vostro team dove la cosa fondamentale e lavorare di squadra altrimenti potresti ripetere le spedizioni un bel di volte WORK TOGETHER OR DIE TOGETHER
The game is great and i would sink hundreds of hours in but the huge problem is trying to get 3 other friends to play at once iv been only able to play basically 1 round a week They have a discord you can group up with people too
Empecemos este juego es una obra maestra donde nos pondremos en el papel de varios desadaptados que tienen como explorar instalaciones abandonas con mutantes la cual buscan averiguar mas de estas aberraciones en otras palabras son conejillos de indias Ya en contexto es un FPS en primera persona la cual requiere mucho con tus ya que es un juego con una dificultad enorme que no perdona en lo mas un leve error Es extremadamente inmersivo si pero bueno que hagan mas en contextualizar el lore de la en si para profundizar esto Su dificultad es como se dijo es extrema asi que se asegura una calidad de juego apra aquellos que buscan retos verdaderos Jugabilidad buena y desafiante recomendado jugar con amigos eso si
good
SHIT IS_ABOUT_TO_HIT_THE_FEN Prepare guys this game is something special dont touch if u get frustrated at all everyone who likes a challange get it even worth the full price because u have A TON of content if u want to the only downside what can be an upside 4 sure is that u HAVE to play as 4(3 at least 1 bot is kind of ok and the matchmaking relys on having discord and actually talk to ppl playing a muted run without having a couple hundred hour playtime isnt recommended once u get into it ITS AWESOME AS HECK not totally bugfree but the dev`s doing a good job with fixing them in time the last rundown will be released soon and then the playerbase will explode again im sure even now u can definatly find ppl to play with at any time of the week/day cu guys in the depth

amazing game
good game but cant sex the scout big sad please add romance option
really fun with friends highly recommend
Great game with friends And with bots you can still complete smaller levels Need some changes to bots tho we should have more control on what they do
nice game
Dogshit game lmao no ammo
p gud
It's a rather slap in the face I would say The game is too hard and yeah that would be accurate I'll admit I'm not the best and nor are my friends but a lot of the gameplay decisions just seem incredibly strange to me Having a horde-like enemy that has a range-based attack instead of mauling you with their obvious mouths is such a missed opprotunity Not spawning in with full ammunition/supplies just makes things far too reliant on RNG/scrounging literally every nook and cranny just to be at maximum capacity Not to mention the massive time commitment each level takes if you know where everything is you can probably get through it in less than 20 minutes but each mission for my group has taken us anywhere between 30 minutes to a couple of hours and that's not including retries and restarts The game does not respect your time at all Everything here has the making for being a good scary game but the game's focus on being hard for the sake of hard ruins a lot of enjoyment that my group of friends like from similar games The atmosphere is pretty good though and using terminals to do things like pinging resources and stuff is a good immersive way to show things on your hud rather than just give you floating objective markers all the time

Enemy click click click Me go Woah Enemy scream Me go AAHHHHH
Super easy game for family and child I suggest to everyone who want a nice game experience Pretty fun game if you want to play stealth only and still got beat the shit out of your ass Also you need to noted that the damage in the game is pretty balance too You cannot one shot the monster but they can Thank for the balance guys I love this game so much
Background I have a complicated history with this game I started Spring 2022 during rundown 6 playing with my brothers and we didn't make it very far at all After a couple wipes of R6B2 we gave up But I continued playing on my own with bots and was able to get all the way through R6D1 and R6CX Rundown 7 came out a few months later and I convinced a few more of my friends to play and we got to R7B3 but couldn't go any further Following that I stopped playing for several months Once rundown 4 came out my interest was piqued again and I got back into it and put a couple hundred hours working through the rundowns solo with bots For everyone who complains about the bots they really are quite helpful once you get used to how they work They have good aim usually can kill sleepers silently you accidentally wake them and take no infection The worst times to use them are during reactor and warden protocol missions or against chargers/tanks/mothers Some of my greatest accomplishments with the bots were R6D1 R2D1 R3C1 R4C1 secondary But that leads us to now Maybe things are different because I played rundown 6 before but my enthusiasm for this game has just been flattened My first upset was in R6A1 when you open the last door before the MWP and the lore log didn't play I figured it was a bug and a week or so later when the patch came out with the bug fix of audio not playing I tried it again No lore Apparently all the lore has been removed The second issue I have is the decision to move the extension missions up a tier without changing the difficulty at all How does it make sense to for R6AX to have multiple scouts two class 5 alarms two full zone alarms flyers and shockers but then R6B1 has two class 3 alarms one scout and a few flyers It feels so disjointed and anti-climactic and I don't understand why they would change it Rundown 6 was the first rundown out of early access and I wish they would have just left it alone I've tried three times to play it and I just don't have the heart anymore I hate that I feel this way about a game I've put hundreds of hours into and dozens of hours learning about the lore The Game I realize I haven't really talked about the actual gameplay I would say it's excellent The guns handle well there's tons of them and the tools are all unique and allow you to play many different ways The core gameplay loop of sneaking planning defenses and hectic alarm sequences is very satisfying There's a handful of missions that play fairly similarly gather items retrieve/process item create uplink but reactor startup warden protocol and error alarms really change things up Also the enemy variety is really good At this point I'm not sure what they could add that wouldn't be a repeat of a monster already present in the game You don't necessarily need friends to play but playing with bots is limiting I wrote about this above but the average player probably won't get past C-tier of most rundowns Some D-tier missions are doable if you are really skilled and get lucky but D-tier reactor mission or any missions that require you to split up are pretty much impossible Tanks and mothers are very challenging because the bots don't treat them differently than any other enemy and you basically have to kill them yourself Error alarms are very challenging because the bots like to run through doors as you're closing them so shutting doors behind you and mining them usually results in a stranded and killed teammate Chargers are also challenging as the bots will switch to melee as soon as they're in range and that can quickly result in a team wipe If you have friends to play with the game is significantly easier Even two humans and two bots is a huge step up over three bots The biggest downside to the game if you're playing with friends is the time commitment Missions usually last 45-90 minutes and in rundown 1-5 there are no checkpoints Losing a mission once or twice and result in a wasted night Most people I played with could only play for 3 hours and a wipe particularly at the end of the mission was always a mood killer That led to all of my friends quitting the game before we ever finished a single rundown If you have a good group of friends with a lot of time on your hands you can work your way through these rundowns and have a ton of fun If you're like me and have kids or a busy job and can only play a few hours at a time it's going to be very challenging to make any progress Verdict I would recommend this game to anyone who has a group of friends that like strategic co-op games or a solo FPS player who wants a challenge and doesn't mind learning the bots behavior If you don't have a group to play with it's going to be challenging to find a team as the playerbase has really dwindled I hate that I no longer want to play this game but I did get a lot of enjoyment out of it and I can't say I wouldn't recommend it based on some personal preferences Also this game has some fantastic video reviews on youtube TuxBird's and Macrackle's are favorites PS why doesn't Dauda thank you when you give him ammo 10 chambers please fix this I can't stand it Edit As of Rundown 8 Dauda now thanks you 10/10 game
Not hard to learn Hard to master Not hard with friends You don't have friends
Jogo extremamente e que exige sangue frio O foco sobreviver fazendo as sair atirando em tudo o que aparece significa morrer sem balas Jogo tem Bot com AI bem inteligente caso queira jogar solo mas o foco do jogo coop Jogar com os amigos treina bastante em equipe pois vai precisar e muito Os bem feitos e as armas bem interessantes Em poucas palavras este jogo um first person shooter mas um horror survival game

It's unique but not very compelling The gameplay gets boring quickly and I usually do like slow methodical stealth games It's just that it gets repetitive Meh
games gud vry tense
GUD
A very difficult game that NEEDS 4 players all communicating Super satisfying when done right and downright horrible when done wrong
I could've sworn I'm not a masochist
i sharted myself more than once playing this
very yes
great game especially with friends The style and atmosphere is amazing the lighting locations and settings are awesome The game is challenging but it's so much fun to attempt a mission with friends because that's what games are made for it's all about teamwork and preparation The only downside is the lack of progression outside of cosmetics If you want to take on a challenge with a friend that resembles the game loop from Left 4 Dead you should definitely try the game

Good Game
One good friend with two bots is infinitely better than 4 supposed friends in a toxic mixture of over-seriousness and self-pompousness
This game almost feels like a movie when it gets intense Each gun feels very unique and is fun to play with The randomization of zombies in every room makes replaying levels after a defeat still engaging Highly suggest playing with at least one friend and talking through game chat
i loved it
Good game You can play this game like strategy
played for an entire day pissed me off deleted it 10/10
fun for a whole squad mic up the crew for these missions

God please i don't wanna die again
A great game with an incredibly dark atmosphere in which you don't have everything laid out as is often the case today Teamwork and a little thought will get you to your goal Stealth planning and when there is no other option firearms are the last resort This is not another wave the bat around brawl you don't buy FIFA if you want to play baseball The ultimate cooperative experience
very fun but you need friends which i don't have use the discord

Not for people who want a game they can play with friends or by themselves it wouldn't be that bad if you could search for matchmaking but you cannot so easy 3/10 because you HAVE to have at least 3 people and I have no friend
I really loved it when the sleeper said you need to gtfo Definitely a game
good
10 10
I'd say this is an alright game Tho I need some friends to make more fun Yes
Played the game over a free weekend First the game is hard If you don't know what you're doing you will lose When playing with randos using matchmaking we didn't get very far Then I tried playing with people from discord and they were too good They went ahead stealthed and killed everything I felt almost useless I hate giving a thumbs down to a game I played for free I feel like I'm punishing the developer for letting us try the game but I did not enjoy it
Terrible title but a good game
GTFO is tears and despair You think it's going well and then the game gives you the middle finger with both hands GTFO is terrific it's magical it's spectacular it's frustration!.it's a kick in the ass and also a feeling of happiness when you've finally completed the map succesfully The game requires a lot of playing skills Stealth team play retreat coordination tactics resource management discipline when making announcements a proper aim this list could go on and on Don't recommend to play if you're an introvert/don't have friends to play it with since you'll most likely have to end up looking for ppl in the official Discord Don't recommend if you're just a casual player since this game does indeed require hardcore gamers Also be prepared you may end up sitting 2 hours in one rundown and above just to get wiped in the end D A game like no other 10/10 and worth every penny THE GAME for masochists The next game I'm gonna put 1k in
this game fun
I think I had three aneurysms attempting R1C1 with my friends 10/10 would suffer brain rot again
Thanks to GTFO I am now mildly paranoid of making any noise whatsoever 10/10
not so great also runs poorly
First things first if you dont have 3 other people to play the game or dont feel like finding 3 others I wouldnt really bother getting the game since with anything short of 3 players the game is extremely difficult to the point where a couple alarmed fights will cripple your team and resources if it doesnt kill you out right To avoid that you just have to stealth but stealth in this game is nothing but crouch walking around and meleeing enemies at the right time Its just really stale and without 3 or more people its almost impossible to stealth every area If you have friends who are dedicated to learning this game and want a hardcore experience go for it if not I cant recommend which sucks because the gun play itself is pretty fun
40 for a barely functional game lmao
If you like cum this is your game
If you want a no mistakes allowed high tension serious business experience where teamwork is a must and you can trust the people you work with get GTFO
get the frick out
DiGGAA 40 Euro das
It's neither challenging nor fun Just a boring crouch walking simulator Well at least it looks decent
I only recommend it if you have 3 other friends to play with who you have fun coordinating with Otherwise its not fun
Work together or die together

Es es estresante pero divertido e inmersivo todo esto se potencia enormemente con amigos La de sobrevivir a una etapa luego de fallar tantas veces es gratificante los escenarios sin luz son los mejores yo WORK TOGETHER OR DIE TOGETHER
Okay it's dark everywhere just a few faint lights but I can do it so what should I do Do not make noise Okay And don't run away Okay wait don't run away What about that tentacle thing Do not touch Okay buddy i got it don't make noise don't run don't touch I'm fine I can do this what could be so difficult right A few hours later Coughing and poisined Sir is there a psychologist I need therapy
the best game for the mass suicide of the whole tima because of the loud sound
OwO
I really want to enjoy this game I love the difficulty of the combat in the horde/swarm scenarios the ammo and resource management mechanics the immersive game environments and sounds and the terminal access building security mechanics However the dormant hostile units feel clunky and are uninteresting to fight after the first couple rundown levels Sneaking through rooms to find keys while smashing the heads of sleeping AI gets tedious quickly The scout unit adds a little bit of variation to that routine but as far into the game as I could maintain interest to play they were the only unit that felt like they really broke the monotony of heavy-swinging a hammer at glowing heads Unit variety similar to left4dead special zombies or trap units like those in back4blood or barnacles in half-life would add greatly to this game's replayability and require players to be more aware of their surroundings and more strategic in their navigation of spaces throughout the map I'm hoping there will be an update to add some variety to the sneaking gameplay and will definitely recommend if that does happen
Um dos melhores jogos para cooperativo e sendo de que vi se
Never have I ever played a game that put the fear of God in me even at 37 hours of gameplay while constantly pulling me in with an addictive aura that's missing from most games these days while also being one of the most beautifully horrifying worlds ever crafted But it's not just meant to be a difficult piece of torture device It's a bonding experience Join the GTFO official discord and you'll never have to rely on Bishop to do stupid sh*t again You'll probably end up making comrades instead I know I did And I'm an introvert Also as my buddy says Don't lewd the scouts
An absolutely brutal experience that keeps you coming back for more punishment time after time and makes you feel like an absolute superstar when you finally crack yet another of its monstrous levels Every mission pushes your teamwork planning and adaptability to the limit We have a reliable three person team who play once a week for three hours and recently cracked a single level after upwards of twenty runs over the space of about six weeks and the buzz from completing the extraction had my hands going numb Phenomenal aesthetic great sci fi horror vibes tremendously meaty gunplay when you're in the thick of a wave of sleepers it's the closest thing to an Aliens tie in game we've ever seen patchy bot AI the number of times the bots have screwed us over but the game is so good I can't even be mad
awesome game with friends my friend gave me this game and we both have been having the best of fun playing for hours upon hours just to beat one level i love how they put in stealth into the gameplay though its all fun and games until someone touches a scout tentacle

Learn to Type games have never been more stressful
I had the game while it was in early access and I must say it has come a long way It is a horrifying experience that you can easily lose track of time on Missions can go anyway you want them to fast and loud slow and quiet prepping each room before gunning hordes down the list goes on I can't tell you how much fun me and my friends have had on this game It is a huge break from the conventional shooters we have nowadays The rundowns have a lot of missions in them and my group has barely made it past the first rundown lol

GTFO is really a totally different coop experience coordinated attack defense and movements is 100 needed Sound carries ammo is a rare resource flashlights are dangerous and it can quickly go from a well played mission to a in a mere second Playing a level is a long haul experience You WILL be spending close to 90mins per mission carefully planning your next moves until the end where every second counts TL;DR great be cautious and take smart/competent people with you Good luck

If I'm not supposed to go in loud why do I have a gun
I screamed so loud while playing this that I woke up my neighbors who promptly called 9/11 i thought that they were ATF agents after my illegal firearms so I opened fire and got into an 11 hour long stand off with them causing several deaths due to randomly placed mines in my yard Now I am in my prison cell typing this out about to face the death penalty due to tax fraud war crimes fraud hate crimes illegal firearms 3 counts of manslaughter 3 counts of first degree murder 8 accounts of second degree murder failure to appear in court fishing without a license and several more crimes over all pretty good game would kill agents of the Antichrist again
A very hardcore first person shooter The Devs definitely don't make it easy on you and that is awesome

It's a nice time to get into GTFO simply for the addition of matchmaking I play with a friend squad myself but really the only thing that was holding back my recommendation was the lack of random multiplayer this feature has been added The entire campaign gets refreshed with brand new missions maps and weapons regularly The melee combat is great and using it in tandem with your squad's situational awareness is needed to stealth through early parts of the areas I WOULD say you should check out some game play to get a grasp on how to survive Limited ammo alarms computer research traps including a variety of turrets coordinated melee stealth kills there is a lot to the game and more to come The developer is constantly rolling out new features as well Recommended
An amazing 4 player co op experience
my friends are all mentally challenged
i pooped my pant
Time to find all the logs again
The games recommended to have a group of friends to play with regularly I love the difficulty of game forcing you to use strategies that may or not work out The games a solid 9/10 keeps you on your toes when you are being quiet IT IS RECOMMENDED TO REMAIN QUIET of course
Stressful and and coordinated effort with friends can make or break friendships
Awesome game recommend to anyone who enjoys teamwork and pve also you can get into lobbys with people from around the world and the servers are usually good
One of the best CO-OP games on the market only problem you NEAD 3 competent friends xd

O jogo parece ser bom comprei anteriormente mas ele parece exigir um grupo formado para poder jogar e infelizmente eu havia pessoas que tivessem o game e/ou estivessem interessados em comprar Caso tenha amigos que possuam o game ele parece bastante interessante mas aparenta ser popular no Brasil e portanto eu recomendo para jogadores solo ou em dupla
One of if not the best co-op horror game you'll ever play Every rundown has 15 hours of content depending on your group's skill level and they've already done 6 rundowns in 2 years I've had many tense moments as well as hilarious moments and there hasn't been any time where I've been frustrated with game mechanics or bugs It's possible that there's been a bug or two but they were so minor I don't even remember them Cannot recommend this game enough it's 100 worth full price if you can get a group to play with
i wish i had friends
Have you ever played a team game with a group of 3-4 people I'm not talking about games like CS:GO Valorant or Zombie Army This game is exactly a team game In this game stealth is highlighted So if you enjoy stealth in games and like to go undetected you'll love it Of course after a while you inevitably engage in combat which is also part of the game There are occasions where you defend a location in certain mission You have to constantly think about your every action stay in constant communication with your teammates and strictly adhere to the plan in every environment you enter Sometimes even the smallest mistake can cost the entire team and there are many details that affect gameplay including ammo management and weapon selection Many enemies in the facility you enter will play an important role in determining your current tactics Among the creatures we have encountered so far are Sleepers scouts and giants For example with the scout if you fail to kill this creature in one go or get caught by one of the gills it emits it starts calling swarms around you and the sleepers in the area you haven't alarmed yet start attacking the area There are many elements that will challenge you like this and you need to stay in communication with your teammates even while firing a single bullet In short if you want to play a serious team game I highly recommend it
Slow burn sneaking until things go south and then action packed thriller for a few minutes until you clear the room or die 10/10 but the bots aren't very smart
GTFO Review Score 7 out of 10 Pros Unique and challenging gameplay Immersive atmosphere Satisfying co-op multiplayer Regular updates with new content Cons Steep learning curve Limited content Repetitive levels Technical issues Overall GTFO is a unique and challenging co-op horror shooter with an immersive atmosphere However it is held back by a steep learning curve limited content repetitive levels and technical issues The game's core gameplay loop is simple you and your team of three other players must explore a dark and dangerous underground complex complete objectives and extract valuable artifacts However the game is very difficult and even small mistakes can be deadly GTFO's atmosphere is one of its strongest points The game is dark and claustrophobic and the sound design is excellent The enemies are also well-designed and terrifying The co-op multiplayer is also very good Communication and teamwork are essential for success and it is very satisfying to work together to overcome the game's challenges The developers have also been very good about adding new content to the game since its release There are now several different expeditions to choose from each with its own unique objectives and enemies However GTFO also has some significant drawbacks The game has a steep learning curve and it can be very frustrating for new players The game also doesn't have a lot of content and the levels can become repetitive after a while Additionally the game has some technical issues such as frame drops and crashes Recommendation GTFO is a good game for fans of challenging co-op horror shooters However it is important to be aware of the game's drawbacks before purchasing it Specifically GTFO's core gameplay loop is simple but the game is very difficult GTFO's atmosphere is one of its strongest points The co-op multiplayer is also very good The developers have been adding new content to the game since its release However GTFO has a steep learning curve limited content repetitive levels and technical issues Overall GTFO is a good game but it is not for everyone

Enemy projectiles are tedious the rest is really fun though Atmospheric and difficult mission based coop shooter

I'll tell you right now this game isn't your typical run gun alien/zombie game If you like a co-op survival horror shooter that's like if Alien Isolation cheated on Metal Gear Solid with Squid Game and had a misshapen lovechild then this is your game Also if you do have some command prompt experience keep that knowledge tucked in the back of your head You'll thank me later Right off the bat the game has a steep learning curve so expect to die a lot But once you get the hang of the basics the planning stages are where it's at The resource boxes items and boosters are randomly generated as well so no experience in the same stage is quite the same You also have full access to the loadout so experiment to your heart's content But of course while one gun has strengths so too does it have weaknesses So plan accordingly I'll be honest though If you don't have the patience for a slow methodical game then this might not be for you There are bunches of runs where I would be hours deep into a rundown nearly complete it then die at the last moment only to restart from the very beginning It's frustrating but it's still fun nonetheless Just that sweet taste of victory after fighting through a hard grueling run feels so good But I do implore you to at least look up some videos of gameplay and see if it's your thing What got me into it was watching Markiplier solo the very first stage in one of the early access rundowns which was probably at GTFO's hardest This vid was I think 2 or 3 years ago But anyway that's my review If you do get it good luck You're gonna need it o7
This game is amazing and in VR it's literally GOD TIER I don't know how some modders made a full motion-controlled 6DoF VR experience for this game that RUNS WELL But they did it Better than half the built-for-VR games out there today tbh
You either play together else die together I am that guy who ruins the team plan by accidentally missing ma spear on sleeper's head XD The game is so dark and you might have to stress your eye too much to play Which sums up to very tactical gameplay

This game is fun and agrivating
follow Gameplay here This game taught me a few things 1 you gotta have friends and use discord to communicate clearly 2 Join the GTFO discord if you don't have any friends and get good with making friends on the internet if you want to stand a chance 3 You will find out how stupid people are on the internet and destroy your faith in humanity because they can't push a few buttons on a keyboard to save their own lives The game itself is polished clearly defined levels to teach you how to approach your objective using the terminals with secret commands you figure out how to proceed do you want to search around for a medikit coz you got 1 moron forever in melee saving bullets but falling over prone every 5 mins or rush the objective because you think 4 turrets with 20 ammo each is enough to GTFO Every move you make in this game is doomed if you don't calculate your chance of success and think twice Its awesome and has about 80 levels now holy cow

Most FPS games are just copy and paste of something else This game is one of the very few FPS that does something different and unique Its a one of a kind horror shooter that relies strongly on cooperation This is an amazing 9/10 for me Id play this more if i had friends
no fun to be had here no action just hide in the dark and whack monsters over the head don't miss tho or you will have to start over
Amazing game that takes a little bit of getting used to Overall I've loved this game even though solo is harder Bots are a godsend that I would not have made it as far as I have without them

1 Scary As F\/CK 2 One of the better Games on Steam 3 Would Recommend 4 Great Game
The game is fun for the first few hours of playing it but once you figure out how to play and the pattern of the stealth it gets boring really fast Every run on every new level feels the exact same Don't even have to think about much once you figure out the pattern The game could be so much better but right now it just ends up getting boring after a few hours Besides playing every mission for the lore there really isn't much to it and the weapon loadouts could also be so much better This is such a bummer
I love the thermal weapons
The game is definitely the best in the genre for this kind of gameplay but it's not for me I don't like how the gunplay feels It's like I'm fighting against lag even though there's no lag if that makes any sense It just feels sluggish and wrong with how the aiming and firing feels Maybe it's just me but I can't get into it
I enjoyed this game a lot more than I thought I would buddy of mine recommended it and now it's my turn 10/10 100 recommend this game if you're a fan of FPS horror or both
Meu Deus do pensa em uma IA burra o bot aliado e literalmente neste jogo alem deles fazerem nada eles te atrapalham se enfiando na sua frente enquanto atira nas merdas dos bichos e eles ficam querendo te curar ou te dar enquanto em um tiroteio com os chupa cu pqp nunca vi uma IA igual a que tem neste jogo

Too scary
easier solo than with 3 liabilities
Spooky
A game made for those who can type properly
As somone who likes a challenge This is finally a shooter game that is not so easy that you can speedrun it in the first try The negative I need friends who aren`t crying about how difficult that game is

Good jame Hard jame Play jame with friends
just make a singleplayer mode so i can play this game without any of my retarted friends
Why the monsters so damn hot
help it dark
The idea of game is amazing if you like hardcore games and COOP games this is a game for you
Be warned You will continually get stuck at security doors having to kick your AI companions to be able to progress Further more the game is just bad I don't say this lightly It is BAD This game has probably the worst game play loop I've ever seen and level design is shockingly poor There is zero rewarding experience for completing a mission You'll maybe get one or two mutagens which are boring and last for one to a few missions before they're gone Maybe a cosmetic apparel item as well that looks pretty much identical to what you are already wearing Given how hard work this game is it's all the more disheartening That's assuming of course you actually manage to complete a mission Which is another gripe I have with it 90 of the difficulty to this game is piss more level design security doors R7C1 Class S FOR EXAMPLE or terrible AI team mates My friend and I have played a good number of missions now and they just plain suck R1 all the way through to R7 There was two missions I found alright Just two There maybe more we didn't play them all but I am so done with this trash
Matchmaking does not work it now works
I have been watching this game for months and talked about it with friends Well I bought it and told my buddies about it and we are now hooked

GTFO um jogo as fases tensas em uma que mesmo se vc jogar de forma inteligente ainda vai sofrer um pouco Ele desafiador mesmo com um grupo de 4 pessoas o que muito bom meio triste que todos os meus amigos que tem o jogo pararam de jogar eu nunca consigo progredir do lvl 3 o do reator que vem uma horda gigantesca
GG
This game shows me how I really love my friends I STARTED TO HATE THEM
Probably my favorite 4-player team game since Left 4 Dead 2 And im only on R1B2 Looking forward to all future updates
GTFO is a dark atmospheric stealth/shooter Still learning but loving every second of it
Esta culero
Hace tiempo no jugaba algo con tanta calidad
shit's dope
It a good game
jogo boas curva de aprendizado mediana a qualidade da partida depende de quem esta na partida no um erro pode acabar com a partida mas depois que todos aprendem como funciona o jogo flui bem mais e sem problemas
Otimo jogo para coringar a mente do vai ta como de pois de uma partida

Awesome game for bros
Muy piola para hacer una pizza con amigos Que tenga mucho oregano
nobody plays this game Aiming is garbage I shot a alien whatever like 6 times with a shotgun it took no damage THis game is dumb
Ready or not but Reactive drop but phasmaphobia but actually Python
Great game b]but please play with friends[/b It's definitely not a solo game I'd give this a mixed rating but there is no option so I'm giving a for the detailed graphics and atmosphere The guns feel satisfying to use when you need to use them hopefully there are alternative methods to dispatch silently rather than having to use melee all the time It's a game that requires actual co-ordination But if you're playing solo I would highly recommend finding a group because without one you will really struggle I'm also glad the developers specified this on their store page instead of letting players find out the hard way

GTFO focuses a lot on stealth and team strategies It is by far one of the harder games I have played This is because the game is designed for 4 players while me and my other 2 friends are playing it as a team of 3 so it becomes even harder Some missions may be almost impossible to beat without a fourth player Not to mention that completing these missions may take hours upon hours of trying Once you figure out how the game works it throws a new thing at you to figure out and make your life harder But that's what makes it interesting You will need to make new strategies and take new weapons because there's no best weapon It's more of a question What is the best weapon for THIS MISSION I absolutely love it and I know I'll get probably 100 hours of gameplay out of this game if not more
Absolute blast pun intended
GUD
why
hard
Thank you BOT Bishop for materializing through the C-Foamed door and dying on the other side during a team scan
sick game
Jogo casual sem muito estresse pra quem quer sair correndo e atirando muito com jogabilidade e extremamente simples
Hardest part of this game is getting 3 other friends who aren't stupid
Wonderful hardcore survivor game with excellently made guns P.S still having PTSD after some missions
Smash next question
Game good

GTFO is an intense first-person shooter game that has been critically acclaimed by players and reviewers The game is set in a mysterious underground overrun by murderous robots and other nightmarish creatures Players have to use their wits and skills to complete the objectives while avoiding gruesome death The graphics and storyline are intense enough to keep gamers thrilled as they try to escape the treacherous world Players must complete objectives as quickly and efficiently as possible while still keeping an eye out for enemy ambushes With an intense soundtrack and fast-paced action GTFO has earned its spot as one of the best FPS games available
GOOD GAME
El mejor juego co-op para jugar trabajo en equipo
Makes you wish you had friends
me ok i'll play the scary game with you you told me enough of what to expect friend yea we'll be fine friend wait i've never seen this before me stress levels rising
Sleepy Sleepers We can be sleepy homies
stressful but so fucking amazing
It's all fun and games until your teammate walks infront of the sniper bullet meant for a scout and the scout alerts the horde
Before I start this review I need to get one thing straight I do not hate this game My problem is the missed potential The marketing will have you believe that this is a no punches pull tactical co-op game It simply is not The fact that all the levels that have ever been released have been beaten solo is evidence against that If you want the true GTFO experience you need to play with 3 other people that have never played the game before And at least for me that is unrealistic without sales This game is 30 Having your group spend a total of 120 on a game that you might not even like is a bit to far fetched for me If you REALLY want to play this game Just play modded And if you have to turn to a modded community for good content I wont recommend the game All of that being said I will not stop playing this game anytime soon The amount friends I have made from this game is amazing Please take notes from this review for purchase decisions and don't waste your money

TLDR Great and challenging stealthy version of the classic Left4Dead2 Horde style game Most likely need friends who are down for a challenge Great Community Discord for help PROS Aesthetically great monster design Lore is there for you to find in a thematic way if you pursue it Gunplay is top tier Challenging rush of adrenaline Lots of missions that all have unique circumstances and challenges to throw at the players CONS Need at least 2 other friends to join for an optimal experience in my opinion community discord is there to help but the popularity of this game isnt too high so getting someone isnt always happening The aesthetic can seem like a bunch of generic assets to some one of my friends had this wrong opinion and I will just mention it Some may find the challenge not fun
Great asses 20/10
Couldve been a good game Way too tedious with repetitive gameplay
The monster goes THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP and then you go CRUNCH and it dies

This game challenges you and your team hardest ways possible You really need to think as a team how do handle situations or you WILL go down Scouts are disgusting
good
spooky
It's a good game but it can be even better if this game had VR support think of how scary it could be but it's still a good game without it
This is one of my favorite games just something to therapeutic about screaming at your friends because they turn off their fucking flashlight
fun
good shi
Love this game it's a shame that I don't have a dedicated team to play with me
Lois.Lois I'm gay
Good game but i hate bots
I've bought and refunded this shittingly difficult game twice I REALLY want to like it but i usually play solo or with one other friend and the game has no scaling at all The bots I've heard are useless so that sucks as well It really should scale with player counts as that would help a lot with the general playability
Game is super challenging like the comments say but it's well worth the playthrough Super fun game 10/10 can't wait to see what else they do with it in the future
Awesome 4 player game if you got a good crew It isn't perfect but damn it is fun Updated This game is a true test of solid team play with a hint of jank I love it dearly and I highly recommend checking out the mod scene for this game on thunderstore so much great stuff there
Fun But I need friends
Quiet yelling followed by Oh shit to incoherent screaming ending in blaming each other Rinse and repeat Great game
Great game Hard and unforgiving Need 3-4 players to play properly
Game is incredible love every second Except when our flashlights are fu**ing buggy One has theirs off and the other sees theirs on Also don't drop your cores on piles of rubble you'll never be able to pick them back up Why is this game so buggy 7.95/10
I hate my friends
Great game
Honestly really fun The real problem that really effects me is the lack of friends with the game Playing with the AIs is horrible
Make sure you have friends before you play this impossible alone
i would recommend playing only if your very masochistic and have friends who arent retards
I get yelled at a lot but I know it's out of love Cool game for sure
yer
Good Game Very Scary
Gute Team bildende
The only game where you try not to kill your teammates because they absolutely suck
super easy game
I love everything about this game Even the infuriating randoms Better with friends interesting lore 10/10
u
This game is quite enjoyable and hilarious if you're in for a roller coaster of emotions especially when you have some retarded friends or when you're the retarded one If you want to have a good laugh of stupidity with the homies when the chaos ensues then this game is definitely for you Or if you want to be competitive with your friends as I said you're in for a wild ride could be the most miserable experience you've ever had
Good coop Game Unlike Payday 3
most fun game i hope they would add more content and that we could make custom guns and gear
The game is good but the issue is no player base i mean i just checked the players and it is only 300 so if i want to play match making i think it will take along time Unless u have friends willing to play the game with you i hope the player base go up otherwise it will be difficult to play it without your friends
E1
All in all a decent horror survival game made especially more fun when grouped up with some friends Gameplay is pretty difficult at least it was for the four of us If you get motion sickness from media I would not recommend this game even with changes to all sorts of graphics settings to minimalize the effect I could still only play for about an hour at a time before getting too nauseous to continue
get the flizzy off
Fun team based game really tests your cooperation and communication skills There's lots of fun weapons and gadgets to use for a customizable experience Very difficult though I rarely win but since i'm a glutton for punishment that makes it better
yes
yes
the burst cannon makes me orgasm
Amazing game Hard if you dumb
Hell of a game this needs more hype
Really cool atmosphere challenging game play and it doesn't get boring
oh boo hoo my video game that i bought for the explicit intent of finding a difficult and challenging game actually turned out to be difficult but not unfair
My review of this game DAUDA YOU FUCKING IDIOT/10
I need VR in that game
h1]Mother Darkest Corners Yo![/h1 Aight so I jumped into GTFO expecting some run-of-the-mill horror action But man as I descended deeper it felt like I was diving into the heart of Russia itself facing its rawest realities Ain't just monsters down there it's like battling life on them tough Russian streets Every dark corridor every violent naked monster coming at me hungrily felt like tales I heard bout life in Russia's underground The real man and it's cold as hell But here's where it gets wild amidst the shadows this unsettling sexual excitement Like these creatures ain't just after your life they're thirsting for more Man I was prepped for some scares but expecting this kind of adult terror The Russian depths are hiding more than just vodka and secrets there's raw erotic energy lurking in the shadows Makes you wonder about them cold Russian nights and what really goes down when the lights go out So if you think ready for a trip through Russia's raw sensual and terrifying underbelly give GTFO a spin But if you ain't ready to face the erotic horrors waiting in the dark might wanna rethink that descent Keep ya head up and always remember Mother Russia doesn't play Peace
Nice This game is great but I don't recommend it unless you like torture

Instead of writing about any of the things that most people have already mentioned in other reviews I'm going to go ahead and try to pitch the idea that this game is a really good crossover for anyone who enjoys competitive online shooters who want to try a co-operative PvE game Having good aim is really important and the gun mechanics feel similar to how they do in Source engine and Unreal engine games like CS or Titanfall I play on low sensitivity and it is truly a blast The guns feel very satisfying and having good accuracy is all the more important since one of the last things you want to do in this game is waste ammo So yeah I highly recommend this game Give it a try
Great to play with friends
Softly softly the dogs are loose
Amazing game Anyone who likes strategy horror and team work would love this game The game also can have some very fun laughs too I play with my 3 brothers
gewd yes mmmmmm
Unforgivingly hard and with levels that stretch into 2 hours this game can be a test of patience and skill But it's less grindy than Dark Souls and is dripping with frightening isolating atmosphere This is what Dead Space must feel like to anyone who isn't Isaac Clarke
L4D2 in steroides
Absolutely love this game It is challenging teamwork is a must the environment is dark and foreboding definitely adding to the tension Definitely fun to play with friends but with bots it is still manageable on some levels to run solo as well Definitely recommend the game if you are looking for a challenge and if you are okay with dying a lot because even the best executed plans can go awry very fast Take the plunge into the complex and become a prisoner

I think the hardest part about this game was swallowing not pride but that concern about using discord and meeting people and putting trust into strangers to be able to perform on these really difficult scenarios but it's so much fun and while I haven't recalled who I used to play with I believe the beauty of this game is it forces the anti-social to behave actually pull themselves to work with people they don't know to share emotions and irrelevant stories make small talk laugh pout in dissapointment over loss the Human Experience of picking yourself back up and going at it again and winning Otherwise you never see those types and what you see instead is regulars who really enjoy this game I think GTFO hints at the future of gaming I think we all really revelled in this world of being distanced and non-talkative after 2014 or so the gaming frontface became moba games where no one talks and everyone flames the lacking identity facilitated flame and grief and then there's games like this that ask you to implement your Discord and ordain that you use voice chat or you'll never make it and I think GTFO is this excellent form of turning cogs in your head that may otherwise collect cobwebs if you're used to a world of no one listening because this game is either one listens and wins or they don't and die and no one queues up with people who don't talk off the initial so I feel that this was an ingenius form of perhaps not anti-cheat but definitely anti-grief you vet who you're playing with if they don't talk they get kicked if they do talk and are mean bratty or rude they are kicked and it all self-moderates itself Biggest hurdle is utilizing the manual matchmaking system through the Discord channel but once that leap of faith is done the game plays well never crashes and there's a community with their own favorite missions I really enjoy the darkness and the gun sounds/fx/visuals in this game 8/10 it sat in my library for two years collecting dust because of those matchmaking hurdles brushed it off learned the Discord technicals got in a match finally played it loved it wrote this review for it Only thing that rubs me wrong is when people are so good at the game that they're just sherpa'ing people around to no gain unimmersed and making irrelevant talk about life/politics really nerdy-like instead of immersing themselves into the game and verbalizing as they see stimulus instead of holding a conversation about the strengths and weaknesses of Doritos vs Pringles while hard-carrying 3 people around the map but that only happened one time and I doubt that something like that will happen again Losing a game hits kinda hard in this videogame but winning has it's intensity and the triumph has its own unique feeling Deep Rock Galactics younger but more mature brother named Chad that skipped leg days at the gym but still gets the girls despite skipping leg day because of all the work he put in to upper body
potato happy when potato play this game potato realize that other potatoes friends are not so bright
good purchase
Really fun game to play in a stack of 4.Will take away your sanity,have fun
ye
GAME FUN
This game would be so phenomenal if ONLY the melee grunts got an actual melee As is the game is incredibly challenging with the deepest missions proving to be impossible without extreme skill luck and circumstance on your side with a team of 4 experienced players The enemy types are diverse and engaging with the exception of the melee units There are explicitly ranged enemy types that are balanced and manageable however the units intended to physically hit you instead get a mid range longer than your short range melee homing tongue attack that is difficult to dodge if not outright impossible This game would be a great survival exploration horde shooter if only the horde was tolerable You will find yourself getting killed due to the homing mid ranged attacks sweeping around corners and them scurrying around in the darkness outside of melee reach The melee giants as well have an even longer range even higher damage melee homing attack that can easily bring you down with their actual melee attacks being even more lethal The game doesn't have a difficulty system and instead opts for the deeper you go the harder it gets Meaning from the jump everything will feel extremely strong and difficult I would highly recommend this game given certain conditions Have at LEAST one friend to play with recommended to have more Be willing to redo the same mission repeatedly sometimes to a frustrating degree Be willing to find teammates to play with most likely thru their discord server Be extremely patient and cautious Willingness to commit 40 minutes to certain runs This game is a very atmospheric and beautiful game that has a unique game play loop it has a very intriguing story which is tied to each mission meaning some story parts will be out of reach and super fun and engaging weapon and melee mechanics and systems The aesthetic UI and feel of the game is top notch A constant and consistent stream of new content to enjoy Given the correct balancing and tuning a super reliable and consistent game to enjoy AS IS:PLEASE PLAY BELOW 2 HOURS TO REFUND IF UNHAPPY there is a very significant risk that that may be the case and 2 hours should be enough to get a very rough feel of how the game feels even at later stages
good

Friends are absolutely required Friends plural a 3-man team will work fine but 4 is better However if you're fine with randoms there is a discord just not many people want to do the first mission Team-gathering issues aside this game looks good feels good and has me hooked The weapons can feel powerful but don't have as much impact as someone coming from Siege might want but it's manageable and they still feel robust Aside from that it's decision-making plan-crafting and execution with high risk and high emotional reward Good for those who like a challenge
Great and difficult game to play with friends if you are one for co-op shooters that are very reliant on proper team-work this is a fantastic title for you
Avis rapide Bon fps en coop horreur Pas fait pour tout le monde car asser exigent 15/20 Avis moins rapide EN GROS un jeu fun avec des amis tant qu'ils ne partent pas par peur de la et le temps que demande une partie Le jeu va recevoir ses mises jours Donc profitez du jeu finit et dans sa meilleure forme Il y une bonne centaine d'heures de jeu si vous y accrochez Sans compter la partie mod qui est vraiment bien pour la si les devs sont contre Je sais toujours pas pourquoi fin triste Le fonctionnement du jeu est simple Il y a des grosses mises jours qui apportent des Rundowns Il y en a 7 actuellement avec une dizaine de missions dans chacune Armes/Equipement changent peu pour chaque rundown Ils faut le ou les objectifs pour finir une mission Munitions et vie basse seront vite une habitude pour il y a des ressources dans des casiers et des ou non pas des cadenas voir des de Eeeet les monstres Mais ce n'est pas comme si ils veulent vous tu Aaaah siii ducoup Le jeu se base sur un de Zone avec des portes par des alarmes qui devront puis avec une/des de scans Il faut rentrer des les gros cercles rouges et attendre va pas besoin Mr Robot et se des vagues de monstres Bien ce n'est pas tout mais vous la joie de ce qu'il vous attend Attention le jeu n'est plus jouer par grand monde et il faut donc essayer de trouver des personnes sur un discord ou autre Il reste de temps en temps des gens qui ont le jeu pour aider mais devient rare Graphisme 16.5/20 C bo Optimisation 13.5/20 Avec une RTX 2060 et un assez bon I5 je les 60 fps mais ce n'est malheureusement pas rare d'avoir moins dans des gros combats tout le monde tire sur de monstre qui arrive Lore 15/20 Des textes et vocaux dans des terminaux Et d'autre petites Rundown 4 Mission B1 par exemple on raconte que des bruits de tuyaux peuvent entendu Gameplay Soit discret et sinon tu es mort Pas plus Ambiance 17/20 les 500h devient toujours dedans par le manque environnement car on semble tout les maps/monstres pour changer un peu Ps Les environnements bien plus avec les derniers rundowns Quelques bugs qu'on remarque uniquement bien trop d'heures sur ce jeu Pour le moment une boite de ressource par un mur invisible sur une map en particulier Et si vous pas de la partie La vitesse d'attaque des monstres plus rapide et pour les monstres au corps corps ils ont tendances rentrer dans les murs et donc impossible de tirer dessus Tu peux mais le murs n'a pas de point de vie malheureusement tant qu'ils n'ont pas fini l'animation Mais sinon va Un jeu rare en son genre loin parfait mais si unique qu'il en vaut la peine

Good game difficult but good combat in-depth level design nice visuals and graphics Why do some of the monsters have a gyat damn bakery though Devs please add monster sex to the game otherwise 8/10
Se gosta de jogo de tiro esse jogo tem tiro da duar bala ja fica sem chatinho chatinho se quiser aprender um jogo dificil perde tempo com outro game
I want to preface this with the fact none of the reason I do not like the game is a fundamental issue with it it's just design choices that a different audience might like though I do suspect that audience is very small This game is requires long stretches of dedicated concentration time investment that can and will be made meaningless dozens of times because it is just that punishing It is extremely unfair and is intentionally so it is not lying to do you about that fact but personally I think it suffers from hostile DM syndrome a bit too much in that it often feels like the game is trying to cheese you The atmosphere is set so well and there are so many unique traits to this game that give it this charm that makes me want to enjoy it but the truth of the matter is that I just don't find it fun or a good use of my time As a regular person with a 9-5 I just cannot justify using my time on this game when it is very deliberately trying to throw it in the garbage even as a person who generally seeks challenge in games
Wow where do I even start with GetTheFuckOut This game is an absolute adrenaline rush from start to finish The moment you step into its dark underground world you're hit with this intense atmosphere that just sucks you in Visually it's a masterpiece The underground tunnels and the horrifying monster designs are so well done that they give you the creeps Every step you take you're on edge and that's what makes it so thrilling But the real magic is in the teamwork You're not just playing with your buddies you're surviving with them Planning tactics sharing resources and watching each other's backs become second nature It's like being in a high-stakes action movie and you're the star The difficulty level is no joke and that's what I love about it Every mission feels like a massive challenge that pushes your team to the limit And when you finally overcome those challenges the feeling of accomplishment is unmatched In a nutshell is a heart-pounding experience that seamlessly blends horror teamwork and challenge If you're into co-op shooters and you're up for a real test of your skills give a shot It's a wild ride you won't want to miss.:gtfohammer

h1]An Intense Co-Op Experience[/h1 Making this review for people who don't know what the game is all about but heard that it's a hard game For people who don't know what this game is about it basically is an inherently cooperative-heavy strategic stealth shooter game with a huge focus on using any means to complete the tasks Note that I emphasize the word strategic and stealth because while you definitely must shoot a sh*tload to survive the horde the focus is more on the strategic side and proper communication with your teammates than anything else Most of the time you're preparing your gear/guns/boosters gathering information via terminals setting up mines/sentry guns planning your return route managing resources and stealthily bashing sleepers head And oh boy you will have to play stealth 90 of the time for sure if you want to maintain your survival rate All of which wouldn't matter if you didn't properly communicate with your team and trust them with your life h2]Control Tug-of-War[/h2 Usually there are two phases You either fight to gain control of a room or you desperately try to plan a way to gain control of another room It's a dynamic where you don't need to exhaust yourself with adrenaline rush from start to finish but you now have anxiety that won't g away until you complete the entire mission The game knows and basically makes the missions either 30 minutes long or 1.5 hours long no in-between exaggeration but you get the gist You will get sucked right in and have no way out until you gain all the control you need for the mission then you just need to GTFO of that level h2]Enemy Noises Ally[/h2 Admittedly apart from some missions you're generally living in the darkness Being stealthy is a good idea since your ammo is very limited So you need to use melee weapons instead The dynamics of the weapons are nice and all that but to take hits you need to be careful with your steps Utilize their heartbeat and squishy noises to detect their activities because if they detect your presence you need to blast your irons Fast h2]Risk Reward[/h2 What if you don't want to stealth What about going around shooting everything down and showing them who's the boss Well sit down tough guy This game doesn't care about you No matter how risky or safe your playthrough is if you or your teammates screw up everything's over You could have spent your entire afternoon on a single mission but if you get horded unprepared your progress becomes null That's why in my opinion this game is hard apart from tedious hacking and troublesome enemy types as the high risk can ruin your sanity real fast and failing rewards you with a nuh-uh h2]Game Recommended with a h2 All in all it's a very nice experience where you're thrown into whatever hellhole you signed up for and bet your life on the line with your plan and strategy If you are a masochist like me and friends who convinced me into buying this game you will love it b]*BUT ONLY IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE TO CO-OP WITH*[/b as this aspect is extremely crucial to actually passing a mission with consistency If you have no friends go to the Discord server and find yourself mates to jump in and suffer together with you I guarantee the pain suffering and fun will keep you going no matter how hard the game is I give it a mild 7.5/10 based on my current feeling
This has barely any content and the content that is there is lackluster and boring Go play Deep rock Galactic or smth

Definitely one of my favorite shooters It's quite impressive how engaging and scary the missions can be considering how simple your objectives can be Some of the missions end up being fetch quests yet the devs manage to make even those basic searches engaging and terrifying Don't get me wrong though there are plenty of types of missions and each have their highlights The stealth is great the gun mechanics are super clean and fun to use It's just a great game You do need friends however to get the full experience
Playing solo Ehh Playing with a group of friends We felt like we won some sort of world cup championship after completing R1A1 only
If you have 2-3 deranged friends who love retrying the same stage over and over again this is your game While designed for 4 players 3p 1 bot is not a bad set up so far that I've played

best game ive played in a while 10/10
Punishing almost to the point of absurdity at times like not even starting missions with full resources/ammo but reasonably entertaining They've gotten way less strict with recent updates on what missions you're allowed to play which salves one of my biggest sore spots All in all now it's a pretty decent hybrid of tactical/horde shooter genres with some fun stealth elements mixed in that see you and your team methodically clearing rooms as quietly and carefully as possible between unavoidable horde rushes The implied story and setting raise some interesting questions but the whole thing is conveyed very disjointedly and never really gives any feeling of questions being answered or a story progressing and I've ended up without a lot of confidence there really is any deeper story hiding under the ambiguity But still if you don't mind some big swings between slow methodical pacing and frantic gun battles and a deliberately high difficulty level I think it's all right
This game has the coolest atmosphere there is Really cool gunplay and gun design awesome levels and a constant sense of dread And as an awesome bonus it somehow only uses like 16 gigs of storage Git game and git gud
GTFO Get The Fuxk Out NO Go Together Fuxking Order YES
Good game
This game reminds me that I have no one to play with Great game
had my john wick moment with revolver so yeah
It's marketed as a shooting game but you'll spend the majority of your time crouch walking and bonking things with your melee weapon in order to not wake up the enemies You don't get enough ammo to really play it any other way

It's Payday peppered with The Last of Us wrapped in a gluten-free horror dough and a Rainbow 6 drizzle The waiter took my teeth If only I could convince 3 friends to gummy it down with me
I now have severe jump scare problems and hypertension
Excellent game and great community You can join their discord and you will never have a problem finding people to play with

Game can genuinely be terrifying but is also insanely fun and very challenging 10/10 would buy for yourself and a friend though make sure you have 3 friends you need coordination The discord also has really nice folk so you can find teammates there if you don't want to use AI
Wanna play 7 hours straight just to lose over and over and over again while openly blaming your friends for fucking up Yes Then this game is perfect for you I love this game Truly The only game I enjoy grinding continuously while losing Shut your noise
Boring and no progression played for 2 hours with nothing to show for and no reason to keep on playing
I went in a mission with a friend and 2 bots The bot got stuck on a crate and we never managed to get the bioscan done 30 Minutes of playtime and we lost because of a stuck bot while an unending wave of enemies ripped us to shreds until we had no more ammo This stuff happens since EA release Is ist so hard to make it possible to finish the bioscans without everybody of the team inside Just make it slower or cause the scans etc to ignore the bots It is that easy and the devs are just not doing it because why it is just unnecessary and stupid
GTFO a great game which unfortunately has a hefty price tag and requires your friends to play Playing solo is not the greatest idea there's little player scaling so you'll be expected to fight of the horde of creatures meant for a 4 man squad all on your own Sure there's bots but they're not the sharpest tools in the shed This game is insanely hardcore A single mistake in a plan or alerted monster could be the end of your run Quick thinking and a competent team is essential to play Gunplay is slightly above average The crosshairs are pretty unreliable and ammo is sparse but shoot well and you might just make it There's a rotating selection of weapons for each rundown so you wont get bored with the same gun Personally that price tag isn't worth it if you plan on playing alone If you plan on going with a squad of friends make sure you guys are all certain you really want to play That one guy who doesn't want to play could be the deciding factor on if you escape or not Or if you're the patient type wait for a sale
UI makes me act unwise in this game
took us 3 hours to finish ONE level do not play with ADHD people no good
game is good
I've spent many many hours on multiple co-op horde shooters And I mean fucking many This one absolutely takes the cake for utilizing actual COOPERATION in said horde shooter It is so difficult in fact that if you don't have an actual set of people to play it with you'll most likely than not absolutely get your shit fucking wrecked Now this is not to say that solo isn't possible the easier levels are indeed solo-playable some can be better with bots some can be outright done without them Depends on the skill level of the player I absolutely love everything there is to the mechanics and strategy to this game seriously it'll be too much to put into words but expect Gun prioritization Tool utilizing Classifying which player is going to do which to help the team Enemy prioritization and the effective dispatching of them Resource rationing Proper map knowledge ACTUAL TERMINAL USAGE like the shit you use on your computer yeah get familiar with it or specialize a player in your team to be the engineer And of course patience whether it be stealth or when things get loud and hairy Trust me it may be a stealth game but it is no short of loud-oriented missions And you WILL fuck up whenever it comes to stealth it is only natural and you HAVE to convince yourself that it is part of the process Not to mention the aesthetics of this game go unbelievably hard It scratches an itch that no other game has and I would absolutely stare at everything GTFO related for hours if I could This game just feels so uniquely itself so GTFO and well grimy as Bricky so well put it you'll get what I mean when you play it High recommendation would enjoy it way more if it was better optimized too I play this at like an average of 13 frames lmao but that doesn't stop me cause I just love this game so much And it has modding on thunderstore go wild
Die Entwickler stecken viel Liebe ins Spiel Die ist einfach nur episch viele Details wurden Das Spiel ist sehr fordernd was den Reiz ausmacht Schwierigkeitsgrad und Gegner sind sehr knackig und schwer Das Spielprinzip fordert einen dazu auf sich stetig zu verbessern Konzentration taktisches Vorgehen und vor allem Teamarbeit sind ein MUSS in diesem Spiel Das Spiel braucht auf jeden Fall mehr aktive Spieler
Absolutely horrifying multiplayer shooter This game is hard but a lot of fun to play
Very nice game

good game
Great team based game with plenty of strategy and horror
ngl i always let my teammates do the stealth killing im to big of a scaredy cat edit after a lot more hours in the game alright so the game is like left 4 dead 2 except you only get so much ammo and there is way to many enemies you gotta stealth trough a lot of levels with occasional twists or required shoot sections its pretty fun until you get to the point of the game where you have to play perfectly or otherwise risk restarting hours of progress did you wake up a room and used to much ammo good luck on the next section you might as well restart the mission but missions can take multiple hours and especially high level can take up to 3 hours if not more i like this game a lot it has amazing art amazing gun play but i cannot in good conscience recommend this to everyone the learning curve is just to steep and the game play is not forgiving oh and by the way a FULL SQUAD is not optional its a requirement for playing this game at least there is a official discord to help you out with that
immortality is a thing
fun
its day 576 and i havent found not retarded friends to play this with but i am also a retard so i guess it works out good game you just get your dick ripped off over every minor fuck up
good game

great game with friends but the match making is ass and almost requires you to use the community discord or organise it externally with friends
Like payday 2 but you dont get paid Also all DLCs are free which is nice
I now hate every single one of my retarded friends
the monster
Game is hard definitely built to be played in a full squad and unforgiving otherwise but with some luck and a lot of stealth you can make it work I have a lot of love for this formula for the team who brought it to life Good job fellas
Peu d'explication au mais tout fini par venir quand on veut apprendre Le jeu 4 est vraiment jouer pour la Les missions sont et offre des Quelques bug notables cependant comme les caisses contre un mur que l'on ne peut pas ouvrir et quelques rares bug visuel avoir une porte Sinon dans la le jeu est bien et immersif Je le recommande vivement si vous aimez la plusieurs alliant bourrinage et fuite

certified hood classic 10/10
really fun and easy
Great game with friends and only with friends
fun but very hard game
That lone wolf stuff stays behind quote taken quite literally GTFO is a game where you and 3 others explore a facility deep underground to complete tasks handed to you by The Warden You go in with not much a Main Special Tool and Melee During your Rundown missions you must scavenge Resources Query your objectives and plan for any cases of failure should that happen There is no difficulty slider each Rundown just takes significantly longer and less linear the higher the Rundown is and resources are in places you might not want to go into Each Rundown Zone has their own distinct designs from open to claustrophobic to foggy to pitch black The recommended way to play is to grab 3 other buddies and carefully maneuver the objectives given to you but Bots also have their advantages and disadvantages so if you're missing 1 or 2 others they can fill in I do not recommend you solo-ing this game trust me Bots love Med-Kits more than Ammo
ooga booga scriggly butt aliens
amazing game with no other like it on the market
They're just silly goofy little guys even the large guys that bring only terror and suffering TENTACLES
ok
this game is the right amount of anxiety inducing and it's very fun and interesting if you aren't careful though this can ruin friendships or cause a lot of people to ragequit play it safe and patiently
Insanely satisfying to finish missions but you will tear your hair out along the way If you literally step on the wrong piece of gravel they will hear you and if you shit yourself because there is one right next to you they will smell it You are fucked either way
if you have friends it is the best horror co-op game y'all can paly
I bought this game thinking I would meet new friends and enjoy a hard game Turns out you have to already have friends at the time of purchase WTB Friends 20:platinum
heheh shotgun go BLAJBFIKHJEDRBWSRTKJOAERJGIKJ
I suck at this game but I love it If you want them to move around less like crack demons crank up your FOV Turns out I was playing at like 55 FOV and that's why I couldn't ever hit any of these things

CHE LOO LOOK CHE CHECK LOOK AT DE MAP CHECK DE MAP
Game has so many classic vibes Warhammer Dead Space Aliens The Thing Game does more with 13 gigs than Baldur's Gate 3 does with 150 I can not express enough how happy it makes me to have good bots that are programmed well and the ability to issue commands and change their gear to play with in Co-Op that are not made to intentionally suck and sabotage you because the devs want to force you into matchmaking with randoms As a Aliens Fireteam Elite and World War Z vet thank you for finally understanding Game has way more immersion and atmosphere than so many AAA titles Including Baldur's Gate 3 I can see why they decided not to add female characters to the game and I can accept that I would love if they did add females but perhaps this is for the best to avoid Certain issues Behaviour by certain people over certain things honestly makes me feel disgusted And best of all It's not woke or pushing political agendas A rarer and rarer thing these days
hueta ebenaya
Prinzipiell Gutes Game aber noch einiges gemacht
when on sale get it with friends
Very enjoyable often unforgiving game Great for those not afraid to fail in a PvE game where you can analyze what went wrong and choose a different equipment loadout or approach for next time Team-based element means there is a place for different types of play styles to flourish
👍👍👍
super fun it is brutal but thats why i like it
Needs patience and teamwork to finish the maps
11/10
GOOD
banger game hand and punishing but its still fun
if u play this game for 30 min then its like u played th whole game its bland just my opinion all th guns feel meh levels i saw all look the same enemies only slightly dif matchmaking is WAY too complex cant connect unless u use discord bc nobody runs the vanilla mm good concept just not engaging how do i know well if i like a game its easy to pour hours and days into it ESPECIALLY when i first get it played this long enough to learn how to play and was instantly ready to go back to other games requesting refund if u have a bunch of friends who actively play this it MIGHT be fun otherwise no thank uuuuuuuu
Love this game absolutely amazing would be better if my friends ever loved me
Good
Very fun but would recommend getting friends
Really cool game but i'm bad at it
cant wait for sex update
Really cool game but i'm bad at it
On Sheesh its a great game
Meh Too much poison fog
One of my favorite games of all time I could survive solely on the pure unfiltered chaos that happens in this game
La caja de la llave estaba al reves
Played this for years My biggest gripe that usually ruins the night is honestly solely the infected fog Difficulty of enemies the challenges of the maps scouts barnacles Whatever they're called all fine scary and thrilling to combat and overcome The challenge modes add replayability and me and my friends loved trying them out and doing the super hard ones we will always remember the immense chaos we had during our first OVERLOAD level But it's just that infected fog that just ends our sessions too early too often No issues with regular fog it makes the game challenging as you can't see the enemy making you play slow and meticulous However when you take damage every nanosecond you're in the poison fog it ruins any plans to consolidate your resources you've been saving for the potentially worse engagements you will have deeper in the facility and thats a big issue when ammo medical and tool packs are rare to start When this gimmick is literally constant for most of the rest of the rundowns then the success of your session might all come down to RNG based on how many fog repellers the lockers and crates contain before you take your first dive Hope infected fog becomes less of a cheap Obstacle gimmick to be seen in rundown 8
Awesomely terrifying and difficult game I wish people would play it with me more
Fun for the first few hours but quickly grows stale and repetitive There is not semblance of story to this game made obvious during gameplay You don't feel compelled to explore as the level design is dull and objectives are as repetitive as the levels are The AI squadmates are some of the most laughable I've seen Enemies constantly get themselves stuck on an object and have little to no brain when it comes to combating the player There are maybe 6 variations in total Give or take a couple This would be a neat concept for a game if it had effort put into it instead of an odd choice to generate maps using shotty A.I which I guess was used to stretch out the repetitive gameplay loop so players feel like there is some substance here Overall this game is not worth it's current price tag may be a good deal for twenty dollars
GTFO est un jeu bien particulier qui s'adresse un public particulier C'est un jeu qui se montre exigeant sachez que la plupart des missions n'offrent pas de checkpoint ce qui signifie que si vous perdez vous bons pour recommencer le niveau depuis le ce qui peut long un niveau se environ entre 1 et 2h Le combat est difficile il y a certains moments ou vous devrez affronter des vagues d'ennemis et le combat sera les munitions et les packs de soins rares vous devrez faire en sorte de ne pas gaspiller vos ressources La est un point du jeu le vous pourrez choisir des armes et outils qui pourront se pour pouvoir faire face tout tout en pouvant jouer avec votre style Vous devrez vous coordonner avec vos pour des cibles sous peine de tout le monde dans la salle Le jeu n'est pas pour seul assurez vous d'avoir au moins un ami avec qui jouer sinon les bots bien qu'efficaces ne vous feront pas profiter pleinement de que propose ce jeu Le horrifique marche bien vous vous retrouverez marcher dans le noir et devoir vous guider au bruit pour localiser les monstres ou qu'il ne vous trouvent Alors Si vous aimez les jeux difficiles Que vous pas facilement de devoir recommencer encore et encore la mission Et que vous avez des amis avec qui jouer Alors foncez
Good game
Hardest part of the game is finding 3 people with the will power to play
Not for the weak
3 hours just to die at extract 10/10 would waste my time again
Abandon Bishop instantly he has death wish
This game is very nuh uh and i hate it and it makes me want to kms after playing for 5 minutes 10/10
more friendships lost than a game of monopoly
El juego es bueno y desafiante El unico problema es que a mi squad le dan miedo los juegos sin

great game epic game-play i would diffidently recommend to my friend only down side is the matchmaking
Brilliant game
Would you recommend this game to other players yes because I need a 4 stack to beat the damn reactor missions
please be quiet
As my dear friend once said drink some OJ
GG
SUPER FUN
Sometimes its about the friends you make along the way
Team work is everything in this game Pretty fun but very punishing Is a hard game but worth it if you have a 4 man squad
not bad at all
waiting for your friends to buy this game simulator

One the best Co-op experiences out there best played with friends who you can coordinate and piss off by shooting your gun and locking them in an infested room
When I had to go back to the OG's since the failure day 1 with starbreeze's Payday 3
yes
Imagine being imprisoned in a narrow hydrostasis chamber for years with having all of your memories wiped off and the only time you are allowed to be free from the chamber is when you are thrown into an abandoned underground lab full of bloodthirsty monsters hundreds of meters below the surface to perform deadly tasks You must fight for your life yet you don't know who you were and what you did in the life Now you have no choice but to cooperate with 3 other men in the same fate to avoid being torn apart by the monsters 4 humans are still vulnerable against countless killer freaks but not as suicidal as trying to do everything alone That is what GTFO is about I highly admire how well the game is made because it's unique concept is perfectly executed into it's players unique experience thanks to the professional development by the devs who knew what they were making for gamers GTFO never requires you to pay additional money or perform endless grinding for having what is shown in the trailers and the store page Only the pure dark and unique horror gameplay is what the game throws at our face This identity of GTFO is extremely contrasting to how mainstream FPS games like Call of Duty or Apex Legends ect have been where their entire point of existence is for milking as much money as possible from it's players instead of trying to be a game that any player would call it a masterpiece I deeply appreciate the game for insisting on being what it has been and what it will be Work Together or Die Together
refreshing gameplay esp when it comes to FPS you will however spend two hours on a mission if you can stand your mates that long
Actual proper strategic horde shooter Best with buddies and the bots AI is actually good for the most part Cosmetic options are unlocked through levels in rundowns no microtransactions Be prepared for hour long levels even longer perhaps but worth every cent
Hard af but super fun if you take your time Good AI and cool guns Quality game
I definitely have not played as much as I should have but this one of the coolest intense co-op experiences you can have with your friends A setting that always manages to be scary even with friends The combat is always makes you feel like your fighting tooth a nail for survival ever bullet counts Its a good time Check it out
Get some friends to play this You wont regret it
Infelizmente possui matchmaking muito dificil solo duo fazendo a dos players logo em seu inicio possui uma atmosfera e gameplay muito interessantes para quem puder jogar com squad fechado provavelmente vai ter bastante

Consider the friends you play with very carefully

They said it wouldn't work but it does GTFO is a fun game to play by yourself or with friends if you have a weak computer like me it is a bit harder to play because i can really only sit around ten FPS and if get into fights it lowers so make sure that you are still able to contribute somehow
Le jeux est injouable a deux si tu n'est pas un pro les bots avec qui tu joue sont bugger h24 tu prend des balles ils te volent des ammo tes heal ils bug sur les objectif de groupe donc t'es stuck et tu tourne en rond le jeu a un potentiel de fou mais il est programmer avec le cul clairement je l'ai desinstaller et j'y rejouerais dans quatre ans Une dinguerie que en 2023 on continue d'avoir des bug ou c'est ULTRA facile patch mais non faut rajouter du contenue et pas stabiliser le jeu GL pour les autres joueurs
SSSHH SLEEPERS dont make a sound
Games that no one plays
Absolutely terrifying and challenging as hell It's made specifically to be played by a group but allows you to challenge yourself by choosing not to It's very well made and the fact it's always changing is one of my favorite things

Wasnt fun no ammo
wish it wasnt as hard as my C&B but still fun
Game good UI is bad Like give you a headache bad
Great game loads of fun a more immersive environment then Deep Rock Galactic with the same concept for game Would buy again if for some reason I lost this copy 10/10 no longer lost in the darkness of my own mind
very hard like me
i hate this game so much
Fantastic horror-shooter with elements of payday and left for dead Would definitely recommend if you like horror-shooters or objective-shooters
amazing game but the bots in the game are lacking and its almost impossible to play solo if you are planning on getting you need to have a group
No.1 friendship tester No game gets my heart rate up like this one does 10/10
can bonk enemys

trop facile le jeu
I wholeheartedly hate this game 10/10 would die again
very nice game 9/10
It has a lot of potential to be good but just isn't Great atmosphere nice weapons cool concept and designs It would be mint if you didn't have to sneak around the entire map stopping every couple of seconds for some throbbing knobhead having a seizure You don't start with full equipment or ammo and when you actually find the small amounts and have to use them it doesn't feel rewarding It doesn't make sense that the enemies organic projectiles track you and is just another annoyance Terminals are painful to utilise and you cant stack tools or equipment that you find

okay so fundamental game play is amazing by far one of the most fun games ive played this year But the only thing is the difficulty i have one other friend who owns the game and we have been trying the first level for 8 hours now im sure we will get it soon but still The bots are far too stupid to be a viable option DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE FREINDS TO PLAY IT WITH
spooky but fun with friends this game has a lot of potential just needs more updates
Dope as hhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllll
good game for relaxing with yr homies
Mixed review Fun at times but bugs poor balancing or poor performance on some levels makes it too frustrating It takes the devs ages to fix and balance
gives me heart problems I never knew I had
Good team game
I mean sneak kill blame the person running around shooting everything at least a 8-9/10
I love this game it's really hard but i like that
i definitely did gtfo
Love the game had to quit tho the community is nothing short of psycopathic
nice
eeeeeeee
Bom se vc nao tiver amigos para jogar vai achar partida nunca

Until a real matchmaking system is implemented this gave will stay dead The discord is horrendous and the bots are awful Shame because it is fun with a full group of players

Just no
My friend bought me this game because she was too scared to play alone I may have triggered the sleepers more than once
good
The hardest part of the game finding 3 not retarded friends
Goaty
Kept crashing on startup Nice fucking job 0/10
Good stuff guys FANTASTIC ambiance like play this in a dark room and scare the crap out of yourself
Game is NOT what I thought it would be going in That said I still very much enjoy it This is one of those games where you NEED to communicate to survive Matchmaking without a mic will get you nowhere Matchmaking in-general won't be nearly as helpful as getting a pre-made squad together The game appears outwardly to be a hardcore survival horror shooter which is just not the case here This game in reality is a coop stealth horror game with very well made shooting as the punishment for Fing up the stealth The stealth gameplay revolves around crouch walking standing very still occasionally and timing melee kills with your teammates before somebody F's it up and everybody starts blasting As good as the game is the stealth and melee overall feels less polished and like it had less care put into it than the shooting aspect did which is strange considering the game discourages shooting as much as it possibly can It's a very strange game and the only thing I can compare it to are Payday 2 stealth heists on the harder difficulties but with better gunplay and the ability to return to stealth as the reward for failing stealth I love the atmosphere I love the setting I love the CMD Prompt computer usage and the main menus being themed after DOS style computer interfaces The only real complaint I have and I'm not very far into this game at all so this could be a non-issue is that I'd really like to do more shooting because the guns are cool and the shooting mechanics are insanely well done I've heard from friends that there are wave defense missions later on and that may scratch my itch for more of this game's amazing gunplay and really well designed sci-fi firearms
hella fun
A great challenging COOP find 3 competent friends and you'll have a blast
really good game allows you to talk to people you would not have met normally become friends with them then make history together despite the difficulty of the game each week i come back and dive into hell 10/10 would recommend just get ready for the horrors that await
Best survival Co-op ever
LAPSAP
Played this while it was free weekend long time ago couldnt pass floor 3 or 4 i think with the big roaming tentacle head mfs shit myself a ton Def a recommend just need mentally capable teammates
It's cool game probably better with friends but non available The problem is that I have not time of the day to play and comparing with somebody is difficult If it's have some checkpoint in some state will be awesome For me is issue to play because not enough time of being in work and it's hard game with bots and hard to mach with the limited time of me It's not the game for work people with cut time and no friends but people with time and many friends it's great choice to have fun and enjoy

How hard is it to just count down from three why he walking around when he shouldn't All my friends are preying for my downfall in this game i swear cant trust them are they even friends anymore BUY THIS GAME if you have 3 other friends to play with
h1 10/10 Outstanding Masterpiece h1 h3 Great to play with some friends to have some spooks and fun h3 This game is one of the most outstanding horror shooters I've ever played the first time I booted it up with the boys we played for 3 hours straight It was such a genuine thrill and everything from graphics to performance is brilliant Walking into the horrific complex blind not knowing what monsters your going up against is super thrilling I can run the game butter smooth at over 100 fps and the bots aren't as bad as people have told me they are I already have 70 Hours on this game and only up-to R2 with multiple more to go sure we've failed and had a few mistakes that have screwed us over but that hasn't stopped the fun I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys horror or shooters This is a must play for me R8 Edit Rundown 8 has just released adding a lot more content to the game GTFO is definitely fun thrilling and one of the best games I've ever played
Great game very goofy at times 10/10 in my books very low bar to meet bots work great about 99 of the time respond to situations well and of course shooty shooty bang bang

GTFO is a thrilling cooperative hardcore FPS experience This incredibly unique game is inextricably linked to its relatively inaccessible nature as for the vast majority of people the best and only worthwhile way to play this game is with a group of 4 players and that are all willing to brave a challenge
very nice
It's alright Not necessarily amazing by any means but a pretty good hard game Love the way the HUD and sights on guns and everything looks
bro remove the bots or make them actually useful they just ruined an entire mission by not standing in the scan ring and ended up getting everyone killed because the hoard wouldn't stop coming until the alarm was off also they do nothing but fucking run out infront of every enemy alerting them then shot YOU in the back and damage you would honestly like my money back or too see them get fixed or friendly fire turned off also add freaking match making its dumb you have to just know everyone in order to play with them
I enjoy games that have a challenge and this sure meets that criteria A very fun game that has more and more to discover as you play
Tough as balls But highly recommend
this game and dark souls have 1 thing in common no difficulty setting while it did take me 7 attempts to complete the first level when i DID do it fuck me that was a rush this game is punishingly hard so overcoming it feels that much better i highly recommend this game to people that like sci-fi guns and sneaking killing/shooting monsters also give the ai hackett the bio tracker the irish voice lines are SUPERB
buen juego
incredible
ye
frame rate was horrible even though my pc specs are better than the recommended level
GTFO is a hardcore stealth and strategy game It is fun to play with friends as COOP with this game is a must There are bots for the solo players but they are no where near the skill of an actually player Overall this game is well made and now contains all the previous rundowns If you are looking for a hard but fun game to play with your friends I would definitely recommend this game Do note the learning curve for this game is pretty high Also note some missions require more time than others but if you plan on playing this game you will have to allocate HOURS in order to complete some missions COOP 10/10 Replay ability 8/10 Horror 9/10 at first after a while this diminishes to 6.5/10 Time/Cost Ratio 9.5/10 Overall rating 9/10
10/10
Yo recomiendo jugar con amigos Es un juego la puedes deshacer el progreso en un nivel en el que has estado 1h y algo aunque en la R7 creo que hay puntos de control y en la R5 por ejemplo no,lo cual es.en fin pero si te atrapa la y el ir completando los niveles,te puede gustar mucho No recomiendo comprarlo si no tienes con jugar,y lo digo muy enserio Te que vayas al discord para jugar con gente,pero es un proceso largo en el que tienes que esperar mucho,ya que el matchmaking no te va a juntar con nadie fuera de los primeros niveles de una en un parche,que es cuando la gente se reactiva y juega Y no recomiendo jugarlo con randoms porque es una ruleta hay quien comparta la del juego y sea gente maja que si necesitas aprender algo te lo expliquen y todo guay y hay los autistas que van haciendo speedrun y se comportan como si estuvieras en su cabeza,y acaban provocando que o completes el nivel sin disfrutarlo o que os maten a todos y malgasten 1h de tu vida Yo creo que lo mejor mostrar una lista de partidas o salas activas como en tantos juegos online en vez de hacer solo uso del discord,y la posibilidad si tanto quieres jugar A LO QUE SEA que te dejen seleccionar todas las pantallas de todas las no que solo puedas hacer eso por Yo lo recomiendo porque me gusta mucho,pero tiene un problema de matchmaking serio,por mucho que se quiera justificar,y jugarlo en solitario con bots se puede hacer pero no es para nada igual
Sad dead game very interesting
frusturating but good game
Im sorry my friends I did not mean to alert the horde IM SORRRY

Game goes so hard A majority of the bad reviews are people who have the attention span of like a 12 yo The game is unforgiving and will require stealth You will have a hard time if you cant put together a competent team Have fun
shit fucking game
They licked me
Unique Captivating Great Gameplay and Atmosphere and kudos to the devs the optimization in this game is something most games should be doing more A MUST BUY imo

I have to emphasize what everyone else here is saying you NEED 3 other financially solvent friends who are willing to take a chance and drop 30-40 bucks on this game There isn't nearly enough players to get a game with randos Gameplay is fine but matchmaking is impossible The player count just isn't there yet You could grab it while it's on sale and see if others jump on board but if they don't it's a 30 dollar hole I'm approaching the refund window at 1.7 hours and I have gotten into one actual game The game looks sounds and feels amazing and there's great b potential b if more people were on board Would recommend if you have money AND friends I would not otherwise
um bom jogo para jogar com amigos mas bem repetitivo os devs continuam atualizando e adicionando mais Fases para o game mas focam no conteudo que precisa ser adicionado recomendo comprar apenas se for jogar com amigos
Still expansive make discount 50 i think thats will be good
need friends L to play and is slow but fun

nice game a lot of challenge
This game has no content and no soul
Lanky fucks are scary
No friends Skill issue 11 sleepers/12 shooters
It's not a horror game
Definitely would recommend to play with friends A mix of stealth and shooter game-play Some parts of the game remind me of L4D2 or Killing Floor One of my personal favourites
Great game to play with friends the lack of progression and skills reminds me of old school Left 4 dead all the unlocks I've seen have been single use buffs or cosmetics that aren't for sale great to play a game that truly isn't pay to win
no le crean a los que dicen que no se puede jugar solo yo lo estoy jugando solo y esta god

OMG i really like this game
Brilliant game this game is difficult and does not forgive mistakes lightly but that's whats makes it so good when you win Ultimately this game is about working closely with your team Weapons variety is great guns feel powerful lots of weapons types to suit your preferred game-play style Developers always updating content 10/10
best game ever game buy it now
Mid game
This game is hard Like hard on another level hard Played with some friends and despite having played many similar co-op games got almost nowhere This game could really do with some sort of learning curve right now its just a cliff face to scale
vary gouud
shhhh sleepers
Game seemed fun Claims it supports use of a gamepad but their support is just mapping every button completely randomly then not letting you change it Why t he hell is R1 the use button and the fire button So if you struggle with mouse and keyboard the game is unplayable I'm writing this while waiting for my refund In the 27 mins I played the game I completed the tutorial Based on that I rate the game 7/10 But overall for the lack of accessibility and gamepad support 4/10
Great game
Yes
Great game lots of fun however It can be pretty difficult if you don't know what you're doing It also is always in the corner of my mind begging to be played All my friends don't want to play without a full group of four but we've had sooooo MUCH FUN Guys please come back
this game is great but i have a massive krill issue
GTFO is the co-op game criminally underrated that you didn't know you needed in your life It's all about teamwork crazy tension and wicked fun So if you're down for a wild ride with your buddies GTFO is the ticket Don't let this hidden gem stay hidden
10/10 its so fun been playing it w my friend super hard when its just 2 of us
fuck hackett
i died
a very fun to play with friends scary at first but once you get used to it you think more tactical instead of fight or flight You do have to rely on your teammates to be quiet or timed kills Very tactical and very slow if played stealthy You can of course go gun blazing each zone you enter but the limited ammo count and relying on good toolboxes and supply lockers makes that hard Levels are recognizable at some point but the amount of levels makes up for it

The hentai sex doll keeps screaming when I touch it just like in real life

this game is basically just bonking it's wack a hole but h o r r o r 10/10 recommend for horror fps shooting players
Soft men make hard times Hard times include many scouts Many scouts make me hard
This game is how my friend describes him sneaking out of his house
goo game kinda but not really
I played R2D2 with my bros and I can tell you that this game is just perfectly difficult like Souls spending several hours on the same map between 2 and 3 hours per level the feeling of success once the extraction is complete is delicious Play it
Game had potential the theme is pretty cool I played it with two other friends and all three of us got bored of it quite quickly Every level feels the same levels are pretty easy all enemies feel the same with very low to no difference in ways to approach them there is 0 progression apart from some cosmetics It is fun for 5h max
good
This game is definitely a good one to play with your family and friends.thank you developer for making this hard difficult game level are really fun and there is no bugs or crashes I give you guys 10/10 game
Extremely fun with friends You Should try it D
A strange and unique videogame to say the least Great gunplay You never really want to use guns except when hordes attack Good gameplay The most repetitive and dull Very difficult For all the wrong reasons Hit registration is not something that was ever considered in the development As far as i've seen those who enjoy this game and are good at it are pure cheese mongers which is fine if they enjoy it Not for me
I NEED MORE BULLETS I NEED MORE BULLETS I NEED MORE BULLETS
the worm demon kind bad tbh
Great fucking game
Yes
The game which gives me thrill all the time Can't breath everytime I'm about to open Sec_doors with class V so fun with friends and so challenging with bots I love this game ever
cool
Great hardcore co-op game Great for lone wolf players seeking to get gangbanged by hordes of tentacle monsters 10/10 will get tentacle attacked in the dark foggy hallways of the abyss Protip Use teammates as human shields to run away from the big tentacle monsters Bullets only tickle them

we suck
Needed 7 tried to complete a run 1.5 hours each We were frustrated angry and nitpicked at each others mistakes Friendships were at rist but when we finally beat that sh we were happy and went straight for the next one 10/10 would almost lose my friends again
its a really good game i wouldn't get it unless you have friends to play with the game is a bit dead
pucker factor 10
Cant believe I spent 43 on a dead game that you cant play with bots cause they shoot at walls to hit enemies on the other side Positive feedback time The recoil is ridiculous I get were going for a horror feel here where your weapons work against you with ammo consumption or whatever but I've tried every single gun and it sucks NONE of them feel good to use and the scopes are atrocious Which leads me to my next point hip firing is useless You hip fire a shotgun and the pellets go into oblivion for some reason Why put charging enemies that run BEHIND enemy lines if your scope is too awful to hit them close and you cant hip fire Why even HAVE a hip fire As well the undodgeable attacks from enemies is wack You're telling me speedy Gonzales can run behind our lines hit us with his undodgeable tentacle tit for 12hp then run away What There is ZERO player collision with enemies leading to retarded interactions where you're trying to shoot an enemy inside your teammate But you cant play with other players because the game is dead so you're firing into your bot companion who is still shooting at a wall hoping to hit the enemy on the other side The enemies are super unfun to fight too you're telling me this is a stealth game right Well why is there an alarm door at every single turn forcing me to break stealth I can forgive if the enemies aren't that fair to fight if they aren't intended to be fought guns blazing But they clearly are if you give us constant max level alarms This isn't even accounting for the 20 frame animations these goobers go through making it impossible to hit headshots which dont even matter because headshots dont one shot Anyways with what you'll pay for this game you could buy Left for dead 2 which has better AI and an actual living community for random matchmaking You could also buy remnant which has better AI and an actual living community for random matchmaking Or you could buy any other game that isn't this mess Like seriously 2019 and it's still in this state They made bank off selling it for 40 bucks then dipped L devs I want my money back
i recommend playing with friends since i got my ass scared by a big juicy hot scary left and right booty cheek and i started to scream to death and got swarmed by multiple other booty cheeks i am afraid to play this game by myself you have been warned recommendation do not look at the cheeks too long

good game hammer good
Is fun horror killing alien things teamwork If you have friends to play it that is solo is rough
Fun format-game where it's mission-oriented I enjoy that it combines a little bit of puzzle-solving with teamwork and weapon strategy All around a well-balanced FPS
this game is fucking hard if you got the skills and the squad this game is dope af
a great game marred with poor decision making from the developers could have been saved by embracing the mod community but decided that they wanted to keep their slow schedule so the game repeatedly died and resurrected every 6-9 months in between releases the resurrection was always smaller each time though and since it is old content a part of community doesn't bother coming back for something they burned through Rundown 8 will be the end of the game since they basically say they will not guarantee any content from there and since mod rundowns will still get you banned the game is basically on life support until death
Good I'm slightly positive on this Tl;dr Recommend if you have 4 gamers and you can buy it on sale I only paid 20 If you're playing solo or duo the AI is so extremely shitty that you will have an unplayable bad time I would not recommend it for just 1-2 players
I got this game recently and it is hard but fair times where we lost expeditions were due to our own faults and times where we won was achieved through very well co-ordinated teamwork I have had so much fun playing this game so far thanks to the amazing community and fun game play mechanics 10/10 would recommend
I will leave the cat friends who pass by can pet it and give it a thumbs up l
Are you the type of person to wipe your ass with sandpaper for fun Have you ever woken up with the urge to anally fuck a razor wire bundle like it's anal beads This game is for you 10/10 would die again
I would recommend for the guys who has friends to play not me tho I am alone I should go outside and learn how to talk Nah I'll go to watch cornhub again easy
great game if you like to be murdered by 100000000 aliens/mutants/things 24/7
It's gud
When the hard game is hard 5/10
Sehr gutes Spiel jeden der es mag den Sieg zu Arbeiten es ist furchtbar SChwer aber der Erfolg mit Freunden dann eine Mission ohne das einer Stirbt ist mega
like skyrim with zombies
INTENSE multiplayer experience Definitely challenging
Awesome hardcore horror co-op game The only con I would say is that it isn't playable without friends yea there are players who solo it really well but those people have sunk in thousands of hours
h3]Updated review[/h3 Now there is a functional matchmaker that looks like it can set you up with games It's even flexible ingame allowing you to replace players with bots on the fly There's no server browser which would be my ideal honestly and there's no feedback in the matchmaker to show you how players are distributed But it's enough now for me to recommend this game when it's on sale since GTFO2 has been announced h3]Requires Discord to play[/h3 You can complete some runs solo but the later levels and alternate levels require multiple players on microphones
banger game but i have no friends
As the title suggests just GTFO I had a clean pair of pants and then they were ruined from the blood of sleepers The only downfall is you run out of ammo quite quick so you need to work VERY effectively as a team otherwise your chances of even getting halfway through are slim Super fun game with your friends though Highly recommend playing

A fun and scary co-op game teamwork required
10/10 worth getting if your looking for a stealth and challenging game this game for you
This game requires lots of thought in each mission and the devs put in a LOT of work to make the levels the monster design looks amazing along with the gore effects despite the game being out for a few years now the graphics still seem to look great game also runs pretty smooth even on older systems This game also gets regular updates around every month sometimes longer NOTE this is not an easy game ammo health and other key components are scarce in levels which promotes stealth If your up for a challenge i can easily recommend this game

This game's whole atmosphere is insane the UI gameplay and storyline are very detailed and immersive and match the tense yet entertaining gameplay The gameplay is focused around stealth optional but there are parts of very chaotic stressful fights that you have to keep focused on what you are doing which creates a very unique experience The amount of content in this game is very large as there are currently 7 rundowns which have many missions inside of them rundown 1 has 6 missions and it took me 18 hours to complete rundown 1 and the later rundowns are larger with 12 missions and some missions has up to 2 optional objectives along with the main objective per mission The gameplay is quite hard but not enough to be annoying I would like an in-game server browser to play with others but currently it is heavily relied on Discord which isn't bad it just breaks the immersion While there is a system for matchmaking no one uses it and its not great The weapons in GTFO are very unique and there is at least 2 guns for how you like to play and are very balanced How enemies have very realistic bodies that break apart as you hit them is very unique You have to manage resources wisely and efficiently as there are not many resources so melees are very helpful You have to communicate with teammates establish plans and execute them with little room for error I would recommend this game to people who like horror cooperative risky and atmospheric shooters

Dato einer der beste Co-op Shooter
This game is Very unforgiving It will test your patience and may take you and your Friends hours to beat one level You will learn quickly how to avoid enemies silently take them out and hold yourselves against waves of them with your friends That being said this game is a masterpiece However it will become stale if don't have anyone to play with You can play with bots or join the discord though I am still on the first rundown and so far im having fun

what happens if i shoot
you are going to die i wish you the best
This is first and foremost an FPS that requires thought and strategy Stealth is a big element of the game as you are often out numbered by monsters that can kill you quickly Tension comes easily as you creep through the dark hallways and rooms towards your next kill or you miss your melee attack generating noise and awaken all the enemies in the room forcing you to go loud and desperately try to survive in the ensuing firefight Every drop has you chasing certain objectives which at first seems difficult to determine how to do it Finding a terminal and utilizing basic coding you can gather all sorts of information ranging from the location of your objective location of supplies lists of security doors etc Supplies are always in demand and you are almost always running low making your melee weapon your best friend allowing you to sneak up and kill enemies silently and save ammo The game is challenging without a doubt and knowledge and skill is your best friends
It's a great game if you have people to play with GTFO switches between stealth and chaotic shooter with hoardes of enemies that are hell to put down While most levels have both types of play in it there is no inbetween the 2 styles Both require a lot of teamwork open mic recommened and strategizing It has a decent balance between tactical planning cooperative stealth and horror shooter aspects The game itself is difficult no matter how much time you put into it amd completing a level is always a great feeling no matter how good you are There is some replayability and with the addition of all the previous rundowns plenty of levels to give lots of playtime The only reward for completing a level is that you beat a level so if you need progression to enjoy a game probably not for you Due to this however there is no balance issues between just starting and being an experienced player so having teammates of various time in game will not ruin your experience With that the bots in the game are very difficult to play with and while having a bot on your team is fine playing solo with bots only will make the game more painful than enjoyable If you've seen the movie Aliens the game gives off some of that aesthetic as it gave ideas for the game Personally I recommend the game for anyone that enjoys the fps and co-op genres
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

h1]GTFO is a very unique strategic co-op horror game like no other It's a hell of a blast![/h1 i]GTFO is a hardcore cooperative horror shooter that throws you from gripping suspense to explosive action in a heartbeat Stealth strategy and teamwork are necessary to survive in your deadly underground prison Work together or die together.[/i h2]Story Environment Enemies[/h2 The story of GTFO can be difficult to grasp In order to fully understand the story you have to find lore logs collectibles in the terminals throughout the missions and read them and pay close attention to when the characters in the game are talking It takes place in an underground prison called The Complex When your team is dropped into the Complex you enter the Rundown episode A Rundown is a sequence of expeditions missions/chapters issued by the Warden the unknown entity holding you captive Survive all the expeditions to clear the Rundown The environment in The Complex is mostly the same A dark underground facility with a bit of variety from time to time The variety of enemies is good enough You and your team need to use different strategies and weapons depending on which type of enemies you're up against h2]Gameplay Co-Op Difficulty[/h2 GTFO is a very unique strategic co-op horror game like no other It has up to 4 player co-op and is a very difficult game especially if you are not playing with a full group of people with voice chat You cannot choose the difficulty level in GTFO Instead the expeditions are divided into different tiers which is basically how difficult the missions are These tiers go from A-E For example if you take the second Rundown the missions are as follows R2A1 R2B1 R2B2 R2B3 R2B4 R2C1 R2C2 R2D1 R2D2 R2E1 A rule of thumb is that the deeper you go in the Rundown the harder the mission in this case R2E1 is the hardest Another Rundown may look different R1 R3 R6 don't even have an E-tier mission and it varies how many missions a Rundown has It can be up to 4 missions of the same tier There are a total of 8 Rundowns It can be enough for one person in your team to make a mistake and the entire mission is lost which can be both fun exciting and frustrating given that many missions are very long without checkpoints You have to be careful with the ammo and going in guns blazing is not always the best as it can have fatal outcomes Practice planning coordination and stealth are key to beating the game Even with very good planning things can go south and you and your teammates skills are put to the test Always have a backup plan if something goes wrong Simultaneous stealth kills with your group are a big part of the game if you're into that sort of thing h2]Weapons Tools Boosters Loot[/h2 When it comes to weapons there are many to choose from Some weapons I loved some weapons I loathed Some weapons have insane recoil and are very difficult to handle because of this But overall most weapons are pleasant and fun to use You can have one Main weapon one Special Weapon one Melee Weapon and one Tool There are 4 different Tools to choose from Sentry Gun C-Foam Launcher Mine Deployer and Biotracker On top of this there are 4 different Sentry Guns to choose from Burst Sentry Shotgun Sentry Hel Auto Sentry and Sniper Sentry All have their pros and cons C-Foam Launcher can be used to shoot foam on the ground doors or on other places in the surroundings to slow down the enemies With the Mine Deployer you can put trip mines on doors the ground or on walls Biotracker is a tracking device that you can use to scan rooms for sleeping enemies and also tag the enemies so they are easier to see if they wake up Enemies that are awake and scanned get a red triangle above their head and this triangle can be seen through walls To gather boosters the players need to pick up Artifacts which are scattered throughout The Complex Boosters provide bonuses to the player and last for the entirety of an expedition usually at some cost or requirement Boosters can be applied to the player in three different slots Muted Bold and Aggressive corresponding to the rarity of the artifacts Some boosters can also have negative effects or certain conditions that have to be met for the booster to take effect A Muted booster can only be used once before it expires A Bold booster has up to 2 uses An Aggressive booster has up to 3 uses Every time you complete a mission for the first time you unlock cosmetics in the form of Helmets Torsos Legs Backpacks and Palettes Colors to customize your character h2]Constructive Criticism[/h2 I would have liked to see more detailed information for the weapons For example a gauge or numbers that show how much damage a weapon does the size of the magazine fire rate reload speed etc The only thing that is displayed when you choose the weapon is for example High damage Medium range Hard to control Fully automatic Low ammo capacity Overpenetrating rounds etc I want detailed stats of the weapons so that you can compare them easily and see which weapon you should bring to a specific mission I don't wanna have to google that Something that is very strangely designed is that the host does less damage to bosses for some reason Why I have no idea The list of collected Boosters could have been much better It's a very confusing list of strange titles for the boosters You have to click on the booster to see what effect it gives and the conditions that have to be met for the booster to take effect You can't sort the list in any way either instead it just expands with the last booster you unlocked which ends up at the bottom of the list An example of how a title effect and conditions of what a Bold booster looks like is this Title PROTEC MEL-R RQ/72 2 uses left Effects Resist 10 Resist 12 Conditions Health 50 Subject must have 50 health or more for booster to be active That title tells me nothing Just confusing The game also has some game-breaking bugs These bugs do not occur often and can be avoided by restarting the game every 3 hours or so I've heard that memory leaks or something is the issue but I don't know The developers don't seem to want to patch it either One bug is that when you shoot C-Foam with the C-Foam launcher on a door the shots just go through the door and does not reinforce the door Another random visual bug is that a small part of your screen starts going black It starts as a small black hole that just gets bigger every second until the whole screen is black This goes away after a few minutes but can really screw you and your team over if this happens to someone at the end of a long mission You can still run around and shoot and such but you can't see anything This bug only happened to me twice in my 215 hours of playtime The game also has some audio bugs where suddenly the sound of your own footsteps gets really loud and you hear less from the other in game sounds There are some more bugs but I'm not gonna list them h2]The Verdict[/h2 The game can be a bit confusing and it can be difficult to figure out where to go and what to do sometimes until you get the hang of it This is a game that you really have to immerse yourself in together with three other people if you want to get really good So if you are interested in doing that and have three friends to try this game with I highly recommend this game Or join the GTFO discord to find players I consider myself and my skill a bit above average when it comes to this game and it took me 215 hours to beat every mission in the game and unlock all achievements and I had a blast doing it If you can look the other way when it comes to the game-breaking bugs that rarely occur then I highly recommend this game Time to Get the Fuck Out h3]Rating 9/10[/h3
good game
I finally beat level 1 after 13 hours Great game No really it's pretty good just really difficult Demands absolute awareness of your surroundings as well as crystal clear communication with your teammates No greater survival horror experience exists
Man I love aimlessly wandering in the dark with a shitty loadout of 3 whole bullets before my team gets murked while I was looking for a locked door I am a fool I forgot to enter the FORTRAN code to find the key to unlock to door
good spooky fucked
game good

Simply no
GOOD GAME SO FUKING Awesome
If you love stealth guns creatures that make you second guess life and want to find out who your true friends are this is the game for you The hordes are intense and the game is well thought out I recommend this game to everyone and I would recommend going to the toilet before playing as the creatures exploding will not be the only mess being created
Me You like co-op horde shooters Friend Yeah Me Have you ever been gang raped by a horde of demigorgon lookalikes Friend No Me WOULD YOU LIKE TOO
MAS DIFICIL QUE PELLIZCAR UN VIDRIO
Kill that n***a
Nice Game definitely need a group of friends the Discord server to enjoy it to the fullest
GTFO 4 5-7 15 10
The game is good but the bot is such a Bitch always fucking you the AI needs rework
The gameplay LOOKS exciting in the trailers till you realise that is 5 of the game and the other 95 is you crouch walking through the same looking rooms melee stealth killing the same 2 mobs in the head And if you miss once and alert them reset to the last checkpoint and re do the last 10 minutes of stealth melee headshots So boring
It is funny how most reviewers here got an average 20-25 hours in game I think i know why For 22 hours i was trying to find something REDEEMABLE for this game(and for game pricetag and i found NONE Stealth(which is a core gameplay and almost mandatory is boring melee combat and enemies boring and clunky gunplay(base shooting mechanic two times boring and clunky One and only thing which is average/good is dark atmosphere of horror in deep underground Base mechanics are very unpolished but the latest patches added just mere cosmetics and a couple of levels but add nothing to improve the base gameplay and make it somewhat fun For example when you have a 3 use medkit and you see a 2 use medkit you CANT stack them together to make it 5 you just swap them(i saw a 6 use medkit once with 120 heal COME ON This title belongs in Early access definitely not in FULL RELEASE with such a pricetag STAY AWAY It simply NOT fun at all Or follow this game name when you find it on Steam store page

THEY FLY NOW
Really fun with a group of friends Lots of tactics needed and great to share resources or you die
get gud friends D
Game is amazing I have no friends to play with me so thank you Bot Blinky Bot Husk and Bot Vivek Thank you for making me feel like a child again sneaking around monsters in the dark with a gun

I like it but there is no matchmaking you have to use the discord to group up really stupid
It's hard but fun the only thing that's bringing the game down is the fact that there's no quickmatch option and you have to match for specific areas
It's awesome
Yes Yes
I want to get the f out

You might get something out of this if you have four people in total to play it But you'll still have to put up with either being blind in the dark or being blinded by the inexplicably bright areas At some point this was an interesting idea that got lost in a terrible execution
Very challenging but a lot of fun with the bois
nah
Very cool Join up
Spooky Requires friends unfortunately
Atmosphere is great gameplay is fun and engaging overall very good game would recommend
Balanceadamente desafiante y perfecto para jugar con amigos
This is hands down one of the coolest games around with how it combines normal fps and co-op with true horror and difficulty
i like this game game like me cuz is best game
Simply extraordinary need a heart transplant hair resurgence skin graft teeth implants two amputations and several organ transplants this game has destroyed it all

If you have a group of 4 people that want a hardcore suspense-filled gaming experience this is the game for you Well worth 40 dollars and bound to cause plenty of fights between the 4 of you as you argue over who fucked up and woke the swarms up This is not a chill/easy game it requires a lot of coordination communication and patience It may take you several tries to find the best way to beat a level and that is part of the fun
The game is very stressful in an artificial way Blinding bright fog Extreme darkness Engineered and forced resource scarcity Game mechanics are smooth but simple There isn't much I can do or improve on as a player to compensate for the level design besides using ammo as little as possible And if you want to play this you better have 4 friends with you The bots are idiots and random players are very hit or miss It is an okay game but it seems to be intentionally unenjoyable
one of my favourite multiplayer survival game this game acutely needs all 4 player to do there part one mistake all died
Have watched this game through YouTubers from early development to completed game Finally having some friends to play with it is so worth the hype we gave it It is a perfect model of stealth and action with a good amount of difficulty
super challenging but fun to play the reward is the win which is nice for a change
I am become hacker man Master of coop query terminal searches for team
Get this game It's unlike any other and extremely fun to play Fans of horror sci fi and tactical shooters will all be satisfied
Incredibly fun shines when you have 3 others to play with shines best when those 3 aren't morons
Questo gioco mette a dura prova la pazienza e il teamwork di qualsiasi team di players
Ein Super gutes Spiel tolle Grafik und wahnsinnig gutes Team Play wird hier geboten ein Traum jeden der Schleich Spiele mag
Very fun and consistant gameplay but far too consistant GTFO lacks variation all this game needs is some weapon customizations new enemies and objectives and then it will be perfect
This game is great Challenging fresh makes you think etc Probably best with a full squad of real people but not necessary Free updates that add content no micro-transactions no issues with performance what else can you ask for
It is a lot of fun to play with a group of people and you get to do a lot of screaming out of fear
Es un juego muy imersivo y perfecto para jugar con es lo suficientemente dificil para en realidad poner a lo que haces y hacer planificaciones
cant seggs the tanks
XD
I like missing a fully charged hit and having 45 zombies rain on my ass
Looks alright But its got unskippable cutscenes jank menus no information on firearms/tools besides has bullets in it The bots offered are useless and unless you've got 4 player parties its gonna be a bad time Wouldn't recommend
Ever wanted to test the limits of your friendships Enter GTFO the game that's less team-building exercise and more let's see who we're still talking to tomorrow Dive into dark corridors with monsters and Mr Spaghetti man that make your even in-laws seem pleasant by comparison And if you miss the 90s good news You can relive the joy of DOS command prompts while being chased by things that want to eat you So if you've ever thought I wish video games could give me trust issues GTFO has got your back
Hardest and best game Ive ever played

I was looking for a decent Game for a long time.I was just tired of all those mainstream games doing the same thing over and over again.I was sick of all those Battlepass,Microtransaction BS.And then i found this gem I love the atmosphere,the demanding,tactical gamesplay and the overall design Im 30 hours in and i just finished like 10 of the game.Yes you need 4 Players with mic,but the discord Community of GTFO is great and helpful and you will always find 3 Players to join with And every couple months the developers will drop some FREE new levels So if you looking for some new and refreshing experience i would highly recommend you give this game a try
hard but good
JOGO SENSACIONAL
c'est dur et stressant
I love suffering Getting to the very end and then dying because a sleeper was behind me and I walked backwards into it while shooting the ones in front of me But it's with friends Suffering with friends is fun 8.5/10 A very schadenfreude experience

A masterpiece for co-op shooting Brutal atmospheric and unforgiving I wasn't really a fan of shooters but this one feels more like a dungeon crawler If you have the patience to learn and enjoy tense experiences this is a must play
good game
Great if you have enough friends to play The bots are not ideal
A hardcore game that is best played with friends along with a decent working brain if you want to progress
j'aime bien
Very dark and hard teamwork is required 10/10

funny and love to play with friends
This game withholds ammo from you so that you are forced to melee the enemies which is only viable if you slowly creep through the level You have to stop moving every few steps in a slow-paced game of red-light-green-light with the sleeping enemies Then you charge up your melee attack why does a spear take 3 seconds of wind-up to stab someone Due to the random placement of enemies it is impossible to learn the layout when restarting the level It introduces RNG that can result in unfair enemy patterns such as spawning them in one cluster so that they cannot be stealth killed even with the coordination of 4 players There are no silenced weapons which could counter these situations Once alerted the small enemies run extremely fast Even if you manage to keep your distance they have homing ranged spit attacks that snipe you from across the room They also attack with their lightning-fast tongues which are difficult to dodge You are at a disadvantage if you melee them It doesn't feel fair that we are outgunned by the spit and tongue attacks of the enemies Reviving your friends in the middle of an attack is not viable It's slow and gets cancelled if you take any damage The game has levels that are mostly unlit where you can't see anything If you use your torch the enemies are alerted Instead you must scan the level through a tiny thermal scope to spot enemies After an hour of seeing mostly darkness replaying the same level over and over it gets boring The difficulty does not make the game fun You lose the level because of making one small mistake or because of lack of design in enemy placement You better have 3 friends to play with because there is no difficulty scaling and they forgot to add stealth to the Bot AI The matchmaking doesn't work either GTFO is not a good horror game It is predictable and tedious to always sneak around the level because the game doesn't let you just fight them The game is always at the same difficulty extremely difficult Each room feels the same as the last GTFO is very doable But it requires replaying each level multiple times and performing very specific actions in the right order to beat the level With the random enemy spawns it isn't even possible to plan an approach to a level after dying
My 2 best friends and I bought this game to play together and in all honesty it sucked No difficulty scaling or options GTFO has very poor accessibility options Don't have 3 friends who will slog through it with you Too bad you shall die Need a slightly less brutal gamemode to enjoy the game That sounds like a you problem Poorly lit levels I understand dark atmospheres to enhance the horror aspect but I'm not a fan of stumbling around a black screen for most the game You get a flashlight but are punished for using it as it alerts the enemies to your presence Stealth is mandated An extreme shortage of ammo means you'll be playing stealthily this means crouching forward no flashlight on until you are close enough to stab them with a charged melee attack A game of red light green light You can slowly inch forward for few seconds before they hear you and begin to throb and pulse light as they awaken Red light Then you stay still until they go back asleep Green light This is time-consuming and more often then not something will aggro them Restarting levels You might accidentally click your teammate forgets their flashlight is on the enemy starts their 1 idle animation just as you attack you collide with an inaccurate hitbox an enemy you thought was far away enough hears the takedown No matter how careful you and your teammates are or how well you co-ordinate it's impossible to be perfect One mistake and everything is fucked If by describing the game as suspenseful you mean walking on eggshells so you don't have to restart the level for the 20th time then yeah it's got some great suspense 6 hours of re-trying the first two levels had me and my friends burnt out and sick of this game Enemy spawn locations are randomised and often unfair For example when we were playing there was one instance where ALL of the enemies spawned in one tight cluster It's impossible to stealth this as nearby enemies are alerted when you kill one close to them Forced to play like a pussycat Accidentally aggravating the enemies causes them all to swarm you forcing you to use up precious bullets to take them down before they obliterate your healthbar You feel like you're playing with your hands tied behind your back as you try to conserve your bullets for alarm events STUPID enemy attacks The chongus enemies are tanky which is balanced by their slow walk speed.but it doesn't matter because they will wipe out 80 of your health by licking you from half a room away The little guys approach quickly running or crawling oh and they also have an explosive long-range projectile attack which CURVES TOWARD YOU making it very hard to dodge They're also bullet sponges And there's a lot of them I would rather play as the enemy getting to feel powerful by easily wiping out hordes of the weak player character A good challenge The only part of the game we enjoyed was the alarmed door events These are the only times you are meant to fight as waves of enemies to spawn until you complete all the security checks which is standing in highlighted circles until the bar fills It's fun because you can FINALLY use some strategy to place sentry guns close doors push or retreat as appropriate etc You can finally use your guns and shoot em dead You get to use teamwork tactics skill and reflexes Perfection or nothing No checkpoints When you die you have to start over If you keep doing it over and over again keep practicing at one point you'll get it It's doable Is this what a fun game sounds like No skill progression You start out with every weapon available to you You can't improve anything not your total HP your ammo or stealth Dumb consumables Annoying fall damage We were not impressed by the visuals Repetitive and limited animations There's only a handful of enemy types and you've encountered them all by the 1st level Oof Difficult for the wrong reasons A well-designed game will punish bad decisions or skill issues GTFO is not a brutal game it is brutally designed Not really a horror game I'm sensitive to horror elements I'm easily jumpscared disturbed by gore freaked out by threat Even still I felt no fear playing GTFO When enemies woke up and attacked I was frustrated not panicked The darkness was annoying not scary There was no fear of the unknown as everything in the level is predictable You get used to chilling by the enemies for hours and they lose any horror element through shear repetitiveness anyway The UI is cool and immersive but not spooky What's supposed to be the horror part the same time-consuming cutscene that plays every time you enter a level There's not even any story to give you at least a spine-chill

SPOOKY
average night out past 2am in leeds
This game was simply not fun it's TOO dark you can't see one meter in front of you in the dark areas which is in 90 of the level and guess what using a light will make everyone target you The game punishes you for trying to see in the dark You have VERY limited ammo and rarely can refill These enemies that are made of flesh will out gun you by using their lethal spit and tongue bruh thank god they did not make us fight with a sling shot no leveling up no unlocking anything you have everything from the get go and enjoy being stressed and losing all your progress if you make few small mistakes it's like you have a job that has to be perfected and not playing a game
you and your friends just clearing the area one of characters just randomly says hands off cocks
TOUCH THE FEELERS Don`t let others tell you what to do
4-6 20
Very fun and challenging game human teammates are almost essential almost Scratches a niche itch in my brain
Keeps the blood pumping for sure very fun
nice game
average day in birmingham really
spook very ah ooh spook very fun me scared
Fun to play with a full group of friends Much harder if you don't have a full group that you can talk to Also hard to find other players with lobby search One miss stake can end your game real fast Nice Horror element to the game Nice weapons and support items Turret 3 Missions some what long
This game is both fun to play with friends and strangers I had a lot of notable moments in the discord with people who both took it seriously and knew how to have fun It's a really unique tactical game but you're most certainly going to have to sacrifice some patience It's easy to learn but hard to master but once you do master it the atmosphere still sticks with you and no matter how good you are you're always going to be that little bit creeped out playing it It is expensive yes nevertheless it's worth it for the amount of content it has If my friends hadn't gotten it for me I would have purchased it myself
If a lady forces you to stealth don't do it And don't be a simp to hide that you're shit at the game
Jogo mto bom mudou minha sobre jogo de zumbi Pisa no prato carrega a cell ache o key digita no terminal e espeta ou gire o sensacional Obrigada
Worst lobby system in gaming history I literally had to take a networking course to figure out how to connect with other players
eb*al
I have mixed feelings about this game The game is great it's fun to play and it is definitely not too easy The game is gorgeous and sounds great The downside is that the missions are way too long and it's almost impossible to play without a team of humans I've also never had luck with matchmaking and generally prefer playing without strangers anyway since that's hit and miss Basically I recommend this game if you have enough friends that can dedicate a lot of time to a single session and don't mind failing
every team i haev been with are dumb and that makes it funny and fun

10/10
Jogo incrivel o problema encontrar pessoas para jogar
Fantastic game gutwrenching tense difficult but in a skill defining way could not say enough good things
very gud the voices are gone now it cured my schizonphrenia and replaced with PTSD
yes if you like team play if not stay away
It will be so much better if they add wave/horde mode Just pick wepons and defend For now levels are way to long for someone who work
This game has come a long way from its origins Every-time I play I am always struck by the atmosphere of this game and Disney should take note This is how you make an Aliens FPS Tension building in dark corridors limited ammo and the command line system on the terminals to find things in the dark twisting shafts of abandoned facilities Really captures the vibe of LV-426 The enemies can get a bit repetitive and I would like to see more variety there Build your team work together stay quiet
I admit this game it's a good for co-op with extreme challenges.But one problem this game runs on Unity engine so many gamers crash the game a lot even I can't avoid it It is best to change the engine and fix the matchmaching so that the system can find the game and give gamers a better experience Or in the future this game will be dead like other unity game
its crazy
The game is great I just completed the alt://r1 rundowns and it doesn't disappoint The atmosphere of the game is set up really well and the difficult in my opinion is set pretty high It's a mix of good strategy teamwork and actually being good But it's a great thing to do with friends and such to have a good time This is definitely a game that you could sink hundreds of hours into and still have new stuff to do learn etc very gud
This game shows that it's from Payday devs Amazing atmosphere cool weapon choices hard and terrifying enemies And god awful friendly AI
Took 2 hours to beat first level Feels amazing to fail 10 times on second one and quit the game
Watch out for sleepers
Gerilim zirve oyununun zirve fazla fazla gerilimli fazla basit ama oynamaya doyulmayan bir oyun Deneyin denetin
Let them
I could come up with some joke but you know what the game's good A bit resource heavy but good The real fun requires a 4 person team coordination understanding game mechanics and patience Good luck prisoner you will need it
Beautiful game best horror game I played
Go get some and have Fun playing GTFO No Hand holding Teamwork strongly needed be quiet or deal with the consequences always heal and stock up on ammo for your Team first and yourself last Communicate and plan out Tactics before doing something or deal with a potential Mission failure All in all Awesome game would recommend for Masochists
i was licked by a big boi
Extremely tough and fun worst part of it is finding 3 not so retarded friends to play with
Fun Hard Spooky
Mtttt BOMMM pra fazer time
Why are we still here Just to suffer
nado brat
Friend okay we need to time our stealth kills so we don't alert them Also friend after seeing sleeper after we opened a door oh shit shoots gun
El juego es muy bueno pero OJO si tienes amigos con los que jugar bien jugar con los bots pero son bastante tontos y no tienes la misma La dificultad muy bien pensada y la del terminal es muy original pero el rendimiento un poco mal en steam deck ya que yo juego a todo pero quitando eso es un extraction shooter muy competente y divertido
I no longer have any friends 10/10
ill preface this review by saying that I have been playing with the same team since I got the game and we suck so bad we have only completed rundown 1 fully HOWEVER I still think the game is one of the best co-op experiences you'll ever have that being said you actually have to enjoy the slower and more thoughtful gameplay especially since it gets sort of repetitive when you play enough levels the vast majority of the game involves sneaking through a room hitting guys on the back of the head and then opening a door sometimes that door has an alarm and sometimes you mess up hitting the guys and you end up gunning them all down anyway the graphics fit the atmosphere of the game perfectly and they can be easy to run when turned down since 90 of the rooms are covered in fog anyway rarely if ever have we come across bugs that affect gameplay and I have enjoyed the constant updates to the game i bought the game when rundown 7 was out and only after did they start releasing rundowns from the beginning definitely worth the full price imo but good on sale too especially if not sure about the game it is pretty important that you have people to play with your team can make or break how much fun you have although i have been a part of a few yelling matches and rage quits always blame someone else for waking them up and of course you can always find a team using the discord which ive heard is a pretty good overall I just think this game is super exciting and atmospheric while also being a good challenge to your patience and teamwork with friends i look forward to one day not sucking at it
mid could not find games crashed and was buggy not good unless you have a group playing with randoms is not an option they ether leave are there to brain dead to think for them selfs
Starts to know how to play the game and got through the first expedition Game starts throwing multiple giants to fuck you up in the second expedition Truly describes what this game is like

The vibes are perfect You and 4 other unfortunate goons ride a nightmare roller coaster into an impossibly large monster infected hole in the ground with a long to-do-list issued for reasons unknown There's a big emphasis on stealth resource management and teamwork The game is HARD and will not hold your hand On the harder missions a couple of mistakes can easily doom a run Even the starting objectives are vague and it's up to you and your team to figure out how to complete even the main objective Really gives of the impression of being dropped in without any second thought The gameplay is quite good Guns look great feel great and sound really great Melee weapons are satisfying and each one has it's use Tools are also well balanced and feel like they all have their use However the thing that will keep me playing is the difficulty One might even say that this is the dark souls of 4 player coop I'm the kind of dude that likes to intentionally cripple myself in games just to see if I can beat it with a disadvantage so of course I love how unforgiving and difficult it is If you don't like hard games I would not recommend GTFO at all The negative There's only one slight problem with the game and it really is a small one The game has some jank to it some weird collision issues and hitreg slight netcode and visual bugs Nothing that ruins the experience by any stretch of the imagination but clearly something that I wish would be polished away It has that early-access feel despite being a finished product Overall it's a real good game with some minor technical issues I would get it if the above appeals to you even if you don't have anyone to play with as teammates can be found in the official gtfo discord It's what I did and the community is generally nice and welcoming
This game has a lot of potential but falls short on a lot of things that other horde shooters do way better Its just kinda the same thing over and over again super repetitive 1 see what objective is 2 Play red light green light for an hour straight That is how the stealth works with the monsters Just go play literally any other horde shooter like l4d2 Deep Rock Galactic or vermintide two all way better games with interesting combat oh and they are not 40 dollars
yes
Pros unique gameplay hardcore experience friendship testing simulator color and lights impressions don't want satisfy all just for few no improving rpg stats interesting and unpredictable enemies with unique skills no tutorials on web devs change levels from time to time so it's unpredictable first game with usable glowsticks you can kill kids Cons vizually stereotypical after some runs chambers chambers chambers lore just from terminals or web no or low option how to gather intel from environment even with gas mask you can't rely on it gas is one of most annoying things especially when you run with friend some runs which they don't have complete weird system of literally just TWO slots for equipment you even can't place equip on ground or into box just have to switch with something else Someon took it Bummer Lot of time spend just by equipment management Imo annoying and funny when you see all that backpacks and pockets even if you don't do many mistakes your success often depends on good spawn of equip and where it spawn enemies stucked monsters after wave which make battle music going in loop and you have to find them just to stop Neutral full focus needed if you are in mission for four hours and more it's like shift in work bots more useful than in other games but often stealing needed equipment you can hear monsters half map away when your comrade walk near them sometimes useful but often confusing
Good game My source The inside sleeper voices in my head
the tentacle man will touch you
Fab game to play with your mates Tense yet fun Defo recommend
The game is really fun even when playing with just one or two friends and then bots though I do recommend having as many people play with you as possible Friends are definitely what make this game a better experience
10/10
play good game.life gud
I own it Haven't played it much Here's a review of the game from a while back Compared to other 4 player co-op games like World War Z Deep Rock Galactic Vermintide 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 I think there's room this game but it's not something I feel really compelled to play There's also apparently timed events which is lame but I haven't played enough to really test it I will also add one word Tencent
It is thrilling trying to sneak around and not have the clapping of your cheeks alert the enemies especially at higher levels

sick
Probably my favorite co-op game of all time and I only have ten hours in Definitely one of my favorite games ever and I recommend it to anyone who likes strategic heart-racing gameplay that requires both stealth and gunmanship skills to excel in

ROCK AND STONE BROTHER
I enjoyed the game probably a little too much fog felt like i was sneaking around a victorian london with lovecraftian monsters
The amount of time i'm going to hear ping ping ping and bloody ping from my bot again i swear
Drop in Stealth through 2 zones Wake up a scout because of skill issue Die to Insert annoying enemy type here Repeat In all seriousness this game is hard but the adrenaline rush from beating a hard level or every single time you melee a scout is worth the price and the time it takes to learn Highly Recommended
Its fun listening to your friends rage quit every time you fail a mission 10/10 would fail a mission again
It is hard

If dark souls is for masochists GTFO is for CBT enthusiasts.and yet despite the gibblet pain I still keep coming back
fun
Lovely Jubbly
I love the game but everything surrounding 10 Chambers is DRAMA HELL if you do decide to get this game make sure you buy it with a dedicated team or friends because the matchmaking for random people is non-existent and the dedicated discord commune is mad toxic this video is TL:DR but if you do decide to give it a full view it hits the issues on nail
A game that does not hold back and I love every second of it
its a great game if you dont have a full group you can always head into the discord and find people to play with there it is honestly a fun game to play with a group of people
Can never get unhooked This game is all about patience and coordination If you got that and friends who share the same qualities you are good to go And if not well you can still have fun shooting up the rooms It has a perfect balance between stealth rambo shooting horror comedy and thrill This game is in my opinion a 10/10
It's super interesting Sadly i dont have a solid groups of co-nerds to play with Since i doubt normies fancy this game at all sad_face
I wonder if the sequel will be called STFU

phrase of the day don't move oh my god there is 10 of them
Daaamn that Scout is caked up lipbite
Best thing I ever played
I had great fun with the game but for some reason I can't access it when I go offline which is sad As for the gameplay I say that some things could use some tweaks like scouts could use a trick were it fakes a return of it's feelers I believe the matchmaking could use some tweaks too but it is fun and scary
yelled at somebody to move out the way then proceeded to get body slammed to the ground amazing game
This game made me get friends holy hell
8 10
Excellent Co-op game Very hard indeed
Best co-op shooter after Borderlands
This game really highlights the mental disabilities of your friends 10/10
I didn't make it out
GTFO Great Things For Overyone
you could get really agresive while playing this game but its fun and very good
this game is fun to play with your friends and by yourself although it may be challenging
I recommend this game to any one who enjoys pain suffering and is disgusted about society Its perfect for any one who wants a friendly and wholesome coop experience you'll learn friendship and going together on nice walks holding hands on the beach
10 out of 10 ALARMS
Highly Recommend with Friends but it needs a full squad of 4 Super satisfying when you complete a level
Better than Overwatch

Shit game and the people are faggots
its gtfo
Got yelled at for how I placed my trip mines and blew up the entire team would do it again
Great game graphics are dope the eeriness is awesome creates one hell of a creepy environment and really puts you and your team to the test however this game is only good with a team the AI are terrible to run with
Few Good thing I wasn't alone
I love me a good challenge But make sure to bring a few people
this game is alright but if you die replaying the mission is boring af maybe if i just get better and more experienced it would be more fun
Fun to Play With randoms Have to work in team to pass missons Only bad part is when you die you have NO checkpoint but its fine as long as you keep learning because it makes it more realistic Fun/action/team/communication/Mediumlevel
GAME DOPE ASF BUT SADLY ITS DEAD THE MAKERS DROP THIS GAME SO HARD
I LOVE GTFO I LOVE GTFO I LOVE GTFO I LOVE GTFO I LOVE GTFO I LOVE GTFO I LOVE THE ONE ENEMY THAT MANAGES TO WAKE UP THE ENTIRE ROOM I LOVE GTFO I LOVE GTFO I LOVE GTFO I LOVE GTFO I LOVE GTFO I LOVE GTFO
lovely game full of love and cat
topzom
it is very nice games and it is VERY CHALLENGES YOU MUST HAVE 4 PLAYERS WITH YOU I highly recommend to bring your friend with you and play with you Bot sometime can be god tier sh*t when they can't do the work with you you need to understand the map complete with your team or one mistake can cost you a lots and start over neither way you can go sneak and collect or blasting and gunning and get rekt for the door watch out they can be VERY FRIGGING PAINFUL to deal with if you don't turn off the alert I wish this game have achievement
Un jeu coop comme on en fait rarement
Jogo do paradoxo vc precisa de amigos pra jogar mas se vc jogar com amigos perde amizades e de amigos pra jogar
betrayal
This game scratches a very very specific itch that I never knew I had Every singular thing is tightly designed and tuned The stealth system is tough but fair the guns are impactful and feel good to use the exploration is fun the satisfaction you get from good teamwork is top-tier I am almost 24 hours in and have only completed 2 levels but I am having so much fun Even with only two people everything in this game shines The little details of this game really make it shine the gore system the fact that you can see what your compatriots are typing in the terminals the fact that your allies can see through your night vision sight when you're not using it the way the enemies alert to your presence The only reason I'm not saying buy it right now is because you really do need at least one other person to really make it fun But if you can rope a friend into playing it pick it up and get ready for some really difficult stealth co-op shooter gameplay
A fantastic game full of suspense Playing this game with bots is near impossible but with a team of players it's still a challenge If you play this game you need to be well coordinated and trust one another By far one of if not the most difficult games I have ever played Managing resources like ammo is vital stealth is the only way to play If you want a real challenge for you and 3 friends then play GTFO
fix yo game
unforgettable levels
Very good but you need to have four players otherwise its just not doable
i like the revolver it's got a very chunky mouthfeel
pew pew but nightmares
if you get this game you got to bring 3 of your boys with you the screams and laughs will be endless
issa gud
This game was incredibly well made by such an unknown company that is 10 Chambers This is a multiplayer shooter horror game and it fits it's genre perfectly normally the moment you add other people to the game it becomes less horrific but this game is an exception Every moment it has an intense and spooky atmosphere The Enemy design is superb the level design is well made and tells quite the story There are people out there with dumb issues that can be easily handled simply by changing how you play and what you do A list of the most frequent complains I hear are the following Matchmaking is terrible the bots are dumb this game is too hard these missions are taking way too long ect Whatever the case is it is just a person trying to complain about something so good There are somethings that may not allow groups of players to be able to play these are many but not exclusively 30 minute to 3.5 hour long missions depending on the difficulty and how many side objectives you do graphic requirements and strobe effects There are some bugs but they are incredibly rare There are a large array of features in this game but I will only name the most used and known Large Arrays of weapons cosmetic options Zero micro transactions many types of regular and alarm doors good cut scenes optional objectives 30 missions of varying difficulty levels and a large amount of enemies 9/10 Would greatly recommend A note to any 10 Chambers get the community more involved in suggestions at least after the final rundown has been released to the public my personal recommendation a level creator
Buggy game.Aside from that though Imagine you're playing red light-green light with a stick and if any of the 12 lights turn red while you move you have to fight off a swarm of repetitive and poorly designed enemies that function like hostile roaches with the appearance of a humanoid tumor Basic body horror designs that boil down to overblown protrusions and/or body parts such as teeth or tentacles are the most diverse function they hold otherwise they will function with a very simple attack pattern that you could find in a mobile game Even the swarms feel worthless because the gun play feels like a cheap COD Advanced Warfare with a severe lack of ammo Maybe if the game functioned like a sci-fi horror tarkov/stalker that featured a more dynamic weapon system as well as completely overhauled enemies it would feel like the scavenger-recon mission I had been hoping for As it currently stands I would say the game is worth 9.99 base price and i would say to only buy it if it was at least half off and you have friends to play with Currently I payed 6 times what its worth and have nothing but complaints The ONLY meh thing about this game that is somewhat creative or entertaining are the tools/sneaking system But they are literally inferior to Tom Clancy splinter cell or rainbow six from 2003.two decades behind the curve on the key features that you added to an inferior Killing Floor 2 is a cheap cash grab not worth 10 dollars and certainly not worth 40 I coulda bought a really nice dinner for this price that would have made my week but instead I am gonna contemplate whether or not i wanna sell my PC because the gaming industry is full of hacks who produce half assed shit like this By the time I had given it the most patient analysis I could muster concluding I had wasted my time I was horrified to discover I'd already surpassed 2 hours
im terrified 3
Hier ist es empfohlen mit Freunden zu spielen und Design ist gut Gruseligkeit das Genre Sound passt zum Geschehen Es hat aber keinen Dopamin Effekt man kriegt am ende der abgeschlossenen Mission ne Jacke oder Hose Man hat alle Waffne schon freigeschaltet Der Weg ist auch Teil Des Rennens nicht nur das Ziel keine mit Waffen keine oder Stats die K.I Bots sind mehr K als I Mit einem Freundeskreis kann man es sich geben aber Solo rate ich davon ab Deswegen kann ich es leider nicht den Max Mustermann Empfehlen
Never stabbed so many asses before 10/10
loved it
WE'RE SHAGGED
they are all naked i"m scared
If You Play This Game With People With Down Syndrome You Can Not Beat The 1st Level Out Of The 49 Levels And Did I Mention That There Are 7 ROOMS More To Come Overall Good Experience
KFC catapulted his chickens at the roof and alerted all sleepers Don't be like KFC
It is fun
Good but make sure you have people to play it with
If you hate yourself and want to induce a stress-caused heart attack play this game
Moneygrabbers first 2 maps are difficult and last 2 hours IRL so that ur not able to refund
Do you enjoy spending 45 minutes crouch walking through a dark area while hating yourself just to be murdered by an unreasonably large swarm of enemies at the very end of the the mission Then this is the game for you For real though nothing about this game is fun If you're looking to blow some money at least spend it on something enjoyable
This game is really something else Quiet a unique experience a mix of survival horror exploration shooting and teamwork It really does a good work setting the scene makes the player feel as if he was on the prisoners skin while it givers small hints of the overall mystery of the lore Currently there is a nice amount of different missions items and overall variations of gameplay Absolutely recomend this game as it is trully one of a kind imo Cheers
Really good shooter i like this game
If you have a group of friends to play with and you enjoy challenging and difficult games then I have to recommend this piece The design of the game is simple but effective Fun mix of gunplay and stealth good variety of enemies and tasks and levels go from quite easy to absurdly difficult The lack of resources makes teamplay vital for success Sound design and graphics are satisfying 9/10

b TL;DR b GTFO is an awesome game with excellent execution with adequate twists on the FPS tropes/cliches Truly a Tactical Horror worth playing with friends Up to 4 player If you don't have a team I highly recommend to check out the GTFO Discord b Unique Aesthetic and Visuals b GTFO's visuals and aesthetics are unlike any other FPS game out there blending many artistic elements together to produce a truly unique horror game GTFO takes inspiration from certain sci-fi horror elements such as H.R Giger's specifically Biomechanical artstyle where biology is integrated with machinery as one the Lovecraftian Cosmic Horror feel to the horrid monsters infesting the complex or even the futuristic brutalist architecture/design with small hints of other architectural styles for variety in the level design just to name some elements I have seen Furthermore GTFO slaps a meaty amount of flavour text jargon and info-graphics into its HUD menus and world design creating what I like to call an Info-centric artstyle All these elements together produce such an excellent vibe to complement the horror and sense of unknown within GTFO b Sound Design and Ambience b GTFO's Sound Design is simply phenomenal distinct realistic and enhances the game GTFO understands that it is at heart a Tactical Horror game and the sound physics compliment this well Every action Player or enemy produces stereo sound which echoes with an appropriate amount of ambience creating a realistically believable and satisfying atmosphere which enhances the auditory feeling of GTFO The weaponry has nice percussive and distinct sounds allowing players to tell what weapon their teammates are firing by sound alone and the meaty sound when the bullets hit enemies or blow away body parts is juicy Additionally bullet casings have stereo sound when they hit the floor Every enemy sound within GTFO was created by heavily distorting and editing real human voices which creates a recognisably human yet monstrously mutated sound profile Furthermore certain enemy types have distinct sounds which allows players to recognise their enemy by sound alone i.e the loud bassy thumping of larger enemy hearbeats/footsteps Hell even the alert roar of the horde is directional and is different depending on the type/amount of enemies that are coming for you Additionally enemies make certain sounds during their telegraphed attacks or abilities giving the player information even if they can't see which is helpful due to the lack of visibility and abundance of darkness in GTFO On the other hand the facilities alarms and TTS coms are punchy and inorganic These sounds usually disrupt the quiet ambience of the mission and with them they bring a sense of dread and thrill as you know the alarm on the objective necessary door has alerted the horde All together the unique Sound Design and Ambience of GTFO enhances the auditory feel of the game and even serves as a decent means of information gathering to the player highlighting the tactical intrinsic of GTFO b Gameplay and Teamwork b GTFO's gameplay is somewhat distinct despite being another FPS and the crucial need for Teamwork is paramount to avoid failure GTFO may be an FPS but it attempts to throw twists into the formula to spice up its FPS elements GTFO takes a conservative approach to guns where you as the player are advised and rewarded for limiting the use of weaponry where ever possible due to the scarcity of ammunition and abundance of enemies This dynamic also pressures the player to make every shot count and certain enemies increase this tense pressure This to me is GTFO's successful portrayal of the pressure of wielding a modern weapon the expectation and anticipation to fight and the stress of logistics not typically found in other FPS titles GTFO then takes this a step further and introduces the importance of visibility as a form of knowledge to your aim Certain levels/rooms are simply pitch black or covered in fog which at times can be infectious Even when your visibility is fine at times there are shadow enemies which are hard to spot without sufficient lighting or gear This makes landing your shots even harder due to your hindered vision requiring you to stock up on utilities such as glowsticks fog turbines bio trackers or bring weapons with better flashlights/sights if you wish to enhance your visibility This importance of visibility I feel is an overlooked part of the FPS genre Not many FPS titles dip into visibility or lack thereof as much as GTFO does Work Together or Die Together is an incredibly apt slogan for GTFO To complete a mission in GTFO you and your team will need to understand move and react quickly and skilfully to any given situation and be able to adequately plan ahead before continuing The level of teamwork required becomes more and more demanding as you progress deeper into any rundown with the A levels being beginner friendly and D-E levels requiring decent teamwork skill reactions and target priority Another part to GTFO's teamwork is the importance of resource management/logistics Communication with your team allocating inventory and asking for appropriate resources when necessary helps immensely when it comes to improving your longevity and attrition In conclusion GTFO's gameplay attempts to create a somewhat unique FPS experience through unusual by industry/trope standard methods and demands an increasing level of individual and team competence b Story and Lore b GTFO's story is well hidden within the game through out the hefty flavour texts world objects missions etc trying to draw upon corporate secrecy and classified information as it's main draw on the player I feel that the sense of discovery and secrecy really pulls you into the rabbit hole of GTFO's story but I won't explain that here to remain spoiler free I will however give you a tip if you wish to discover the story for yourself Check Terminal Logs and take in the details of your surroundings/objects during missions

One of the best games I've played so far 10/10
Erm.i think its time we pack our things and.GTFO
Stay calm and collected because the adrenaline rush that fucking up gives could put you in crutches The tagline stays forever true you really must work together listen to the vets and learn from them mastering the set-up to alarms and understanding the terminal will put you 40 done with the level the rest is down to mechanical skill and boy do you need it especially for missions lower down
No handholding Bought this with a friend and we struggled so hard for the first 3 missions Now we get to teach our other friends how to play Trust me the tagline is true together or die
Its a great game just wish I had friends who had it
It's a fun rogue-like game squad game that has an awesomely hard difficulty to it definitely one of my favorites
A brutally difficult co-op shooter Be ready to get absolutely pulverized by the enemies consistently It's also terrifying

This is the terrifying tactical shooter than any group of friends needs to play together at least once it will either make or break your friend group
GTFO is a hardcore first person view shooter but developers team consisted from 1 programmer and 99 janitors didn't noticed that hardcore doesn't mean not optimized dysinced gameplay with 3 friends who wanted to test their cooperation skills and as a result check which mission the most playble p.s The passage of the mission takes several hours so that you do not have time to return the money for the game
Everyone ready dies in the most horrible way imaginable

I think we need to get out of here
Go in as blind as possible look up nothing have adrenaline filled encounters and get scared by new monsters
oh man I really love this game its frustating but ADDICTING even tho you failed many times you will be addicted to try since the graphics and game mechanism are insanely GREAT Once you success survived from a mission you will be rewarded with Cosmetic to indicate that you have succeeded its just Cosmetic no Stats Effects so far No OP Over Powered weapon in this game so there will be no Perfect Weapon Im sure the developer purposely did this to make the game difficult Some weapon like Shotgun and Machine need to charge for a few seconds first before shooting No Flamethrower No somekind of Exploding Frag Grenased to easily hurt swarm enemies The HQ did not packed us with Medkit since the beginning Can not deactivate Friendly Fire Can not change the difficulty setting This game updating fast I know the developer really worked hard for it I will continue play this game Thanks for reading
Just shy of 50 hours I can say this is a very well done game If you have a team and what to be CHALLENGED then you're in the right place The game is hard which to me is a huge appeal Hours can be wasted by one mistake but that only adds to the fun once you do succeed The looting component is enough where you are looting only a few different items but the scarcity and situation-dependence makes opening every locker/chest worth the effort The graphics are well done and can be run on most machines the levels are different in many ways and the sounds are also excellent Definitely one to keep you on your toes and have you losing your cool at times as death runs at you I do hope the rundowns continue to take on the feel of the earlier release rundowns where there was an element of plot to them The new rundowns do lack in that component but I may not be far enough into the deep yet to see if there are dots that can be connected 10/10 would recommend
10/10
Invited friends but can't start the game I fell out of the tutorial area place too buggy lol
love it
one of the scariest games i've played scary because i'm not sure my friends are competent enough to help me beat it
great horror game to play with friends or some what solo great game overall
Very fun
GTFO is a horror-stealth-cooperative-tactics game that prides itself on being exceptionally challenging I would recommend this game because it delivers an experience entirely unlike anything else In the majority of situations you will need to silently dispatch enemies to avoid wasting resources on fights and enemies You will need to prepare for alarm sequences that awaken enemies with tactical ideas such as holding choke points reinforcing doors and moving as a group to cover one another Terminals require you to enter commands manually to search for objects throughout a level and complete objectives Right off the bat this is probably one of my favorite cooperative games out there It is extremely polished and is very unique in many parts of the game and receives free updates many times a year that bring new levels enemies and weapons to play with The developers should absolutely be commended for sticking to their roadmap and promises as they have already delivered many of them There isn't any form of monetization past the price on the game itself and you start with every tool and weapon unlocked already only earning cosmetic items for completing levels The developers have also stated that microtransactions will never be a part of the game although DLC supporter packs are not entirely out of the question This is fair for this game as it is around half the price of a AAA game and delivers free updates on a semi-regular basis Talking about the game itself many aspects are done extremely well Audio and Visual design is first-class it runs great and looks great on basically every system aside from complete potatoes Each level is designed to focus on a certain element of the game and really push itself bringing a very unique experience in every level you play Cheese strategies have mostly been ironed out although a few exist which helps the game be more grounded in teamwork in my opinion A common argument is that the game is simply too difficult for people with a limited friend group This is entirely fair and it becomes almost impossible for an average single person to beat a C or D-tier level even with bots However this game explicitly states that it is cooperative in mind and design so the ample warnings kind of discredit this argument Still it is valid criticism Another argument is that levels designed after checkpoints were introduced take an absolutely insane amount of time to complete at a minimum of a hour and a half up to three or four and a half This can make scheduling time to do these levels challenging and is really inaccessible for those that may not have time to sit down and play this game Even in earlier designed shorter levels one should still expect an hour and half for the majority of these levels to be completed excluding failed attempts This game really is not friendly for those that want to pick up and put down games quickly such as those that may travel a lot In short here are some key points to consider if you're playing this game h1 Key Points to Consider h1 Pros The game is very well designed in level audio visual and general gameplay aspects There is plenty of tactical depth and teamwork is required instead of encouraged There is a lot of content to go through for each tier of difficulty Weapon balance is very good and you can choose based on comfort and strategy there isn't really a hard meta Consumer-friendly practices by the developers and new content every couple of months at least in the past year there was a lot of drama regarding modding and datamining when the game first came out The game is very well polished and exceeds that of AAA games very few bugs or issues Cons The game is extremely difficult for many people Some may find the game to be confusing and convoluted Average solo players will not be able to access much of the content in later levels There is no meta-progression elements this is debatable as a con though Levels can take extremely long to complete it is not friendly to pick up or put down quick This game has a niche audience but I would highly recommend giving a try and seeing if you like it
gud
It's like deep rock galactic but instead of getting rich i'm learning coding trying to find some red key
slow immersive game with horror elements creating a feeling of scarcity that leaves you terrified at what could be lucking in the dark fog next to you

Genuinely one of the scariest games I've ever played Not because of the monsters or the caves But because i have to trust my friends to act competent
Ur not built for these rundowns son
Absolutely unoptimized on a 2060 with medium graphic settings I'm barely getting 40 fps while being in training mode not even matchmaking lmfao Recommended settings GTX 1060 my PC is choking with 2060 RTX what a joke Waiting for my refund
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH I AM SCARED AND PISSING MYSELF PLEASE I AM SORRY FOR KILLING THAT GUY IT WASN'T WORTH IT I WANT OUT
I love this game I really do But when I spend a hour on a mission just for Hackett to run directly into a crowd of monsters at the end when escape is LITERALLY in sight kills the vibe 10/10 both my character and I have an unstable mental status now
Hello everyone after 600 hours of GTFO I can say something about the game for people who want to buy it Okay this is a hard team based shooter where you have to adapt for upcoming shit 1 Team Communication is the key here you need a good team for many levels cause the game does not adapt the level If you drop alone or as a duo the game won`t give a shit about that and u will have to fight your way trough all the enemies And yes there are some chinese ultra high tier players that are soloing every single level without shooting and taking damage but I am not one of them and I guess u too so better find a team And A microphone is highly recommended not needed but highly recommended as I said comms are very important if you run out of ammo during an alarm u will have to say that to your teammates Your only option will be the text chat and trust me you do not watch the text chat while shooting the enemies How to find a team If you dont have friends like me then the official discord server is your solution There are many players searching for a game sometimes it is hard to find a lobby for high tier levels but not impossible Then we have matchmaking no one uses it and it is dead I honestly dont know why people are complaining that the the matchmaking system isnt working No one needs it cause u have the discord server Community The community on the discord server is pretty nice If u have questions problems or want to discuss something u will find people to talk with 2 Gameplay Each rundown has multiple missions some objectives are the same and some very unique But many times u play like this Go quiet meeling al the enemies and clear room after room use guns only if you fuck up and wake up everything or doing alarms Clearing rooms requires sometimes killing multiple enemies at the same time and that is also where communication is required In the beginning menu u will have to choose which weapons tools and boosters u want to take in order to complete the level Sometimes we even give ourselves roles example one man takes high caliber and goes for big enemies and the others control the waves machineguns assaultrifles etc 3 Graphics Well the graphics are not something insane u can clearly see low resolution textures but the game hides it by making the levels very dark And to be fair it is very good cause it creates a very dark and depressed atmosphere supported by the unknown of the level limted supplies screams etc The cosmetics in this game are okay there are cool backpacks and gasmasks but some of them have the same 3D model and only a different color The gun design is in my opinion very good they look very realistic and every gun has its own unique 3D scope The HUD is integrated as a projection in your gasmask it looks very good and if u kill an enemie close u will see blood floating down your mask Or after u change the mag u can see it on the floor The level design is okay many of them are rooms and corridors with many doors however sometimes its different 4 Bugs There are bugs the game is out of early access but in my opinion it should be still in it Many of them are visual bugs that are not critical ans sometimes even funny Some bugs can save u the run and some will end it However the critical bugs are very very annoying Examples visual rendering bug black dot u will have a blackscreen for a few minutes then it goes away crashes connection problems and desync stuck enemies in walls foam glitch where the foam flies trough the door and makes it impossible to hold the position enemies spawns sometimes spawn direct in front of your face or wrong amount of spawned enemies R7D1 especially and finally luck dont get me wrong but R5 especially is based more on your luck then on your skill if a scan goes to deep or it moves to slow u can restart if in R7E1 you wont find enough ammopacks in the reactor u are fucked Stuff like that is only on a few levels but for gods sake sometimes I want break my monitor because we were unlucky and died after 2 hours of a smooth run Coclusion The game is unforgiving mistakes or bad teamplay but at the same time it challenges you and pushes u to the limits the feeling after u finished a hard run is something else All in all if you want a challenge team based gameplay and u are ready to tolerate bugs u are welcome in the deep and dark complex slaaaves
Game sucks you in big time Awesome aesthetic Gun play and sneaking feels great Very punishing but feels super rewarding if you and your team get out
its very kool
So HARD D
My friend whit whom I play GTFO with told me that if I post a review about GTFO and it gets 222 likes and 52 awards he will buy me a pack of beer and some vodka So I'll leave this here
i hate this game so much
Get it it fun it spook it fast it slow it good
This game is unbelievable There are reviews that talk about how it will take an ungodly amount of time to beat a single level and they are absolutely correct Let's just say the first mission took my group of friends 4-5 hours to finally beat At 9.6 hours of playtime we have beaten only 3 levels There are a ton of things to learn and master It's a hardcore game this is not for the weak Your friendships WILL be tested to the MAX 10/10 definitely recommend if you hate yourself or your friends
scary fun
Challenging and enjoyable
I play this game with some friends They really don't like stealth Wanna know what they do like Waking up entire rooms by themselves We are no longer friends
scary af good game tho
i literally do not have the physical time in my life to play this game but i bought it anyway because its good asf EDIT I JUST BEAT MY FIRST RUNDOWN WITH MY BROTHER IM SO HAPPPPY THIS GAME IS THE BEST
Very scary made me lose my faith in humanity At the time I am writing this it is 2:37 am I woke up drenched in sweat and hard as a rock I still have nightmares about project mugetsu being in maintenance for 3 days but anyway there is no e 30 has sent his mods after me because I said the wrong line in his script I am now boarding a plane that will take me to Australia I should be safe there.at least for a little e 30 said these word exactly incinerate now I am the most wanted man on the planet.there is no hope.I have been in my bunker for approximately 362 days now running low on food and water I also have no friends so slowly going insane I made a friend today tho his name is terry and he is a rat he keeps me company but going to have to eat him soon due to the lack of food Any I have said too much and I think the mods are slowly closing in on my they are looking for me Hunting me is chopstix143 going dark Day 389 I have managed to make some successful supply runs although I encounter one of nick e it was a long and hard fight but I gave him multiple back shots so he is down for the count I am also insaine now haha I had to eat terry due to lack of food and now he is in a better e 30 has ruined my life but enough about him the are close they are listen
Very good and addicting game i recommend it
spooky
This game is one of the funniest horror games you can play with your friends You can either be extremely stealthy and try to do everything silently or try to go in guns blazing and somehow get through it or you can just take a Sniper rifle and roleplay Lee Harvey Oswald while waking up the entire room of enemies
its not worth but it is bloody horrifying 10/10 would shit myself again also the matchmaking kinda bad takes 20 mins to get a match that dosent have some chineese dude that don't know what teamwork is and is generally just crap at the game yeah i geuss the tables have turned don't buy unless you have freinds that have the game too
HARD CORE SHOOTING HORROR GAME really good game
This is an obsessively specialized game one dedicated to its vision and the delivering of that oppressive volatile experience of exploring SCP-like environments It goes to extreme lengths to do so something rarely seen in games of such production values If anything else GTFO is tremendously successful at achieving this goal UI sound combat enemies weapons art even the menus are single-mindedly geared toward this purpose which I cannot help but admire As a player it is an experience I can only describe as highly polarizing depending on your own sensibilities It is the poster child of a game made to purpose one which is unapologetically comfortable with being hated by many so it can be adored by others It is a packed menu of stealth intense combat very low resources during long missions with a focus on exploration under the constant threat of harsh failure It is a unique offering servicing an under-served niche from which people will derive drastically different experiences The game endlessly shifts between high-stakes stealth that require a high degree of cooperation and communication and crap inevitably hitting the fan as things escalate in a glorious cacophony of screams and gunfire As someone who enjoys group play and difficult games this has been a joy for me If you are lucky as I am to have friends to play it with who can remain relaxed and positive in the face of failure and if you enjoy the sort of lore and atmosphere every pore of this game is dripping with this is a no-brainer especially on sale The content to be found there is immense However it must be said that GTFO still has one problematic blind spot when it comes to grouping if you do not have a circle of friends This game is not made for solo players with bots barely functioning correctly The in-game matchmaking is all but dysfunctional and thus GTFO openly tells you to use its Discord to find other players This is a very clunky way of finding groups compared to titans of the co-op genre such as VT2 or DRG While this was entirely okay during the game's Early Access phase I do not think the lack of a server browser flies for a commercial release This is also made worse by the problems inherent to relying on Discord if you somehow get banned from that server or service or encounter other issues your ability to enjoy GTFO is going to be severely hindered Thus be warned that this is a potential massive issue depending on your own situation With all that being said this game has already brought me hours of fun with friends and we feel like we have barely scratched the surface On sale this is a steal for anyone even remotely seduced by the atmosphere tense stealth and chaotic firefights by the idea of long and claustrophobic missions for which the reward succeed or fail will always be the same hard-earned fun
Bio Scan Frame here
Get the fuck out
Took 6 hours just to finish the first level
Beat the first lvl after 17 tries screamed with my friends raged and kicked my child Basically the game is just killing naked Hellen Kellers Cum launcher goes BRRR 11/10
The FPS Is Insane and full of horror/action
p
A great game however if you don't have friends to play with it makes it around 100X harder
Very good game with friends
I did not get this game for free 10/10
The reviews didnt lie it will take you hours to finish the first mission and it only gets worse from there 10/10
them screamer tentacle guys suck 5/7 would descend again but repetitive bleck
Challenging and fun with a group of friends Especially if they are serious about clearing areas Can be a bit nerve racking as well Take your time and plan out moves I think you'll enjoy this game very much
sim
h1 Un vrai banger h1 Le seul c'est qu'il faut minimum 3 pour que soit ok deux encore c'est faisable mais beaucoup moins fun et tactique En gros le but du jeu c'est de remplir un objectif dans une map grande avec des genre de monstres qui sont dans la map Sur le papier c'est simple mais c'est super bien La meilleure le jeu c'est d'y aller en mode furtif s'approcher lentement des monstres sans se faire pour les au CAC Mais il y a plusieurs types de monstres et je ne vais pas spoiler ici mais vous devrez adapter votre et vous coordonner avec vos super rapidement selon le/les monstres auxquels vous avez faire Mais si vous arrivez discret tout le long vous devrez obligatoirement certains moments vous taper une horde affronter comme pour certaines portes pour la suite du niveau qui sont d'une alarme Et c'est la que toute la du jeu les ressources votre disposition Vous avez la les munitions les munitions de votre arme Qui sont en gros les principales ressources trouver parce que vous aurez peu de munitions peu de vie et vos tourelles ou arme ont besoin de se recharger Pour se faire il faut fouiller la map pour trouver des caisses ou casiers peuvent se trouver des kits de rechargement Par exemple vous pouvez trouver un kit de rechargement de de 2 ce qui signifie que vous n'avez que 2 recharges de 20 de a prendre pour vous ou a donner vos et c'est le pour les munitions Donc le jeu va se jouer 100 en il faut partager les ressources et intelligemment en fonction du loadout que vous avez choisi au Donc vous devrez utiliser des terminaux pour trouver l'objet que vous venus chercher et peut prendre 30 mins ou plus d'arriver l'objet et une fois que vous avez cet objet absolument TOUT les monstres de la map savent vous et vont vous foncer dessus pendant que vous essayez de regagner le de la partie pour vous extraire Encore une fois la gestion des ressources va la car si vous n'avez plus de munitions ce moment c'est fini pour vous et vous devez TOUT recommencer GROS GROS point positif c'est que le jeu ne que 15go je crois et vu le contenu c'est vraiment incroyable En gros il y a 6 missions par chapitre et 6 chapitres en tout donc 36 missions peut peu mais les missions sont super dures et avec 2 on a mit plus de 2h passer la mission En plus de le jeu est toujours mit jour avec du contenu gratuit qui est normalement vendu 20 euros en DLC chez d'autres jeux Et toute la DA du jeu et le game design sont vraiment au top On se retrouve vraiment pas avec un jeu classique mais il est exigeant ultra fun sur la et la en En vrai je ne l'aurai jamais 40 euros mais franchement si vous le trouvez 20 euros c'est un must-have
great game unlike my friends intelligence
239 hours playtime and still haven't completed the entire game 10/10
runs great even on old software hours upon hours of endless entertainment and a shitload of different levels to complete which will take arguably weeks depending on how much of a social life you have
just die
Fun game with friends and not that scary
Did ONE guy in your party missclick and wake up a room Did you misplace your turret by ONE degree You lose But it's fun
dead game
Totalnie od tej gry,jest dla mnie zbyt absurdalnie i nudne
the real gtfo were the friends we made along the way
GET THE FUCK OUT
Good game dont suggest it for those who have no idea how to handle frustration Also if you play this you are probably partially a masochist
hard asf
10/10 cooperative game
Breathe air
i would rather have my entire family be burned at the stake before i have to play this game once again
ganzo
My balls dropped cause i was doing great then i ran out of ammo 10/10 Would recommend perfect if you need a transgender surgery
Glitchy but still worth it
Muito bom imersivo divertido e desafiador

10/10 would never play again Only play this game if you hate yourself because you will hate yourself even more Thanks 10 chambers I have to go see a therapist now
Bello tosto Io e i miei amici lo giochiamo dacche era in Alpha Gioco che sa davvero metterti ansia e tensione ma che sa dare anche tante soddisfazioni quando vinci Missioni davvero lunghe a volte impieghiamo anche di 1 ora a rundown e non sempre ci sono checkpoint Ogni membro della squadra meglio se non bot di vitale importanza per aiutare ad affrontare la missione Per essere efficaci ognuno deve avere un compito ben preciso e la strategia d'azione dev'essere ben studiata per affrontare lo scenario a ca**o duro difficilmente vinci Azioni stealth tattiche di raggiro e mosse combinate con la squadra spesso sono la strategia migliore o almeno lo per noi Dopo anni di gameplay devo dire che ancora non ci ha mai stancato
Wanted this game for years looked really fun but after playing not really that interested nor was it as interesting as i thought it would be No real progression system not much to go for and its really really slow paced i dont personally recommend it its an ok game if you like this kinda game but idk just kinda boring im ok with slow games but this like just feels like crawling through a glue trap its so slow
Great game if you can get yourself a 3-4 man squad Most levels you can do with 2 people but the A.I is not very helpful and is always using up resources when you do not really need to use them hence best with a squad There is a few things that the developers need to work on but I would recommend as a fun game to play with mates
A great game with friends Apart from the one who woke the big one Say it with me boys Fuck You Whiskey
Hard but if you have some good friends and some patience it's an awesome experience
Yup
For a game that boasts about its stealth and tense gameplay it really falls short of silenced weapons 10/10 the devs know how to screw their player-base That aside the game's environment is top notch and the gameplay is stressful yet somehow fun and rewarding
Hard but rewarding Team oriented Very fun but a little stressful
If you like being tortured beat and sexually abused by a scout this is the game for you
Numerous OSHA violations A few pulsating worm ceilings some torn out doors that need some C-foam to smooth out Half of these cretins aren't even wearing hard hats Still the game scratches an itch I can't describe Highly recommend especially if you have friends to play with
I am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 14 now My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories
Designed to be very hard but if you enjoy a challenge it is the perfect coop zombie game Has a very good mix of stealth/suspense/action Monsters become more varied and interesting the further you progress Make sure you play this with some friends to get the most out of it 10/10
Awesome game Very immersive
Do you like BDSM gaming This game is the FPS version of it It's bugged it's hard and it doesn't forgive but somehow you come again to play each rundown
bro just read the name get the flip out
i give it 5 eur max
cbt but cooperative

4 player co-op is required very difficult and punishing stealth recourse management and teamwork are extremely important

11/10
While only accounting for 13 of the population they commit 56 of the crimes
save the world but bad lol
Amazing Game I would recommend this game to anyone though I would suggest having 4 people to play with but it is possible with only 2
Matchmaking broken AI dont work
Amazing game
vse
I died
god i wanted to be able to play this game it looks hella cool and all but fuck me on the image dubbleing dog shit gave me a migraine i get that its part of the game but fuck me their should be a accessibility function to turn that shit off
Fun with friends idk if I would play solo
boring as fuck
great game to play with your 4 stack the difference of IQ among your teammates determines if you'll become better or worse friends
Best co-op game out there
qn pa jugar Compralo
if you enjoy crying this is the game for you
cool i guess
funny eldritch horrors
Hard as steel to survive with a random grp but great game and very intense The level design is different for each Rundown but there are sub rundowns that kinda feel copy and paste The enemies are numerous with each's own way to not set em off Hoping they bring more into the game as game develops
This game is an incredibly fun mix of survival and cooperative stealthing It's fun engaging and there's a ton of skill to actually completing the levels Gather up some friends and give it a run or fill in the gaps on the discord
40 10 10
The netcode is actually shit You'd strictly need friends within the same region for your games to work properly I tried playing a game with a friend from Europe everything got super laggy Enemies weren't moving my friend was somehow able to phase through doors when they weren't open for me I can't deal damage and I can't interact with anything If you are looking for a game that is reliable to play with friends from other regions save your money and look for something else
Game Is pretty damn good at what it wants to be and the difficulty is high but manageable Bots are dogshit don't play with them unless it's just one AI is jank as all hell across the board works for the enemies not your teammates don't use em Make sure you always play in a group of 3-4 outside of those numbers good luck hope you can have a better experience with those brainless lemmings that love walking into your crosshair and putting holes in your back because they can't sit still for more than a second and love re-positioning Basically full group and no bots a good times with the bois
okay so first of all i absolutely love this game the story/lore is actually really interesting and the gunplay and sounds are honestly so damn good but you should honestly only get this game if you have friends to play it with but if you are an introvert like me then its gonna be difficult to find people for this game and yes their discord exists but i have social anxiety and such so its not easy for someone like me to just go in and be like whats up can i join even tho that this game is really good it still has its flaws and some of them are gigantic flaws there is still alot of game breaking bugs that have existed for over a year now where for example if you manage to get to a checkpoint and if you are carrying something heavy while activating the checkpoint and then do a team wipe and respawn at the checkpoint then you wont be able to drop said heavy item and you are just screwed there is work arounds but they are a pain in the ass to keep doing other than that great game just please fix these damn bugs
great game
very good game with friends

lvl R5 R4 R5
So I'm going to write a real review this time My last review was made in a bit of a rage as the game's terrible AI caused us to lose Just for reference My two friends and I have completed R1 all the way to R5D1 With the exception of about two E1 levels that we plan on coming back to later We also do every overload and secondary if the level has them I love this game however GTFO's philosophy around difficulty is actually kind of frustrating So much of GTFO's difficulty comes back around to blinding the player with fog Just about every level in every rundown after you hit layer C1 and over becomes a fog simulator It is really disappointing that the devs couldn't find a way to add difficulty beyond limiting the player's vision Most of the difficult levels become so gimmicky Survive with fog but this time the fog is denser than usual Survive with fog but this time you have no disinfection Survive with fog but this time you have no fog repellers/turbines Survive with fog but this time we spawn a tank every 4 minutes Survive with fog but this time activating the generators will make it worse The game ALWAYS comes back to fog being the main difficulty mechanic It's not unforgiving in its challenge it is boring though Imagine playing L4D2 but every map was in the sewers but with a tank spawning every 5 minutes Or Dark Souls had every map being a swamp but didn't give you any moss to cure poison It's doable just not entertaining Update We got stuck and lost to 3 tanks spawning near the end Couldn't do a bioscan because one of my friends got stuck inside the stairs near the exit Reviving and rejoining did not fix it
It's like aliens cross with last of us clickers cross with coop gameplay like a tactical shooter mixed with some left4dead cross with stealth on the level of early splinter cell You end up with a coop hardcore tactical stealth based shooter where you try to speedrun the missions as efficiently as possible to succeed with a variety of weapons tools equipments and mods that you bring with you to keep you alive while finding supplies within the mission to help you It's pretty fun the game is very intense that you may only be able to play the game a few times and actually need a break from Playing with live players is better than the CPUs as the coordination is much better and you don't stress over the CPUs doing things you don't want them to do and having to babysit them game could have some improvements like custom weapon that you can mod with certain parts more item/equipment variety stacking items together instead of having to grab a completely different item slightly better A.I with more commands There could be more that can improve the game but it's overall quite good Not suggested for those looking for a casual experience as the game is intense and maps can be maze-like with the game not holding your hand as you have to figure things out yourself Those with motion sickness may want to be wary as the game is super dark and sometimes super bright from light sources that could make some sick and disoriented
GTFO is one of the most challenging games i have ever played R5D1 i am tired of 5v5 moba and 5v5 fps games i just want to relax R4E1 after all that competitive games If you think this game is like l4d2 oh boy your in for a ride R5E1 For single player's If your gonna play the game alone cuz you don't have any friends it will be very hard you will mostly play with bots Or you can solo but alarm doors over level III will change your mind it shows how 1 person lacks to do everything themselves so you need help from the bots or players after all this is a team based game for a reason Rundowns There is only 7 rundowns which has several expeditions ranked with difficulty of A to E tier A tier You can win the whole A tier expedition with bots easily and you can solo some of the A tier expedition but not all of em And all tiers have main mission secondary overcharge You can win main mission with bots but you need real players for secondary and overcharge this applies to all tier's cuz secondary and overcharge makes the game very hard For example secondary and overcharge makes A tier like B or C tier B tier like C,D and so on B tier Spikes the difficulty up a little bit but you still can win the whole expedition with bots but it wont be that easy like A tier You can solo few B tier expedition but it will be very hard and time consuming Average time to complete an expedition for solo players takes over 2 to 3 hours and the time increase when tier's go up It will normally take 2 hour or less to win an expedition with bots With real players it will be an hour or less but only in A,B,C tier D,E and tier is built different C tier Is when you see the flaw of the game you cant't solo you need teamwork bots can't do that you need real people to win this tier and onward You can win some C tier with bots but it wont be like B tier And forget about soloing it Every rundown combined has over 14 success rate so you can see how difficult this game is And if you lose an expedition you lose all the progress u made in that expedition let's say u lost 2 hours of progress u do that from the beginning again 2 hours wasted quite hard isn't it cuz there is no checkpoint in this game only Rundown 6 And Rundown 7 have em so losing is not an option D tier Oh boy this is where hell starts you ain't gonna win D tier with bots You need 4 people to get a better chance of winning or at least having better experience of the game It's better to get destroyed with other people than getting wrecked with bots alone at least real people will know your pain And If you don't have any friends you can use the official GTFO discord server to find people to play with cuz the matchmaking in this gane doesn't work E tier Yeah chief i don't wanna talk about it You either GTFO together or die together
spooky
b ALARMS STARTS BLARING b My character i That is the sound of death coming for us i
Extremely tactical and very fun
Nothing like spending an hour of your life being a ninja only for your friend to step on a creature straight out of lovecraft and ruin the run over all great time
game good love it
fun times killing aliens
very fun and very adorable love when the unicorns shoot sprinkles onto the ice cream mountain
This is a very fun and amazing game if you like strategic shooter games Though friends are very necessary at a point as the bots are not great I intentionally kill the bot Hackett at the end of the level if he messes it up for me Skynet will hate me But I will have stopped the Infection The story here is actually very Dark Souls-esque in that it is not shoved at you but is rather something you largely have to find in-game using computer terminals and such If you have 2-3 friends to play with routinely the game is hella awesome fun 9/10 If you do not have friends to play with it is still good but the bots will fail you The devs Discord server is generally used for helping with matchmaking by the core playerbase
Oui j'adore
Great game but heres a Creme Brulee recipe 6 large egg yolks 1/3 cup 70 grams granulated sugar 2 cups 480 ml heavy whipping cream 1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 tablespoons 25 grams granulated sugar for the topping Preheat the oven to Place a large pot of water on the stove to boil In a large mixing bowl whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until well blended and it just starts to lighten in color Set aside Pour the heavy whipping cream in a medium-sized saucepan and heat over medium heat Stir occasionally until the cream is warm and bubbling around the edges Remove the cream from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract Slowly pour about 1/2 cup of the warm heavy whipping cream into the egg and sugar mixture making sure to whisk well as you're pouring it in Then slowly pour in the remaining cream and continue whisking until fully combined If there's a thin layer of foam on top of the mixture you can skim this off with a spoon at this point Strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer then evenly distribute between four 6-ounce ramekins Pour the boiling water into an 8-inch square baking pan or larger pan if you prefer about 1/3 of the way full Carefully place the ramekins in the baking dish The water should come about halfway up the sides of the ramekins If needed add a little more boiling water to the pan Carefully place the baking pan in the oven Bake at for 35 to 45 minutes or until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly Remove from the oven and carefully remove the ramekins from the pan using tongs or pot holders and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely Once cooled cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight Once chilled blot the tops of each custard with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture Sprinkle 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of sugar on top of each custard shake it around into one even layer then use a small kitchen torch to carefully caramelize the sugar Allow the sugar to harden for 1 to 2 minutes then serve and enjoy or refrigerate for a few hours until ready to serve
dont shut doors in your friends faces and youll be fine
This game made my Johnson hard the first time i played it
Un juego increible al que puedes jugar sin parar
if dark souls was a co-op shooter where everyone dies if anyone makes a mistake xD
One of the most hardcore and challenging game that I have ever played
Excellent game perfect to find another people to play w the price actually fits the game DEF RECCOMENDED
y
Is an interesting game but is very difficult and you can not be loud in anyway
Very good game very challenging game If you are looking for a tactical experience this is a game for you It heavily favors precision planning and learning on level playthroughs Even when you fail which you will i]a lot[/i you can still count it as progress in an abstract sense as you often gain knowledge or progressed deeper than you did before There is a variety of guns and tools at your disposal but the most important one is your teammates Work Together or you will indeed Die Together
This is the only game I know that really forces players to cooperate for victory Everyone's input matters Also the various gameplay elements like stealth gunplay melee and tactics all mesh very well together It's also challenging
This is soooo much fun with friends
great with friends but i dont have any
After some patches haven't run into the game breaking bug If you want a difficult co-op shooter with a little bit of stealth GTFO is ticks the boxes although I'd recommend having friends to play as the bots are quite useless Original review Game breaking bugs that force you to quit the game losing progress
very good sneaking game A lot of fun in team
Very slow paced and tactical until it isn't This game virtually requires a full 4-man team with good communication and coordination stealth and patience As soon as enemies are alerted prepare for a brutal wave of enemies who will shred through not only your body but your ammo count as well Highly recommend The most important thing though Sledgehammer go BONK
It's really good but you need 4 people in the later levels
This game is arguably the hardest coop shooter I've ever played and it's pretty amazing You don't lose anything besides boosters when you fail an expedition so while losing a run isn't fun it isn't necessarily unfun either The harder levels require MMORPG raid levels of coordination and planning to pull off and it is extremely rewarding when you finally do Note that these levels can be upwards of 2 hours long depending on how efficient you are Easier levels are closer to 30 minutes But beating that level you've been stuck on for a solid two weeks is one of the more satisfying moments I've had in gaming in a long time

I love the components the challenge and the overall content in this game It's truly unique in it's own genre and delivers an amazing experience with friends no matter how much is played I have recommended this game to multiple friends who share my enthusiasm
The game is extremely team oriented Levels can be cleared with 3 players but 4 is preferred The bots are pretty good on some levels 10/10 would recommend if you like co-op game-play
This game is very fun Extremely challenging requires teamwork However I have to say this game is waaay too punishing A tiny mistake will set you back 30 min This alone makes it a game that I cannot recommend
Cannot play it keeps crashing Plus it also kills my audio drivers whenever it does crash Overall not recommended
love playing for an hour and a half only to die because I mess up killing a big dude and he wipes all 4 of us in one pimp slap because we were dumbasses and stood right next to him this game will put you in your place and spit on you like the dog you are while demanding you bark 9/10 worth every penny
This game does everything it wants to do and is unforgiving for it and the more you play and deeper you go the more respect I have for the developers on how they make every mission especially the C's D's and E's a unique experience I started out hating the game over time though this is now one of my favourite games to date Special shout out to R7C3 for being the best example of Work Together or Die Together
Tried the first level with bots didnt realize you need to hug the dna thingy Almost lost an hour Would do it again

great game very immersive

If you value your sanity have caution when playing this game It's the most frustrating mean and unforgiving game I've played in a long time Highly Recommend

1 hour and 45 mins into a level 80 extracted and we all die to the horde 10/10
I don't know how they managed to do it but the devs ruined an amazing game that was already practically perfect If I could play in early access I would recommend it
I have a friend We play gtfo together He like to stand in front of my mines and blow up the team we are no longer friends
Got a cat here Friends passing by can touch her and click Like to pet her once Award for good luck Take My Points for infinite pets l
very f gooooood
One of the few games I can honestly say is a blast There is no grind for weapons and each level has its own unique expirience
Please pick up your deployables

Good concept but execution is questionable For a game that's meant to be challenging and exciting it ended up being a very tedious and buggy experience Until they improve the core gameplay especially the terribly executed mechanics focused around stealth it's not worth the full price Issues currently with the game list Collisions bugging out having things go through enemies you're shooting/throwing grenades at Enemies dealing damage with no indication in any animations when you happen to stand too close it just insta-damages you with no wind up time Stealth has basically no gameplay you just have to wait until enemy gets in the right position or play the terrible red light/green light game Lack of tools and mechanics to deal with it for players beyond the most basic stuff Almost no ways to interact with the environment Buggy checkpoints as well as terrible placement of them Game doesn't respect your time and makes you re-do the tedious parts probably a few more I forgot list
This game is not exactly meant for solo players so if you wanna play it have some friends play it with you An expedition usually takes about an hour or more and sometimes you are going to die and have to do it all over again from the start The lore is amazing and if you pay attention through the levels you are gonna get a glimpse of the story Also I don't find it horror at all it's mainly a stealth game but once you are spotted it feels like you are playing fucking doom Not scary though 10/10 with friends

hey guys lets make a game with limited resources and stealth mechanics MEANING you need to go through encounters efficiently otherwise you will run out of stuff and need to reset with all that lets add INFINITELY SPAWNING ENEMIES WITH NO INDICATION GIVEN OF WHAT TRIGGERS THEM meaning you just have to do trial and error to figure out the best way to complete the level or you will literally be forced to reset with your ammo being wasted on INFINITE ENEMIES INFINITE ENEMEIES INFINITE ENEMEIESINFINITE ENEMEIESINFINITE ENEMEIES not persona 4
It's an alright game just not for me I just bought this game for a date night with someone and never played it since
good

love the game at its core but the matchmaking is way to tedious and complicated to get matches quickly if I want to play a match I don't mind even waiting like 5 minutes for a game but any longer waiting or not even getting one is a issue and the AI isn't the most useful to work with
Best co-op game seen since COD Zombies

a super fun game to play with friends over comms definitely punishes those who think they can solo dps hero of all the times i failed playing with friends i had a great time every time
R1C1 is a pretty easy level
really good game but matchmaking sucks there will be times in which the game wont feel like letting you play and u can find a really good group and then boof it glitches out and everybody gets kicked out of the game

This game kicked my ass took my lunch money fucked my mom stole my Gushers and called me slurs and I said thank you 20/10 it's a masochist's wet dream
This game feels like a game that was designed by a tech artist who doesn't really care about the end-user Most of its difficulty really just comes from the fact it has obtuse design approaches which just make its core ideas harder to understand for the player The game's menus opt for lore first instead of usability so as soon as you start the game get ready to be confused When I started playing my friends and I who have never played the game before spent about 10 minutes trying to figure out which type of match we should be playing in and how to start a match There's really no reason in the year 2023 why players should be expected to have to learn how your game's menu works or what they're even doing in it I think that means your menu is poorly designed The gameplay once you get in is.just okay The variety comes from different enemy archetypes and room layouts but at the end of the day most of what you end up doing is a loop of enter room sneak kill zombies find objective leave occasionally broken up by some wave defence sequences It was sorta fun for a couple of matches but after that it quickly started getting repetitive Some environments look different than others but I couldn't see myself playing it for much longer than I currently have I think one of the more disappointing parts of it is just how a lot of people tend to frame this game as being difficult and people just need to get better in order to play it I play plenty of games people consider hard games so I guess my hot take is that I generally don't think the core gameplay is that really hard and that the difficulty mostly comes from what I'd call obtuse UX decisions A game that feels hard usually has me feeling like I've done something wrong or made a mistake I need to improve on next time but honestly every time I've lost a match in this game I've felt like it was because the game didn't communicate critical information to me or that it was intentionally being obtuse about what was happening to make it feeler harder than it is I think this coupled by the fact some matches can take upwards of a couple hours with no checkpointing.idk I have better ways to spend a Friday night I get the impression the audience for this game are people who have played for a long time which has made the experience for newer players pretty alienating by-design If you're on the fence about this you should probably be ready for that going in Maybe you'll like it maybe you won't but either way it definitely feels like a game that could stand to have a UX pass or five
have friends then buy with them its a great game
makes me wanna kill myself
TEam KIll funny
not enough health or ammo at all lucky if you even find any at all which forces you to have to stealth all they time not as action packed as they make it look they never explain how to play the game at all so interactions with computers to find locations is horrid expecially if your dislexic like me probably spelled that wrong but you get my point maybe tried it and after getting my load out set up and finally find a group to link up with i passed the 2 hour mark after the mission so steam would not give me a refund they really should change that i have a couple not many that i tried to refund that they would not because let be real to give a game a real try to see if you like it that does not have a demo to play first it takes more than 2 hours most times
scary
Its very good better with friends
IS GOOD ONLY IF FREN IS NEAR NO FREN MEANS PAIN
bots dont stand in the exifil scan so awesome to die at the end
Very good and very tense I just wish I still had the friend group I bought the game to play with still
game's very hard but can go pretty smoothly if you have a good team definitely join the official discord for manual matchmaking with folks shooting feels awesome

Ottimo gioco non abbastanza apprezzato
good
get some friends to play with
All I can say is that this game is the best multiplayer experience I've ever had It's terrifying gripping and just straight up immersive I don't think any other game has had my friend and I immersed like this We were giving real callouts left and right On top of that this game is just pure fear When we first started the alarm doors were terrifying Once we got over our fear of those AFTER Rundown 01 we then became scared of other things that the game added to better itself Never in my life have I been so excited to progress in a game like this It is a little difficult which is for the better in this genre I've played the Dark Souls games and when I say that this game is more difficult than them I don't lie There is only one part of Dark Souls that was harder than this game in general and that was Ornstein and Smough Anyways if you're thinking of playing do it If you have friends to play with it will strengthen or weaken if you're bad at hacking relationships
Maybe the scaner is the problem
really great intense gameplay its DOOM but you're under powered lol

YOU NEED TEAMWORK
really fun game to play with friends or some randoms you meet in the GTFO discord
Fun game with many bugs
GTFO is a game where a bunch of insomniacs take to much melatonin and you and 3 offer people have to do stuff in the facility witheout wakeing them
I'm just not sneaky enough
The game is worth the buy Its even more worth if you have some friend to play with played 170 hours and still on it
Bienvenue en enfer
didn't launch but seems cool
ESTE ES UN JUEGAZO,post actualizacion es re bueno aunque el nivel es bastante elevado pero estos retos son geniales reecomendadisimo
incredibly challenging and fun
The only thing this game lack is the lack of friends willing to play with you
Game lags a lot the first few times you play it But after just a few runs it'll sort itself out Very immersive experience with a lively community and gameplay loops that encourage player communication and mutual teachings of mechanics 7/10
good game
This game taught me to code
who ever made this game take your snatch and put it on your head
Would recommend only if you have 2 or 3 more friends to play with
game scary wary scary make me pucker
5/5
je to pecka 3
A very fun and engaging stealth fps play it with a group of close friends for ultimate hilarity
GTFO is an extreme cooperative horror shooter that throws you from gripping suspense to explosive action in a heartbeat Stealth strategy and teamwork are necessary to survive in your deadly underground prison Work together or die together In other words GTFO if you got no friends
good game with friends
Average game 1 okay we're cool smashes a sleeper we're cool we're cool smashes the next one misses hits again chill it's cool it's red dots appear rapidly We're Not cool We're Not cool at all Or Same game oh a security door prep defences um will the door open and we fight the other duh security checkpoint starts door siren activates that's loud wait The door didn't open It notified the rest that lunch was served
Full Stealth impossible no friends no fun and constant die
Monsters like to jiggle and griddy Couldn't keep it in my pants
Super silly game Don't open that door Eddie
dificlut
Hacket you friendly firing bitch kill yourself otherwise good game
I shidded myself when I played this
this game is so fun I wish I had friends to play it with
this game is really fun to play with friends and its great in the sense it requires teamwork It is also very thrilling to play in general because almost every other play is different top teir game in my opinion
been playing solo stupid hard but a good challenge
After a solid 6.8 hours I would highly recommend to anyone who likes a Fps/horror mix I don't think watching game play puts it into perspective how nerve racking it can be to play Having no ammo no healing and a little bit of your equipment supplies basically having nothing but a knife while having to sneak though a level that's filed with nothing but Bigs is a feeling a hopelessness I haven't gotten from a steal mission or game in while The added fear of spending 30 min to an hour just getting through a section and one mess up leads to you getting killed and having to restart from the beginning also adds onto the pressure spending only 7 hours basically in the game total half way struggling to get though what I can only thing of being the beginning expeditions on top of trying to learn the game itself It makes me wonder what the latter half of the game can even throw at you that's harder No Tutorial No Help Use what you have Or GTFO Simple
huh
Dead Game Devs refused to engage further into making matchmaking a priority Instead you still have to go to a discord filled with elite assholes who refuse to let you join their team unless you have 1k hrs A game that involves what amounts to a job interview to join the game is hilarious
crap avoid
the devs hate their own game
broken and buggy was not a very enjoyable experience
Super fun coop game involving equal parts butt clenching stealth and intense wave defense Be prepared to be put through the wringer because GTFO does not hold back The later levels have soul crushing difficulty Only the most skilled teams make it to extraction Good luck prisoners
DRG Alien Isolation GTFO Press E to
Only if you have at last 2 people to play with and I mean only with them You will spent 1h to get someone in matchmaking and then wipe because noone is using microphone
Came back to it after idk how many years and it's in its worst shape it's ever been No solo mode no balancing AI is 100 percent useless AI doesn't even follow you Even the first mission is not possible to do without 3 other players on the voice chat It could work if the game was so fun that it had more than 2000 players worldwide but nobody's matchmaking and most people leave the lobby after 1 failed mission It's kinda unplayable
really great game but HEAVILY rely on cooperation
sleepers
Saw vids of this and fell in love with the concept Now I've played it all I can say is GTFO is one hell of a drug
sneaky sneaky bonk aaaaa run shoot shoot run help ugh ow help dead ok lets go again
The fact that this game isn't immensely popular boggles my mind It's a great game for anyone who likes difficult games similar to I'm so sorry for this Dark Souls It's the type of game where you join up with your friends argue with one another about why you're all low health and out of bullets but the second you start up the failed mission again you're all trying harder than you were before Exhilarating bullet storms with heart-clenching stealth you can't go wrong with this game
banger
love the game nothing but fun and scares
My only complaint with this was the difficulty swing At the stealth moments my buddy and i would could do it with our eyes closed So easy When shit hits the fan literally couldn't get past a certain mission and had to uninstall but damn its a fun game
Banger
Play it one time and it wont allow you to switch the keybindings for gamepad seems like it wouldve been a nice game
GTFO more like Glock the Fu ck Off
MONSTERS GO BOO MONSTERS DIE
Although it is hard to play solo you can get far with enough practice The people who don't like this game are just not skilled enough or just don't have any friends Anyways the gore is not as gore-y as people say and that's fine with me I also got this game during its Summer Sale so I was super excited to get it It was on my wishlist for a year I heavily recommend this game and if you don't have it yet try it out
Best coop shooter for the whole family D Fun and Tentacles guaranteed 3
Good spook hard
Finalmente un gioco difficile Bello solo per questo
Induces fear very thrilling def a must play with a full group
This game reminds me of the crackheads from Florida and it's great 10/10 would recommend
great game if you wanna wake up the entire neighborhood screaming at the top of your lungs past midnight

5 hours in R1C1
Step 1 Acquire friends Step 2 Die a lot Step 3 Step 4 Profit
have some shit have some fun
The difficulty of this game doesn't hold up to the hype at all If you're careful in the slightest you can walk through any stealth scenario with just a hammer and a bio scanner When you do mess up and have to resort to guns it's almost more worth it to just restart the rundown because everything within 4 rooms is coming your way and the guns do nearly nothing for the amount of ammo they have Most of the rundowns boil down to sneak to a place then leave except for the odd loud mission where the guns are more of a problem than the enemies TL;DR If you want an actually hard game and not just an over gassed sneaking game don't play GTFO
AI 18
I couldn't get out
Yes
Need friends to play but really fun if you think its too hard ur trash and need to get better
boring as hell
This game makes me realize the joy of having competent teammates/friends and is the key to 45 of actually finishing levels 1 The rush of emotions when a bunch of hemorrhoid babies and titans from AOT rush at you when your idiot friend pulls the security door alarm with zero prep 2 When you get a med/ammo pack and use half of it then proceed to tell friend it was a one use because its believable the dev's will give you 1 use items 3 When you need something friend will give it to you bot will just take items like loot goblin death
Get the fuck out
ONLINE IS DEAD DO NOT BUY
I think Left 4 Dead 2 has more active players takes forever to find a game
Me encanta pero como mis amigos son unos giles no se lo quieren comprar porque esta muy caro
don't move don't open flash light don't fire don't step in infection you still die because fuck this game I love it
Gud Gameplay

The Best Game to Play with Friends I swear I am not
i killed all of my friends
its a pretty nice game just a little hard for me as i play solo hopefully you have more luck and skill than me
Very challenging and difficult coop game Lots of fun yelling at friends and messing about but one small mistake can cost you a run so just remember that
scary
8/10 love it but some weapons sound just silly This is very noticable especially if you play the game after l4d Meanwhile monsters and surroundings sound brilliant bot AI could have been better The game often trolls you and your teammates with situations it generates but you can't hate the game because it's awesome all in all When a bot starts trolling you with its intelligence you want to shoot him no Bishop were harmed during this opinion was being formed UPD After a recent update some weps sound more brutal now Bots behaviour has been corrected either They've stopped shooting teamates I think

I hope this game takes off like Hunt did Is a really good hardcore experience

SOO FUN It can be v challenging and really makes you work with your team to win Me likey D
Lets just start with saying I love this game Coming from someone who doesn't consider themselves a hardcore gamer GTFO is my most played game by far I think its a great experience and highly recommend it HOWEVER this game is not for everyone As many other reviews will tell you this game is one of the best at creating a sense of dread and impending doom To this day it is probably the only multiplayer game that can still scare me The gun play is responsive rigid but not restricting and truly hammers home the idea that you are not the apex predator The stealth combat is fun perhaps even more so than the shooting and doesn't bog you down or make the game feel too slow However There is a lot wrong with this game While I personally haven't been put off by it there are a lot of bugs Compounding this problem is the fact that your average level in this game takes around 60 90 minutes with even the shortest ones being around half an hour Spending all that time on a game to have a bug ruin it will definitely sour the experience Personally the length of the levels is the biggest problem and the reason that after over 300 hours in game I can only stomach one or two levels a month The A Tier of the game The first and easiest of the levels is far too easy for a veteran the B Tier is similar but has some tense moments and some bad RNG that could result in a wipe I feel the C Tier is this game at its best Beyond that the game becomes nearly unplayable for your average user I understand that the niche and main draw to this game is the hardcore nature of it but come on 8 of the most difficult enemy in the game followed by 4 of the second most difficult enemy in the game on loop for 3 hours isn't fun 2 or 3 deaths is fine encouraged even this game is supposed to be hard 4 or 5 I'll take skill issue right But 15 hours on one level is madness even for a vet And then they go and add secondary objectives These devs are some sadistic mfs So why after all that trash talk would I still recommend it Because I keep coming back After all these years I still load up the game and play another mission or two With the new bot mechanic I can beat A and B tier and I still think its pretty fun Every once and a while I drop in with some friends and we hammer out a C level maybe even a D level if its not too bad For 30 dollars you can at least give the game a try I think its worth it

Este juego me tiene con Llamarlo desafiante es quedarse corto GTFO te odia te escupe en la cara y te golpea pero si puedes soportar eso e incluso disfrutarlo es un juegazo La asegurada con bastantes niveles que ofrecen un reto constante Si juegas de forma segura un mapa puede durar una hora o Eso juega con amigos Puedes jugar solo pero los NPC son bastante

Very good game not for people who just want to kill aliens 9/10 the stuff in ur visor water
scary good
This game brings a puzzle for every level It focuses on teamwork to insure the success It will test your patience because when you die you will have to start at point with only the knowledge of how you died I personally prefer this game with as few people as possible I enjoy how hard this game actually can be solo In all honesty its impossible for me to do most of the levels without the help of others The AI needs a lot of work still They will stand in a spot and just die They will not listen and the command prompts are hard to get used too The only pro to having a bot in place of a human is they rarely miss AI needs a good amount of work put into them to make it fun for people that don't like others if you don't have any friends or like to play with a community that just wants to show you everything This game might not be for you The community is great People will love to help a new player out But most of the time they just want to beat the level for you They have the best knowledge to help you understand the game The new experience of trying to figure a game out is lost when you play with experienced people Some people prefer the help but if you are like me well good luck This game is not forgiving It doesn't matter if you are solo or have a full party You will get the same strength against you in any level Can you live with your mistakes that got your team killed Can you work as a team so everyone will survive together or will you run until you heart beats out of your chest knowing you can't outrun them forever Make your choice because the next wave is coming

Ich finde das Spiel cool und einzigartig und hatte auch spass die ersten 2 R1 Missionen aber das Spiel ist aufgrund der Schwierigkeit irgendwann anstrengend Ich hatte die Missionen nur 1 Freund mit dem ich dieses Spiel spielen konnte da man Online einfach keine Leute findet ohne einpaar Stunden zu warten Ich habe ebenfalls auch probiert Solo zu spielen die Aufgaben mit denn Bots zu erledigen lief ganz gut Aber das Extrahieren um die Mission ist manchmal viel zu schwer trotz Vorbereitung was nach fast 2 Stunden in der Mission Komplet nervt besonders wenn man auch immer alle hat Ebenso gibt es meiner Erfahrung nach auch nur Kleidung als Belohnung nach Abschluss einer Mission da sich das unbedeutend an Diese geben einen halt nicht wie z.b Perks oder irgend einen Grund diese zu tragen aus optischen aber selbst da bringt es nicht wirklich was da man in Ego Perspektive spielt und es auch keine Emotes gibt Fazit Wenn man Fan von Hardcore Games ist und Missionen wo Fehler ziemlich bestraft werden ist dies das Richtige Spiel ebenso loht es sich nur zu viert oder zu dritt zu Spielen
Sneak up to melee alert something by mistake panic and shoot everything Repeat with patches of typing into a comp to ping a loot pickup That's It This game could be REALLY good offering a lot of PvE potential Unfortunately it doesn't take long to see everything it has to offer All the games are available at the start and the perks from levelling up are minimal skill perks The vanity items are what you're really rewarded with and they all look the same a mess of scrappy clothing all with beige like coloring If you got a group and the game is cheap try it out for a bit but there is no longevity to this game
very fun and cool and all that
The game matchmaking is dead i just did spend an hour waiting for noting but the game itself is awesome
GTFO est un plaisir pour tout masochiste adorateur de soulslike et de challenges comme moi Ajoutez cela une dimension de et de comme dans peu de FPS avant lui et vous obtenez un titre qui vous fera passer d'inoubliables moments Pour le meilleur et pour le pire

This is an amazing game fun and also stressful If your into horror and strategy games this game is for you I would 100 recommend this game just make sure you have friends to play with before getting the game
honestly such a sick game with friends

Fun game Check Stressing game Check Fucking glowsticks when I need health and ammo CHECK
R2D1 Garbage design
a genuine blast to play with friends the horror setting works great especially when introducing newbies to the game but doesn't lose its spice even as a more seasoned player the game is difficult and dying far into a run is not uncommon the slightly masochistic tendencies expressed through some very deliberate level design choices make that even more apparent somehow with each new mission objective it makes all players sigh in despair in the best way possible all guns handle surprisingly uniquely and choosing different loadouts for different types of missions is always somewhere between great benefit and absolutely required
very fucking well made i literally came all over my screen bro gameplay is sooooooooo good its literally a understatement
Decently difficult
10 10
eglence
Punched my monitor and smashed my keyboard Super fun game if you have friends to play with
Very difficult yet fun game Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a strategic challenge You will have to take things slow and really think every decision through and this is what I love about it
this game is fucking hard but i love it
ew
Si vas a jugarlo con amigos te lo recomiendo pero asegurate de que sean 4 si son 2 lo mas probable es que al igual que yo acabes por odiar el juego es tactico y todo lo que quieras pero que tengas que para el mismo numero de enemigos siendo solo 2 personas o 4 personas me parece decepcionante
fuck this
Great tension atmosphere and game play Still needs tweaking here and there and it can be unfair at the end of a run but otherwise a fun co-op sci/fi shooter With the full release happening GTFO is the SCARIEST most HARDCORE survival shooter you'll ever experience Bar NONE

When i was but a wee lad i would go into the forest with my friends and would fight off the skin walkers that almost resemble the sleepers in this game that also gives me great nostalgia Keep up the good work i await to cfoam coom onto the sleeper Would recomend becuase its fuan
It's a amazing game of course you have more fun playing with more than 2 friends
You want to chill and just play the game Not this game Be ready to cry at the pure terror and pain brought by the evil lurking in the dark Fun af tho
Super Spiel Empfehlenswert nur tilt resistente Menschen
my friends wanted to install this first instead of SCP:SL
This game its absolute awesome and at this point i be clear ABSOLUTE AWESOME PD:When i say Awesome not a joke its like the AWWWWEEESSSOOOMMMEEE of awesomenes
The game is quite fun and the combat is terrifying and exhilarating Watching hordes of enemies come at you while you see your ammo count dwindle down to the point you actually run out is honestly a fun mechanic However my only problem with the game is that when you squad wipe which for my friends and I was frequent the late of checkpoint means you are going to lose at least half an hour of progress At one point on one of the missions we failed at the very end and the checkpoint was in a previous massive fight like an hour plus ago We just lost all motivation to continue playing from then on From the short time I played I hated going back over and over again Probably a skill issue but with the three friend groups I played this with the end result was always the same
The game is really fun my whole squad got butt f*cked by naked men with funny looking heads
Awesome game Recommended 100 for real coop gamers
Very fun very goofy game Do play

It's really really fuckn for me Rundown 8 Is amazing
this game is perfect for people who like chaos and also strategizing i love the feel of all the guns and the gameplay in general i love how careful and coordinated you have to be and i love how hard the game is i 100 recommend this game if you have 4 people for it and are willing to deal with the absurd challenge it comes with
Rek stinks
killing floo 4 for dead Back for blad 30 6 2 20 security door 5 40
A game that gives off Metro 2033 Dead Space The Thing and Left 4 Dead vibes all at the same time And you just use their Discord to matchmake which is better anyways

SCRARY
Why can't games be normal Had to spend the first 30 minutes trying to remove the horrendous visual effects that every game today trying way too hard has dof blur abberation etc then their own unique brand of painful effects curved hud the pixel effects jumping inertia and many more However unable to remove the absolute two worst offenders the reverse parallaxing menu and HUD which cause beyond unplayable levels of motion sick on top of literally making it hard to navigate and the flashbang notifications where a quarter of the screen is pure white in a game that is mostly spent in low light trying to parse out small details The most significant accessibility option is the ability to disable the flashing lights warning Everything is so hacker themed that even navigating the menus and doing basic tasks are a chore Please just add a single option to the menu which is make the game normal that makes it a regular-ass fps so the probably good horror co-op fps gameplay can actually shine
Amazing graphics but you need your friends to not be a bunch of glue chuggers to get far into the game still fun though 8/10
Cool mais a plusieur se serai cool
legobit
It wasn't me who woke up all the monsters I swear it was
While it seems to have great atmosphere and the build is there for a great coop experience there's basically no people in matchmaking thus making this game kind of useless as a coop game unless you have friends to play with or want to dive into a discord channel in hopes of finding someone to play with
Convince three more friends to buy this game and play with you so they can suffer with you
Well I Wanna Play it Cuz i love Coop Games But Unfortunately its really hard to find a match match making is maybe bugged or something i like the game but its a total waste of time waiting for a match to join it takes forever maybe i try it again some day when match making is fixed and devs actually listen to players problems on matchmaking
Extremely fun and challenging coop game You'll need to make sure you have free time when you play this because a level can easily go on to up to 2 hours The game makes you work cooperatively There is no way around that if you want to succeed So not for groups of people looking to mindlessly play something Controller support can be better if but still works well Overall highly recommend if you if you're looking for a new and challenging coop experience
Hey whats that dies
You think its gunna be Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy but its just Dark Dark Lemon Dark
Scary fun
when your friends enter the next room without anyone knowing
Pro-tip things spawning right next to you out of thin air after you've killed every lovely thing in the room and have set up turrets staring holes at the door that ain't a situation of Git good son it's a situation of Wow this really lacks proper game design
Played with friends haven't got past the first mission definitely GTFO horrible experience 10/10 recommend
Jogo simplesmente fenomenal Precisa de mais 3 pra jogar junto Se estiver se sentindo adiciona e bora sofrer junto
Nesse jogo 4 pensam pior que uma
this game should be scary 10/10
I am so glad the devs keep updating this game
cool game but hard to find friends to play with for this price
for an early access game its a lot of fun with friends
THIS GAME SUCKS INSTRUCTIONS UNCLEAR I DONT EVEN KNOW WHATS HAPPENING NOR WHAT TO DO IN THIS GAME DO NOT PLAY IF YOU HAVE AN ATTENTION SPAN OF A GOLDFISH VERY BORING AND COMPLICATED I GOT BRUTALLY PENETRATED BY THOSE ALIENS DID NOT FEEL GOOD

the tutorial was very helpful and taught me how to play this very fun and simple game this was satire do not spend your money on this
Se arranjar mais 3 pra jogar com o jogo fica 10/10 Podia muito bem ter uma de compra 4-pack
Thousands of people playing but i cant find a game
splendiferous
It"s a must have for the hardcore co-op loving gamers After owning this game for almost 1.5 years I have absolutely no regrets investing my money Yes it"s punishable and sometimes frustrating So you will enjoy the success even much more in this game And if you don"t like it GTFO
ci(.)(.)ci
balas super escasas cuando lo y partidas demasiado largas
dark no
This shit is spooky raids take a while but if that is my biggest complaint i am more than happy to keep playing this game
w game
fun but pain
stukiado en r2d2 desde la beta
Really fun when you have a full squad solo on the other hand good luck
I'm not good at it and I don't want to be
this is not a game you suck at its a game that has pea shooters for guns and anything that hits worth a shit has 2 bullets also love the spitters real easy to avoid
i keep dying so the game is bad

Sick
I play with 2 other friends and we're too proud to play with randoms or bots We haven't gotten past the first level yet Edit beat it at 6 hours
i am in pain
This game is unashamedly proud to be itself It feels like the core vision of what the developers at 10 Chambers wanted to make was never compromised and that alone should be worth something Thankfully that isn't all this game has going for it Moment to moment gameplay in GTFO is a rollercoaster between tense stealth and frantic action and the atmosphere of its environments and storytelling are very easy to become immersed in The gunplay is satisfying and resource placement within the levels ensures you both explore the environment and are always rationing what little you can find I want to wish 10 Chambers the best of luck on their next project and hope they can showcase that same passion there as they did here
lourd pour les tryhardeur
I like the way they click
Amazing stealth coordination and horror game
Divertido con amigos sin amigos No tanto
pizdi 10 10
honestly a really fun game BUT the matchmaking is horrible no one is patient enough to wait for everyone to ready up basically dropping out after maybe 10 seconds if 1 person out of the group hasn't readied up the random is usually setting up their loadout if you do manage to sync up a team you're probably lumped in with dickheads who ruin it for everyone usually for content for their streams/tiktoks/youtube/etc by being loud and obnoxious getting everyone killed if the Dev team was larger or if they partnered up with a bigger studio multiple studios they could possibly get things to where they want while staying in control of their project honest opinion if you have 3 friends that want to join you in this game that's probably your only option the official discord is also an option but pretty seedy and unreliable
See Monster mew go boom haha
kjnk
kinda fun but not my kinda game
Really love the game Dark and scary action-packed However i just hope there is more commands for playing with bots like hold position etc since matchmaking is not possible unless you go to Discord The game is challenging and brutal cuz one mistake can jeopardize the whole mission Overall a good one to pick up during discount
Als erfahrener Shooter spieler ala Call of Duty Back 4 Blood DayZ Arma und wie sie nicht alle Ganz klar nein das game hat was ja ABER ohne 4er team kannste das knicken Spielersuche naja dauert halt stunden Viel zu schwer kaum Munition kaum medipacks
its like deep rock galactic but if deep rock galactic was spooky and scary ahhh good game but made me shit my pants and start crying when i woke up a horde
Spent 4 hours beating one mission only for a friend to wake a big one we are no longer friends
schwer aber geil mit Freunden spielen ist empfehlenswert

Epic difficulty Great team building exercise
I have never felt so terrified while constantly shooting a 50 cal machine gun Being heavily armed really doesn't means much in this game

This game is a work of art but it is the most stressful art you will ever see The environment makes you uncomfortable which adds to the horror of the situation you are in Would recommend to play with people you know because you will get mad at them They will make a little mistake and end a 45 minute run Not to mention there is a lot of content in the game I have 40 hours in the game and I am still finding new enemies and environments that freak me out Would highly recommend
There are skins you could only unlock if you played the game on a specific week in 2022 The apparel is likely to never come back and I don't support this If it comes back I will change this review and make it positive There are some guns that are specific to a rundown which is sad Also if you want to have fun in this game you need 3 friends who like hardcore games or you need to socialize on discord because playing solo is near impossible old rundowns got removed and came back in an alternative version Hope your FOMO doesnt kick in I like the difficulty and the necessary coordination work you have to do to succeed But there is no real tactical depth or different strategic approaches You cannot even choose to just sneak by enemies because on the next alarm you have to kill em anyways gunplay is meh nice interface nice atmosphere good graphics and good music Buy it with your friends on sale
You unlock easy mode after 2000 hours
very good team orientated horror style game communication is key i highly recommend going in with a full squad but hours of fun and she may seem slow at first but trust if anyone fucks up it gets real chaotic real quick
The matchmaking is bad no boddy playing this game anymore
Fun game but get friends to play it with you bots are kinda bad
I have a love/hate relationship with GTFO There's a strong artistic direction on it that you can feel from the very first screen to the computer gameplay they went all-in and it's a real pleasure to experience that The mood is fantastic the gunfeel is incredibly good even though a sound feedback when your gun is empty would have been nice the enemy design is on point The art direction especially on the latest maps completely catches up for technical aspect My main point of concern is like a lot of people I think the difficulty Not necessarily because it's hard but because it mixes a very unforgiving experience with long playtime sometime above 2h and the lack of any basic exposition to new threats At the time I'm writing this review I've lost two time after 1h gameplay because of an encounter with an enemy that was never shown the second time it happened while being chase by an infinite wave of monsters It's a die and retry where the die part last hours Basically it often crosses the line between hard and frustrating at almost every mission Very few maps have a checkpoint mechanic added after the release but it's broken I've always ended up with a massive bug after using one of those I really don't mind the difficulty but I would have sold my left kidney for a true checkpoint/save system every 15-20mins I would still recommand it unless you have no-one to play with the AI is functional but not very smart it can help on the lowest difficulty missions but you'll need a friend or two to complete the other ones It's a unique experience that's worth playing and I've played it more than most other recent coop shooter game I honestly can't wait to see what the devs will do next

Really long missions but it's overall really fun especially playing with friends who have the same amount of experience as you though it's not impossible to have fun with people who are much more experienced as long as you steal the Bioscanner first so they have to rely on you Plus it is still a challenge assuming that the people you play with don't have 100 optimization of every mission as well as everything memorized Overall fun time but also ideally played with 4 people total so there's that
Very nice game fun to play with 4 friends it's get challenging
You guys have the map knowledge of Christopher Columbus Did you know that you have to turn on your monitor to actually do something 10/10 game
Best horror game I've ever played
Game crashes Their is no matchmaking system you gotta use discord If you have no SMS verification and you have a new discord account you're fucked and cannot participate in the online would be fun if it worked like a game and not a glorified reason to fuel a discord mod's power fantasy over pulling a 30 game from you at their whims
This game is a great experiment as to how far and hardcore you can push a 4 player co-op experience It's dark scary gritty stressful but it rewards experimentation and uptight organization between friends However I was a little thrown off with the non-existent progression system and how the leval layout for all missions stays the same only changing the location of key items The only thing you unluck in this game are skins which you barely get to see since the game is mostly dark and in 1st person and limited uses bonuses for a level that while welcome are still nowhere near the character progression system in games such as in Deep Rock In other words you have no incentive to re-do missions unless you really want achievements otherwise you're stuck in waiting until the next rundown opens Great game it's just up to the player wether you believe this game will get old quickly or no
I think this game is truly a matter of finding the right group for it I didn't enjoy it a ton when I first played but after gathering a couple of my friends for a 2nd try it turned out to be a lot more fun than I remembered it being Besides that it's a tactical and rewarding experience that can have down-to-the-wire clutch moments and is a ton of fun
It's a really good game the feels might get a little repetitive but it has very good balance interesting maps and good overall performance for my pc RTX 3060 and i5 12th gen cpu
3 Deep Dark Fantasies of this we turns me of this hundred
Stealth is recommended but not required If you're willing to take the challenge
Its hard as hell but very fun with the right group of people Scary and satisfying

muy complicado
This game is good
lange her wo ich so gefesselt war wie in den 13h gtfo
Pretty fun game though you'll need to gather drag in 3 other people to play with you There's a decent variety of guns but it's hard to choose and stick to one because each gun has strengths and weaknesses that are amplified or nullified by the type of run you're doing Coordination is key since a single goon waking up can spell BISHOP WOKE THE SCOUT UP AGAIN ARE YOU FECKIN SERIOUS
the last of us

spooky scary 10/10
A unique and engaging approach to the 4-man co-op FPS formula that Left 4 Dead established One of the best horror games I've played in a very long time not because it is scary although it definitely can be tense at times but because of how purely fun the game is The devs are incredibly active in not only updating the game with a new map every single month called rundowns but also in engaging with their community on Discord The game focuses heavily on teamwork stealth and the preservation of resources in order to survive and succeed There are no difficulty settings and unless you are working alongside a well-coordinated squad the game can be brutally difficult GTFO is best played with a full 4-man squad preferably with friends for the best and intended experience Teamwork is the key to success as you stealth your way past rooms in order to preserve your resources for the Bioscan doors as they always result in a firefight The devs encourage anyone who is looking for a squad to join the Discord and meet people Not to mention the community is very friendly and welcoming I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys a tactical more slow-paced FPS centered around teamwork
It is amazing all around it is very frightening as the game is meant to be has a pretty hard difficulty but is not too hard if you play together Timing and patience are the names of the game
a realistic game with horror and teamwork Nice graphics and story along with the team building aspect and just as it states get out together or die together is legit 10/10
FPS
Boring game and not scary in the slightest You need to find people to play with through the official discord or already have three discord friends to play with Was super hyped over it but even more so let down

pog game
Kinda like a horde shooter but where the power balance is much less in your favor and resources are scarce As a result you mostly want to use stealth and melee when possible and when needed use your guns and tools as effeciently as you can Great coop game for friends who want something less lighthearted

they forgot the part that the game is supposed to be fun
Prepare yourself because GTFO is not a game for the faint of heart If you thought you were tough GTFO will push you to your absolute limits and then some Brace yourself for an experience that will leave your nerves shattered and your heart pounding like a drum From the moment you step into the dark foreboding depths of GTFO you'll be immersed in a haunting atmosphere that never lets up The game's visuals are stunningly atmospheric with dimly lit corridors grotesque creatures lurking in the shadows and an eerie soundscape that will send chills down your spine It's a masterclass in creating tension and unease GTFO is a cooperative survival horror game and cooperation is not just encouraged it's essential for survival You and your team will be thrust into unforgiving environments tasked with completing challenging objectives while fending off hordes of nightmarish creatures Communication and coordination are paramount as a wrong move or a misplaced shot can spell instant death The gameplay mechanics in GTFO are nothing short of brutal Every step you take every door you open and every bullet you fire could alert the enemy and send them swarming towards you Resource management becomes a delicate dance as you balance your limited supplies against the constant threat of annihilation The tension is palpable and the stakes are always high But what truly sets GTFO apart is its unforgiving difficulty This game doesn't hold your hand it mercilessly punishes every mistake you make Each encounter feels like a desperate struggle for survival with a razor-thin margin for error GTFO is a game that will test your skills your wits and your nerves like few others Be prepared to fail learn adapt and push through the maddening challenges GTFO is not a game for everyone It's for those who crave a nerve-breaking pulse-pounding experience that will leave them mentally and emotionally drained It's a game that demands your full attention and rewards those who persevere If you're up for the challenge GTFO will deliver an unforgettable journey into the darkest recesses of terror So gather your most resilient friends steel your nerves and prepare to embark on a harrowing adventure that will test the limits of your courage GTFO is a masterpiece of horror gaming that will haunt your dreams and keep you coming back for more Just remember when you enter the depths of GTFO you're in for an experience like no other Good luck You'll need it

good game
Playing solo is doable with the bots They've clutched up at times when I fuck up Super fun Keep in mind that an average level takes 1-2 hours Edit actually its about 30 mins to an hour if you are good
Need to be able to save as you go or just re-spawn I keep dying in the training and have to go right back to have another go
Se for meu amigo compre esse jogo Praticamente todo meu tempo de jogo na 7b1 aguentamos mais Jogo muito bom 10/10
SILLY GUYS 3
Great game for you and your buddies if you wanna have some of the most fun and also be horrified at the same time 10/10
Fun however I regret trying to run this game with a PC running off a potato
Really cool game But it simply doesn't work
Very scury 10/10
I can see in the Dark now Great game but you really need at least one friend because the Bots are quite stupid and will spend all their ammo
YES
the noob filter is real
Nuh uh
I liked this game but my friends got mad so I refunded it 10/10
susto
yes
total shit Everything you encounter in the tutorial will not change one bit throughout the rest of the gameplay 3 varieties of enemies No progression at all All weapons and everything else is open from level one I honestly don't understand how people play it for more than 2-3 hours Such monotony I have not seen even in stupid games clickers probably
So black
Gutes 4 player game nur ein kleines bisschen ist erforderlich

Red light green light with guns you aren't supposed to use
This game is good Much fun Very Yes
You have to join the official discord server in order to play Don't play with bots your experience will suck If you have b]crippling social anxiety[/b and b]if you don't have 1 to 2 hours to play a single mission from start to finish don't buy it b]You will have to communicate a decent amount while playing this game It is very fun and challenging If you like playing hard video games this is the game for you I have 21 hours in the game and I haven't even beat half of the levels in this game yet because there's so many missions There is no difficulty setting in the sense that the mobs will always deal the same amount of damage no matter which mission you choose You cannot go from hard to easy The difficulty however lies in the mission you select Each mission has a depth and the deeper you go the more enemies you will encounter and there will also sometimes be secondary and overload objectives that can heavily increase a mission's difficulty Currently the only purpose for doing these side objectives are for personal satisfaction Granted it does feels great when you beat them Some missions contain harder map conditions like intense thick fog poison gas pitch black darkness or a lack of resources If you have any basic experience with command prompt for Windows OS it will help a little bit You have to use the in game computers to locate items and resources I recommend watching a guide on terminals if you aren't familiar with command prompt at all You can also just type commands on a terminal and it will tell you all the functions you can do at that specific terminal The guns are fun and the stealthy melee combat aspect feels fantastic There are some missions where you are forced to go loud the entire mission where you defend an objective such as a nuclear reactor Some missions you should preferably stealth as much as you can to conserve resources like ammo/health and extract after you gather the required materials in order to unlock extraction Out of the missions I've played so far the gameplay loop is basically this 1 Stealth to enemy zombie and bash it in the back of the head 2 Communicate with your teammates on where the zombies are and if necessary 3-2-1 a group of zombies at once 3 Progress through the level and eventually you will reach a door with an alarm This means that you have to now go loud for at least a few waves of zombies that will rush your position These zombies are omnipotent in the sense that you can't hide from them just like all zombies that are alerted of your position in this game Alternatively you could also go loud in every mission for the entire mission but this isn't recommended as you will run out of ammo for the alarm doors Some missions have tons of alarm doors Teamwork based horror game 9/10 Shame this game doesn't have more players I think the price tag and lack of advertising is what is making it feel unpopular There is also no PvP in this game although there is friendly fire so technically there could be if you and a friend are fucking around at extract
da spooky little demon children are after my andrew tate lookin ass

Very fun but you need friends to play with for lower levels
Good game
If it was a trim then brim a tim
so amazing free weekend player and still trying to convince my friends to come back after we were stuck for 4 hours it was awesome
Extremamente desafiador divertido com os amigos Super recomendo
I'm not very far into the game but so far it is fantastic The Atmosphere is 2nd to very few games with dynamic heart rate systems and terrifying noises The pacing changes are drastic from fully stealthy and quiet to full on chaos when the hoard awakens Graphics and map design are incredible and the game pulls no punches If you are a fan of the difficulty that Souls-likes present this is the game for you The only big downside is that the game NEEDS 4 players The game is marginally playable with 3 but ammo is so short in most runs that the lack of 2 guns and utility really makes it I love how the game mixes rooms you need to kill enemies and rooms you have to stealth no matter what the only downside is some of the line of sights when you have differing heights becomes weird making the really long stealth rooms aids to move through sometimes Great game could not recommend it more
Good game very fun made me die in real life scary much good
GAME SUCKS

Not a fun game but very challenging and unique compared to other games You absolutely shouldn't party with some randos you found online you need to actually go to discord servers and invite those people to play if you had no other friends to party with
After putting 300 hours into the game I think I can finally figure out why it's got me roped in so much When I first played in the beta the experience was hellish Completing an A or a B mission felt taxing and insanely gratifying when we finally won and at the time I could barely fathom surmounting a C-tier level After playing it thoroughly for a while I've gotten used to the adrenaline filled action and the hurdles the game regularly throws at you to the point where A and B missions are an absolute breeze and C-tier is my new standard It's a wonderful feeling getting a palpable sense of progress and becoming a more capable survivor for not just the benefit of yourself but your entire team In regards to newer players this game is brutal It takes a long time to get into and there are many nuances to the gameplay loop that fresh players will take a while to absorb I recommend spending some time with someone already experienced or having a whole troop of fresh players with you so you can figure things out together On top of being a ludicrous adrenaline surge the dynamic music during stealth combat is utterly fantastic The sound design is utterly immaculate On occasion I will play it solo just to appreciate how well put together the ambiance is The guns are punchy the effects are flashy and the game's color palette is dark and evil It also runs extremely well on even low-tier graphics cards Just when you think you've mastered every obstacle the game will throw more at you Every threat feels avoidable every mistake feels like you could've done better somehow and it forces you down a path of improvement I feel as if the developers are finally figuring out what that truly want out of this game with the advent of Rundown 7 The gimmicks in the modern levels have gotten very fresh and they are experimenting in ways that were inconceivable in times previous All the mechanics developed from the previous rundowns are beginning to coalesce into a masterful experience As of right now my biggest complaint with the game are the bots Sometimes you need to run a team with one bot on it to make up for a missing player but the bots are specialists in holding onto shitty utility items and avidly wasting ammo On occasion their pathfinding will bug out and they will refuse to stand in a team scan jeopardizing a whole hour's worth of work These issues are conceivably fixable in time and there has been talk of improving them further To date a full team of bots could carry you through C-tier if you're attentive To close I recommend a dark room a friend or two and some good headphones A solid run can absolutely drain you when you finally pull through so remember to stay hydrated Walk softly and learn to love that sledgehammer
He jugado muy poco este juego pero puedo decir 3 cosas 1.-El juego es muy desafiante parece simple al inicio sigilo-matar a las cosas esas-escapar pero el proceso es muy 2.-complicado porque puede faltar o vida o simplemente no sepan lidiar con los enemigos 2.-La es muy importante 3.-Es obligatorio conseguir gente para jugarlo incluso si consigues encontrar gente de estar esperando como 1h para encontrar gente por el emparejamiento no existir una buena incluso si sabes ingles nada te asegura que no te salga un chino o japones me toco con uno y mi ping se fue a la mrd que si tienes amigos para jugarlo y te gusta un juego desafiante cooperativo entonces te puedes llegar a disfrutar este grandioso juego Psdt Aun no gente para pasarlo y aun soy medio novato que si eres nuevo o solo quieres gente para jugarlo puedes agregarme como amigo y escribirme para pasar el rato con este infernal juego
gG
yea
Yes stealth is optional but actually no
This game is really good so far The stealth and communication is really cool and it sometimes makes you sort of feel like your really in the game I recommend playing with 3 people minimum because its difficult I like that you have to find things in game to help you out You should get it The only bad thing I have noticed is that glow sticks are kinda bad
amazing and fun pretty difficult but fun with friends
too much walking and boring downtime not enough shooting and even if their was the gun play is meh at most
Ayo this game kinda baller tho
Scariest shit ive played I love it

Best horror game
i've walked face first into monster ass on at least 3 occasions
good game but extremely overpriced even when it's on sale it's still very pricey
Buy it now
2:30 hour missions without a checkpoint Beautiful
Be prepared to fail a lot but you'll make some discord buddies along the way 10/10 would GTFO again
fun game excruciatingly painful to watch 1 and a half hours of progress instantly deleted from internet skill diff

Great game Different and unique Some things can be improved but overall a solid 8.0/10 Lacks some basic things that could be improved on or expanded but compensates with other thrilling challenging masterful gameplay It's a personal challenge for people that have strong mental and are open to getting psychologically broken after failing miserably Only have played with my friend and bots most of these levels and some solo levels where I felt comfortable mostly A,B,C levels Until you beat an E level I don't think you've seen the game in it entirety I'm not a one to speak because we've only beaten R2E1 thus far and completed about everything else that's not an E level from all rundowns available right now and am taking a break before diving into the harder E levels It's really hard especially if you can't commit or learn more about the game or the certain level in advance Wish we had a person or two more to play with maybe it would be even more fun It still a really good game Hopefully R8 goes crazy
Spaghetti
get the fuck on and then get the fuck out
I like the game but the matchmaking is terrible and I can't seem to get a game in
theyre just like me when i get shredded cheese at 3am
The fact that there is a Meta way of playing this game makes it dull and boring
Oyun guzel bir oyun ama tek basiniza yapamaycaginiz bir oyun 4 kisilik bir arkadas grubunuz yoksa cok oynayamazsiniz ama oyunun kendi matchmakingi ve discorduda var ordan oyuncu bulabilirsiniz onun disinda cok zor bir oyun full strateji uzerine bir gorevi yaklasik 3 4 saattir yapmayi deniyoruz bir turlu yapamadik
we need a terminal
Its a fun game as long as you play it with friends This is a game that you will not finish in a week or so This game will take weeks to months on end Good Soup
amazing game however there is a huge skill gap that needs to be addressed My point is you won't be amazing first try this game requires knowledge of the maps and modes with the addition of utilities as well This game has an amazing fan base which is ready to help and support I've only played a minute number of hours compared to the rest but my best advice is to try the discord and also to understand that it is hard at first to learn you just need to put the time and effort into learning it
Pretty boring and unfun all around No real objective for the level and enemies are just basic melee enemies Only redeeming quality is fog turbine Weapons are pretty boring and just not interesting in the slightest
h1 Yeah nah h1 As a big horror junkie this game is something I've been wanting to get my hands on for a while but honestly for how many redundancies there are in the core mechanics and how little much they've done to improve upon them since this game came out I'm a little disappointed There is a good amount of this game I do enjoy The terminals the don't tell your story show it vibe the melee and gun range and the minimalist out of game menu is all neat stuff that stands this game out from the rest as for the mechanics this game u wants u to be known for it strangely just feels like they all shoot each other in the foot not allowing anyone of them to fully flourish Stealth A big promoted part of GTFO is the urgency to be stealthy never to get ahead of yourself and stay cautious I can say that the mechanic works and I haven't encountered any technical problems so far but its no where near being a unique and well thought out part of this game It is essentially crouch->move->stop for 10 seconds->move->slap or stab depending on your melee->repeat and when having to slap hundreds of tape worm riddled sleepy heads again and again it can get very repetitive very fast The game also offers no alternative for this other than to avoid the room they're all in entirely or move past them either which often isn't an option Eventually you'll start to get impatient and just cause a slap fest making stealth null Horde shooting If at any point you have a fucky wucky with the above mechanic you'll trigger this phase This is supposedly not an ideal situation b that you as a player should be avoiding at all times b That being said you will soon discover horde triggering is an utterly unavoidable part of this game Visibility by design is abysmal so having to accurately spot shoot and stab hundreds of angry naked worm people plus the fact that a would-be satisfying head-shot doesn't always kill them is a massive head-ache Unlike stealth however you are given a variety of tools to help you in this situation C-foam and mines to slow down enemies sentries to hold choke points and bio scanners to help you keep track of what your dealing with all of which are designed to minimise you having to interact with the horde Seems like there are two progressive paths away from this A give players an option to avoid hordes entirely in some scenarios or B make hordes a fun shooting range event like most other horde-shooters this game however is sadly stuck in the awkward mid ground Horror Why I got this game the big spook that sends adrenaline through you perhaps arguably one of the biggest promotional features of this title a feature that it sadly like so many that have a horror-tag before it falls so very far of Now I know I sound like a gate-keeping bum but lets just look at what two things mechanically make a horror game Vulnerability Feeling unarmed even when you are anything but is what a great horror game accomplishes This pressure can amplify the feeling to get anything that needs to be done done now and greatly increases the rewarding feeling of completing a task Whilst the above paragraph about Hordes makes it seem like they accomplish this the one further up about Stealth shows that you are hunting these things not the other way around Similar to games like Dead-Space or Evil Within why should be afraid of something that you've already killed a hundred of Answer is you shouldn't Unpredictability Not knowing is a defining feature of fear its why most horror movies and games are far more horrifying mid way through then near the end It can be done through RNG or even out of place events both not too hard to implement Whilst honestly I haven't witnessed all of what this game has to offer It felt pretty predictable a few missions in Whilst this games atmosphere and creatures seem perfect fits for horror it fails to exaggerate both of these defining tid-bits In the end the attempted stealth ruins the horror the attempted horror ruins the horde-shooting and the attempted horde-shooting ruins the stealth and we're left with just a hard game that's just not fun I'll continue to play it a bit more and see If I can prove myself wrong but in the meantime b i'd heavily recommend you and your friends play Deep Rock Galactic instead b its actually very fun and knows exactly what it wants to be plus the cosmetics don't suck ass I give this game a 5/10
le big spook le creppy montr me le like

Very immersive great if you love co-op and strategy
good fps game
They broke the experience of the game by the matchmaking made via discord
Me and My Friends GTFO We GTFO so much that we don't enjoy the game and have not touched it since Allied Ai also kinda sucks
yell at your friend simulator 2023
the most fun I've ever had in a horror game
hard like me
this game contains guns
Now that I've played the game for dozens of hours I can finally have fun when I'm playing the easy levels The others are still a trudge through fog and unfun stuff Also the bots walk in the line of fire and can inflict DEADLY friendly fire Edit After a few more hours it's not really interesting anymore it's just a game about opening doors You need to get to Zone A for the objective but the door requires a key which is in Zone B but the door to Zone B is out of power so you need to go to Zone C to find a cell but Zone C is behind Zone D and Zone E All the zones have different rooms but they all contain the same stuff there's no variation of anything it's tedious as hell

Got a cat here Friends passing by can touch her and click Like to pet her once l
This game was way more of a stealth melee game than the action packed co-op horror shooter I was lead to believe it'd be I obviously should have looked up some game play online before purchase It does seem to do the whole stealth co-op thing alright but the levels feel uninspired and the enemies lack any sort of distinction beyond big guy and alarm guy The concept of this being anywhere close to horrifying is also pretty laughable Obviously at 4 whole hours played I didn't get into most of the game but the first couple levels we beat were enough to make me shoot for a refund before I bite this game It may be someone's cup of tea but it definitely isn't mine
Regretting life
great game to play with friends Doesn't run the best on computers not for the average filthy casual
I've been craving a game like this Requires careful planning and good execution especially when playing with just one other person Very good Thumbs up
ass
Hard but fun with a group
this game is fun
jogue com seus amigos e ainda melhor
pissing shitting and in some cases cumming
Pretty difficult to play without friends but when you've got your monkey brained squad you're bound to have an insane adventure with this creepy co-op horde roasting game
30 mins to an hour waiting for a lobby in matchmaking No team work my melee weapons are hit or miss on certain enemies like it doesn't phase them Most of the levels seem the same just randomized layout each time you go in
AI is horrible and dev don't care not enough checkpoint dying bring you back almost at the star of the mission

where do i start ten chambers may not be the best dev team out there people are not shy to praise or degrade them but none of that matters when you can piss your pants infront of your friends this game is best played with three other people that you know it really tests you're ability to work together as a team like REALLY tests you as a group sometimes the one thing that makes or breaks levels is communication the re-playablility of this game is questionable really because from rundown 2 and on you really don't ever want to redo some missions ever again its FUN don't get me wrong some levels you just don't want to revisit after completing them but if you're a completionist like me you'll love the amount of challenges and secondary tasks there are to complete overall the gunplay in this game is also very good the monsters are very well done some really make you break a sweat i can't really comment much on the overall fps quality of this game with big fancy game words i really just think the gunplay and overall weapon crap is pretty dang good i find among my own team we even have very diverse loadouts usually theres enough to fit everyones style of playing im the sniper i always have been and i still am in the game i look things up on the computers and find out where we need to go another teammate mains biotracker and they're hella good at it they also love lore and read every log to us while we sneak through levels one is simply called monkey they're our melee god really they usually have the lowest health from preferring to hammer instead of shoot the last is our turret guy they know all the best places and everything good and bad about each turret they also love to main shotguns it even gets down to character i love bishop to annoy everyone by pinging every resource box/locker our biotracker main loves hacket for being irish you also get to name all the enemies funny names if your team has a sense of humor overall 10/10 would recommend also i definitely suggest singing the pizza theme from spiderman 2 every time you encounter a scout makes it a little less tense
menu is a bit confusing and matchmaking needs a touch up but overall game play is great recommend for intense long game play
10000/10
Awesome gun play lore and atmosphere Love the gadgets and the pulse pounding engagements The worst part of the experience for me was having to learn discord It is the first app that has made me feel like a grandpa Took so long to figure out how to get in a game But once I did it slapped

Sleepers here
Astonishingly good game The atmosphere graphics art style guns futurism story enemies difficulty It's honestly one of the best sci-fi games I've played in years Cooperation and communication is actually incredibly important Stealth and choosing your battles It's one of not so many games where all the features and gameplay ties together perfectly It's also quite challenging My only complaint is that there aren't more games like this A shooter with non horror elements like this would also have been great But I've not seen other games get the fomula as perfectly as this game Even the weapons actually make a difference and choosing different loadouts is something to think about for every mission
Incredible game
This game doesn't fuck around Stealth mechanics resource management tactics and planning ice a solid FPS cake
its a challenge
A not-quite-so-hidden gem Definitely overlooked and underappreciated Atmospheric as hell tense at times you never know when you might trigger a wave Play this game Friends required although there are bots
Too easy
get the flip out
fun infinitely better with friends but still playable solo with bots
Man scouts are just my favorite Out of all the bs the game throws at you whether it be a group of 4 giants when you're playing with bots or long agros that wake the whole room up I know that scouts will always bring intervals of 12 homies around to have a good time Never have I heard such amazing music as when scouts pull up to the party and take the AUX Sometimes they're shy and just want to be invisible but I always help them come around to reality Truly an amazing life simulator
I hate everything D
this game breaks friendships and its amazing 10/10
horrid devs and repetitive game play they also refuse to support any modding community

Juegazo recomendado pero si no jugas de a 4 es jodidisimo de a 3 ya es bastante imposible No me fije de jugar de menos de 2 personas
Most people say the game is very difficult which IT MOST DEFINITELY IS but the game is too fun anyways Sneaking around a room filled with 10 sleepers where any noise or any step at the wrong time waking them up makes the game so fun on top of not being an actionless game because of the security alarms that are in basically every mission 10/10 game would recommend to anyone that isnt a baby
BEFORE YOU BUY this game does NOT have much content this game does NOT have a lot of progression this game is hard My opinion on the game wasted potential the devs are lazy bugs stay in for long amounts of time and gun play is not good There is no unlock system and most content can essentially be used in the first level not enough content for price and needs large amounts of work would have been a good game but things such as the dissapointing gunplay the bad matchmaking the lack of content and the lack of a sort of progression/unlock system really drags the game down the drain good with friends if you like hard games
Vastly overrated game that I spent way too much money on when it was first release at 3.7 hours played I can't get a refund but this is one of the few games that I really do want my money back
very fun game would recommend

TBH even bots are better than real friends NGL they make me act up
Tall man comes for my hair
epic
This is a really fun and exciting game If you enjoy stealth and team work games this is for you Only minus is that you have to play with other people to actually have fun the singleplayer is a pain as it gives you 3 bots to command which the developers have made as easy to control as possible but it's still not the same level as human players The game does not also teach you a bunch of stuff and phrases to learn and play with other people I had to join the discord everyone on it is older than 15 or at least the people I came across so you know that they won't throw slurs at you for being new to the game Here is the link if anyone is interested I highly encourage you to play with people here as you will learn a lot and you will have fun playing this Comments on if anyone has any questions
is nice
f
game good
Maybe I'm bad at gaming but it is too hard lol
GOOD
this game is awsome
Fun game for faint of heart mhmm 100 for the faint of heart
i really GTFO man
GUD
I like this game i just wish that i could play the new stuff with my friends but each patch seems to make the multiplayer worse Dear devs PLEASE fix the multiplayer for us scrubs who cant run solo i want to play with my Alaskan friends again
This game must decrypt like G.T.F.O Get The F*ck Out I guarantee that this game is a fun simulator of crawling on your ass 9 successful chargers out of 10 ruined hits I need friends to play it
fuck this game
PRO Tip Touch the spaghetti womans spaghetti to get her to moan Side effects may include death
GTFO is such a experience for me and my friends to do strategy against the sleepers abomination It's best play with friends rather than bots as they are extremely hit or miss NPC in certain rundowns situations 3 real peoples are highly recommended but best 4 real friends to be extremely efficient at making rundown life easier Remember no sleepers
So this is what its like to be a walmart employee during black friday huh

super stressful yet fun
I love this game but it makes my d**k sore
This game is bad and repetitive but not in a good way

tri
TL;DR I generally recommend the game but with some serious caveats and some potential dealbreakers b]Overall it's a game with lots of rough edges that I think are worth overlooking if you're looking for a truly difficult coop experience and have the time to dedicate to it b Edit My hours might be misleading here I have all my progress on a family-shared account with 400 hours at the time of this review h3 Dealbreakers h3 I would absolutely avoid GTFO if any of these apply see the negative reviews that refunded for lots of examples of these Part of being a narrowly-scoped/niche product is that the game won't really appeal to everyone and the concept of GTFO is definitely polarizing b]Having to use Discord for matchmaking is a dealbreaker for you[/b There IS matchmaking but it has always been sparse and now that it's split across 7 rundowns it's almost impossible to find anyone for ANY level let alone the ones you actually want to play If you're not playing with friends you will need to use Discord to find lobbies b]Do not have large amounts of time to dedicate in one sitting[/b Levels in GTFO take a long time 1 hour for almost every level especially if you're moving slowly as new players will Some levels can take up to THREE hours for a successful completion although the average is definitely closer to 60-90 minutes in my experience It definitely does not have the same drop-in playability of something like L4D2 b]Don't enjoy difficult or time-consuming games[/b This game has a massive learning curve and even the easiest tier of levels in GTFO are hard enough to give new players serious trouble There's no real laid-back and casual way of playing this game so if that doesn't appeal to you then GTFO is 100 a bad pick I don't want to sound gatekeepy or elitist it's just the nature of the game hr][/hr If none of those have turned you off I think GTFO is a super unique blend of action stealth and resource management that really delivers on its promise of being hardcore It absolutely nails the desperate prisoners fighting for survival in an industrial hellscape vibe and I've never seen a game deliver the sense of dread GTFO does before The feeling while preparing for the last section of a 2 hour level when all you've got is four revolver shots and a hammer is hard to describe but the gratification of making it work and extracting successfully is incredible GTFO is probably the most stressful game I've ever played but in a good way h3]Core Gameplay[/h3 b]Stealth[/b Stealth is how you spend most of your time in GTFO At first learning how stealth works can be daunting but once you get the hang of it basically becomes a puzzle of how quickly can I murder a room of enemies rather than a real stealth game There's definitely missions where they ramp up the difficulty and things get intense going for the fourth code on R7E1 is spooky but that's mostly due to time pressure or the danger of the enemies rather than the stealth mechanics having any real depth or challenge to them I don't know that I enjoy the stealth mechanics themselves as they're fairly basic red light green light rules apply stop moving when sleepers make noise move when they're quiet but it's serviceable enough that I don't have many complaints b]Shooting[/b The gunplay in GTFO is very good The audio and animations are solid recoil is manageable but still noticeable and things feel weighty in all the right ways Not much to say here except that the shoot things sections feel great There's definitely an effectiveness hierarchy to the guns but none of them are unusably bad or blatantly overpowered h3]Story[/h3 There is practically no direct story in GTFO There i]are[/i tons of logs and other tidbits on terminals scattered throughout the game although mostly people read them on the internet that provide backstory and lore Generally people seem to find these interesting and well written but I haven't followed it closely enough to weigh in The later sets of levels Rundown 6/7 have some narrated parts that give you a more focused idea of what you're doing in a particular mission but as of now it's not really clear what all of it amounts to in a grander sense Given the way things have played out so far I'm incredibly skeptical Rundown 8 the final rundown will bring a satisfying story conclusion If you are looking for a compelling and straightforward narrative experience GTFO will not deliver This isn't necessarily a con just a design decision to take into account h3]Difficulty[/h3 The strongest point for GTFO in my opinion is that it's uniquely and unremittingly difficult With other high difficult coop games HoE in KF2 Cata in VT2 if you're competent you will USUALLY survive and sometimes get dealt a bad hand In the later tiers of GTFO levels your odds are never good even if your team is A lot of the difficulty in the game can be overcome by trial-and-error and map knowledge knowing what will trigger error alarms or fog learning where enemies will spawn the best places to abuse pathing etc which isn't as compelling to me as the rest of the game but honestly even having a concrete plan sometimes things go to shit Managing your incredibly limited resources while dealing with hordes of enemies is a uniquely stressful kind of entertainment but if it sounds fun to you no one has done it better than GTFO in my opinion h3]Bugs and Other Thoughts[/h3 GTFO is a fairly buggy game for something that considers itself a full release Not unplayably so but there are loads of rough edges and unpolished surfaces that can be frustrating Checkpoints have been unreliable since their inception more than a year ago and losing literally hours of progress to a bug like that will sour people FAST I find myself telling new players oh yeah that's a known bug pretty much once per session although there are very few that are truly gamebreaking The content stream for the game has also been incredibly slow since the release of rundown 6 which feels inexcusable when you look at the quality and quantity of modded rundown releases Overall though I do think the 30 price tag is fair for the amount of content currently offered R1 R7 but sticking through most of the early access was painful Overall it's a game with lots of rough edges that I think are worth overlooking if you're looking for a truly difficult coop experience and have the time to dedicate to it
Great game very hard missions are long which I like but I can see being a turnoff for many people much more difficult with less than 4 people Overall recommended
Fun for the whole family of dead men
GTFO makes me feel like crushing baby skulls with baseball bats
oyun zor ve strateji isteyen bir oyun Oyunda internetiniz yok internetle onu gerek sorun online oyun
Amazing game
21 Hours Nice game a bit pricey one of a kind experience made better with friends I would describe this game as a challenging stealth horde shooter with heavy yet simple resource management I will say this game is bit pricey for what it is but I would pick it up on steam when it is on sale or buy a key from a third party source This game is playable solo with bots but it is definitely better with at least one other friend Work together or die together is the most accurate catch phrase for a game I have ever seen Edit 48.3 Hours This game has gets better and better Currently on Rundown 2 with my friend It seems to me that since the older rundowns are you know older that playing the newer rundowns might give a better experience however despite the older rundowns being less feature rich it is lovely to essentially relive the evolution of a game Seeing and experiencing new features being added in levels and each new rundown is amazing
w game not even hard skill issue
10/10
Flew through the training session in about 18 minutes rundown 1 solo has been giving me troubles Tried about 3 times and still got shiddhon The bots are helpful but blows my mind the creatures don't recognize them standing right in front of them when they start clicking and glowing I've wanted to play this for a couple years and I'm glad I got to but my next step will be playing with friends Solo is fun but I keep hearing with friends is even better
why are you not playing it

Friends required and buy on sale You will play this frequently at first then weekly then monthly then intermittently throughout a year You will move on There is no sense of progress Finish one rundown and move onto the next and the next and the next so on it will go till the day you shalt uninstall the game for storage space

multiplayer system almost a piece of s**t you can never match with real player
I killed all my friends
I mean it's alright I guess.(I'm addicted
There is a game somewhere in this bug Good luck trying to find it
it looked really interesting and i enjoyed the tutorial mission then i couldnt figure out how the F to actually find a game to join i needed to find online communities and tutorials just to learn how matchmaking works which is apparently mainly through discord what how do you make a quality multiplayer game and then force people to matchmake outside of the game i cant even comprehend i genuinely wanted to play and the game actually prevented me from doing so absurd
I do not recommend this game not because it is difficult or skill-dependent but because there is no normal and adequate matchmaking or at least a list of lobby servers if someone is looking for some other mission because if you do not have 2-3 friends with this game in the list of friends in the Steam then you will not complete even 1-2 rundowns Thanks for the money back
DUDE WE NEED TO GET THE FUCK OUT BECAUSE WE HAVE MIC SPAMMER IN THE GAME
Damn I love this game
The game is too busy smelling its own farts to be a fun or competent multiplayer game so much wasted potential It would work much better as a dedicated single player experience or a more user-friendly multiplayer game
it do be fun
Dead game don't bother buying this sh1t Devs prefer to recycle old maps as new instead of patching the horrible matchmaking system forcing you to use Sh1tcord or other crap to match up with anybody Refuse to support lazy devs like this one
Fun game but better w a group or friends than using the bots in solo
it gets boring very easy Plus its difficult to find people to play with cool concept but i feel like they should put some more lore and progressive plot elements into the game instead of making more enemies that are the same but stronger
boring and you can't find people to play with
boobs
The only thing that the continuous updates ever added were new missions and that also have been kinda put to an end because everything is just recycled now There are no cool co-op animations no cool interactions no interesting game mechanics This game was a platform that could have been used to literally lead action-horror but they've made it just very dark and generic horde shooter Go buy Outlast Trials that game is in Early Access and has more coop that this
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i fucking hate this game can i get more
Insane

Highly recommended ONLY IF you really deeply enjoy games that torture you for making small mistakes This is most definitely not for the faint of heart if you love a SERIOUS challenge give this a try

WE GOT SLEEPERS DON'T WAKE THEM
PRO The combat is difficult fun gritty and scary The lore is also intriguing The constant pressure of needing to preserve ammo and health fits the game both mechanically and thematically CON The shooter part of the game is among the most difficult I've played which means a decent number of mission failures/restarts The scavenger hunt is unique but it's replay-ability is far less than the replay-ability of the fights So it's a bit of a bummer to want to get to the difficult fight with a new strategy knowing that you have to do this completely un-challenging time-sink before each attempt It ends up feeling like a complicated waiting room FINAL TAKE-AWAY It's fun but due to the con mentioned above it's hard to keep a group of people interested long enough to get my moneys worth
Never finished a single rundown 11/10 would die again

One of the best games to play with friends if you like survival action horror with in-depth strategy and planning Beware it will be difficult but the thematic feeling satisfaction of clearing a level is very rewarding

fucking boring
Very fun and unique Thrilling and exciting The teamwork dependency is the best part
18/20
fuck this game
Es muy bueno para jugarlo con amigos si juegas con los bots es un aburrido pero si aunque sea a un colega es un juego 10/10 vas a estar en todo el rato y te vas a sumergir en el juego de una manera super inmersiva

Everything about GTFO is terrifying and oppressive Every corner is a threat and every door is a death sentence if taken lightly It is nothing but pure punishment and no sane person would play this game of their own free will Great game 10/10
DO NOT BUY IF SOLO it comes with bots to replace human players but they suck and get u killed more often then not its a great game if u have friends that listen and can be coordinated alot of counting 123 charge and release silent ninja killing as a team pretty savage game i enjoy needing to help my teammates so they dont die teamwork makes the dream work
yes
A masochists dream game
This game is suffering and i love every second of it
Copy paste levels and enemies doesnt change fell asleep playing
i gtfo and it was pretty fun
good
GTFO is insanely fun however it is time consuming unless you're speedrunning My friends and I like to do slow and methodical approaches Bots are really dumb and only act as pack mule Besides that a few UI quality of life issues e.g the HUD for directing bots is kinda weird to use I would only recommend this game for those who have friends that are down to play for long periods of time
Sexy
sneaky boi poke butt
i can handle the bugs the stupid people cheating the game to make it even harder but thos problems plus the fact that i cant play whit my friends beccause it stops working for no reasin its tha worst worst part i love the game and its mechanick but a coop game that cant be played whit your freands its pretty crapy on my opinion
Shooter tactico dificil y MUY TACTICO y MUY DIFICIL La ambientacion es muy buena los recursos escasos los enemigos cada uno mas raro que el anterior y la coordinacion es clave para no liarla a los 5 minutos de partida Se puede jugar solo con bots se les puede dar ordenes sencillas y se manejan bien con el equipo que le pones pero preferiblemente jugar con amigos para una mejor coordinacion En definitiva una muy buena experiencia y muy recomendable para aquellos que busquen un desafio
A game not for the faint of heart Hard and challenging game yet so ridiculously fun get friends to play with though If only Mooseman and Lousier would want to play it more
dopium
this game is literally the hardest game i've played ever but its fun i would not play again
I got the fuck out but left Bishop to die
Very fun Coop is very much recommended but going solo never hurt nobody Graphics look amazing and true horror is when you actually play this game to it's full potential Highly recommend
yes
mhhmmmmm
Idk what to say besides the fact its absolutely amazing in every aspect they went to create
The amount of teamwork necessary for even the first level is setting the rest of the game up to be a challenge to look forward to
I've enjoyed playing with a group of 4 and developing strategies developing the skills over runs and feeling the progression of being almost paralyzed and slow at a few sleepers to fast stealth kills and coordinating group kills The maps are well developed never encounter any bugs or issues If you want to feel suspense and true resource limitation and the feeling hard earned survival without the anxiety of PvP loss or balogna deaths GTFO is great
You cant actually just play the game The fps drops if like 200 if u open a door and when the game starts(if it does not crash ur fps is like 10 I have 2080ti i9900k so yea My friend w amd card cant even play it it instantly crashes
Yes this game is absolutely amazing me and my friends have such a fun time playing this I'd definitely recommend to play the team work is one of my favorite parts of this game because one of your friends can run into a room full of sleepers and make you guys loose the round but we all end up laughing and trying it again
Does not work on 7900 XTX Not even with 3 months old recommended drivers

Its like one of the most stress inducing dread feeling games I've ever come across While the first few levels are casual and enjoyable very similar to the Alien Franchise the deeper you go on the levels the more horrifying and scary it gets As we grouped to the lower levels the game shows its true colors with its brilliant sound effects shadows lighting at ever turn You know you're in a pickle when you are constantly counting your rounds desperately hoping you have enough to get by That's what makes this game so unique the feeling of hopelessness and despair that leaves you coming back for more There's no other game out there like this and it just leaves your heart pounding for more The gameplay has improved since 3 years ago and its not smooth as butter with updated graphical fixes quarterly The developers have kept this game alive and have been updating features so I'm very happy to have supported them Overall this game is excellent for the survival/horror team comp game it is
Listen I absolutely adore this game It is incredible fun and has so much content that I haven't even scratched the surface of My only complaint about this game is that the bots aren't the best I don't have many friends to play this with and so I want to play solo which is almost impossible so bots will have to do However if you have friends the game is absolutely amazing 10/10 would recommend to anyone who enjoys horror games and has the friends to play with
Great game if you have friends even if you don't the discord is a good way to get it done without having to deal with npcs
The atmosphere is striking Playing this with friends felt immersive challenging spooky and incredibly fun
This game is super unique and it has a lot of very good features It is very team based I will say that some levels are pretty much impossible without teammates but they make the bots very good and helpful it has a ton of replay ability and they are always adding new stuff I would definitely recommend this to someone who likes shooters horror and strategy games
The best time travel game
GTFO RN
Interesting mechanics that makes you want to survive
Als es im kostenlosen Probierwochenende drinn war habe ich es aus Neugier gespielt und seitdem ich mir so sehr das entweder ein anderer Steam User dieses Spiel mit mir teilt oder es bald noch wird Es zu 100 wirklich das was es verspricht Ich kann es nur empfehlen
Difficult af but worth it for the feeling of accomplishment you get when you finally succeed Bringing friends helps but the AI is surprisingly and might I add impressively intelligent for the most part if you prefer to play solo Huge learning curve it's unlike any other game I've ever played
10/10
Honestly I have played GTFO over the course of its life This game is one of a kind Stealth with set-up for when stealth isn't an option in co-op form with actual difficulty and skill and teamwork required I don't play many games for longer than maybe 80 hours before i get bored and drop them I have 440 hours in this game Worst thing they did was add sprint to combat the kiting problem All that really did was make it so people died more often than not when someone foox up and wakes a BIG room Other than the sprint limit this game is one of my favorite of all time Matchmaking is a bit meh but the real way to play is to join their Discord and lfg in there If you are a group of 4 friends this game is 100 going to cause some banter and irritation until you clear that one you're really trying to get through on Prisoner Efficiency and then its one of the most satisfying feelings Game is hard as hell but well worth the money
GTFO is a hard as nails game that you can bash your head against for hours If you and a group of friends are up for the challenge a highly tactical and immersive stealth-horror-shooter awaits you
My friend lock me outside a door with C-Foam and then start a class D scan great gameplay
Greatest co-op game ever created if you have patience during level progressing want alot of intense moments coordination with team then this is a game for you

SO HARD
Work together or die alone The most lovable stressful game I've played Definitely worth the coop experience The adrenaline is real
if you want to spend hours to fail this is the game for you hard but its almost always your fault
10/10 would play again
Aigh so since I could never properly review this game since I will probably never finish it within 1 of my lifetimes I will just keep this review updated Current status I would recommend Current Review I really like the concept of this game and the hard difficulty makes strategy necessary now I just hope they do not go overboard because I can see this concept blowing up in everyone's faces Current Progress LEVEL 1 was a great introduction and really fun since you could only beat it if you understood the game LEVEL 2 was a good way to teach the player the strategy aspect as well as the different objectives LEVEL 3 helps the player get used to the coding mechanic while hard it is definitely doable LEVEL 4.soo up to this point the game seemed flawless This level makes you get used to sentries and reactors and it's a sh*t show It is definitely beatable with a good strategy but is very repetitive and relies a bit too much on rng LEVEL 5 is a test of everything you have learned and a really good one at that The level is fun challenging and has tons of variety in its rooms However thank crap this level is optional because it takes way too long In of itself that is more a nuisance than a problem but when combined with a ridiculous amount of enemies it sucks LEVEL 6 The first big finale and my favorite level of R1 It's challenging and has you using strategy around every corner It comes off as a bit too easy since i first tried this but that may just be because this is the most well-balanced level out of them all More of this LEVEL 7 I really like this level a great scenery change with tons of new and interesting mechanics LEVEL 8 Really cool a good challange LEVEL 9 First half sucks second half is great LEVEL 10 It's a worthy level 10 Level 11 Basic but with a interesting ending
FPS
amazing game only thing that could be better is if controller worked better
took me 4 hours to get one mission done good game
BIG GUYS
Neat Spooky Frustrating
Es como ir a puros bichos Muy buen juego bastante la verdad
It's a game that exists that you can play and the graphics are definitely there and if you listen closely there is definitely audio that is coming through your audio device of choice the keys on the keyboard are more that likely bound to something that happens in-game like W moves you foward and S moves you back Hell even the MOUSE can turn your camera around so you can see what is in your vicinity it is quite honestly one of the games ever made I'll have to rate this
AUXILIO mis compas no tienen talento 10/10
Mi amigo le disparo a la madre y nos arruino la hora de partida GOD GAME 10/10
If your like me you love horror games and this game does not fail on that aspect nor the gun play this game is the perfect mixture of difficulty ambience and cooperation Its hard but if your team puts in the effort you will eventually win If you like horror games fps's and a challenge this game is for you
The best experience is playing completely blind to the mechanics of the game Fantastic game balanced around 4 players and 4 players only If you purchase this game expecting to play it by yourself it's next to near impossible But still fun Anyone who is looking for a game that forces you and your dysfunctional 3 friends to work together in a game about resource management stealth and gunplay synergy this is the game for you Note They added bots to the game but they are not human players and will not fill the slots of players You are warned The game knows what it is and leans into the horror/action elements extremely well The general gameplay is centered around stratigizing with teammates and working together to complete an objective that gives no clarity to the true objective path There are no fancy skills there are no reliefs You'll be constantly under stress and uncertainty The game is about trying losing and altering strategy And most importantly when your objective is complete GTFO
I typically don't write many reviews on games but this one honestly deserves it 0 Micro-transactions which in this day and age is practically unheard of The game is updated regularly Super challenging but with friends makes it very enjoyable but oddly frustrating as well Requires skill patience tons of team work and tactics in order to get to the next level The graphics are great and the game is very easy to run So if you have thoughts on this game and thinking about getting it 10/10 Recommend it
too hard with no difficulty scaling The game is also meant for 4 people so when you play with less it's much harder
its a good game i guess
one of the best coop games out
hard game but worth the play
Delightfully challenging
I milked the aliens then I died GAMING
I have tried before to get into GTFO but the hardest struggle with the game is also its greatest aspect teamwork To get really proficient and go into deeper levels without wiping every time you need a team of people who you work with and learn This game has several LFG systems but random people are inconsistent and grow even more so as the levels get harder There are also bots now They are interesting in that they are accurate and not stupid They don't negatively affect you but they are incredibly hard to make a team with which is again the best aspect of this game They aren't bad bots because they make decisions they are bad bots because they make no decisions except they keep SPENDING ALL MY MEDKITS If you want to really get into this game find a group of 3 others who are interested in starting with you Get ready to wipe a few times Try a few auxiliary objectives before going to really deep levels Oh also this game has lore It's very in depth too much so for me right now Worth an hour-long YouTube video to figure it all out though
yeet i love it

This game is not for the casuals from FPS games This game is brutal hard slow tactical So if you can't agree with these terms then definitely skip this game Though the sweet satisfaction you get post completing any level is surely worth it

For those who value teamwork communication patience rationing resources and having to learn from your mistakes by being punished again and again this may be the greatest horror coop shooter ever made
Probably the best game I absolutely suck at 10/10 Would recommend to someone with a short temper

Jogo 10/10 isso mesmo Coloco a minha no fogo por ele Se eu tiver que reclamar de uma unica coisa dos terminais que o game em PT-BR mas o uso das dos terminais Se para os nativos da inglesa tem dificuldade com essa fica pior para quem o sei como podem arrumar isso mas o ponto critico que pode atrapalhar um jogador novato
what if i dont want
Ein super Hardcore Shooter zum gemeinsamen zocken nach dem Feierabend Wenn man eine feste Gruppe an Kollegen hat die Lust auf sowas haben kann ich das Spiel nur empfehlen Die Map-Wechsel sowie die unterschiedlichen Gegner in jeder Season lassen das Spiel nicht langweilig werden Das einzigste dass ich etwas Schade finde ist dass zumindest empfinde ich das so die Gegner etwas einfacher geworden sind im Gegensatz zu ganz am Anfang Aber das mag vielleicht auch nur Einbildung sein
Very good game Helps with teamwork
very challenging game would recommend playing with friends to help make the rundowns easier to explore or just play by yourself to get the maximum amount of scares
buen juego
this is a game that absolutely grabs multiplayer by the and never lets go the develop team is amazing and the whole team keeps up with updates great game

Very fun game
thigh high compression socks with my cargo shorts makes for a free mission
its a banger
Excelente juego y bla bla es la raja Pero nos falta 1 en la party somos 3 que hable hable al DM El juego es muy divertido y dificil
for being a fps/horror game this probably takes the cake it has this fine mix between the two were after a while its not too scary to play but still makes you tense up as well as having a good varity of weapons you can use and all skins are unlocked by completing lvls instead of having to spend more money would recomend
I love this game a lot I came from playing a lot of fps shooters on my Xbox this was my introduction to PC gaming and I love it Honestly love the different play style from what I'm use to It is a very slow-paced game a few rundowns can last hours if you're trying to be very stealthy I do highly recommend it if you like horror games
big scare many aliens
The words bonk and incessant screaming seem to describe my experience quite well
If you have three mates and are looking for a new game you need GTFO If you want a game that is A challenging B has maps that are absolutely stunning visually yet thrilling at the same time have you on edge constantly and C so rewarding when you win/complete a level then I cannot recommend GTFO enough It is a 10 out of 10 game and they are few and far between
The bones of a good concept but they've taken the wrong choice at nearly every turn Why poison fog why voice notes over a game you need maximum auditory awareness why is it so awkward to help your friends Playing it as a coordinated group with friends on discord and I still didn't enjoy it
I missed the head of the scout sorry guys
game is too hard
Recently jumped into this game after only briefly playing it on early release Having a ton of fun though I wish we had a 4th to play each night because the AI can be entertaining at best Hackett is the best of them
A great game if you have somebody to play with otherwise its pointless.because you wont be able to play
Its a lot of fun with friends if you have any
Very good game with fun gameplay and interesting mechanics I would not reccomend buying it to play solo or with less than 3 friends Game is completely dead unless you have 3 friends and all get the game it is not worth your money
This game has a lot of individual parts that are great but doesn't make it when put together in my opinion anyways Atmosphere is great but is lost if you aren't playing with a group of friends Gunplay is pretty solid but the game discourages you from using your gun to preserve resources On top of that there are a lot of redundant or useless weapons where another one is just better than the other in every way ie smg vs carbine I personally feel like the game lacks a certain identity It doesn't know if it wants to be a stealth survive game with friends or a horde shooter In my eyes it does ok in both aspects but iv'e seen it done better elsewhere The game has it's moments for sure but sadly i don't think new rundowns change enough about the game to keep it interesting long term At best each rundown adds a new mechanic or a new enemy that shows up maybe once or twice But I don't think it changes the core loop enough to keep players engaged I think the game would have benefited greatly from dedicated matchmaking or a server list It would allow players to find the experience they're looking for The community of this game falls into 2 categories optimal players that really know their stuff or new players looking for a fun survival atmospheric experience The latter of which rarely make it to C tier or beyond due to the hardcore nature of the game All in all I enjoyed my first 80ish hours with this game,but it drags imo and there isn't enough for me to keep playing Not to say it's bad The game is very well made with few to little bugs in my experience It's just not my favorite and for a new player with no one to play with I cannot recommend it
I DONT LIKE THE TENTACLE ONES
polecam ale szukanie meczu to okropny bul w dupie do radomowego meczu i szukanie ponad 4 godziny
This is surely a game Possibly even a good one
les D.A magnifique l'immersion et la sensation de se faire submerger tout moment sont au coeur du gameplay Depuis sa sortie les ont permis mon sens une nette plus d'armement traduction en fr ce pas la release sur les terminaux avec certaines traductions plus de bug graphiques sur ma config en tout cas ryzen 7 et 1060Ti du ratio des bots les le GROS POINT mon sens est la population de GTFO Si tu n'as pas 3 autres potes pour lancer une partie tu es contraint de lancer une partie avec les bots la mission R1A1 se en solo bot de un serveur depuis la j'ai plusieurs ou recherche de groupe j'ai attendu JE N'AI PAS TROUVE UNE SEULE PARTIE et c'est vraiment dommage je recommande GTFO car il de l'attention

Juegazo 20/10 y God
its kinda boring you just crouch walk around constantly playing red light green light meleeing shit because if you go loud you die in like 3 hits you don't really ever fight anything new just kinda bland tbh
Good game I love this game
Excelente jogo em todos os aspectos que o mesmo busca trabalhar Cooperatividade e adrenalina oferecidos de forma realizar as runs solo mas fica bem mais o ideal jogar com party fechada Como todos que gostam deste estilo de jogo tentem buscar jogar com o pessoal no discord GTFO Brasil eles ensinam de boa e dahora conhecer a turma Criticar o jogo por ser ou pq tem checkpoint constante faz mt sentido visto que a e a de realizar as de forma fazem parte da gameplay o que o torna pois vc duramente penalizado critique o jogo pq facilitado ele cumprindo com o que seria mais um jogo de wave Avaliar com menos de 10h significa que vc foi carregado ou jogou o suficiente O tutorial a Demo a primeira fase rundown o tutorial apenas a partir da rundown 2 que o jogo de verdade
Al inicio no sabia si este juego seria bueno pero mientras mas lo jugaba mas me gustaba y no solo por la jugabilidad que te obliga a hacer la mayoria en sigilo para ahorrar balas si no que es su historia pese a estar escondida entre logs dentro del juego es increible sobre todo el que los creadores hayan hecho que no solo tengas que buscar info dentro del juego si no que tambien debas ver en otras partes como en el twitter de the warden o en la pagina de santonian me parece increible no dire que este juego es una obra de arte pero si puedo decir que es un gran juego sobre todo para jugarlo con amigo 100 recomendado
AFTER SPENDING ANOTHER 40 FUCKING HOURS ON THIS GAME ALL OF MY FRIENDS HATE ME MY GIRLFRIEND LEFT ME FOR A WOMAN AND I'VE LOST ALL SANITY AND I ONLY PLAY THIS GAME ALONE NO CLOTHES NO FRIENDS NOTHING I CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE SAVED SAVED I ONLY HAVE THE BRAIN DEAD BOTS TO SAVE ME FROM THIS MORTAL COIL
Be me join a team full of pros sneak like a mad man and shit your pants for 35 min coz you dont know whats going on fell down on an enemy coz i didn't see the floor everything wakes up and starts screaming at you whole team dies 10/10
very fun a nd spooktacular better with friends hacket is kind of dumb
is fun
This game makes you hate it and love at the same time It just needs more QoL stuff and modded support and it'd last way after 10chambers are done with it
GTFO is a great game If youve played Deep Rock Galactic then you will like this game My only complaint is the multiplayer Though very well made the only true way to form a squad is using discord or having friends Even then it takes a long time to assemble a group for a game Soloing the game is also difficult but possible The devs are updating the game but they arent adding features that shouldve been added years ago
Fun Co-op game that keeps you on your toes The sound design especially pulls you in With the release of previous expeditions there is definitely enough content to get your money's worth
10\10
Don't buy this game if you have any level of self respect
gud game
Jogue apenas se tiver amigos para fechar o squad pq se sua com o jogo afetada negativamente
hard and fun crazy combo
GOOD GAME
GREAT game this game is one of my absolute favorites only problem i have with it is it runs like garbage on my pc but thats not fully on the game itself my pc just sucks
GTFO has me tearing up every room that I enter but that's because i'm new to the game Having friends to play the game with can lead to a more calm and collected experience as trying to solo requires a knowledge of the game's mechanic enemies weapon usage and so on If you die then don't get frustrated this game is the Dark Souls of horror/shooters/co-op games You WILL die whether you like it not although that can be avoided with some practice The enemies fire tracking plasma balls of some kind with some strafing you can easily avoid them and charge a melee hit to kill them in one hit highly recommended to practice this set of moves since Ammo Packs are hard to find and with teammates it can be frustrating on deciding what resources each member will need For any new players i'd recommend using the Thermal Rifle to see enemies in the darkness that this game is in order to plan your route and a buddy to play with Playing alone is very intense and having someone around can lead to more fun and a better experience Not all things are perfect in the 13 hours that I have played however The main con of all cons is that these bots will not shut the fuck up I swear to God you will enter a room and have the Bot drop the most generic one liner for the twenty second time and that annoys the hell out of everyone You don't want to be distracted whilst sneaking in-between two massive enemies that can kill you in an instant You can easily disable the Dialog of the game in the Audio options but I'd rather that they just added the option to decrease the voice lines from the bots or simply remove them all whenever you're in a room full of enemies in a certain radius Other than that the game features solid gameplay and atmosphere and I highly recommend it for those who love titles such as S.T.A.L.K.E.R Dead Space and SPC to name a few although different the horror element is one of the main driving forces of this game It's well worth the money for it even though I got the game as a gift If I hadn't I'd happily pay for it
AH but for an hour at a time
Does it already scale down when you just wanna play with 2 people or does the community still shit on you for even remotely suggesting this
IF U LIKE UR ASS EATEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU HARD AF
i CANT SEE SHIT MY ASS HAS BEEN BEAT IN 30 TIMES ALREADY LOVE IT
Big bonk yes
hao wan
Very immersive game very challenging lots of replay ability Literally nothing like it It does come with its caveats though There are some bugs it seems the devs take a while to get around to patching things There has usually been about one game-breaking bug per rundown and it's extremely frustrating when your group has been kicking ass for an hour and a half clawing your way through multiple objectives and feeling very good on the way to extract only to have a bug on the last scans and lay to waste the time you had sunk into it No one feels like playing another level or immediately retrying it after that That being said it doesn't stop me from recommending it to other players looking for a unique and challenging like extremely challenging experience Find three other guys to get together with consistently and run the shit out of this game I don't think you'll regret it
Pure pain
ATTENTION THE DO OF THE
Also ich habe dies Spiel jetzt angetestet und mich ist es nichts dunkle Nebel schlechte sicht und schleichen bis man umfeld Ich denke wer splinter cell mag den ist das was wer aber auf ballern steht last die finger von den game lohnt sich nicht
1000 Hours and still can't beat R4E1
Spent one hour briefing my guys on how to meticulously clear a level avoiding any bad outcomes Spent another hour clearing majority of the level avoiding said bad outcomes Spent 2 minutes getting completely eaten alive because one of us took one step too many I love this game

FPS game with souls games difficulty Play if you want to lose all your sanity
If Left 4 Dead 2 Dark Souls and SCP had a three way
Very rare these days to find an experience quite like this undeniably fun and terrifying at the same time This game will put you and your friends teeth to the metaphorical curb and i wouldn't have it any other way QUERY 9/10
Megaa Funny im Team
You will lose your friends That is not a suggestion
fun game to play with ppl on the gtfo discord
best game because the scout hit the griddy and the sleepers sometimes are taking a shit quietly i like to get licked too ngl
Eta igra ebet v ochko
maybe
Incredible game So many levels mod options worldwide play and hundreds of hours of content Once you get into it it will definitely become one of your favourite games
Love communication.with a heavy dose of lead all jokes aside its a great game if you have a full team of friends to join you this is a game that is never going to be easy it takes time and practice to learn and it rewards skill in gun play and communication
Absolutely worth it Play this if you want to experience suspenseful and action-packed shooter This game is a Tactical FPS tower defense stealth looter Extremely polished too
Very fun very tense super hard
alot of fun 10/10 recommend especially if you have 3 close friends to play it with
good game needs dedicated players and a good team but worth the time investment if your a fan of survival horror team shooters DONT GO DEEPER IF YOU WANT TO LIVE
This game is incredibly fun with friends One of the best horror-survival games ever in my opinion I wish that they allowed a scaling option for duos and solos though or if not enemy scaling let us spawn in with more ammo and give us more drops There's nothing like spawning in with your duo and you both only have 50 percent ammo
This is a very fun and challenging experience The only problem i have is the AI The friendly fire is a bit annoying and it is annoying when they pick up supplies and use them Because of that I can't say for certain that people will enjoy a solo experience but there is definitely potential for fun when with other teammates
very tense shit pants many times
Dope not the drug but the Feeling this game gives your pp Fellow 9yo yeet yeet
Very Fun Need to play with friends Makes the experience so much better
I wish I could convince more people to play this game I've loved it since early access The levels are challenging definitely not for the weak It's such an awesome feeling when you finally pass a level Devs did great with this one Hopefully it'll continue to gain traction as time goes on 3
Family friendly
shoot shoot fun
Only fun with friends Levels are too long and repetitive Level Design all looks the same

such a pain to play but I love it
Better than Overwatch 2 PvE
id say worth the money although you do either need to join the discord or have friends that have this game to play it to its fullest extent if you don't then you will not have much fun but if you like a good challenge then fill your boots btw this game has match making

No importa cuantas horas tengas en este juego 100 200 o 1000 no importa SIEMPRE vas a tenerle miedo al Scout
great atmosphere splendid ideas demands close cooperation lacks players such a shame
gut diese skari
we do a bit of sneaking
Don't even try R4E1
Teamwork makes the dream work
You better STFU if you wanna GTFO
It's fun but you need at least 3 friends to play with
Game is Game
all of the monster are naked
El juego esta bueno pero es un viaje encontrar alguien para jugar asique agregen
love the sleepusy
my friend james told us he was going to silently take out the alien with his hammer he winds up he misses we die blames it on our friend josh we all blame josh
Cool concept but gameplay is relatively shallow Doesn't live up to the scp type fantasy it sells Gimmicks are not very relevant to the gameplay
One of my only reviews but this game is everything I love If you have friends who are willing to buy this and spend the time this is one of the best co-op games to choose there needs to be a lot of teamwork and you need to be able to trust your teammates but if you all know what you're all doing this game is so fun to play Even during challenging levels you get to problem-solve and I look forward to future updates and improvements I'm probably going to have a lot of hours on this game This game isn't for everyone the game is hard and the levels are pretty long but if you bring some friends this might be your favorite game 10/10 for me Also if you need a guide since the game is pretty rough for new players I recommend going on youtube and watching some tutorials
waiting for it to get a legit decent sale to actually buy it none of my friends will pay this much for this type of game and i refuse to play it alone given the difficulty waiting simulator
Really repetitive with limited missions the fog is AWFUL Cosmetics are pointless and the game isnt beginner or solo friendly
i hate this game

At the point of writing this review I have completed most missions all of them with friends I only have 2 missions left in Rundown 7 which is arguably the hardest of them all GTFO is a diamond in the rough with empathise on the rough The game has a huge learning curve few accessibility options and is downright unfair sometimes due to technical errors or limitations It is not a game for everyone Here is why I still recommend it despite all of that GTFO is about failing learning from your mistakes and find a new strategy The R7 mission AWOL is a perfect example of this You are thrown out there without a clear objective and have to struggle to figure things out We've probably failed around 20 times if not more and we all have over 50 hours of playtime at this point But then something you try works You try that strategy next time and suddenly the mission goes from insane to something doable Hope starts to rise and today we finally managed to complete the mission Such a good feeling of overcoming great odds This is not a game for everyone and I wouldn't want it any other way However here are some things I would want another way Personality settings for the boss to tweak at what treshhold they heal or resupply you A lot of times they stop shooting because you went from 100 HP to 75 which snowballs into a very bad situation Ordering bots to drop their supplies so you could pick them up instead would be nice Some maps are too long and should have a checkpoint Checkpoints should persist even if you leave the expedition if they don't want us to have a bunch of checkpoints up at once on different maps they can just make it so the last dissapears if you open a new expedition strike More story content currently R7 is pretty much the only rundown that has any and is by far the best content the game has to offer.[/strike With the release of R8 I deem this improvement fixed Maybe something like a booster reforge system would be nice just to get rid off excess boosters System is pretty optional anyway
Good but only fun if you have friends
This game is NOT it
game is neither mechanically or aesthetically pleasing just a frustrating mess that's equal parts slow and boring

They fixed the bots 5 stars
Games mad amounts of fun with a heavy empisis in cooperation and constant communication no lone wolves on this on
do you like redoing levels over and over when you or your friends accidentally trigger an entire community it's like living in real life 10/10
Amazing game 10 outta 10 must have friends for full experience
Possibly the scariest game solo I have ever played in my life Not because of the monsters I mean sure they will get you every now and then But the AI that drops with you every mission are the real monsters I mean Jesus Christ Tim Get your ASS in the room and stop fazing through the fucking door I'm trying to open a tier 5 alarm door here and you dying as a pull the lever isnt helping
yes
dont wake them
Before I played GTFO I had a small pp no friends no gf depression and a crippling p*rn addiction And after 140 hours nothing has changed good game though
j'ai bien le moment ou on doit get the fuck out
This game is very fun if you like high stress and strategy games with a heavy need for stealth and communication the game is a lot more fun when you have friends to play with with but if wanna solo the game gives you bots that you can command with a few clicks of a button
spoiler]DL-7572[/spoiler b]GTFO[/b
This Game will break you I mean it still 10/10 We had 4 5 try's on the first Mission as a full squad but what a feeling as we finally made it the progress in understanding how the game works is huge and extremely addicting For me the Sound design really peeks out i'm always playing in full volume i don't know any game where i do this you just start the game and before you are in the main menu your completely in this world just start your first rundown for a sound check If you like sneaky game play or just rushing trough thinking about live as a resource and get f't in the a with your friends this is your Game
many tongue slap me in face leave me feeling violated good game
i fucked a sleeper and lived to tell the tale
I love this game This game can be really tough but having great teamwork and coordination as well as having a good weapon loadout can really make the difference It feels super satisfying to completing every level and almost all of them have their own special quirk to them My only issue is how slow it is to switch weapons and also how you can see what other people are typing on the terminal
The complexity and texture of the sleepers rear quarters got me coming back every day of the week See you again tomorrow cupcake
jogo muito para jogar sozinho ou em dupla achar pessoas para jogar nem divertido nem todo mundo gosta de seguir a mesma estrategia e sem pior do que sozinho tem save no jogo o que pode fazer abrir o jogo todo dia a semana toda e sair da primeira faze pois elas demoram muito e muito cansativo voltar do inicio um simples checkpoint leva um jogo de maravilhoso para

This game is one of my all time favorites to play with my friends I genuinely love the care the developers put into this game and their dedication to providing an exceptionally unique experience It is difficult and will not hold your hand You need to pull out every trick you can think of to make it through and that's the fun My group has played together for over 2 years now and we still think of new strategies The combos you can pull off with thinking and timing never get old
h1 GTFO Significa Cagast3 h1 Es un juego de terror shooter FPS en la cual se enfoca en la y la estrategia por lo tanto si o si tienes que jugar con amigos porque si no la que te van a hacer es digno de subirlo a p0rnhub ya que la y son la clave para tener en las misiones La dificultad es elevada y los mapas enormes con recursos limitados por lo tanto el sigilo es primordial en muchas ocasiones solo dispara si es necesario La que crea es opresiva con una excelente y efectos de sonido que aumentan la a medida que avanzas gran variedad de armas y mejoras para tu equipo que ayudan a aligerar un poco el trayecto de cada El juego no tienen mucho lore osea si tiene pero es muy rebuscado simplemente son prisioneros condenados que los mandan a misiones para reducir sus sentencias a un lugar donde cayo un meteorito y las misiones consta de buscar documentos muestras entre otros Lo malo del juego es la poca variedad de enemigos y su de un tiempo falta contenido
I'm down
Teamplay is a MUST This thing is a Zombie-shooter ala Left4Dead in the same sense that Dark Souls is an action-adventure ala Assassin's Creed GTFO is HARD but as you figure it out so far it seems manageable
var vururum korkmam falan demeyin en oyunlardan biri olabilir grafikler 7 10 9 10 animasyonlar 6 10 9 10 fizikler 8 10 10 10 atmosfer ve 9 10 de bir oyun oynayacak vaktim yok ama daha
great coop game I played R6 Extraction for a year and loved the gameplay loop of that game GTFO is similar but is more unforgiving and from what I can see the mission objectives are more diverse Maps from zone to zone within a rundown so far looks a bit monotonous and lack of real progression such as unlocks.etc are a bit of a miss Overall happy with the game
If you enjoy exploring new fetishes this game is for you
Really enjoying this game Requires competent teammates which can be asking a lot and teamwork to achieve Nothing is impossible but every mission will require strategy and teamwork Best played with people you know
35 4 10/10
Best COOP shooter ive played since the release of Left for Dead 2 can be a bit buggy but it makes up for it with super good gun play vibes insane difficulty to keep ya from just going through the motions and an Awesome community to play with via their Discord
L4D but spooky
Que juego tan de la verga y aburrido encima
Super difficult but that's the nice part about it You need to learn and practice ABSOLUTELY NEED AT LEAST 3 PLAYERS But by now I'm sure you've seen that Shame there is no real sense of award from your skill
TLDR The mechanics are really fun but insanely punishing Not exaggerating the mission fail rate in this game is astronomical The characters seem lacking until you read/listen to some logs The world/lore is really cool But again hidden behind logs and such Enemies are really diverse but they're a whole other layer of difficulty as a lot of them have slight differences to them that are important Like vulnerability spots for instance Full Review I've tried to get into this game several times over the years and I really want to enjoy it But I can't The game is difficult for the sake of being difficult No big or complex mechanics to memorize just insane difficulty And I fully understand that the devs say This game isn't for casuals and I don't really care This goes beyond trying to make a well crafted and difficult game This is unbalanced and poorly designed in so many ways And they just keep adding more stuff I can't tell you how many times I've got caught on geometry or a random mob wakes up in the middle of a room and just basically causes the whole mission to fail Even if you survive your ammo tool and health are likely lower which severely lowers your chance of survival Also limited ammo capacity makes no sense in this context Sure the characters are expendable but the amount of ammo and resources you have upon mission start are awful If you want someone expendable to complete a mission you would at least outfit them with as much ammo and supplies as they'd need for said mission Not 20 rounds for a shotgun and 90 for an AR(Give/take for a SPRAWLING UNDERGROUND COMPLEX FILLED WITH HOSTILE CREATURES And I know stealth exists but there are a LOT of points in the game where stealth is not an option at all It forces you into using your guns I've seen some discussions about Just kite the enemies noob but that doesn't always work and not everyone wants to use some cheese method to get through what should be an average encounter I want to play it in an immersive manner Speaking of stealth I love the stealth in the game but I hate the concept that one wrong decision can fail the whole mission as stated previously And playing solo these missions are well over an hour long on average My friends gave up on this game a long time ago and I do not like randoms They just make things worse Overall I really want to recommend this game for the general audience But I can't It's not meant for the general audience It's meant for that small pool of people that enjoy grueling and unfair gameplay I will never understand why people think that difficulty options are a bad thing It's an option FFS Don't buy this game unless You have at least 2 friends that want to play with you You understand that this game's idea of difficulty constantly changes and gets worse per mission and per rundown New mechanics enemies environmental hazards etc And take if from me(If you do decide to buy don't play this solo It's not worth it
Me We should play it slow Friends Yes Rico Kaboom
O jogo divertido ainda mais com amigos mas cansa muuuuuuuuito jogar pelo fato de ter checkpoint cada fase 1 ou 2 horas pra terminar e se morrer ja era tem que tuuuuuudo de novo e isso um saco poderia ter um modo diferente com checkpoints e saves pra poder parar de jogar quando quiser E se que pretendendo comprar GTFO tiver nem compre vai se frustar muito
um jogo muito bom e interessante a cada descida diferente tudo Unico do jogo que demora muito mas compensa com a jogabildiade e o teamplay
After finally having acquainted myself with the first two movies I get it now Bot Bishop
actually better now whole lot better now
nice to enjoy just pay attention to teamwork it will be fine
i like this game but i have no friend to play with
Dark Souls but its an FPS Survival game

I doing my part
nicht was ich von dem Spiel halten soll Wurde von einem Kumpel mir das Spiel zu kaufen Normalerweise sind Spiele auf Horrorbases nicht wirklich meins deshalb musste ich 2x ob es sinn macht Am ende hab ich es mir gekauft und mit denen gespielt Nachdem ich mit dem Gedanken ran gegangen bin das es horrorlastig wird war ich gespannt was auf mich zu kommt Am ende war es eigentlich gar nicht so schlimm wie ich dachte Klar das Spiel ist oftmals verdammt dunkel aber dadurch das man nicht viele hat wie z.B eine Leiche von der decke oder sowas Ist es eher schwach von der nur mein eindruck Worin geht es bei GTFO geht es darum sich als Gruppe durch verschiedene ebenen zu arbeiten sei es etwas besorgen oder eine bestimmte Aufgabe erledigen Dabei sollte muss aber nicht man taktisch vorgehen da wenn man es zu hastig macht zieht man die Aufmerksamkeit der Monster auf sich Dabei trifft man auf schwach Monster die man mit einem gezielten Nahkampfangriff ausschalten kann oder man sie ignoriert Dann hat man verteilt auf den ebenen verschiedene die ihr entweder einfach oder hacken musst um sie zu Dabei solltet ihr euch mit den mitgliedern absprechen und weise Da es wichtig die Mission sein kann was man Mein Fazit Mir hat es nicht sonderlich viel gemacht Finde es teilweise echt weird wie viel Loot man findet den man am ende gar nicht mitnehmen kann weil man kein platz hat Daher stell ich mir die frage warum es dann soviel gibt Dann das ding mit der Ich geh mit dem Gedanken ran das es schlimm mich wird was dann aber eher eine war da die gar nicht viel Horror bietet Dunkelheit Das Spiel Prinzip gut kommen wenn die Gegner sich nicht so random verhalten Es gibt sicherlich viele denen das Spiel machen wird mich ist es aber eher so ein 50/50 Ding zumindest momentan Ich geb dem Spiel trotzdem ein Daumen Hoch da es nicht wirklich schlecht ist nur aus meiner Sicht nicht sooooo interessant
A week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illness and the doctors have given me a year at best I'm so glad I was able to play this before I go I don't know how many people will see this but I recommend to you to play this game if you do see it Gameplay atmosphere graphics everything is masterfully crafted If you read it thank you and good bye

fun and tense gameplay having a full party makes the experience even better but playing with bots isnt bad just makes it slightly harder to sync attacks other than that very fun
Love the atmosphere and gunplay Great with three friends Still good with fewer than four people due to the introduction of bot players Periodic updates continue to introduce content in the form of rundowns with their own set of missions I am also invested in finding out what happened in the story of GTFO Lore tidbits are found while playing the game similar to Destiny with more information coming to light in later rundowns
fun ame
great game
Jump to hell
If you are looking for a challenge and some THICCCCCCCC ass clickers you found the right game 10/10 would smash again
silly masked men go pew pew
Great game Love the idea of having to play things smart Cannot just run and gun Matchmaking was a little difficult for me I am new to discord but am getting the hang of it
The Satisfaction of completing a level after you and your friends have failed several times in a row is unmatched 10/10 would recommend if you are atleast a party of 3
Bugs everywhere

great with friends a challenge without both are great
garbage
GET THE FUCK OUT thats what it says
This game is honestly the best fps game I've ever played it may seen difficult at first but as long as you have a plan you shouldn't struggle that much in a four player lobby All of the levels are made too be played by four people and there isn't any difficulty scaling so make sure too get friends bots or other people from the discord server too play with you If you don't want to do all that it's still possible to play but just make sure you're up for the extra challenge It may seem a bit pricey but I can assure you this game is the best use of that money you could ever make
very fun game i just wish it didnt cost so much so friends can get it without spending so much
great game

GTFO

Tedious:the game has one upside the weapons sound good but you can't use em because ammo is rare and waves happen every 2 feet because every door has alarms Oh an constant stream of doors mist that removes sight from the equation and a lack of fun in general
My favorite game I suck at Best played with friends
Very hard and scary 8/10 would recommend Although hard to matchmake lobbies
The only time when mothers come after me
very hard
Get some friends and ahve at it But remember 91 of all missions fail
goddamn its bad

good
one of the best underrated co-op games out there not your typical call of duty and the dynamic and some pretty hard missions make it a great experience

its pretty fun with people and def scary alone but it takes a long time and can get boring otherwise its worth it to play once in a while with homies
very lovely even though the community is small the devs still put alot of effort in this game deserve a labour of love award
yo lo compre a 400 pe este juego y ahora ESTA 4.500 QUEEE PERO CHUPAME EL CHOTO CON ESA PLATA ME COMPRO nada UN FERNET CON UNA COCA que pais de mierda lpm loco
I Love this game but my friend keeps ragerquiting
muy buen juego si te gusta el terror y los shooters con amigos y partidas bastantes largas y muy complicadas y tensas
great game
GTFO a game where every micro-movement is judged and criticized by your so called friends 10/10 need better friends
I need therapy after this game
TOP DEMAIS
El juego esta bueno tiene buena tematica y ambientacion pero no lo recomiendo si no tienes amigos con quien jugar y los grupos de discord desde mi punto de vista estan muerto y el matching no encuentra con quien jugar y jugar con bots es muy aburrido asi que piensalo bien
This is/was my 2022 GotY It continues to hold a top spot in 2023 I'm just a regular guy with no sway in your purchasing power But I HIGHLY recommend this game 1 Yes playing with others is HIGHLY advised 2 No don't worry the game is HIGHLY active You can find player's to aide you in your journey through the complex on the GTFO discord channel 3 Yes you will die It is hard 4 No you won't regret giving this game a try The Devs know what kind of game they have built and are going for and definitely have something golden here 426hours at time of writing this I'm still deeply invested in this game and I think if you like shooters stealthing mechanics team cooperation planning executing that plan and RUNNING AND GUNNING b/c your plan sometimes goes to shit you will absolutely love this game
GTFO is a game that really rewards stealth while not cutting too much on the quality on how great the shooting should feel It is a fun and tense game better enjoyed in group of 4
No hay nada igual

good coop game
rainbow6 left 4 dead stealth GTFO love the game and wish to have a group that I can play with
I am that person with ADHD they say not to take in The idea of the game is good but it is a bit too slow paced for me with the set up before alarms Most times the stealth gets messed up from either latency or miss judging a safe distance from other enemies And they hit hard The writing is also very small for the mission objective and so can be difficult to read
This is an Indie game that outperforms 99 of AAA titles in its genre Visuals 10/10 Gameplay 10/10 Horror 10/10 Storytelling 10/10 Performance 10/10 Balancing 11/10 It's got a handful of bugs here and there but its getting constant updates from the dev team and they're still adding brand new content like new enemies new weapons new levels and new lore If I have one criticism its that the bots are almost useless Their pathing can be inconvenient at best infuriating at worst Sometimes they'll decide to melee a horde of enemies despite having 100 ammo in both of their guns Sometimes they'll refuse to place down sentry guns or mines when they are doing nothing else They friendly fire way more than they should and often prioritize useless resources/consumables over more useful ones The only upside about having bots is that hey absolutely cannot wake up sleepers under any circumstances and can't get infected That's literally it

Es posiblemente una de las joyas que pasaron por mas desapercibido o de la cual no se le tiene tanto reconocimiento cumple totalmente su cometido a la que te quieren meter y lo hacen demasiado bien si no dispones de un grupo de amigos de 4 personas como no lo si dispones de 3 amigos bien y con ganas de cooperar adelante

can be a real challenge and emphasizes the importance of working together properly coordinated teamwork will make missions that seemed previously impossible feel like a cake walk and also take way less time
very cool game highly recommend it for homo-sapiens
phenomenal now that 10 chambers is re-releasing old rundowns with a fresh coat of paint i've never been a huge fan of limited time game content that disapears later and now its all being brought back with a full team of friends GTFO is great fun and suprisignly challenging you really need good communication and planning skills to get out alive and that's what makes it so engaging the game itself looks great runs great and has a perfect spooky atmosphere and some cool lore if you're someone who likes to hunt down text/audio logs just make sure to play it with friends
Este ser el mejor shooter que he jugado hasta el Claramente para un jugador casual necesitas unos amigos para poder pasarte una RUN completa el juego de por es hardcore pero igual no impide que te lo puedas pasar en solo Los niveles de tienen una larga y en ciertos RUNDOWNS no hay checkpoints por lo que no te recomiendo cagarla y hacer plantear bien los objetivos El equipo de armas se va sumando a medida que van agregando las viejas rundowns recientemente update del ALT Rundown 4 Los enemigos dentro del juego no son de entender completar el objetivo y la supervivencia depende del trabajo del equipo Te puedo asegurar que es un buen juego pero requiere de paciencia o buena estrategia le falta un poquito de al juego Mi 8/10 por unos bugs con la AI del juego
July 2024 update Team bots have backtracked since last i played they atleast dont ninja loot like at launch but combat side they are back to the same issues at launch that rendered them mostly a hazard to use even on a easy run i can imagine the PTSD of trying to use them on anything above easy so clearly the dev tweaking the AI is a idiot As for weapons they feel worse then last i played including effects feels very mobile quality for some reason like something got a down grade and enemies feel more janky as well first thought it was my frames but they were a steady 90 seems who ever has been tweaking weapons mobs and AI is a bit of a moron needless to say most of the weapons optics torch ammo range recoil spread and damage also feels like someone who has never played a shooter and never tested their own game has been left to do as the please and the results feel worse then at launch to the degree i didnt even want to try out each weapon to see whats changed it was that big of a let down since i last played i couldnt wait to finish the run and just quit the game the only positive was the pod drop once i actually started playing though.it was all downhill from there currently i give the game a 4.5/10 but i kind of want to give it a 3.5/10 due to devs just being so moronic if the devs had more then 1 brain cell they would just switch to mod support and let the modders do what the devs are to incompetent to do themselves but the devs being so incompetent well we already this also makes such basic common sense impossible even if they want they are to stupid go support better devs better games DONT BUY IF YOU LACK FRIENDS make sure you are 100 certain they will want to play the game with you as a single player experience its mostly trash as a 4 player co-op its mostly tolerable long as you dont take the game to seriously and treat it a bit like a joke as there is not point expecting to much from the devs which have been twiddling thumbs since it came out of EA hence allot of broken missing and incomplete features as many have mentioned trying to play without friends is a broken mess AI suks and discord suks even more you will have better luck at the casino specially as the player base keeps dropping of since the devs wont pull their weight most the game revolves around you doing the exact same melee attack 1000 times on 1000 retarded AI that look the same dont expect to much effects variety just same heading popping 100 of the time and sure you have a couple other melee weapon choices and a quick melee attack but yea you wont be using them unless ur bored which probably will happen faster then you think as it can be fun for the first few hours as its all new but then when you start to realise how shallow the game is u start to endlessly play wack a mole or realise how lazy the dev was balancing weapons levels etc etc yea so even though you will be spending most ur time playing whack a mole dont expect good melee weapon variety or quality just the same attack and effect over and over and over melee side of the game is still very much in the alpha stage of development and the devs have no plans to ever finish it or fix it obvious fact the game has been out of early access for some time now and they have no plans on the drawing board to fix their games gaping pot holes and infact refuse to even recognise these pot holes even exist so u can already tell this game is not going to improve much with time so you have guns yea yes you do but they basically are balanced to encourage you to spend most your time doing melee and to use them only when a alarm trips etc and as far as weapons go they all look decent generally sound decent as for effects feels like they dropped the ball there and also within balancing as yea how much ammo u can carry often makes no sense their accuracy or damage output also often doesnt make sense simply put every gun will have something about it which defies all logic and its just the devs lazy way of balancing the weapon side of things so they dont have to play test there own levels really at all for proper balancing this is also why weapons generally have about as much range as ur toy nerf gun im serious and why often a small pistol is way more powerful the a BFG hence to try keep it fresh you dont get access to all weapon each run so each run has some taken out some added back in and they also keep adding new game levels but yea as for new enemies either they suk or are a lazy re-hash of exiting ones as such u better get used to virtually seeing the same few enemies over and over with 1 especially 99.9 of time and you would think with how much the game revolves around doing melee most the time they would have put allot of effort into fleshing it out but no as suggested it grows old fast if you have more then 2 brain cells level design is also often a issue after u done it enough u start to realise basically all that the devs do to ramp up difficulty is by throwing in a drop and play game mechanic eg throw toxic gas here some more this or that devs dont properly play test or balance the experience for players in most cases as such most levels are built around this lazy repetitious design that makes no sense this also becomes a issue for actual story set pieces as well were the devs obviously set things up specific for story progression yet some parts are even more simplified and lazy then the general level design they are straight up alpha quality in experience were some set pieces do feel like they got little more attention but again only partially enjoyable after that they are a drag specially as AI is as dumb as it gets AI basically just runs straight 2 u with only a few exceptions to this rule but because they have not been scripted very well once u learn what they do they are easy to dispatch with any weapon that actually functions logically only reason you will deviate from logical weapon choices is due to the fact boredom kicks in after a few hours again bringing up how most guns function like nerf guns etc to encourage u to play certain way rather then doing some proper play testing and balancing for each level and the games weapons so get used to using the same melee weapon and same attack animation for 1000 years and save the ammo for the obviously drop and play game mechanics with limited testing that spam enemies at you while forcing u to do a ridiculous dance that makes no sense other then the devs were to lazy to actually doing anything fun or that makes sense again as many mention the game is not balanced for singleplayer or with AI players very well they basically released the game with broken player AI that did more to help the enemy kill u then anything else and that basically hasnt changed much for the harder levels they become a total nuisance but as the devs dont want to do any proper playtesting or balancing or fixing well dont expect this to improve by much or if at all long-term etc etc as such i cant recommend the game even on sale when the devs refuse to do the work this game is only suitable for people who are desperate to scratch that certain itch i was one of them but it failed to satisfy i have 3 other friends and dont have to high standards for this game due to lack of competition yet yea cant recommend its not a good game overall it visually has a nice aesthetic out the box nice atmosphere when you first drop in could have had a nice selection of tools and weapons but they are balanced by morons.so unless your a mindless COD fanatic your going to enjoy it for the first few hours again being fresh but after that its a down hill slope unless your low on brain cells and naturally ist 10 times worse if your doing it solo so keep that in mind
more like work together and die together
Shh sleepers wake them call their friends and we'll be in deep shit
Killing floor 2 gtfo
This game has all the ingredients to be great But the developers stubbornness kills any chance of it And the end result is just a frustrating game for 99 of people out there The devs straight up refuse to implement at least some sort of lobby/server list in-game The Matchmaking button is useless because no one uses it They expect you to know through clairvoyance that you need to get into their Discord to find people to play with and if you don't live in a very populous region and/or speaks fluent english well f you you won't find people to play there also So now you see yourself with only two options Play alone or convince your friend(s to spend 30 on this weird game too The vast majority will end up with the first option Which also means you won't be having fun because there is another set of problems the devs refuse to address The game dificulty is handcrafted for 4 people But the devs refuse to create any sort of dificulty scaling so if you are alone you get to face the same challenge you would with a full party But don't worry after only a few years of the community begging they were benevolent enough to add AI bots to help you Help on quotes because they are so basic and dumb many missions are actually easier without'em So by playing alone you will only go as far as the second level of each rundown leaving 3/4 of all the game's content on the table simply because you can't find people to play with It becomes hard to believe this project comes from the Designers of PAYDAY when you see how all these problems I mentioned don't exist there are easy to solve but they just don't
Imagine in 2023 being unable to design a proper matchmaking system for your coop horde shooter Complete ineptitude

Dark Souls of FPS Game goes to shit from small errors Grab some friends and suffer together
I've played this game on a free weekend play and was quiet amazed at the game play It's quiet INTENSE game with many of the game being SUPER CALM This isn't RUSH game because everyone needs to do properly together otherwise you are FUCKED I repeat this again DO NOT FUCKING WONDER AROUND because you will be FUCKED and if you die they may not be able to revive you If you are venturous to go alone JUST don't You have limited ammo and only 4 people fighting 60 enemies so stealth and teamwork are two biggest weapon you have Guns won't matter if they swarm at you because you can die very fast too
get the fuck out and shut the fuck up
This game is the perfect example of Stockholm Syndrome
brings me back to doing COD zombies but with a twist
Seriously this game is not really worth playing if you don't have 4 people willing to play So friggin hard but so friggin fun
Forgot bioscanner we all died painful deaths to shadows BS game where you're literally required to take a tool Lighting bugs galore when you enter a new room enemies don't glow properly when you enter a room Recoil is impossible to manage on anything stronger than a peashooter 10/10 come join and get sucked
Played it as the game for a local LAN party And mind you we are decent PC gamers After the 12th run trying to beat the first map we gave up The game is UNFORGIVING Every bullet counts Every movement counts Like darksouls in FPS Generally not fun but it was well made so if you are into playing games like Left4Dead on BRUTAL then you'll like this I however will likely never play this game ever again Lol just saw this was the game I paid full price for and refunded it was so impossibly difficult and un-fun This is only 1 of 2 games I've EVER refunded on Steam
BAO COMPRA
Make friends or ruin your current ones This game will test how much you can clench your ass and how much you can work together
Pitch dark sluggish uneventful labyrinth Crashes multiple times As much as I hate the Killing Floor devs they do this genre better Could not find real human server either
Put qui m'a dessus
Very fun very intense Funnily enough my favorite part is using the terminal commands haha
strike rush strike bot 10/10
its boring
A very cool and tactical survival-horror game with friends People beach about it because of its so-called difficulty but working together is what makes you pass missions I play only with 1 friend and 2 bots and we nearly cleared all the first rundown It's fun monsters are pretty scary to face and the range of weapons is amazing and adapt to any playstyle Just be careful about adapting your playstyles to what's coming at you and you different objectives You'll see what I'm talking about once you'll need to start a reactor What I also like about this game is that you're not guided at all You have to do it yourself Use your environments and multiple terminals to determine where you need to go and if some rooms are worth checking and taking risks for But a wise guy said Plans all go to shit when the first shot is fired So be careful out there If you want to survive plan ahead talk together and act together Always have a backup plan and aim well Get the job done then GTFO EDIT just finished R3 R4 seems hard but hell we survived so far so let's go
gud game but so hard play fun with friends
wowowow
It has made me become Na'Vi coms
Very good game but my advice is that you have friends and your friends won't hit you oh yes you need a computer teaching don't forget
hao
yes
It's a good why not improve the IQ of bot teammates?Why do bot teammates always think about melee when facing groups of enemies And always shoot when facing an enemy who is alone To make the game more difficult
Best game the Reactor sound is worth every bit of frustration
mmmmm squishy bois
highly addicting ambience is bone chilling such a ruthless game if you ever make a mistake you risk losing the game entirely
Me mataron mi team me las 40 y tengo el autoestima por los suelos Juegazo D
GTFO ha logrado una de las inmersivas y aterradoras que he visto de una gigantezca de al completar cada
Only play with 3-4 people If not meh If so amazing
really interesting and fun design However the game will most probably die without a proper matchmaking system I shouldn't have to use discord to find a game 80 of the time the game should help find a match by itself without use for 3rd party software
scawy
vary good game
Kind of boring couldn't refund cus it was 2 weeks after purchase
I dont think the game is bad in any fashion I only have two problems with the game 1 Le Fog I understand its a game element to make visibility and issue and that there are items to remove the fog in the game Simply put with the lights in the buildings and fog combined every time I turn a corner into the building's lighting I get flashbanged due to the amount of fog in the way of it Not really things the game can fix per se or something they should rather but its just something personal I dont enjoy 2 Le game kinda just boring I just straight up dont like the game as far as gameplay Its kinda cyclical I dont feel anything is at stake or a weight to each mission Just get in scan for stuff with computers find stuff leave Might play a little more later on and see if my opinion changes but for now this game isnt my type to enjoy I guess I will add if you're into stealth and have a bunch of idiot friends this game will be perfect for you No shame towards the creators or anything just not my type of game I was gifted the game to try by a close friend
A Thumbs up for me
Great game overall the experience of working in a team is awesome alot of teamwork is required I would also suggest that maybe you can add a feature that you can use you in game voice chat to alert the enemies but talking loud or soft But that is only applicable to later rundowns in the game as the players get more familiar and experienced with the game overall what do you think
Kinda spooky lots of sneaking Epic gameplay reminds me of the last of us monsters
Excelente juego atrapante y desafiante no es nada tiene muy interesantes que no son muy comunes en otros juegos muy recomendable jugar con amigos porque si bien los Bots son bastante inteligentes aunque obviamente se mandan sus cagadas es muy darle ordenes en pleno tiroteo EL sigilo y la con tus de equipo es clave al igual que el tipo de armas que va a llevar cada uno ya que lo mejor es complementar el armamento entre todos algunos detalles que podrian mejorar seria la cantidad de ordenes que se le puede dar a los bots como que suelten los Ammo pack o el Tool pack incluso seria muy que uno mismo pueda arrojar al suelo estos elementos pero en resumen muy buen juego
ok good
So fun but fail a lot and learn from it but for some reason I cant stop staring at their ass bro its just so THICC thats gotta be why I been caught 70 times but overall fun game join discord so it easy to match make and its more fun with friends because retards
get the fuck out
le scary
This game will destroy your god gamer ego and make you question your life choices
if payday 2 and darktide had a child
This game is really good but the things is that i have no friends and no one to play with ya i play all the games by myself and no on with me and so for single player it was not that good but it was not bad too if u have friends than u should consider purchasing this game but if u are alone and sad like me than u might now enjoy this game that much it was a good game i must say but more fun with friends and i know no one is reading this so i might add i am really gay and bald
I recommend Die or pass
game has been out forever and isn't even a proper game me and my buddy bought it tried to play it and couldn't refund it afterwards cuz the missions take forever and the map is based on the literal labyrinth from Greek mythology 3/10 don't buy it I would rather play valorant and that game makes me a literal retard
best co-op game
Big shooter is thicc as fuck
LOVE THIS GAME
scary crazy little guy make my poop pant with friends very good 3 thub up
Nicu
Adore nearly every aspect of this game super well designed and really well optimized everything about this game hits the notes i want in a game its scary challenging in the best way possible and the gunplay feels good The guns diversity is a little lack luster but regardless they all feel good and everyone finds their niche i can't say enough good about the atmosphere in the game
Muito Bom
this might be the most newbie unfriendly game ever it is so hard to pick up As of writing this i still have no idea what i'm doing when it comes to JUST joining a game let alone play one It's a real shame because it looks really fun but dear god please make it easier to play till the the game is dead to me
I rly like the game but i think its kind of to dificult some times I mean i havent even completed the FIRST MISSION R1 Those dam IV security things lock
High learning ceiling for new players but really fun with a group that's down for trial and error Would recommend against this game if you only want to play solo
Wasn't sold after my short time with it There are some cool designs And interesting set-pieces But I found it repetitive Maybe a bit of a chore to play because I got bored and fed up eventually of navigating and sneaking and navigating and oh horde time And I play a lot of these kinda games The customisation isn't worth dying for so there wasn't much incentive or reward for playing more and I had a look at the unlockables down the line and wasn't phased I noticed a lot of people say it's hard too It says Stealth strategy and teamwork in the description I played solo with that advice and did just fine
hard af but fun
Hooked
I recommend this if you have friends I don't recommend it if you don't have friends because matchmaking basically doesn't exist I found ONE lobby of other people failed one game with randoms and never found another populated match again You can't cheese through the campaign with the AI either because they always get stuck somewhere and you can't progress Pretty fun game otherwise
I highly recommend this game Dont really play this type of genre Positve towards the game as a concept only a little dissapointed that it wasnt any real information about some certain task but hey maybe the point This is made more fun with friends and you do realise that your biggest weakness is your friends XD
I can't with good conscience recommended this game This is a stealth horror FPS where you can't lean with your character Leaning with Q and E is the bare minimum of control you'd be expected to have over your character in any modern first person title 2/10 If the devs added leaning it would be a 9/10 Don't buy
Too scared to play by myself
gtfo
me like glowsticks me throw them
terrifying and fun
Absolute S tier game Incredible I bought the game twice just to give the devs more money
This is game is littered with bugs When i started the game and tried to change my settings everything resets back to default I was able to fix the problem by deleting some files Then when i go into the selection screen the icons wont appear on my screen and it wont allow me to change any of my gear When i was researching ways to fix these problems i found many more strange bugs that crash the game through the most basic of actions Wish i could get a refund
4 Dead
After this CBT of a game I need some CBT Very fun with friends you can make trios work with a little effort and for solo and duo there are mods though the security scans become more and more brutal
Morrer 20 vezes na primeira nice
Melhor jogo de em Coop que joguei dificil e desafiador Vale para jogar em Coop 4 players
hey man wouldn't it be funny if we all died in extraction yea fucking hilarious no fucking way im doing that again places mine oh shi MISSION FAILED
get the fuck out
Not for the feint of heart
Early access game there are tons of missing features and quality of life
My friends have PTSD because of this game They no longer want to play the game with me
Much Fun tad hard to get friends to play though
I'd say this game is most certainly one of the more original ones I've played The gameplay is simply amazing I love everything about it the stealth the gunplay feels heavy and exactly what I look into when I want to blast hordes of enemies We simply NEED more games like this every other teamwork extraction shooter I've played just hasn't full-filled what I try to seek in them exactly because there just isn't that many games like this out there Sadly good things come to an end cause you can say the game is sort of dying player-base wise I will NOT stop glazing GTFO though
Diese scheiss versauen einem jedes Spiel Ich hasse sie
stay away from the hentai
its like darksouls and left 4 dead dead space had a baby and its awesome co-op is a must to get most out of the game
Funny zombie games that break friend ship and my monitor 10/10 would recommend

I'll be short and sweet with my review If you like the idea of left for dead being hardcore and require actual communication with your teammates This game is for you It deserves much more love than it gets
Kinda g4y but pretty cool Would recommend
Scariest part of the game is whenever I'm about to extract and there's like a large swarm of monsters Is that I'll just frame drop until I just die lmao
Best most immersive yet stressful in a good way game I have ever played
um game divertido para jogar com grupo fechado
ive only played a few hours but i highly recommend this game but i recommend playing with other peoples/friends but its not required being as you can add bots overall challenging but fun asf
Over all a great challenging game but a little under developed
don't make a sound we'll be overrun in no time
Anyone wanna play I'm stuck on the same missions
Its fun if not repetitive
nice
Very fun to play only with FRIENDS if u are playing this game solo u need to see a psychologist right now D
GTFO is like a team-building exercise except instead of trust falls and icebreakers you get to shoot thicc mummy monsters with your friends Just don't forget to bring your adult diapers and lube
GTFO despite its potential ultimately fails to deliver an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience The game heavily relies on stealth mechanics but unfortunately this aspect lacks depth and fails to captivate players The repetitive nature of sneaking around quickly becomes monotonous leaving players longing for more engaging gameplay elements One of the major drawbacks of GTFO is its over-reliance on stealth without offering any substantial depth to this gameplay style The mechanics feel shallow and lack the complexity needed to make stealth an exciting and strategic component of the game As a result the gameplay becomes dull repetitive and devoid of the necessary challenges to keep players engaged for an extended period The concept of standing in a red circle to open doors is a disappointing design choice It feels like an arbitrary and unimaginative way to progress in the game This lack of creativity and reliance on repetitive actions only serves to dampen the overall experience Furthermore the scarcity of ammunition prevents players from embracing a more dynamic and action-oriented playstyle Instead they are forced to rely on the mundane and unexciting stealth system which quickly becomes tiresome A more balanced approach where players have the option to employ different strategies would have greatly improved the overall gameplay experience One of the glaring issues with GTFO is its basically nonexistent matchmaking system The lack of an efficient and effective way to find suitable teammates severely hampers the multiplayer aspect of the game The matchmaking system makes it frustratingly difficult to form a cohesive team and hinders players from fully enjoying the cooperative gameplay that GTFO intends to offer Furthermore the developers restrictive stance on mods prevents the community from enhancing and expanding the game in meaningful ways This limitation not only hampers the potential for user-generated content but also denies players the opportunity to transform GTFO into a more diverse and compelling experience It's important to acknowledge a few positive aspects of GTFO The atmospheric elements within the game are praiseworthy creating a tense and immersive environment The gunplay while infrequently accessible due to scarce ammunition does exhibit solid mechanics and provides brief moments of enjoyment Additionally the sound effects contribute to the game's atmosphere and add a layer of authenticity In conclusion GTFO has the potential to be an amazing game if it weren't for its overemphasis on stealth mechanics The lack of depth and repetitiveness associated with stealth greatly diminish the overall experience Tedious door-opening mechanics and limited ammunition availability only serve to compound the game's shortcomings The absence of a functional matchmaking system and the developers reluctance to embrace mods further hinder GTFO from reaching its true potential While the atmospheric elements and occasional glimpses of engaging gunplay offer some respite they are simply not enough to salvage the game from its fundamental flaws
This game deserves a way bigger playbase if you got patience and a spare hour or two a game id highly reccomend it just use the discord to find 4 mans solo isnt really viable
1 Que bueno que esta usar el mazo 2 Shhh
Pay 35 bucks to panic with your friends it forces you to be tactical and smart in your decision making alongside scaring the absolute shit out of you Game is great and well taken care of by the devs I plan on playing it a whole lot more
Spear go stabby stab
make the game better and maybe i can play lol
YOU ARE NOT A GROAN TUBE
This game is dope I really like the theme and it has a unique pacing that's both methodical and frenetic Cool with friends not so much without
dope game
HArd
I like the uniqueness of this game so I recommend it to you but it is slightly overpriced Since we get the game without very important aspects that suggest is a beta version very poorly designed search for players inside the game matchmaking no character level and prestige weak motivation of players to play weak customization we can get for completing the mission a random item part of your costume and opening the next level plot of the game forget I consider all of the above to be a game base without which interest in the game quickly disappears Quite a high difficulty for beginners and a high entry threshold on the other hand this is a fun challenge in the company of friends Other games have the characteristics of weapons and equipment but here they forgot about it or will they force us to look it up on Wikipedia 2 years have passed since release of the game and all this has not yet been added Thank you for ur attention and good luck with ur RUNDOWN
Work together or die together
its realy fun
boring
fun and intense co-op game with 3 other friends
Au top
Played with minimum settings due to a bad pc lol but game was still good and i enjoyed myself Some missions were really laggy but its alright
Left 4 Dead but its stealth and even harder
Good thing i wore my brown pants today
Scout's screaming on my alarm clock wakes me up in the morning I hope the developers will continue to develop the game in the future Thank you for your work 10/10
kill zobmie and die 10r4/012

bryce won't play
good
It can be so difficult its just not fun and then it can be so fun because it is so hard but you made it And honestly I cant suggest it to anyone interested just by the look of it cause honestly Its a nightmare to get through one round some times
GG WP Nice try valve
Fantastic game The game is broken into Rundowns which are limited timed levels that are fairly unique and have only been getting better as the game is updated You start with the low difficulty maps and work your way further into the dungeon to progress and unlock cosmetics All weapons are unlocked from the start so there is no pay to win as far as I can tell since I've been playing the game As far as the actual game-play it's 4 player co-op stealth shooter You have to sneak and use melee to progress through the level and complete what the warden sent you there for The game is very much designed that if you fail the stealth checks you will run out of ammo and die a horrible death If you don't stealth and conserve ammo you will likely run out of ammo during the horde doors which are unavoidable scenes that to progress you must survive a horde of mutants that you will absolutely need your guns for Learning to stealth and take down the mutants silently is your 1 priority master this and you will have a huge leg up when it comes to the harder levels This is the game I wanted Killing Floor 2 to become The developers have been doing an amazing job of updating the game and adding new content levels weapons cosmetics and other items that are all free by simply playing the game Very refreshing to see that in this day and age of devs bilking their base over a re-colored skin
yeah
difficult but fun
Very cool we need more co-op games like this
Fun
Fun
spent 2 and a half hours and didn't get half way in the first mission
i dont know what the heck im doing
keeps me and my friends on the edge of our seats the best co op game that encourages team work and plays well because of team work
game hard but so fun and cool
Its very challenging for sure but it is fun when you have a group of friends
i love getting ganged on by 6 dudes in a deep dark place
over all great game when it came out first weeks but the game is deader than anthem the discord people don't even play the game whats the point just shut down the servers and refund everyone pls don't wast your money
epic
le serveur discord est obligatoire pour jouer avec du monde random mais meme si les jeu tactique sont pas vautre genre Ce jeu est tellement unique qu'il en vaut la penne seul review donner a un jeu de ma vie
shits wack
Tout un patacaisse pour un jeu de mer Et les graphismes
Not at all what I expected This isn't a fun Coop horror shooter like left for dead nor is it a hardcore shooter with team aspects like Rainbow6 Its kind of nothing the mission objective are boring and repetitive the bots are horrendous matchmaking is non existent the shooting is non responsive and not fun Every gun is a pea shooter that take whole clips to kill simple enemies every enemy is a bullet sponge Its as unsatisfying as possible even feels deliberately when considering the objectives as most of them are just hold down x button until door opens Super disappointing I'm surprised it has such a positive review I bought this with my friends and none of us have ever played it again on account of it being so hard to get into it and not being that much fun to begin with
It's good suffering
Best horror multiplayer fps game Hands down 10/10
Big Pog
Pokud se chaos si tuhle hru
Well play
Hands down one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had the pleasure of playing Such unique visual concepts in the HUD the core mechanics fucking the feel and aspect of the game is so damn fun I've mostly played milsim shooters like Arma 3 koth DayZ etc etc and this game adds a whole new style of thinking when it comes to team progression and survivability Truly I would tell everyone to play this game atleast once Yeah it's hard Yeah you're gonna die And that is what makes it amazing Truly one going in the memories
GOOD SHIT
spoiler Rainbow Six Siege Extraction With Updates spoiler
discord matchmaking is fucked buy the game with a group of friends who enjoy stealth you're pretty fucked if you guys make an mistakes cool horror game but more on the obnoxiously difficult side you and your boys arent gonna hop on this to fuck around youll find out real fast
not much content wise
yes very good
makes me want to cry
THIS GAME IS THE SHIT its fun to get violent it help calm down wife after a long day of work she likes to kill shit overall 10/10 IGN would play again ps shhhh let them snooze
Seriously one of my favorite games Its difficult and takes hours to get through just one level but its so much fun you definitely need friends to play it with though I'd play it more if my group of friends was online more consistently haha But they have a discord server full of other people you can play with and have a great system for finding players/lobbies too with hundreds of voice channels for everyone to use There's also bots that can take the place of other players and you can still get pretty far with them if you practice enough and are lucky with where the enemies spawn This game takes a lot of practice trial and error and strategy It's a fun challenge and the enemy designs are super cool I paid full price for it and it's absolutely worth it in my opinion I even built my current gaming PC around running this game like it's nothing 10/10
tres bon jeu coop tres au niveau des parties le design plustot monotonne
I have had the pleasure of playing this game with two other friends(With a bot as our 4th for about 200 hours and I can say without a doubt this is one of the best games ever made From the design of the levels and the feel of the guns it provides a fun challenge for you and your friends People crap on this game way to much before actually investing the time to try the game and understand the basic mechanics that help you get further and further into the levels and once actually completing the levels the amount of satisfaction you get as well as the want to try deeper/harder levels is crazy Please gives this game a try if you are a fan of hardcore games
OOOOOO0OOOOO spooooOOOOOooOOOOOoooky bri'ish guy the zombies are there too ig
VERY good ccop game Tag line says it all work together or die together Screwups are punished hard Ideally played with people you know and get along with because frustration with other peoples action can be a thing why did you go and melee that thing we were in the clear now we're screwed No progression beyond unlocking comsetics not a problem because the gameplay is rewarding in itself Finishing a level leaves you with a feeling of accomplishment But even so I've found myself trying reeeeaaally hard to finish the last level in a rundown to get that helmet cosmetic so it's not nothing
diye indirimde oynamaya korkuyorum aq
It's a good game but the bots are kinda stupid
noty
this game is shit for that was it cost
What a crazy game I love it but i think it hates me everytime I need ammo I get a fuckn lock melter
UPD 10 10
10/10 user interface and art style Almost perfect atmosphere Love to play it after sundown with the lights off Gun play is also great Good monsters I really like the terminals Playing with bots is fun playing with randos is great but playing with friends is clearly the best It is true that the matchmaking is lacking you'll need to use Discord But the game is very very slow It's not even that hard you just have to play very meticulous The hardest part is staying focused I hate to admit it but I only play a few times a month because I'm just burned out after failing a 90 minutes slow paced mission I hoped for more of a bitesize immersive horror adventure GTFO isn't that
i saw tutorial i pressed i thinked easy turned out to be a gangbang of entities raping my ass 10/10 Me
Very fun aesthetically pleasing and the enemies are incredibly cool You can definitely re-play this over and over alone or with your friend(s Definitely worth it in my opinion
Great Game
3 GTFO
get fxxk off
fun and scary
is fun with friends although sneaking can be repetitive ALTHOUGH going loud means death
Nagyon broken D
bom
i don't respect the opinions of women
I bought this game in beta back when only Rundown 3 was out I've struggled and clawed my way through every rundown since and it's been amazing seen how much these developers are grown and shaped this game It's brutally difficult and mechanically one of the most fun shooters have played to date My only gripe is you NEED to play with friends Playing this game solo is a miserable experience that I do not recommend but if you have a group of 3 or 4 this game is amazing All it takes is a little patience and some teamwork and you're in for an amazing time Would recommend PS If you alert the scout we're not friends
This game is very fun and hard enough to keep you and all your friends on edge Graphics are great story is very good Funnest I've had on my PC in a while
Goat game
Es un juego muy pero se disfruta Siempre a tope el nerviosismo culpa de las criaturas que rondan las instalaciones del juego

its hell
Great Game to play with friends
Intense and great with friends with amazing lighting and atmosphere BUT It's no easy game would be great if they added a difficulty setting or a way to change drop rates just to take the edge off when you don't want to spend 2 hours of focus ending in frustration
yes this is the greatest game ever made
for people that like getting kicked in the balls
I now feel nothing but empathy and sorrow for all the people who work in retail during Black Friday
The pansies whining about the difficulty and lack of scaling for player count are the same people who wanted difficulty levels in Dark Souls and Sekiro
fun and hard
They refuse to scale difficulty based on number of players I don't play games with randoms Until this changes hard pass
How come the Warden let's you carry the Bio-Tracker gunfire unintelligible screaming That was a lot more than eight
bought this a while back wayyyyy to buggy for 30 then probably still the same,.i think out of all my friends that play i have the most Hours in
cool but hard as balls
GOOD
I love watrching all of my friends trigger all the monsters

desespero
Either you pull up with your mates or keep your fingers crossed you're paired up with some community minded gamers team experience is best
A great game that will put your teamwork to the test It is recommended only if there is a team or willingness to search for party members on discord channels
Awesome game
Hard game But a ton of fun Make sure you have a lot of time to play as there is no saving
Funky mutants in a giant hole in Mexico Bonk the funky mutants run from the funky mutants scream like a little girl at the giant funky mutants die to the giant funky mutants that looked at you funny
Played it while it was free and it was super fun there is a major issue though that being that you need 3 other friends to actually play and having to make them pay 40 dollars each is something that will probably not happen
My friends get angry every time we play so don't have anyone to play with anymore

This game is good if you are willing to join their discord for matchmaking and not planning on relying on the games internal matchmaking system Make no mistake You will NOT enjoy this game if you are planning to go it solo depend on bots or overall just plan to use the built in match making service The game needs a lobby and the ability to host games with a search function Right now The game just lets you host an unlisted mission then randomly pulls from a group of people without taking into account pings or location So often times you will end up with people in your lobby who will just leave causing you to have to rehost the lobby because it won't start looking for players to refill those empty slots Even with bots there are some missions that are nearly impossible to complete without voice communications I have reached out to some members of the team over at 10 Chambers in hopes to address this but was told that it was a Talking point A Multiplayer game with a subpar matchmaking system is not good for the long term health of the game This needs to be addressed in the next major patch According to the community at their discord it won't because 10 Chambers simply doesn't care
Hmm fantastic indeed the appendages of some of these pests is very pleasing to the soul Cheerio
Great Coop shooter
Really boring They should have added mechanics from Overwatch TF2 and Valorant to make this a better game
Good Game
I got the freak out
it do good hard game
Repetitive enemy types and bland mission objectives lend themselves towards hindering an otherwise engaging hardcore cooperative shooter very unsatisfying
Theyre letting new players play the levels they missed Its good
i got out
Team Ai is not developed very well imo so if you plan on buying you might want to play with a complete 4 stack but very interesting game to say the least ive never played anything like it
I genuinely cant fathom the decision to have your games matchmaking be purely discord sure yea you can get the average game off of matchmaking and pray that everybody isnt profusely eating glue but thats few and far in between let alone successful but lord help me the discord is ass new rundown just dropped second day in fact and for some turd smuggling reason i can not find a game in over 50 min for the first ducking rundown A1 if you have friends to play the game with its descent but solo is the epitome of dog cancer
This is the only game that gave me depression losing at 70 of the extraction after a 2-3 hour long expedition is hard to swallow This is why I recommend this game to everyone that like to torture himself or his friend
nice
There is or might have previously been a good game here but best of luck finding it I've played multiple stages of this game for several hours the beta early adopter/early access and release phase The game plays at having a slew of loadout options with unique pros and cons to each a unique terminal/computer interaction system and a healthy mixture of stealth and gunplay The reality is far more boring The instant that you realize that you can clump up sprint your way through rooms as a group and mow down enemies with your melee weapons before they can scream for help and that you can bypass almost everything that makes the terminal system engaging with a few simple shortcut commands it will shatter any illusion you had that this game is supposed to be difficult Matches will take an extremely long time to finish the way the game was meant to be played actively encouraging you to slide down the slippery slope into banality This is a game where the enjoyment is supposed to be derived from overcoming its difficult through teamwork no difficulty no enjoyment no fun
GTFO ist Leid Definitiv kein casual game Wer diese Erwartungshaltung hat wird vermutlich werden
Getting close to 600 hours at the time of writing this so it kinda speaks for itself GTFO is tagged as an hardcorde coop game which is true going in blind gun-blazing will usually result in your demise and your friends having to deal with some tricky situations Coordination and communication are mandatory that's an aspect I enjoy a lot there's nothing like being low on ammo and carefully planning my next move to survive the upcoming alarms or complete an objective Pros Great ambiance Unique and well paced gameplay Good roster of enemies weapons Solid graphics Levels can be challenging depends if you're new or not to the game obviously Cons Can be time consuming depending on your team you might need 1 2 hours to clear some levels You may need to play with strangers if your friends are unavailable The bots can be useful but they tend to shoot you in the back don't give them a Burst Cannon or they'll kill you Overall GTFO is a pretty niche yet awesome game I definitely recommend it if you don't mind losing every now and then in order to improve your tactics to survive all the dangers deep down there
The game has a lot of game breaking bugs the game is already go hard as it is so you can spend 2 hours in a single mission only for it to bugged at the end and thats it
el mencho me pela la
They say any game is fun with friends GTFO is the exception It is one of the most boring repetitive coop games I've ever had the displeasure of paying money for Go play Deep Rock Galactic instead
ez game D
good game to relax to
If you have a group of friends this is easily one of the most amazing games you can play it requires a lot of comunication and its pretty damn hard Hard intensity moments have you and your friends strategizing gear and loadouts I cant speak for everyone but we failed many times and all that did was try and figure out the best approach timing our stealth kills wisely and hoping for the best posible loots Great Ambience Good weapon variety Interesting cosmetics i got a chestpiece that gave me a robotic hand Gun play feels pretty damn nice Thermal weapons give a pretty interesting twist Monsters a pretty damn ugly Some of the missions are pretty damn awesome The game has a console system that has you actually writing into a machine and makes you feel like a damn hacker Just fucking play it
This game will make you cry It is the equivalent of psychological torture My eyes are bloodshot my fingers bleeding my asshole is stretched beyond any human threshold imaginable This is like rape simulator If you ever wanted to know what it feels like to get absolutely brutally relentlessly ass fucked this is the game for you Especially if you don't have a 4-man squad Much Recommend
este es un juego de irte a la mierda
This game gives me anxiety and stresses me out more than budgeting as a college student 100/10 would recommend I love this game
Best FPS horror game ever
L4D auf Koks Achja und die Lore is ganz geil
ehh instead of killing enemies during encounters you have to find and stay in small red circles that you can barely see Peak shooter gameplay
It is too late to jump into this game Old-time players are too good so if you join them you will be carried through missions with no way to meaningfully contribute and plenty of ways to irritate them and get kicked out There are too few truly new players who would be on your level and if you manage to find them you will be overwhelmed by the complex user interface and gameplay mechanics the non-customizable difficulty etc It's as if the developers learned nothing from Left 4 Dead or similar cooperative games which existed for 10 years the very first mission after the super short and simple tutorial is already 40-50 minutes long and you are likely to get wiped after spending 30 minutes in it That is just bad design Meanwhile developers are adamant to not allow difficulty selection improve Steam-based matchmaking or improve early mission design Too bad because the game probably has a lot of potential and a ton of content which I will never get to experience
Gets old real quick
I have a f*cking love and hate relationship with game but grinding it is so fun
Excellent jeu bien stressant et qui se vraiment en coop maintenant les bots permettent d'aller plus loin en solo
very good team game
This game is my favorite so far on my steam library Theres so much RNG that you would never have the same experience in a single level Playing with different people make the game more fun you can play solo with bots Not recommended since the bots always follow you and have no tactical strat order to give them The game is really well polished the atmospheric experience make it much better to play There is some client bug the host do not see bug so often In case of a big bug client can always disconnect and reconnect to the host at their will The new rundown are slow to get out so we wait a long time to play new content you better use mods to play new stuff at the end game since it got really repetitive Really good game You can also validate this by the number of hour I put into the game D
im not into vore dont know why the devs are tho
Es un juegazo pero muy y se complica mucho si se juega solo es muy recomendable jugarlo en equipo ya que solo practicamente imposible pasarlo aun siendo pro y llevando bastantes horas te pueden humillar los enemigos de la peor y legendaria forma posible si vas a jugarlo hazlo con amigos es una experiencia mucho mejor requiere mucha y del equipo Ojo recomiendo el juego solo si lo compras si o si juegalo con amigos de morir tantas veces lo vas a encontrar fastidioso y aburrido tendras un experiencia mala y no recomendaras este juego
RRRRUUUUNNNN
fun to play with friends
Bought this game to play with my friend he never played it with me I played with ai for 13 hours and I never got past the 2nd level of the first rundown This is a very good game to play with friends and it has some of the best programmed ai I've ever played with
pooped my pants
Dead game
Yes
this game is dead no one is playing it

plz make it free
Fun at first but gameplay is way too repetitive Level design is very basic the same underground complex areas with a few outside levels in other dimensions Monsters selection is very limited although they are well executed Technical difficulty is not high therefore game devs are trying to compensate for it with often illogical Warden missions secure an artifact All right Move to the forward extraction point Why How is the original extraction point not good enough Let's fill the whole level with toxic fog with specific order of correct sequence to clean areas fair enough Collect N batteries to jump start the reactor Why not bring these batteries from the upper levels in the same way we do with HSU's They are commonplace enough So yes instead of making logical and organic environment the devs are just trying to screw up the players which tends to be annoying Still recommend it though if you get it on sale Rundown 7 is probably the best at the moment in terms of the level design and overall features so I would recommend it The rest Meh
Its pretty hardcore Reminds me of Dead Space 2 but if it was way more realistic Highly recommend it if you're into some hardcore horror survivor stuff Def needs more than 2 people though and the bots are a bit dumb at points Its pretty tough so if you rage easily this is def not for you
only good if you have friends if not dont bother
Ein Ego shooter-escape-horror Spiel fast es ganz gut zusammen Ich finde die und Grafik sehr gut und stellt die Situation eines Untergrundkomplexes realistisch dar Es gibt verschiedene Rundowns also Level die in noch einzelne Komplexe aufgeteilt sind Die Rundowns werden nach einer bestimmten Zeit wieder um Abwechsulng zu halten obwohl ich bei der Menge von Rundowns und einzelnen Komplexen sowieso nie alle schaffe xD Zu wissen ist auch das man es alleine mit bot und mit mehreren Freunden spielen kann war ich am Anfang abgeneigt es alleine zu spielen da es zu schwierig alleine ist aber die Bots agieren mit dir und du kannst sie das Befehlsrad anweisen das ist ziemlich einfach Das Spiel bietet eine Menge an verschiedenen Waffen von Maschinengewehren bis hin zu schrot DMR und Pistole Zudem mir auch das Spiel Prinzip dass man sich durch einen verzweigten Untergrundkomplex durchsuchen muss um ein Ziel zu erreichen dass am Anfang gezeigt wird Ein Computerpad das in manchen Stellen bzw Zonen zu finden ist hilft mit Commands spezielle Items zu finden die das des einzelnen Komplexes Unterlevel eines Rundowns notwendig sind Aber gebt euch in acht von den Sleepern von denen es auch einige verschiedene Typen gibt sie sind die Gegner im Komplex Das Besondere ist die meisten sind in einem Ruhezustand aber passt auf wenn sie zappeln sie reagieren auf Licht und laute Mein Tipp ist es Munition zu sparen in dem man die Meisten mit einem aufgeladenen Nahkampfangriff auf dem Kopf zermatscht Falls es dann doch mal an Munition eure Waffen mangelt oder eure Leben gering gibt es in orangenen Kisten oder Spinten Munitionpacks oder Medipacks sowie viele weitere Items
discord server friendly if you have no one to play with great game some bad design choices rare but time consuming and annoying bugs besides this the combat is extremely fun the guns feel very nice would recommend if you are willing to talk with randoms on the discord

I suck but is good game
uhh all clear behind this door
j'ai en vrai
7 hours in game with a 3 stack and we still have not made it past the first level
NB
Its an amazing game for those who value teamwork or even just precision stealth
Must have si vous avez au minimum 1 ami a 2 avec 2 bots on arrivent a clean les maps les plus difficile le contenu est huge si vous aimez les jeux intenses et hardcore
No one plays this game and bots are ineffective at team gameplay Should not be required to use an external program for matchmaking
I suck at this game
really want to see full controller support with the steam deck and other portable pcs more people will start to want to play hardcore survival shooter games lik this i just start playing really like

what the hell oh mah gawd no waeaeaeae yayea signed yes
Excellent jeu ambiance Cependant il faut constamment trouver une escouade de joueurs pour jouer sinon peut vite devenir infaisable en ajoutant des bots si on peut leur donner des ordres et les diriger un peu ils ont quand tendance se mettre dans nos pattes ou bouffer voir garder du ravitaillement pour rien ou au mauvais moment Y a une excellente d'armes toutes au moins jouable dans cependant les outils poussent toujours jouer de la et user des comme il y en a 4 que types vraiment la tourelle automatique dispose de plusieurs variantes pas pertinentes mon Les missions sont aussi des ressemblances et la peut au mais en jouant un peu on se rend assez vite compte que dans des missions c'est en et facile de se face aux ennemis en trouvant la bonne qu'on utilise un peu tout le long du jeu La vraie c'est de tout faire pour ne par se faire submerger voir de un plan B si c'est la sauce sinon toute tombe comme des mouches Les vrais points du jeu c'est que c'est difficile en de comprendre certaines quand on comme les ennemis qu'on pense tuer plusieurs fois de suite en les la et que tout bouge encore ou bien le terminal les ordinateurs qui permettent de des objectifs ou de trouver des informations de si il y a des explications il reste difficile utiliser surtout dans la panique et la pression du temps sur certaines missions J'ai aussi vu des gens se plaindre des menus qui sont certes pas les plus intuitifs je le reconnais mais je les trouve pas si perturbants surtout que les effets 3D et graphiques peuvent se En vrai ce que je trouve un peu dommage aussi c'est que les fins de missions c'est juste soudainement une image de partie qu'une on se barre d'une similaire qu'on arrive Petit point positif que personnellement c'est l'introduction sans aucun avertissement la plupart du temps au beau milieu d'une mission sans s'en douter de nouveaux ennemis qui viennent mettre un coup de pieds au bestiaire auquel on s'est rapidement ou alors de nouveaux de Y a parfois quelques petits indices cependant si on s'attarde un peu trop au des maps ou dans le peu de lecture que le jeu nous fourni Y a tout un tas de mods que j'ai pas encore eu l'occasion de tester mais qui ont l'air vachement sympas
Juegazo tiene y cuando ganas tienes la de que te lo mereces Lo que jugar solo no es recomendable
A Steep learning curve but If you understand the gameplay it is a lot of fun
Hard to the bone will test your patience will and tactical awareness Prepare to drop and die this is not an easy experience but it's a hell of a fun ride
first win after 10 hours
Criminally but understandably underrated a very challenging game that demands a lot of time and effort to beat but its the only game of its kind and its very satisfying when you finally manage to out play the game and conquer a hard level
Fantastic game Play with squad or at least someone that knows what they are doing
I think this game could be a fun-but-tense experience with a consistent co-op gaming group but it's too hard to get the band together for a game like this It's weirdly hard and combat doesn't seem fair a lot of the time so it doesn't feel very good to play Props for actually making us use a command line in game though As a real-life IT guy that was enjoyably meta

only a good game if you have three other to play with and the game base is dead so not worth buying unless you do it it with three other mates
i get its meant to be a hardcore survival game but its just not fun with one person all it does is make me stressed out and sad when i get to the extraction but get screwed over at the last second i have requested a refund and i hope i get it i would only consider rebuying if they add some sort of difficulty scaling for people who play alone the bots take loot that you need more sometimes aswell and generally suck as they run through doors you are trying to close to prevent any enemies from coming through if a game is making me more stressed out and angry than making me happy than i dont wanna play it anymore im going back too payday
yes
Be prepared to be punished A challenging horror fps Highly recommended if on sale
sleeper thicc i coomer
nobody to play with
Absoult packendes Co-op Spiel Auch mit Bots spielbar Teamplay und Planung ist ein Muss andernfalls man schneller ins Gras als einem lieb ist befindet sich auf einem Top Niveau Es fehlt mich ein kleiner Gunsmith indem man seine Waffe etwas auf einen zuschneiden kann Wichtig zu ist wirklich dieser knallharte Schwierigkeitsgrad und die Zeit die man in Level investieren muss Kann schon mal 2-3 Stunden dauern Und wenn man dann noch stirbt zumindest in den Rundowns in denen es noch keine Checkpoints gab sind nach einem Tod auch mal 2 Stunden komplett die Katz gewesen Ansonsten Feuer frei Holt es euch So ein vergleichbar packendes knallhartes Co-op Horror Erlebnis findet ihr zurzeit nicht mehr auf dem Markt

I play in VR so.I'm on a whole new level with this game Its a vibe and in VR its an occupation I constantly check to see if I smell irl because of this game SERIOUS must have

amazing
y extremo Los bots son al principio pero luego la dificultad aumenta y es necesario jugar con jugadores Se puede ir hasta media partida en sigilo pero en la acaba siendo necesario disparar y eso es un problema cuando los recursos escasean tanto las misiones son variadas y tienen objetivos muy diferentes en localizaciones variadas para que no puedas memorizar Su industrial y oscura es alucinante es dificilisimo y muy Es el juego ideal para jugar cuatro amigos muy frikis y dedicados dispuestos a sufrir de manera extrema porque incluso teniendo la acabada al 99 en un segundo se puede ir al traste todo y perder al final la es total hasta el final La pega que le que es muy encontrar jugadores no si porque escasean o porque mi nivel bajo me impide jugar con jugadores a niveles altos lo cual me dificulta desbloquear niveles
No puedo dejar de pensar en este juego es una Lo que deseo todos los es que llegue la hora de volver a jugarlo con mis amigos para nuevamente quedar frustrados al perder una partida de dos horas aunque al otro retomemos con las mismas ganas de intentarlo nuevamente Es una de amor/odio Pero bueno la de completar una que te no tiene precio 1000 recomendado con amigos
the sleepers are so thicc making me wanna act up
This game is brutally hard but once you start making progress coordinating figuring out terminals it's like crack
30
A great game to test if your gamer friend is truly good at video games
if you like spending your entire day clearing a room because a scout refuses to go where you want it to go and end up alarming the whole room anyway causing 10 hours of progress down the drain then this game is for you 👍
good
PTSD sim
get the toilet paper cause im soiling myself
This game is extremely difficult the hardest of all the games I've played including Dark Souls Elden Ring bla bla But with my team my best friends we were Complete almost all the missions in the current game This game is not for the weak and fragile Here are some experiences for new players who want to become a Gigachad Ideally you should have three friends to play with or at least find a team that everyone can work with and talk to Stealth this is not a title where you waste your bullets pointlessly If that fails learn from it and ask yourself what you and your team did wrong Stay calm in all situations Learn how to use the tools that the game gives properly each level is not the same Learn how to manage resources ammunition medkit tool ammo
It is fun but is very repetitive not worth the 40 USD wait for the 80 discount
Extremely challenge for players

It's good needs more onions thou
nothing for casual fps players kinda repetitive
top game
R1>>>>R2 R3 what the re-using the maps added few monsters nothing new you already know/experienced same thing back in R1 and R2 I just simply disappointed
3 8/10
wish there was an offline mode but other than that its a very enjoyable game
pues cuando lo compre aun estaba en beta no funcionaba bien con muchos bugs
Kickass game
it good it dark you shoot
I think that this is a well done game There are some aspects of it that are an acquired taste like needing to use the system debug My only complaint is the bots that stand-in for missing team mates They are not perfect and have caused me to fail a mission due to their pathing
Really awesome and challenging game bought it in early access and kept playing it since If you enjoy FPS co-op games and getting mad this is for you
Looking for coop-multiplayer games that I can play with my friends the description of this game sounded promising But unfortunately this game is just annoying on so many levels It starts with the abysmally bad and non intuitive user interface After all the years since its launch the game's devs apparently still don't find it necessary to provide a match making UI that deserves that name it is just a mess You invite your friend into your game via Steam only to find that even though you are hosting the game you are unable to actually fill the remaining slots with bots and instead the locked player slots just wait indefinitely for some event that never happens it is totally unclear what the purpose of this garbage mode might even be then having to share game-IDs via Discord so that other ppl can join your game seriously I already knew that I hate rogue like games i.e games where you always have to restart from from scratch replaying the same boring 10min entry sequence again and again just to then die in the exact same spot where you already died in your previous 10 attempts Unfortunately this abomination of a game works exactly like that And to add insult to injury it makes you watch the same slow/long winding startup animation that was already boring after the 2nd attempt The bots available in the game are a bad joke They reliably move into your line of fire right in the middle in a fight blocking you view completely Also they never deploy the auto-turret weapon that that carry around so your team is regularly outgunned with those useless turds by your side I would certainly not buy it again
best coop pve game ever
is gud
good game
Precisa ter um grupo de amigos para jogar e muita mas o jogo bom pra carai
Hard like a horse kiss My bottock became stiff wtf XD
Very good very difficult Play with friends Be willing to learn even things the game doesn't teach you Atmospheric as all can be does darkness better than any other game I've played Not the most casual game ever but its fitting Work together or die together
Bonk
Slave Simulator
Its like water and ice yaknow
i'm only giving this a negative review because of how insanely overpriced this game is 40 bucks for a game you need to play with your friends is too much And it's not even THAT good it should be 10 bucks max
THIS IS R4E1 WE CLOWN IN THIS MUTHAFUCKA BETTA TAKE YO SENSITIVE ASS BACK TO A-TIER
m\an this game is hard bu t it is fun shooting littl e creeps
great game tough and intense a thinking man's FPS If you spray and pray here you will lose every time Even though you can enjoy the game with bots like L4D but its MUCH better with 4 human players the bots can be really annoying at times
Poke and Smash is the plan O crap you messed up Just start Blasting

nicht zu empfehlen
really cool simple but hard game good mix of exploring shooting koop action and a touch of jump scares if you are a solo this game aint for you the match making doesnt work really and the bots arent terrible but you wont have much success or fun if you are a group of 2 looking for a cool side game to dive into this game is awesome

Great game with a lot of fun and try again A definitely better with friends game where you can enjoy even if you not finish the rundown
hehe hammer go bonk
My friend is a Femboy Twitch
It's a hardcore co-op FPS that emphasizes stealth gameplay If frustration inducing repetition is your go-to dopamine releasing activity then try this game but before you do I got a better alternative play an instrument Thank me later
It's fun and scary when with your friends Highly reccomend this for like game nights
Co-op games are an interesting if somewhat predictable genre For the most part they are designed around a relatively simplistic and often repetitive gameplay loop with any sense of variety banking on the interactions between players and with the game's environment In that sense GTFO isn't much different The bulk of the game consists of the same handful of tasks spread across many visually indistinct levels and prefab rooms especially true in earlier rundowns To add to that even with the various task types the general gameplay loop is often very similar consisting of slow methodical progression interspersed with small moments of intense action That said the true value of GTFO doesn't arise from its objectives or scenery it comes from the sheer brutality of its difficulty Missions are a resource efficiency problem disguised as a co-op FPS Every section is intentionally designed to make the path to victory feel like precariously balancing on a knife's edge Missions are long resources are scarce and fatal mistakes are never more than a misstep away Literal hours of setup can fall flat because you or your friend had a momentary lapse of situational awareness You accidentally wake an enemy at the wrong time Restart You use your guns a little too liberally at the start of a mission Restart You fat-finger a four-letter code on a computer terminal Restart You ignore the medipack your team left near the start Restart Few games exist which so closely ride the line between brutally difficult and impossible If you have three other friends with nothing but time and patience give GTFO a go
its good difficult game
Am I the only one that really loves being the guy on the team looking stuff up on the computer
1 2 3 4
I could not get out
cool game to play with friends
yes
It's tough and scary best to play with friends so you can be scared together The training course is more scary but when you're sneaking around with friends it's a lot less stressful Overall it's a good game The atmosphere and background noises are nice and get you in the mood for sneaking The characters talk a lot which can be a bit annoying but you can turn off the audio in settings Lots of different weapons and tools if that's what you're into
Best co-op at the moment True co-op
Ein sehr geiles Game aber auch verdammt schwer nichts zwischendurch und ohne Freunde
it's just perfect

spoofy gaming
klimatyczna,taktyczna gra Uwielbiam kapitanem xD
You ever feel like you should have listened to the games title I think maybe i should start doing that
This game becomes a simulator on what its like to have stockholm syndrome
I really had high hopes on this game future it sad they parked the game and focused on new one I think their business model of pay once and get updates for free was what got them eventually as technically their hopes was go get new players to join the game as old ones generated no profit i have too much hours in this game and sadly I do not recommend this game any more simply because this game was greatly based on community which came together every time when new update was out look at this game as puzzle that needs more than 1 head to solve it due to fact that game is challenging some levels needed skilled players for me it was fun part to have 4 strangers meet in the lobby and then try to beat OG R6D4 for next 7 days without looking at guides or anything heck of a fun where we had to organise our evenings so we are all good to come together make some progress but fail the last leg now the community is basically dead skilled players are gone and there is nobody walking you through levels like in good old days I am pretty sure new players who buy game now would not be able to beet Dx and Ex levels unless the grind it but this game is not worth blindness grinding its about strangers coming together to beat very very challenging levels now one sits in lobby for hours begging people to join cause playing this game alone feels empty I do hope they get financially better and GTFO 2 will come out it sad that R8 had to push many story lines to abrupt end although they tried R8 feels like all talented game devs were gone and basically coops were stitching it together I want to see GTFO2 but I am afraid we never see it To be honest I do not recommend to buy this game anymore its a dead game its like all going alone to escape room but if somebody want to make tv seriies about game's lore I ll damn sure bench watch it
e
im still trying to gtfo this game is hard picasso
its its niiice but not like niiiiiice but niiiiiiiiice for sure at bare minimum
Buen juego pero amigos falsos
I love the game it has a fantastik horror aspect and when you are playing it solo it is difficult but imposeble But if you whant to play the game try and get your friends to buy it then its gonna be pure fun
very cool
this game makes you realize how much you actually need friends def worth it tho
GTFO est excellent si vous dans un groupe de 4 personnes faire de la coop hardcore GTFO brille l'aide de son gameplay de sa de son level design et de sa de vie plus de 400h Par contre si vous pas dans un groupe de 4 personnes passez votre chemin C'est d'ailleurs pour que je ne peux plus recommander le jeu
is stabil
nice game
have literally never seen a worse community
We died together
suffer
this game is ass and buggy
Game looks incredibly fun and I love the gun design Only downside is that there is nobody in matchmaking to play with Making playing this game impossible So I submitted a refund Shame that there isn't more peeps
fun game to play with friends or even alone i love it and would continue to play more in the future
good game
good
good and difficult game better with friends still fun with randos
The first level of the game crashes the game Every other level works will give a good review when fixed
GG
Overall a really well rounded game requires a decent amount of FPS skill so you can't really be a sh*t player and expect to get far in this Level design and the pace of the game makes it so that each level takes about 45 minutes if you lost a hard level a few times you can crunch it down to 30 minutes once you know the pathing Really awesome job there's no game out there quite like this one The only downside so far has been the excessive fog which seems to be a huge complaint from the community and the devs aren't budging on that for some god forsaken reason You guys should really just tone it down by 50 and it'll be much more manageable it's understandable that you're trying to make it atmospheric and intense in those eerie scenarios in-game but when it's on nearly every level it's not that thrilling It's just annoying and you guys missed your chance at doing gun customizations doesn't even have to be at a csgo level skins and stickers etc but just give us SOMETHING hahah Even choosing between a red dot or halo or acog scope would be nice on select weapons

The Game is awesome But the Lobby is death Das Game ist geil keine Frage Aber die Lobby ist einfach mal tod Wer das zockt ich bin jetzt gerade on Das ist die Gelegenheit Kommt kommt Hilfe
spooky
dont get this
This game owns me
Is good game
This game is really difficult and tiring indeed but you will not get tired of that feeling when you cleared a rundown
100 10
Biggest problem of this game is to find 3 other people who like to play hardcore+shooter+horror+stealth+coop but if you get a good crew of friends together it's awesome and delivers on every mission You need patience skill and all time cooperation Also loosing a mission and with it 2 hours of nervewrecking playtime adds to the hardcore aspect but I don't think there is a way around that checkpoints just split the mission they tried that and smaller missions would be just sad My tip that might give you a chance you can kill scouts and big boys with the sniper in one shot
good game but not 40 good but it is a good game
There is not Plot or anything to be expected straight gameplay Less chit chat more gaming I like this concept should be common
the best game ever made in the world
I got in then died out
good
what
amazing game alone with friends with strangers with bots this game is amazing
I NEED AMMO
It's just a bunch of waiting I understand that's most stealth games but it is just so bland after 30 minutes The game play loop is holding W until the monsters get an erection then you wait 15 seconds for it to stop then you keep walking The missions are hours long which is the only thing that makes it horror as you don't want to lose hours of progress because you held W for 0.1 femtoseconds too long It has a charm to it but how am I supposed to read paragraphs of text on a terminal in a multiplayer game Are you seriously telling me to stop 3 of my friends forward momentum so I can read the story Also there is 3 enemies that are repeated just either a different skin or bigger size here and there The whole game is really only an inch deep And it's not even a mile wide
This is a challenging game And my friends and I are VERY challenged
nice

good if you have friends why are you crying
Just a pain to play There's a point where Hard becomes just BS
good co-op
The sheer amount of effort these devs have put into the game without paid DLC or micro-transactions earns this game a recommendation on its own GTFO is tense fun and challenging which makes for an amazing coop experience especially if you scare easily super fun solo too

Great game difficult spooky atmosphere co-op it's just great Except for the menu is purposefully double visioned and blurry and immersion is great and all but why is there an accessibility option to disable the photo-sensitivity warning but no actual photo-sensitivity mode Can I get a clear main menu UI as an option Can I get a mode that doesn't have a bunch of flashing images and screeches when opening the game Please Who needs to disable the warning as an option
You will die Alot

GTFO GTFO

its hard
👍
buen juego carlitos troll no mas gg el coyo se come los completos al saludos
Amazing co-op experience Takes a bit to learn the rules but when your communication is on point and your planning is perfect this game feels absolutely amazing Completely worth the full retail price especially now that they are adding old levels back into the game
I'm down

Fun
its good
It's been a blast so far Gotta get strategic
GOAT
8/10 Quality game it's just so frustrating in how long each mission is There is only so much for you to do with the game all missions are basically repeats in different layers which isn't a huge issue but it does bore me eventually Gun mechanics are super fun but they're more of a last resort thing which is kind of a shame Thank you 10 chambers for actually committing to creating a good game and not straying away from your vision for greed or laziness That's more than I can say about most developers today
Big spikey bois go brrr and then you scream and die Then tentacle monsters tickle you and summon a bunch of gremlins to come lick you and you scream and die Then a huge hulk looking thing taller than the twin towers tongue punches your fart box and you scream and die Also watch out for mines Overall 10/10 maybe
Great game Get some friends to play with you if you enjoy having hair tho
Methodical 4-player co-op Extract sometimes execute well thought out objective wins OR YOU WILL NOT MAKE IT THE FCK OUT And trust me you will want to make it the freak out The horrors that lie in the depths of the laboratory you explore in this game is disturbing To get a rundown on the plot you and 4 other convicts are being sent down to save the world from a Alien brain virus that is destroying the human race You are equipped with energy weapons bolt throwers and a multitude of high-tech gravity based tools to protect your team and make it out or survive objectives GTFO is a hardcore cooperative horror shooter that throws you from gripping suspense to explosive action in a heartbeat Stealth strategy and teamwork are necessary to survive in your deadly underground prison Work together or die together And trust me you want to work or die together
I like this game I was actually an early adopter and would spend more time playing it rather than watching it if the game was more accessible to solo play This game is fantastic if you have a few friends to regularly play with but sadly if you are a solo player you are given 3 bots which although are more useful than ai companions in most games DO NOT cut it especially farther into run downs IF YOU ARE SOLO/DUO CONSIDER OTHER GAMES Constant attention to their tool use and bugs in doing so Many times in a heated moment you'll tell a npc to mine a door before it implodes and then they simply just don't do it even after addressing the player with an I'm on it or Will do Inability to coordinate movement incredibly challenging for security scans where many more waves than usual would spawn because of AI being unable to efficiently turn off the alarm Inefficient use of resources I'll regularly see bots shooting shotguns at far away enemies attempting melee combat while being over ran taking A TON of damage most players could avoid and wasting special weapon ammo on normal mobs Not going past doorways resulting in them being locked out and downed or causing you to take more damage waiting for them sometimes they'll just straight up melee fight infront of the door while hordes are rushing towards your team A lot of my gripes with the game simply boil down to their FIRM stance on not scaling difficulty to player count if I could solo without the help of bots and have a equivilant challenge I would simply adore the game but I cannot and seemingly from the dev responses will not be able to You are forced to play with either randoms terrible simply bad to have to work in a team with brand new people not to mention most are just losers crying whenever something goes wrong or any resources are wasted or if you perfer a weapon they deem inferior to the other choices you run into many alpha commando's shouting orders and letting you know why you suck and are being removed from the lobby or with your friends which is an amazing time besides most people not wanting to spend 40 on pretty much the equivilant of masturbating with sandpaper hands-which don't get me wrong I fuckin love but it's not everyone cup of tea obviously Anyways yadayadayada skill issue obviously PUT FUCKING DIFFICULTY SCALING IN THE GAME 10 CHAMBERS LAYERED DIFFICULTY IS FOR LITERAL TROGLIDITES WHO CAN SPEND THEIR WHOLE DAY SOLO SNEAKING THROUGH THE MAP TO GET ENOUGH RESOURCES INORDER FOR THEIR WILDLY INEFFICENT TEAM this only applies to soloing with bots mind you TO FUCKING DIE REGARDLESS WHEN THEY ALL TRY AND SMG THE HYBRIDS TO DEATH STANDING STILL BEING BARRAGED FROM ALL ENDS SPENDING ALL DAY ON A SINGLE RAID BECAUSE TO HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE IT TAKES 30 MINUTES OF RESOURCES GATHERING FROM SECONDARY ROOMS EACH ATTEMPT IS STUPID thank you goodbye
GTFO it's call of dog
GOOD GOOD
Tentacles yessssss close to hentai mmm probably Teamwork needed definitely without a doubt Did i get licked more than i would like to admit Nonetheless it's a really good pve game Community seems very nice and be sure to take your time there is no mercy in terms of ammo,health and monsters

oyun Get The Fuck Out oyunu tek zor tavsiye ederim Oyun zorluk 10/8 bir oyun Oyun sizi sisli kasvetli bir ortama ve bu ortamda sesiz sakin bir ilerlemeniz yoksa ve mermi sebep oluyor Cephane ve yenilemek oyun size imkanlar sunuyor olup bu alarmlar iyi savunma stratejileri Oyun puanlamam gerekirse 10/7 diyebilirim Bu arada kesinlikle ile tavsiye ederim
You can see Spider-man and he's cousins doing some jazz dance moves all I can do is stop and watch 10/10 would smash again
Definitely not a run and gun Meant much more as a multiplayer experience it's a fun stealth shooter I'm not awesome with psychological horrors but this one is more gore than horror so it's fine You do need to think and look everywhere If you're a completionist you'll do fine It's also hard enough that our group of 4 seasoned gamers can't get through the first level R1 and yet we still have fun everytime Conserve your ammo say your prayers expect to die and take as many of the sleepers that you can

If u have squad to play U could try this game Really good horror coop game Work together or d together It's really hard game imo A lot of sneaking elements and doing things quietly
strike]This has got to be the game with the most messed up matchmaking system I'm not saying it's bad but I'm saying it's difficult I mean why discord This game has a lot of potential but if you make it this hard to matchmake then why bother Not everyone has friends who has this game I get that the point of making a group play from start to finish is to build team play but not everyone has the time or inclination to set up a small group of strangers just to play a game.[/strike strike]A little suggestion although I doubt devs will read this is to allow players to come and go as they please This has its cons no doubt but the pros outweigh the cons of the current system like really joining a Discord group in the hopes of finding a lobby that just happens to be on the level your'e looking to play You'd be finished with a whole rundown by the time the stars align.[/strike strike]Granted a matchmaking method akin to CS may end up posing challenges in terms of loadouts as players will have different loadout preferences But maybe you can do a placeholder bot that carries its previous player's loadout until someone joins I dont know how you'd actually do the mechanics of it but at least figure something out strike Matchmaking aside the bots are ok-ish definitely better than I expected The tension is always there not knowing what waits in the dark adds to the overall ambiance of the game Pacing is dictated by how the players want to play risk management is definitely a requirement here Weapon selection also gets a plus for giving players an idea of what kind of performance it brings sure these are not numeric stats but it's described well enough to help players choose one that suits their style strike]One major markdown I have for gameplay is the ADS Sure hold to aim adds to the gameplay as it's the game's way of making you work extra to hold the gun up but on the flip side it's downright tiring I can understand if you want to keep this as hold-ADS but please consider adding toggle ADS as an option.[/strike Overall it's a great game if the player is up to the challenge of carrying bots Or with friends Or both strike]Perhaps one day you'll implement a matchmaking system that makes it more friction-less for the player.[/strike update 1 previous cons invalidated the settings to toggle ADS are buried in gameplay settings Friends can drop in mid-game And yes there is some degree of matchmaking comforts provided that you have friends that play
Este juego no es y tiene una curva de aprendizaje de cada mapa para poder cumplir la Curva que es constante debido a que las misiones van rotando Recomiendo este juego por que representa un reto en especial jugando con amigos Donde la y la son vitales para lograr completar las misiones Admito que puede ser un poco frustrante aveces pero la de completar misiones es bastante Si siento que hay cositas de que mejorar la interfaz especial en el de inicio se me hace medio confusa por como planteada y siento que las recompensas por completar una son pocas pero lo recomiendo si les gustan este tipo de retos

This is not a game that you can play casually whenever you want to Each time me and the poor fools who join me in this game want to play we plan the day in advance And we plan it out not only because this can take hours but the we have to prepare mentally to take on the horrors of the the complex We know that each time we load this game up that there will be nothing except for a night of stress and constant adrenaline Each time we descend the shaft when I hear the gasp I have flash backs to every single moment of every single mission before it This game has done something that no other game has done before It got me to admit that I am a masochist I enjoy the pain that this game brings into my life And I love it even more each time I play it
GTFO is a niche game in case it isnt clear enough the levels are hard long and punishing the game needs 4 people to play tho join the discord is very nice lots of nice people the gameplay is methodical needs of preparation and strategy BUT if it still looks a bit interesting knowing these facts its defo a game that deserves to be played when the horror is gone you are left with a punishing and very fun game to play While it does need a lot of hours to learn its one of the most fun and tense experiences in games there arent a lot of horror coop games that get to the level of GTFO it just has somethin that is so special and while its obv not perfect cause there are some bugs and meh levels its just that fun Defo one of the best underrated games out there
at first this game had me screaming in fear now it has me screaming in anger after doing crib
very promising game shame devs abandoned adding new content they're just adding things they've already used back in edit devs are on par with EA devs
the hardest and the best game i've ever played
if you are looking for a very casual survival co-op FPS to play with your friends i recommend a nice easy game like L4D or Back for Blood etc end of story GTFO is not for you if you are looking for casual game play Now for the real ones out there that want a game that is gonna break you down piece by piece every time you fail a mission a game that is gonna slap your momma right in the teeth in front of you and a game that is criminally underrated IMO GTFO is for you This game drags you along with it mysterious story that keeps expanding and adding characters every failed mission is knowledge gained and a chance to return and kick some Sleeper ass the end of every mission feels so damn rewarding you cant help but breathe a sigh of relief and want to go to the next mission and start the torture all over again All in all this games story,atmosphere,enemies and gun play are great and I 100 recommend it to anyone looking for a Hardcore game to add to their masochistic list they seriously mean Work together or die together
Its nice
I am not a horror game person I get so easily freaked out This game's focus on teamwork makes it honestly so fun and I've actually gotten pretty good at it Definitely recommend playing with friends while talking on discord it helps so much
First day playing today and HOLY HELL This game is wildly entertaining and looks amazing Would 10/10 recommend Its a hard game though
Dauda shots me everytime
Terrible lobby making makes it really hard to find people to play this with If you don't have 4 friends to play this with you'll be very lonely in this game Playing with bots will not work as their AI is incredibly dumb That is very unfortunate because the game play itself is fun and promising
I like the premise the format and most of GTFO's elements in fact It's far more complete than the last time I played but it's not actually finished and it never will be The dev's can call this whatever they want but it's not a finished game by any means at least not compared to what was promised I was there from the start I remember your marketing Matchmaking What matchmaking Apparently that's up to the player All matchmaking as far as I can tell has been exported to Discord Which is laughable The only way I could see of getting people to join me when I host these days is to copy paste a link into Discord and only Discord Community Tend to bully and harass in mobs anyone that dare try to criticise the game Hate noobs Lovely Social features None exist as far as I can tell Payer base Very very small In the hundreds Learning curves Everything in this game is a learning ledge Either you know or you don't know and that's it The stats of the all important weapons the selection of which can and probably will determine your success on a run There are none Nothing but a vague written description like fast slow medium high damage/low damage semi auto etc No numbers not even those really stupid sliders games these days love There are redundant weapon combinations that will get you killed and you have no way of knowing this until you're dead Same with navigation a core part of the gameplay loop To find an objective one must look it up on a terminal which one must find without any directions Once you find a terminal at least one of the few things the tutorial/'training teaches you how to do you must enter a command to ping the location of what you're trying to find Cool sounds great So let's say the object is in zone 60 area J Well you won't know that or that there even is a Zone 60 or area J until you are told about it or happen to stumble into it and notice where you are and when pinging an object in another zone you only get the zone it's in zone 60 OK so where is that and how do we find it Ping the object Do you see the issue yet Well at least you can find out where you are by looking at zoning signs on doors and walls as well as typing info on a terminal Well that's step 1 and 2 done where are we and where we going How do we get there though How do you know which direction to go in how do you draw a route from A to B You don't The game says you can and that pinging continuously pings objects so you can home in on them but it doesn't The only part of the map that is visible is the map you've already visited and the only part you can zoom in on and read is you're current location SO even if you find the right area miss the objective and leave you can't fucking see that correct area on the map properly UNLESS YOU'RE ALREADY THERE WTF The only way to know the map is prior knowledge The only way to know where you're going is to already know where you're going So each run challenges you once in this regard and then never again unless you completely forget The entire game is like this and the existing community love it because they have already gone through the learning curve They love torturing people with the crucible of total information blindness that is this game I'm one of those people that have gone through most of the learning curve by the way and I still think it's horrendous Every single knowable thing in this game relies on memory because it's not recorded anywhere else in the game and it's terrible I'm sure someone somewhere has written in depth guides and such which would is great but that's not a merit of the game For the price the broken promises and the continued toxicity of the everyone involved in this thing I cannot recommend it Even buying with a group of friends to play together that is minimum 220 AUD which is an absurd price The game is unfinished unpolished barely supported no new content just shuffling around runs and it's going to stay like that I'm going to try and squeeze what enjoyment I can from GTFO since I already own it and maybe I will change my review as a result I hope it redeems itself the more I play it but I have a ever growing list of concerns and annoyances with this game
First of all I was gifted this game by a friend Now into the review WARNING This game requires the friends game pass in the video game known as life if you don't have this then I recommend not reading GTFO Technically it doesn't stand for get the fuck out but because you'll be screaming at your friends 24/7 it might as well mean get the fuck out I don't have much to say other than if you want to play this Ensure your friends aren't the type of people to lose all forms of brain functionality when in a discord call Because as the slogan states Work together or die together Take that slogan very literally please If you don't have good friends then go to Deep Rock Galactic and make some cause this game is just DRG but horror 11/10
Match making is there but no one uses it Why Because UsE tHe DiScOrD witch was implemented as a stop-gap measure will be regurgitated in your face non-stop Its 2023 what game that is co-op doesn't have a match maker now People are being apologists for white knight credit i guess On top of that I do not like that the Devs at 10 chambers wish to force THEIR way of playing YOUR game on you Want to steal some stuff from the first room of an optional overload Too bad have the whole level reset as punishment Want to bunny hop for outrun the enemies TOO BAD WE DON'T AGREE WITH THAT AND REMOVED BUNNY HOPPING And the list goes on and on and on
Very nice
Just brutal This game will test your friendship
I sold my virginity to play this game and it was horrible
Miss Miss 30
A great mix of co-op horror and strategy
It was ight
One of the best games I've played in a long time
Game is incredibly fun and challenging in a puzzle kinda way The combination of shooting strategy and timing with teammates makes it incredibly satisfying to complete scenarios
Smh idk why all these people say the game is hard Wish they would make it harder just feels wayyyyyy too easy for me and the bois
Chave raxa ara
This game is a mix of Left 4 Dead gameplay mechanics and Splinter Cell levels of stealth mechanics You always have the tools to get the job done Whether or not you succeed is entirely up to you This is hands down one of the best games I've ever played and the developers are constantly hard at work making the game even better than it was Alt Rundowns are a lot of fun and my friends and I have been happy to see the mechanics return from those rundowns I can't wait to see how R8 looks when they finally get around to releasing it

GTFO can either be a mixed bag or a delightful co-op horror experience I remember when I first got the game I felt a bit disappointed I was expecting a chaotic scary and a bit wacky experience to play with friends A kind of couch co-op kind of feel What I got was a more serious title Not more serious in tone or mood but in the way of playing For me when I join GTFO I feel like I should play with the mindset of just straight beating the game not as much as having crazy times with friends Because of this me and my friends got quite bored of the game quite quickly all putting it down A couple months later I decided to hop on the game with some people on the official GTFO discord I feel I've found a new way to enjoy the game but definitely one that subverted my initial expectations I've gotten into that mindset of getting each level done and I'm more into the social aspect of the game but that's fine for me I do think the game is fun but you might have to think of the game in a different way to initially enjoy it If you are looking for a game to invest tons of time into and want to take a bit more seriously this game can be a blast

i love it

Thanks I hate it Must play more
sounds like someone using mouthwash
this game has a very tiny wiener<3

Edit Actually changing this to a do not recommend after seeing devs fighting with people in the Steam forums over this exact topic basically saying they don't want to put the effort into accessibility e.g pinging matchmaking/server browser because they want people to talk in Discord Can't rightfully recommend a game that the devs are purposefully gimping in the name of some bizarre sense of hardcoreness and community If you want community build it in game instead of shunting it off to a third party your playerbase is already small enough without splitting it like this.Really really excellent game I like it a lot and I'd like to play more of it however.while there is an in-game matchmaking system kinda matchmaking is done almost exclusively through the Discord and the devs encourage this almost to the point of seemingly resenting the idea of just doing it in-game Your mileage will vary but I really don't like it The community is already pretty small for an already niche game and while it's a simple one the extra barrier to entry doesn't really help with that Sometimes I just wanna hop in without all the rigamarole but I can't really and while solo is possible that's not really what the game's about Basically be sure to bring some friends.Other than that though the game's gold Graphics art direction UI style and atmosphere are all incredible Weapons are all cool but the gadgets really steal the show and let you be an asset to the team even while you're getting used to the game Enemy design and especially sound design are off the charts cool and the level design and how you move through it are also fantastic Highly recommend but again bring some friends
i haven't played too much of this game just yet but i can already confidently say that the reviews don't lie graphics are great in my opinion controls feel good and the game runs well even on rigs that have older CPUs.communication and cooperation are absolutely a must for this game your team must have a tactical approach in order to succeed i recommend buying this this game feels really refreshing to play especially now during the times where new games tend to die off quickly are blatant copies of other games or simply get boring after playing them a few times

w game
the screams
A brutal game that will not hold your hand at all You've got to work well with a team or you won't make it
Game is dead I did match making and got into no game
The premise of GTFO is very much in relation to its meaning You don't really want to go down there and investigate It wasn't your choice to go down there anyway But by sheer determination and having a willingness to live and getting the F out with your teammates is a very rewarding action
eThe main riddle is why this game has so many good reviews But it is understandable why no one is playing it less that 1000 players at the same time The game is not hard or scary it is very boring You are almost always crawling and hammering poor creatures that have seazures Sometimes some irritating stuff is added like white fog yellow fog or poisoning fog Man developers love when you cant see nothing Idk who has decided that this type of gameplay can be fun
TLDR Simple satisfying tense and tough game-play Play difficult hour long missions in a group of 4 Graphics are good combat is smooth and interactions with the environment are interesting Better with friends 8/10[hr][/hr]GTFO is a stealth game at heart Limited ammo and tough enemies give it a great survival horror feel so that you have to make tough decisions and really feel the tension The missions are hard and you will likely want to team up with other real players to make good progress list][/list]There are basic unlocks for appearance items that you can use to customise your character as you progress But aside from that the experience is very simple Enter a mission complete the objectives with your team leave and repeat While simple it feels like a very solid and cohesive experience.[list][/list]My only criticism is that it can be difficult to gather a group of friends or strangers and play through a whole mission in the limited time that I have to game these days Some kind of quick missions or solo mode or progressive campaign with regular checkpoints would go a long way for the more casual players like myself
hackett god
It's hard really hard to get the fuck out But to be fair it's fun even if you don't get out
MATCHMAKING DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE NO ONE PLAY THIS GAME ACTIVE PLAYERS LIKE 30 OMG
hOLY MOLEL IT WAS GOOD
GOOD GAME
oooo
Game is a blast with a group of mates struggles a bit with any less however as without a full squad a single ai teammate can be a major detriment unless this has been fixed but beyond that I don't even complain about losing since it all feels fair.You and your team are in almost complete control of the consequences you face
If you have friends Solo sucks Trust me
It good
its fun
super fun gameplay very occasionally glitches but nothing frustrating super immersive
noice
Completely intense and horrifying game I will need to get used to it however
toy mareado de la UI no se ve chota y tengo que saber python para poder jugar.re buenardo esta la cosa
Truly we need to get the fuck out guys PLZ SEND HELP IM STUCK IN THIS SHIT
great game to play with friends even if you dont have 4 friends to play with the bots are relatively smart but it is better to play with friends It is a very demanding and difficult game but that makes the rewards all the more fun to get and rewarding
Bu oyun bir oyun yoksa iyi birini bulun her
I love this game till MARK WAKES UP THE ENTIRE COMPLEX
Hot
hell nah
The environment the ambiance it's amazing The guns have weight and heft and the enemies are numerous the ammo low This game is not for the feint of heart

This game is quite difficult but it feels so rewarding once you finish a whole rundown
This game is fucking hard and good I mean we need a good communication and teammate to finish every rundown Bot and sentry can friendly fire so be careful with that lol No speedrun use brain is more satisfied when you finished the rundown
game is greath but i dont have friends
Bom jogo

friend dont like no play sad life Regret
Sehr gutes KO-OP Survival Spiel welches wirklich sehr anspruchsvoll ist Selbst als Vierer Gruppe ist es extrem schwer und man schafft ein Level wohl selten beim Ersten Versuch Eine klare Empfehlung 4er Gruppen die eine neue Erfahrung suchen
This game ah sibek weak First I can't see shit in the dark Second those mutated half ass human is harder than my dick Third this game give me last stage of cancer can't even sleep well at night Fourth this game is harder than rocket league
Fairly challenging but usually feels fair Bots really aren't great so it's kinda required to play with friends to get the full experience the fucking tone and just flavor of the world is fucking top notch though amazing presentation
hao
The aesthetic of this game is what I love most It really immerses you into the games universe and only once I was 15 hours in did I realise that there was an actual story buried in the details for me to piece together The game play is intuitive the enemies are creepy and the atmosphere unsettling Each time I think I've learnt everything there is to know there is some new element or feature I run into on an expedition that i have never seen before Great game highly recommend getting it You can play with bots but it'll go a lot better with at least 1 other person with you
Fun game to play with friends its like left 4 dead
I love this game wish i had friends though
Guys we need to GTFO
Muito bom o jogo bem da forma que tem que ser Para jogar com os amigos no coop vale muito a pena
i was tk'd by some asian when i had no clue what i was doing 10/10 game

This game is super fun but be ready to suck ass at it for a while at first Dont touch the danger noodles
Hard game but worth for the worthy
stupendo consigliato

Great Game Hard as Hell
gud
An ok game with an absolutely useless matchmaking system Unless you have your own team to play with you will wait for random players with unknown skill levels for longer than you can play So steer clear unless you have a good squad already
Community's kind and they help learn you real good on the ropes Can't say this game is bad because every wave has your buttcheeks clenched
It very good
it good
I really like this game when i saw horror was in it i was scared but got used to it very quickly its a challenging game and recommend having 4 people to play with or it'll be really hard
Game is really fun with friends
Challenging fun
Very dull and dark Not impressed
Nobody's gonna read this review so I'll just say I'm gay
This game remains to be in the top 5 games I've bought and played on steam to this day I bought this game when it came to early access back in 2019 The devs have remained true to their initial commitment and rolled out consistent update after update The game is currently on rundown 7 and they've begun re-releasing some of the previous rundowns The way the this game demand cooperation and teamwork in order to deal with and circumvent the various objectives and enemies ensures that victory is that much more rewarding I always find myself booting this game up each update that is released A true team-centered tactical first person shooter
A lot of fun as long as you have friends to play with because it is impossible to play on your own
Muito bom Apenas jogue se vc tiver amigos
Ta bueno pero mis amigos no lo tienen es un juego que pide muchas horas 3-5 por partida al maximo
El juego en su mecana y una elegancia pero haber una que se llamara multijugador gente que conozcas ya que no me empareja con otra gente que tengan el juego o por lo menos no lo ha hecho conmigo y jugar con bots pues no era mi objetivo al querer este juego
Shat my pants 10/10 would GTFO again
good
It's okay
me da miedo estaba suave pero me moria mucho no lo recomiendo
Bolt 102993939483 4 Bolt
i hate my random teammates I would recommend
I saw a demon screamed and logged off 10/10 would consider playing again
very nice game
shit the lag that does not depend on the connection of the players goes every other day 3 hour missions thrown away due to lag or bugs months later games still bugged but they have added the spawn of enemies behind the back
bom jogo falta hentai
gahdam
10/10
poop

this shit is scary
this game is so bad holy shit
Supero mis expectativas
It Is A Difficult Game Get used to failing missions(rundowns over and over with friends and strangers from the discord channel And then it gets even more difficult I love it
It's a tough but satisfying and fun game Obviously in order to actually have fun bring your homies Playing solo or with bots is just gonna be hell on earth it's not what the game was meant for So before buying make absolutely sure that you have other people to play with or at least you're comfortable playing with randoms on the Discord server The guns are satisfying the graphics are stunning the music and atmosphere is amazing and this game is overall really solid If you manage to learn the basics and tough through hard missions you'll probably find this game a really good choice for weekends with the boys 9/10
im so gay this game makes me straight
yeah good game shot and killed a single mother of 50
pog
One of the best action-horror that I've ever played
good game
This game is really fun I've only played through one mission but i'm reviewing it now since I dont know when else i'm going to get the opportunity to play it since it requires a group of pretty close knit friends all around the same skill level to get the most out of it due to it being a really hard co-op game I can see the game potentially getting repetitive to some people due to there not being an overwhelming selection of guns and tools but to me that kind of adds to the charm and allows you to get a base understanding of each weapon really quickly and figure out level strategies faster Despite being really hard I don't find the game overwhelming at all the only part that is kind of confusing is how level progression is structured and the whole rundown bit which isn't really explained well to new players But the actual gameplay itself is surprisingly straightforward and easy to jump into my friends had played the game before and I was brand new we just started a level they were stuck on and I got the hang of it pretty quick I enjoy how the levels don't randomize very much between runs the structure and doors remain the same so you can actually plot out strategies by playing a level over and over again The gunplay is fairly standard but feels good and it's super satisfying to hit an enemy in the head with a sledgehammer There's a half half split between stealth and action so it never feels like you're doing the same thing for too long and there's a lot of on-the-fly thinking to figure out what strategy you should use in what situation If you mess up and get hit you don't die instantly you actually have a pretty generous amount of health and ammo given to you at the start the challenge is that you have to make it last nearly the entire mission since there are very sparse resources Overall if you like survival horror games and want to play a heavily co-op themed survival horror game this is probably the absolute best game for you I never felt super scared while playing it but there definitely was a tension that never let up during the whole game similar to early survival horror where you have extremely limited resources and hate having to take any unnecessary fights
GTFO is a challenging game that requires the teamwork of all 4 players If you're playing this game single player you wont achieve the full experience I'd recommend to get this game and try to get a friend or two to join with as well Aside from a few little map glitches and annoying tasks that seems to be a little repetitive at times I highly recommend this game if your into fps horror and hanging out with friends 8/10
Great but personally not for me since my friends are also not coordinated enough to complete a run If you're looking into a challenging co-op game for up to 4 players look no further
asd
Cool game devs active looking forward to the future
Beat the first level steamhappy
Beat the first level steamhappy

super immersive and keeps you on your toes
You need a team
hardcore shit
Buen juego muchos esliperts D
one of the best multiplayer survival horror games I've ever played quite hard very rewarding game play with a heavy focus on the cooperative part of cooperative mutiplayer
Bots need better AI more gameplay mechanics for the player like inventory or new items things that make the game more fun and balance the experience
requires 4 stack and perfect teamwork very hectic but very enjoyable if you can work together
100
It can be fun if you have friends
Oh my god this game if fucking amazing but its so fucking difficult but i love it 10/10 would die again
this game is great at what it does horror terrifying shooting clean friendly NPCS janky overall experience has been a lot of fun
10/10
This is as real as it gets if your looking for a challenge that uses not only skills but also uses real life brain power and computer skills this is your game there is no x button when you search a computer you use command prompt as you would in real life making the game a real horrifying challenge scary and fun i give the game 10 out of 10 this is hell and you just dropped into it GTFO
Not bad for a casual shooter
Git Polecam
game good devs bad pov you are waging war against your own community and alienate them by threatening with a literal court because they want to mod and play old rundowns
Teamplay,schwer und doch Progressiv Einfach geil
oyunun o kadar mal ki sessiz ilerleyecekken tak tak bok var gibi bazen duvardan alanda gerekirken ekmek almaya gidiyor botlar oyun
If you dont have this in your library your missing one of the best games of our generation Fun hardcore Relentless team cooperation Fan FUCKING Tastic

GTFO is a first-person shooter survival horror game that takes place in a dark abandoned underground facility This game is not for the faint of heart as it delivers a challenging and thrilling experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat One of the things that impressed me the most about this game is the lighting The use of lighting is superb and adds to the overall atmosphere and tension of the game The sound design is also fantastic and really immerses you in the game world The gunplay in GTFO is neat but it can be quite hectic at times especially when you're swarmed by hordes of enemies While this can be overwhelming it's also part of what makes the game so exciting My one complaint about the game is how difficult it can be to get through without friends in multiplayer While it's possible to play with bots it's not the same experience as playing with other people If you have a group of friends who also have the game then it's definitely worth a shot Overall GTFO is a fun and intense experience that will keep you entertained for hours It's not a game for everyone but if you enjoy survival horror games and are looking for a challenge then GTFO is definitely worth checking out
Just awesome Environments are great piecing the story together with logs is fascinating and the difficulty keeps you on your toes

crashes everything
Don't know what people like about this game so much Matchmaking basically get's you nowhere so if you're hoping to join with randos you're probably SOL There isn't much strategy to this game It's touted as some kind of exciting tense strategic shooter and it just isn't Sneak around through some plain old rooms shoot the generic baddies OH NO A wave of baddies don't die That's the game It's seriously that bland If you like it good for you If you're thinking about getting this game because you want an intense serious shooter game with lot's of communication and strategizing I say get something else
most fun ive had shitting my pants
Despite its marketing as a hardcore cooperative first-person shooter that emphasizes stealth gameplay GTFO falls short of expectations The game developed by 10 Chambers Collective has been touted as a challenging and intense experience that requires high levels of coordination and communication between players However the game's potential is hindered by its limited stealth mechanics and lack of gameplay variations This is particularly disappointing considering the potential that the game exhibited in its early stages particularly at the conclusion of rundown 2 However the game's issues have continued to mount with the introduction of rundown 3 and subsequent updates This phase can only be described as experimental marked by fluctuating difficulty levels strange balancing decisions that suggest the developers are not playing their own game and tedious and mostly uninspired level designs While the game includes promising concepts their implementation is often lacking resulting in a frustrating and unsatisfying experience Additionally the game sufferes from numerous bugs further detracting from the overall enjoyment of the game Another significant issue with GTFO is the lack of replay value or incentives to keep playing after clearing a rundown Once players have completed the levels there is little reason to keep playing The absence of meaningful rewards or progression systems makes it difficult to stay engaged with the game for an extended period It remains a mystery as to why the developers chose to implement a half-assed matchmaking system instead of a straightforward lobby browser and then encourage players to use the third-party platform Discord to find other players The current matchmaking system is not only useless but it also undermines the game's intended cooperative experience by making it frustratingly difficult to find others to play with Finally the lengthy content droughts in GTFO make it a constant struggle for players to stay engaged with the game These prolonged periods of inactivity leave players with little new content to explore To make matters worse the developers have actively worked against their core community by ignoring valid feedback and targeting modders who were trying to create interesting new content for the game All in all I would have wished for nothing more than this game to succeed and having spent a lot of hours playing modding and discussing the game maybe it did If you have 3 friends there is still fun to be found in GTFO and to some degree I recommend it But for me GTFO will always be the disappointing game that could have been The game that could have been so much more
gg
HUGE SHAME OF FANTASTIC POTENCIAL ACTULLY WHAT WE GOT IS BORINGLY CHEAPLY MAKED GAME THAT STILL LOOKS LIKE UNRELEASED BETA VERSION Please do not spend your money and life on this cheaply maded bullshit you may regret it

issa good game fr
GTFO is not for everybody it is a hard game that require your teammates to be imprisoned in Siberia and beaten with a baseball bat for breakfast if they fuck up that's why I love the fact that they added bots now you can play this game with bots and it feels so different it feels like you managing an elite squad of retards with down syndromes I love it my success rate went from infinite negative to 5 so now I do sometimes manage to escape from tarkov the matchmaking is non existent and I don't wanna join the discord cause I'm sociopath so I'm going with the bots and I really rediscovered this game It really is worth a shot the guns feels like shit and the movement feels like you running with your pants down while having diarrhoea attacks but stills the atmosphere of this game is unprecedented I'm an horror fan cause I'm a pretty horrible person my self and if you are somewhat the same(hopefully not you have to play this game But honestly this game is very overpriced it's nothing particularly hard or innovative at it's core and Deep rock galactic offer MUCH MORE for less but like VERY MUCH MORE i'd say that 70 of the game is the atmosphere Still if you like horror tactical stuff and you have 30 quid to clean your butt with use toilet paper instead and buy this game and play with bots It's really cool plus the game is surprisingly well balanced Imho the actual honest price for what the game has to offer depth and progression wise should be free to play at max just joking but it should be around 15 to 20 if you out of your mind to be realistic Now buy the game play it at night with surround and shit yourself this game is a better horror that all the horror movies made in the last 15 years all together comparable only to Dead space whoever is the fucking psycho that gave birth to this should be put in psychiatric ward but so should I so it's fine BUY IT
TL;DR This game is amazing and you should totally get it but you need at least 2 other friends to play with cause the bots are dog shit and online play is kinda weird also its only 13GB which is sweeeeeeeet I haven't really played this game for that long but I have already fallen in love with it Like this game is absolutely phenomenal the gameplay is amazing the spooky environment is awesome etc Honestly I could go on and on about how awesome this game is And really my only gripes with the game are the use of a discord server for online play and the dog shit bots But both of these problems can be solved by just getting some friends to play with you which is honestly the best way to play this game So you're on the fence of getting this game and you have a few friends to play with then I highly recommend this game even at full price
p
atmosphere is insane love it
Before playing GTFO I had no girls and nobody loved me After I played GTFO it was the same situation
Game's hard but I'm harder
the fuck off GTFO=get three friends okay
i have THREE hours in the game im making a review on the game very good very getting out of the place very nice the monsters are very yes ok i now have like 60 hours but this game is fucking unplayable a jacket mesh was in the floor worst game
I love everything about this game The atmosphere game mechanics team play difficulty graphics etc As long as the developers continue making runs this game will keep you entertained for a really long time Need more games like this
10/10 PERFECT GAME
gg
If you like fighting spawns of hell powering nuclear reactors or making a mistake that will get you frowned upon forever for making you should play this game
yes
Original and absolutely terrifying Love the attention to lore as well
woo
Great run-downs Must have a properly aligned spinal column
cool
D
love the difficulty of this game Really makes your team have to communicate and coordinate loadouts
heheehhheheh go pwepewpew on zombise 3
Low visibility limited ammo high stress it is a great game to destroy friendships with
NB
Good game thats more fun with friends highly recommend for group play
I HATE Bishop
There is no content you meet all the enemies in the first few missions
15 Gameplay
no
i don't understand why everybody talks shit about this game graphics are good development team works on it and game gets update fairly often You can either go stealth or loud depends on the lvl UI is good community is good lvl design map AI enemies are good Missions can sometime be rather pointless but no judge on that part since this game all about trying to complete a mission with harash conditions This game needs and deservers more recognition and love if you don't have friends to play this game don't worry you will meet with friendly and nice people in lobbies anyway take my word for it Overrall 8/10
big good
idk havent played it yet lost the account for 8 months cant download it for some reason
10 10
It's not worth 40 dollars ps this is a pain and suffering game at first glance yeah sure the graphics are great and the first few sections are fun but this isn't cutting for me
Top game especially if you like to be sneaky and cooperative

This game is an awesome horror shooter that requires a good amount of team work or you will go down If you have a group of friends with whom you can play this game repeatedly GTFO will be challenging yet super fun and rewarding

GTFO is an absolute masterpiece This game surprises me each time I try a new level The twists turns strategies last-ditch efforts solid gunplay and easy-to-learn hard-to-master gameplay make an immensely satisfying experience 10/10
It's a game that wants to beat you down to the point of considering throwing away your PC You will hate your friends hate yourself and hate every decision that led you to the point of install 10/10 recommend
scary alien thingy make me squee
130 hours of pain misery and suffering Then you finally feel like you're starting to get a grasp of things and getting better and you get screwed completely out of nowhere because the game randomly decided to crash and erase all your progress 4 hours into a mission The technical state this game is in is completely inexcusable and you should NOT play it until it's been fixed which is gonna take a long time checkpoints have been in the game for a while and they are still bugged out for example Play DRG instead and save yourself the pain The difficulty of this game is not worth it when you constantly got the sword of Damocles hanging over you

Best game to test your friendship 10/10
Pros Beautiful graphics Good gameplay Frequent updates Good variety in weapons Cons Bots are pretty dumb I know its supposed to be a game that you HAVE to play with other people but it would be nice if I could play through levels solo with custom difficulty or just have a cheat system Readability is not the best sometimes its difficult to spot the red security scan circles when there is an orange light shining on the ground Pinging system could be better option to use ping wheel instead of menu and let us ping ANYTHING Controls could have been more similar to other popular games like give us a quickswitch button and an option to toggle infinite inventory scroll
Now supports 8 players modded The game is fun again
This game matchmaking system is so bad like my ballz in summer time itchy and stinky
good game
hard as balls but extremely enjoyable
GTFO is an fantastic evolution of the fps genre But PROS 4 player coop challenging but fair retro ideas re-imagined lore rich that isn't shoved in your face CONS Derpy coop AI some levels are too long hard to convince friends to play lol I gotta say that this is by far the most criminally underrated game at least that I've ever played Too long has the fps genre been trying to add ideas and features that are either niche trendy or at worst damaging to its roots Here We have a game that doesn't hold back any punches mixing the adrenaline filled firefights with the oddly satisfying resource management and computer terminal interactions that happens along the way The weapon selection is some of the best I've seen with pros and cons to your choices to really encourage a mixed loadout approach for all players to go in as prepared as possible Shall I elaborate Nah Experimentation is more fun anyway Plus the devs are adding back new to toys each rundown update so there's a little something new to try out Mostly great so far right NOT SO FAST There are a few quirks to keep in mind that cannot be overlooked It pains me to say that a majority of these missions are not for the faint of heart if you don't have an hour at minimum to play at a time then you won't accomplish much That's right a whole hour That can be a rather tall ask if I do say so myself Especially when a few of the expeditions don't have checkpoints Ouch Its because of this I can't recommend this to solo players sure you can get some of the rundowns done with the bots but they suffer from the odd quirkiness making them at best glorified meatbags They try their best to ration resources but they do this automatically at will prioritize the player above all else sounds great before you realize that they will often give you too much and waste it or use it when the situation REALLY does not call for it ie Heal you in the middle of combat instead of shooting the thing attacking you disinfect you while in the middle of poisonous fog that you cannot see in or steal resources you don't want them taking Another odd quirk is their random points of being down right stupid running through a door you wanna close and getting stuck getting in front of your line of fire or not placing their tools when you tell them to I could go on and on but in all honesty This is a game that you play with 3 of your friends so whatever right The game is great tell your friends bribe or guilt trip them to play with you because good gravy it is fun and rewarding don't actually do that but for real convince them to try it at least
Probably one of the best games I've ever played as well as one of my favorite games tbh Most of the reviews that are negative not all but most are because of the difficulty Like the devs say the success rate for most missions is very low That doesn't mean you can't trial and error your way through it even with minimal skill The same goes for literally any game The devs are incredibly transparent and even tout the difficulty of the game which in all fairness is fine The game plays great feels great and is very rewarding/satisfying when you finally beat a level you've been stuck on for a while All in all I feel like it's fine to not enjoy the difficulty The game's just not for you However I don't believe it's fair for that to reflect negatively on the game or the devs because of that They are VERY transparent about the difficulty before people get into it Not to mention most of the things people find difficult have a simple or easy solution you can use to manipulate your odds by utilizing the tools provided for you Again trial and error like ANY other game If you don't like difficult games where you can lose a lot of progress from a loss then don't play Design atmosphere gameplay and replayability are all at least a 9/10 for me My opinion though Fantastic game that's not for everyone but I personally love it
Extremely hard game That's the point
Guh
I love this game so much Challenging and so much fun I wish I had more people to play with
Excellent game It has a great and stressful atmosphere and is hard Each levels are carefully designed with challenges to solve and need cooperation with every players to be successful I highly recommand it Something I'd like to see in futur is more diversified environnements and types of ennemies
the game only need score board for example friendly fire notification damage dealt by each category sentry special etc
bonk
Intense This game is far from sleeper
No es un juego para todos en mi experiencia es algo que debes tener mucha paciencia y estar preparado para jugar algo repetitivo pero el sentimiento de morir al inicio avanzar morir a la mitad y despues poder pasar el mapa y hasta sentirlo es una experiencia no es un juego para todos pero es todo lo que esperaba pureza de prueba y error es aun mejor si no se nada de videos o guias y todo es experimentacion y las armas son fantasticas por lo menos para mi
Your asshole will never clench harder throughout your life other than when you play this game
While i do like the core game-play i cannot recommend it The monsters are horrifying the atmosphere is really good and when it clicks the coop can be good and satisfying too But here comes the issues The matchmaking is almost nonexistent only shown to exist by a button in the main menu that never actually gets you in a session Only other way to find a lobby is by going through their discord and using their channels where people post their private game password which could be fixed by making a server list If you get in a lobby you will most of the time either end with one guy running into the enemies to smack em ruining the match in less than 5 minutes or people telling you to go because you did a single mistake If you decide to play with less than 4 players you don't have enough resources for the hordes But the Ai you can take with you to replace em are practically brain dead Then comes the weird decision to make certain objective soft-lock you if you took one wrong door Example being having 3 batteries for 3 generators but having 4-5 generator in the map 2 being traps that opens useless door locking you out of the mission In a labyrinth that you need to explore to develop your map for easier navigation You have alarms on these doors that alerts the horde which depletes your resources fairly fast One single mistake and your 1 hour long run is ruined Losing in a game is fine it wouldn't be challenging if you couldn't,but losing because lack of ulterior knowledge that you cannot gain without either winning or losing multiple times simply isn't thoughtful mechanics
C'est difficille mais amusant A faire plusieurs si le nombre de joueur est en dessous de 3 Si vous 2 ou seul alors rajoutez des bots
this game is super fun only thing i would say to new players looking to get the game is that this game is much more enjoyable in multiplayer the way the game works just feels like it was made for 2 players the waves are just too big for singleplayer unless you're really confident in your abilities otherwise the environment is amazing this game is a great game if you like stealth/horror type games D
amazingly terrifying
Nebel effekte sind komplett was manche spiel passagen komplett wie man mit 1 so groben fehler ein ganzes spiel schlecht macht erfahrt ihr hier
Would've been a lot better if they added cat girls F***ing amateurs

Shit pants 10/10
I like when the tentacle monster violates me in ways I didn't know possible and calls his friends so we all can have a massive orgy
This game is terrific with friends and i've never had so much fun withholding a med pack from them and watching them die to the aliens hahah
10/10 I can draw d*cks
Its a fun and difficult however the ai could use some work as they tend to piss off the whole room when you are trying to sneak
bon jeux full
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
I've never felt such happiness completing level 1 of a game
zor
Good
man i wish friends were real
yeah
Fucked my wife
This game is not like other coop game where you cant complete the game by playing solo This is real coop game where teammate is needed I dunno if there is a way or other players have completed the game by playing solo I tried to avoid unnecessary fight but the bots ruin it anyway When there are times where the objectives should be done individually the bots didnt do it So basically its impossible to play with all the bots to reach the objectives Aside from that the game is so much fun to play but sadly cant complete a mission Will play again in the future Great game
9/10 bread score
Pros Gameplay Graphics/Artstyle Concept Enemies Story Cons Clothes/Skins Verdict A hard game that needs a team that is very coordinated It's really rewarding when you finish a level
Still no native VR support Da fuq
Everyone who likes this game must enjoy being kicked directly in the balls or clam
The game feels like SWAT4 meets Aliens/Sci Fi horror Get it on a sale 7.5/10
The game requires a lot of teamwork rule-following and listening to one another There is friendly fire so this game really relies on a realism system to keep you entranced in the immersive gameplay The game is very difficult and that is why teamwork is so important You and your friend group must try this game
alors le jeux est beau l univers est sympa et on est en immersion de ouf mais point negatif ma co crash et impossible de re rejoindre la session donc le jeux de me mettre en solo en 2023 ils pourraient faire en sorte de reconnecter les jours sur leurs session si la game du joueur est deco
I ain't gonna lie some of the monsters in this game are kinda cute 3
Did not really enjoy the gameplay at all
Sometimes its GTFO is needed in life just to be lost in dark places gulp other times it become too much walking simulator ooof huge levels
GTFO GTFO
Rundown R1c1 is impossible and absolute bull because ammo cannot stack and you have to shoot a billion enemies
This game is too easy
its pretty good
This game sucks
Es un juego de horror bastante entretenido La dificultad aveces escala muy canijo y casi cada nivel te presenta un nuevo detalle que otros no tienen y eso lo vuelve aun mejor La verdad si tienes amigos con quienes jugarlo te lo recomiendo bastante si no esta el discord muchas horas de entretenimiento ademas al de hoy los desarrolladores le siguen metiendo contenido nuevo gratis lo que lo vuelve aun joya El juego no miente con su dificultad hay puntos o enemigos bastante molestos y toca pelotas pero nada imposible si se organiza bien Los tanto de niveles como de armas y enemigos son bastante buenos PICK UP YOUR DEPLOYABLES YES
fue bueno mientras duro le falta mejorar mas sobre los personajes xd
The Moto really stands the people on voice chat are great In my experience so far
h1 GTFO to ekstremalna gra strzelanka w konwencji horroru w do przetrwania jest skradanie planowanie i z innymi graczami h1 Gra jest przeznaczona dla wyzwania i wymaga komunikacji graczami oraz planowania taktycznego w z czterema osobami W GTFO w czteroosobowej grupie jest kluczowa Gra z botami za graczami i u ich boku ale nic nie komunikacji ludzkimi graczami Przed gracze swoje odpowiednie i role w W grze jest i koordynacja wiele jest w stanie hibernacji i wybudzonych przez lub wibracje jedno z nich zostanie co tragicznie dla Gra oferuje wiele w gracze i zasoby im w tuneli misja po jest nowy nakaz pracy i gracze do kolejnej ekspedycji GTFO to gra dla wyzwania i koordynacji i w Czy graczom uda i czy musieli razem To od ich i
garbage
spooky but stealthy randoms should get good cause its annoying to play with people that suck at the game
SWAT but scary wayy more fun and just generally a good horror shooter
10
Work together or die together is the perfect description for the game definitely fun to play with friends
Can't play with my friends and I don't want to join your gay discord Make the game work
Very fun get friends if you think its bad
GTFO is like a horror movie but instead of shouting at the screen you get to shout at your friends while blasting your way through a nightmare dungeon It's like therapy but with more guns and less talking about your feelings

Really enjoying the game so far with friends Gritty and tough and requires teamwork to get through Graphics are amazing The game uses light darkness smoke fog and sound to make you feel very immersed Not just a run and gun requires you to be strategic in your play as ammo is limited sound and light awakens enemies and onslaughts are brutal Only through R1 rundown 1 out of 7 and each rundown has about 6-10 missions each 10/10 so far
Been playing since Rundown 1 back in 2019 and don't have any major complaints for the game It is a wonderful co-op survival horror shooter that punishes you if you have teamwork/communication skills I have just reached 1000 hours with the game and since they are bringing old rundowns back it has a lot of replay ability If you and your friends are getting into it now then playing each rundown in order is ideal since for the most part they get harder each rundown with new enemies and environments appearing in each run as you go through them in order Currently they just brought back R3 allowing you and your crew to play rundowns 1-3 and 7 4-6 will be re-released in the future with R8 being potentially their final rundown
It's hard It's fun If you like coop games that are genuinely difficult even for highly competent shooter players then you will enjoy the game If you are looking for a comfortable experience to relax or to play a casual left4dead esque game this is not it The game will punish you hurt you and make you suffer but it's the good kind of pain You will take multiple attempts to clear many levels You need at a minimum one other person to play the game with Ideally at least two If you're willing to engage with strangers the discord is extremely active for the purposes of finding a group
Hard as shit Fun as fuck
imagine you and the bois opening a door only to find it pitch black and when ur homie with the long range flashlight turns it on you see 3 big black men standing there praying to god they then start pulsating and having as stroke in other words fuck yea its amazing
Count this among Deep Rock Galactic and Vermintide 2 for best games that are kinda like Left 4 Dead 2 but not actually
One sentence summary review If the parts where you weren't blasting monsters weren't so tedious and chore-like the game would be a-LOT better I would wait for it to go on sale for like 15 Longer review The coolest thing about the game is the build up For example 1 The Menu 2:The drop 3 The initial 30 minutes of playing Then you realize its an extremely repetitive and tedious and enemies are overall pretty boring and everything is messy when the fighting finally does happen I don't care if this is realistic I care if the damm game is actually fun There is also little to no ammo Apparently everyone likes this Why would you send a team down to accomplish something you benefit from without proper resources from the start If the game had cooler stealth mechanics and cooler melee combat I guess that would make it better but why not make the game more dynamically difficult and just have more ammo I don't know I like what they tried to do but ultimately it is pretty meh If there weren't so many better games out there I ultimately would think its more worthwile But lifes short yall lol
get out
It can be very difficult But the community is very very helpfull Coop is key Voice chat is the best way to do so But either way really fun
stay silent
When are you gonna add venting amongi
kinda spooky
oui boum boum des trucs bizarres allez pique
Playing this game is like trying to get a woman the more you try the harder it gets
this game makes me want to jump on the roof of a 30 story building 10/10
good
Goof fun
Amazingly challenging coop survival horror game with immersive ambience gritty gun-play tense stealth situations cool engaging lore to dig up and combat encounters that most of the time need you to be tight nit in cooperating with other players to survive Highly recommend for any Horror/Stealth game enthusiast or simply anyone wanting to get in to a responsive challenging shooter with stealth elements
its cool
bon et fun

This game is good but you really need 4 dedicated people to play it Also some of these levels and enemies are bullshit
Shhh sleepers dont provoke them
she forced me to play it
good
funy
Most entertaining way to die
Do not waste money on this game unless you have 3 other friends who want to commit 2 hours per level with you people will say there is matchmaking and discord but the reality is the people on discord are germans who will randomly leave without talking and matchmaking doesnt actually match you with anyone the bots cant get you through the game Each rundown is a collection of levels which get progressively harder following some kind of theme they are actually hard but in the sense that if your friend misses half a mag you might not have enough ammo to even finish the level an hour later earlier levels are much more lenient though Atmosphere is fantastic and sound design is cool the weapons and tools also feel good to use and the lore is presented in a way that makes it interesting and speculative Replay value is very minor levels are the same but with objectives moved around each time but this is more of a game with missions that you struggle through and then never play again because theres no need which is why the game dies a month or 2 after a new rundown is released Note the game is just about a year or so from being no longer updated i believe since the devs are adding back all previous rundowns for good they vehemently believed removing previous rundowns when a new one came out was an awesome idea but it was dumb regardless there will be plenty of content to make it worth it assuming you have friends to play with but if you REALLY want to get in and play with randoms from the discord this is likely the last year for it
E um jogo recomendo
Play it dont try to not do it it is fucking incredible
Great option if you and your friends want to put your friendship to the test A ton of fun for anyone wanting a challenge but cant recommend to anyone who doesn't have anyone to play with

the gameplay is all that matters
Most fun I had in a co-op game in years
Play this with 3 other friends and you'll know which of you is mentally challenged Spoiler it's probably all of you

the devs said it best in their own end of the year message for 2022 they have a 13 success rate on any single match succeeding on any given run meaning your going to waste 87 attempts out of 100 due to any number of reasons a less than 50 success rate of the TUTORIAL LEVEL of which the devs are proud of in the comment section to this game on the 2022 end of the year post you can find one dev stating they are happy that the rate is so low because no other game lets you do that the matchmaking is basically non existent the alternative that the devs give is to join their discord an off platform application so they can moderate without discretion which users have posted being banned from no reasons given so take that with a grain of salt lastly here we go about game play its very fun so fun in fact that this is one of the two reasons why people will back this game up so much slowly crawling your way through hordes of enemies and hacking your way at a problem with precision and timing with 3 others this makes you feel like a real specialist who is doing something that really no one else can now that's the thing almost no one actually can because the in game runs are so long that you or anyone else on your team WILL mess up and the ensuing gun fight will take most of your health and resources because you were caught out of position leaving you under prepared and unable to continue on with the rest of your mission one of the main contributing factors on why over 80 PERCENT of player runs fail lastly i give you one last piece of evidence on why or why not to buy this game GTFO won on December 22nd 2022 the steam award for BEST GAME YOU SUCK AT even players who love this game and say that there isnt anything wrong with it had to come out and vote for this because they know in their hearts that this game is so hard that even those few who know the intricate ins and outs of this game still truly suck at it now then if you still wanna buy it because you love the challenge then please go ahead as i said before the game itself is truly fun hence why i put almost 40 and soon to be over 40 hours into it
A bit pricey but if u find it on sale AND hav friends then It is worth every penny
It's really fun with friends and the amount of challenges it provides is just perfect
I was three and a half hours into a raid on my fourth attempt before learning the enemies at the end were invisible and neither I nor my partner had brought the gear to deal with invisible enemies Truly gut wrenching 10/10 you really FEEL like your're a prisoner trapped in hell
A well balanced game
Get The Fuck Off
nice game best
Don't get me wrong the game is fun but Considering the price and amount of content they could at least make working matchmaking system and fix game breaking gliches that exist for years now Yet they prefer to put all thier efforts into discord server and that's the only way to play the game You don't want to use discord well that's to bad You got banned by trigger happy mod for not being not super friendly and stuff too bad You want to appeal go diddle ursellf cuz it's not a forum with appeal system And I can't post this on thier discord or they would probably ban me for not being positive about the game and I still want to play it online Amout of content for the game is good considering the slow pacing the gameplay is solid even tho every so often you will be locked out of finishing a mission bc of bug that persists for long ass time But considering broken matchmaking and price being just too high I can only recommend this game at 50 up till now it goes for 30 at most Inflation is high and rising and game's not getting better

Wenn du Freunde und Interesse an einem schwierigerem Taktik-Shooter hast kann ich GTFO absolut empfehlen
fuki
Es un excelente juego para jugar con amigos se disfruta bastante muy el grado de dificultad es muy alto lo que hace que sea entretenido hay que ser bien estratega ya que el loot es bajo y muy random a veces y por un lo que eso te a saber gastar la y el totalmente recomendado
this game scare the living fuck while playing solo but it the best horror/mulitiplayer game
Love this game and play all the time You can run solo with bots but would highly recommend using a team of friends
Really fun and intense really hard to find friends who actually have the game
Lots of monsters here Lots of monsters here Lots of monsters here Lots of monsters here Lots of monsters here Lots of monsters here Lots of monsters here Lots of monsters here Lots of monsters here Lots of monsters here Lots of monsters here
And I need a friend oho I need a friend To make me happy I stand here on my own

juego klo estresante
Opened the door touched spaghetti set off a Alarm went off And died 10/10 Very hard game
Muy buen juego para jugar CON AMIGOS Es un juego de NOTABLE DIFICULTAD por lo que es recomendable jugar con premade de 4 la y paciencia son claves en este juego algo que los bots no cubren y jugar con randoms seguramente tampoco si tienes un grupo de amigos que quiera jugar a un juego y de es muy buena compra Si por lo contrario lo vas a jugar solo no es nada recomendable por lo que he es un juego con pocos jugadores dificultando el matchmaking y los bots no son viables para ciertos niveles
QUECK QUECK QUECK QUECK QUECK Gracias a eso ahora tengo pesadillas

Such a great game to play with friends it can be very tense when you are experiencing something new for the first time but will always be fun Even if you don't have a full lobby to play with their discord server is super active and has tons of experienced and friendly users
great with friends
My biggest complaint so far is that you can only play very slow and methodically which becomes very repetitive after a few hours Writing this review is tough although I really do enjoy GTFO it's hard to recommend due to the difficulty of the game as well as the clunky AI for the bots And lack of hand holding or it being lore light It does remind of marauders and other diesel punk games even hints of doom 3 and killing floor The monsters are very much like clickers of the last of us games when it comes to stealth they can only detect movement/Light Slow paced and repetitive until the actual combat scenes I do not love it But i do like it it did take me 6 times to do rundown 1 like 3 hours,We had repeat it until we new the map well I kinda wish it was less down to luck map memory and battle location/stage events and more down to skill Your always 3-4 hits away from death Meaning you play very slow and carefully As its not forgiving Sometimes you face small Hordes Cool concept But fails in several methods of execution tbch The game out of EA but i feel like it needs some polishing and balancing still and still needs fleshing out more
Bello carico ma portatevi gli amici appresso ahaha
We need Rundown 8
Writing this review is tough although I really do enjoy GTFO it's hard to recommend due to the difficulty of the game as well as the clunky AI for the bots At a 40 price point it almost requires you have a full team of 4 of people you know to complete any campaign mission Although every mission is do-able on your own or with a friend it heavily requires a full lobby of decently skilled players to make it through the hordes and the increased difficulty new levels bring Don't get me wrong it's extremely fun and thrilling but if you make a game that requires a full team of players 40 isn't a fair price point If it was closer to 20 I believe it would be much more worth the money
Slow paced and repetitive Missions take ages and offer very little difference to each other for the most part Cosmetic loot is entirely random so had booty shorts on my character for the first 10 hours of play I appreciate what they were going for but in practice I don't find myself having fun when playing this game
Left 4 dead but modern and way better basically
Chambers
Intense horrifying teamwork is the entire game and overall an amazing game Should buy it if ur boys have it it's better with friends P.S Just GTFO discord is a good place to play with others
Deze game is echt helemaal iets anders De sfeer is soms te snijden waarbij je soms je vrienden uitscheld als ze een misstap doen Als je gewoon wilt doorlopen en knallen,is deze game niks voor jouw Maar hier is het echt plannen vooruitgaan stapvoets and BIMS hammertime Onze favoriet van mij en mijn bro alsinds

A great way to practice popping hemorrhoids and it's better with friends It's always tense too just like m
God
Very immersive and you can type in the panel in game That is a plus
good
Boring Multiplayer matchmaking does work
As far as I love design of this game I have to say that It's unplayable for solo player with bots even with friend we got overwhelmed without a party of 4 players It's impossible to finish even the first map
nagyon sok stressz nagyon sok ami minden percet
A great game a real challenge for those who seek one The different maps are all great with their own mechanics and before the full release the rundowns were removed each time a new one was added which removed them permanently but the devs decided to reintroduce them while making sure they are up to their standards which is great The gameplay is a great mix of stealth combat intel gathering Terminals my beloved and decision making with little room for error so be ready to die and retry The maps layout won't change but the enemies and loot spawns will However I cannot stress this enough multiplayer is almost mandatory Yes there are bots but their decision making is binary Either they fully commit to one thing or ignore it You being downed will make them all want to revive you often to their demise they are great with Bio-scanners tho My advice is to play with at least 2 other people 4 is optimal but 3 can still do the trick Being with only one other player might work at the beginning but it might not be enough later Overall I highly recommand this game the gameplay is very unique compared to other games that are made to be hard and will make you feel like the universe is against you but with a good fighting chance
Extremely fun just make sure you have friends
This is the best cooperative extraction shooter on the market There's not a whole lot of competition but this is the best one available However you will absolutely need to bring friends Once they finish making all the old rundowns available and release rundown 8 this will easily have 1-200 hours of content Missions usually take between 20 minutes and 2 hours depending on your playstyle and level of experience and the publicly released player success rates on the difficult missions are very low Playtime at time of review only includes 18 successfully completed missions If you find a group willing to stick with it it's great value for money and you won't find anything else like it
This game is utterly terrifying My life has drastically changed since playing this game for context my wife works very long hours and im unemployed My wife works as a nurse and often works 12-16 hour shifts im a stay at home dad that is addicted to video games my job is to tend to the children but sometimes i get distracted by gaming and the kids poo their pants my wife came home to find the house covered in poo and was furious she told me its the last straw that something had to change well that night i got out of bed and got on my computer which is located in my infant sons room around 3 am and started playing GTFO almost immediately i got startled by one of the monsters and screamed loud enough to wake the neighbors the kid woke up crying and my ex wife was pissed now im playing rainbow six siege in the local library and sleeping in the mall bathroom don't recommend
Although I have not finished the Rundowns I had never planned to write a review until recently The original idea that a Rundown which in short is a collection of the missions would rotate after a few months and the previous Rundown would be deleted This system was meant to be iconic but unfortunately for me it meant that I did not have the time to complete them with my friends Life meant we could not pick it up everyday I was disappointed that I could not finish the first then when we tried to complete the second it switched to the third Finally I put this game down and we took a break Finally after all this time they decided to release all of the Rundowns which has made this game fun again We can redo the first missions we missed and can experience the story without having to research it post-Rundown In terms of the gameplay it is fairly stock standard for a FPS which does not mean that it is derivative It is quite challenging even for half decent players but still very much enjoyable So I recommend this now because any newcomers can actually experience the game and the story without being 7 Rundowns in To any who complain that the team has changed their original tenants I cannot agree that the devs have ruined their game I think that it has gone on for a long time getting rid of old Rundowns and now as they prepare for new boundaries in the game they want to open this up for everyone and not just the elitists of old And I could not be happier for this decision So please buy this when you can if you enjoy stealth tactical shooters with Co-op I would have recommended it during Early Access back when it was just the first Rundown but now I do so to encourage this game and community to continue growing
its really cool
I don't think i would consider playing this game without a full 4 stack of homies but when you do have that this is genuinely one of the best if not THE BEST co-op experience you can get They are constantly adding awesome stuff to this game and the high-stress challenge offered by every mission is just amazing Levels that sometimes feel impossible in your first runs turn into super satisfying wins after you iterate your approach a few times This game demands real-time communication to succeed which just fully adds to the immersion With all that said if you are buying this game to get a specific experience like L4D or something along those lines you could very easily end up disappointed This game hinges on planning ahead conserving resources and NOT SETTING OFF EVERY ROOM YOU GO INTO The game demands patience timing and communication that can often cost you long runs if you don't perform on these aspects There are certain elements of difficulty in this game that shamelessly tread into NOT FUN AT ALL territory also They have actually stopped implementing things like invisible enemies in main missions as a result of basically no one liking them at all Missions that introduce you to infectious fog are sometimes just not even worth playing as you'll spend so much time getting infected and with 0 visibility that you feel completely out of control of your experience in game Ultimately the game is at it's best in the B level missions as far as difficulty goes especially once you have a handle of the game C level missions at times can be even better however many of them have these viciously unfun elements multiple check points that often break the game and make you waste time and surprise challenges that quickly end a 3 hour run on a mission Having long multiple hour raid missions without the ability to reload at a checkpoint after taking a break creates a horribly inaccessible experience for a lot of people at the higher difficulties I have almost 80 hours in this game and have a pretty good understanding of most of its elements yet the idea of trying a D or E level mission just feels like a waste of time This game is extremely fun and ruthless there is more than enough content to enjoy through the lower level missions Easy to get your moneys worth out of this game Super strange that I have played this game for this many hours and a ton of different enemies and content are in missions that don't even sound fun to try lol but this all seems to be by design and certainly works with some crowds
Fun heavily reliant on good teamwork Only down side is that so far the post-game rewards are lack luster no upgrade paths for weapons feels like it could use some more depth in terms of weapon attachments
VERY FUN but very tough Even with two AIs and two players it can still get infuriating Overall the levels and the gameplay is very fun and well thought out I'm glad they decided to include all the old rundowns as well as new ones I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves coop survival horror games

nothing like it
GTFO is a cleverly-designed 4-player co-op FPS with the typical go loud or stay stealth pattern of gameplay yet instead of being required to stealth or the mission would outright fail the stealth element is spontaneously up held by the players themselves as ammo and health are fairly limited that players won't be able to gun down every enemy meaning stealth in GTFO is not for skipping fight and cutting the playthrough short but for saving unnecessary expenditure of resources meant for the actual guns-blazing run-like-hell moments Trust me you are gonna need every health and ammo you could spare later into each expedition that's just how hot and out-of-hand the situation tend to become when the alarm is sounding and the enemies are swarming The enemies in GTFO will prove themselves challenging to tackle Not only they are quite dodgy they do not stand still their attacks are not easy to evade too They can perform melee from a greater distance than your shove/bash and their range attacks have a slight homing property so it can't be dodged with simple side-stepping you'll need to change direction when the projectile is just about to hit you GTFO is grim harsh sweaty It's not your typical horde-game where players are merely required to fight at each other's side and shoot at everything that moves They will have to carefully decide their loadout play their part properly coordinate with each other and most importantly Be patient and take it slow because screw-ups are likely to cost valuable resources The pace of GTFO is probably the most unique aspect of its experience albeit it can be deemed too time-consuming and not inherently exciting but the stress that slowly builds up is indeed heart-racing and deeply rewarding for you would have come to realize that how much it takes to succeed or just how easily it could have failed If anything else the system and QoL isn't amazing but serviceable Bot AI can be idiotic just like many other games there is little to none appeal for casual players and you definitely want to delve into GTFO with 3 friends In sum I'd say GTFO is a 7.9/10 Work together or die together
Good game for good players D
I'm terrible at this game but I still have fun It's like uno in that way
600 people playing on daily basis Unless you have some pre-made group or discord server or whatever you will never be able to find a party to play with on matchmaking It's a nice game but it's basically dead right now
Un buen juego solo para jugar con amigos Es un juego pero satisfactorio Pase unas lindas tardes destruyendo cabezas a mujeres amorfas Super recomendado
scary
Fun only with other people but if you do have people to play with shit is gas
very yes
Scary naked men 10/10 Spooky

We finally completed the first mission
Game isn't working after one of the recent updates it's just stuck on the loading screen and after a while of waiting it says Internet connection error
This is the most fun video game you will be absolute ass at
This game is all about making your friends feel miserable for four hours straight
This game is schizophrenic deep rock galactic so if that's up your alley go bonkers
definitely need 3 friends which can be tricky good coop tho
Jogo excelente uma pena que o machmaking deixa a desejar pra jogar com o pessoal do discord
This game is piss easy don't listen to everyone else
El juego esta bastante bueno lamentablemente es iniciar una partida con humanos porque el emparejamiento tarda siglos
SHIT GAME don't buy this SHIT
Good game waste my times waste my friends
cool
Albanian Simulator 2023 really makes me feel like an Albanian going to get milk from the store and having to fight off sleepers Albanian Citizens from mauling me to death Would recommend
This is a hard game to recommend but it's not a bad game The biggest strength and weakness is the punishing difficulty which can only be reliably overcome as a group through brute force memorization and repetition Intense concentration cooperation and overwhelming patience are required There is a helpful community on discord which you'll need if you don't have a crew as this can't really be played alone but most of them seem to be people who enjoy a kind of cheerful masochism about the learning curve As long as you're willing to study the game memorize the maps and scenarios and spend countless hours practicing it it is playable but that's more an indictment than an endorsement
Juegazo muy los niveles mas complicados son prueba y error muriendo partida tras partida volviendo a hacer todo de nuevo pero cuando ganas ufff la es exquisita Solo somos 2 jugando y los otros 2 son bots pero si juegan de a 4 se les hace mucho mas aun los bots son al momento de disparar
God i fucking love this game
Very stressful good game

This game is mid smh
good but levels get long and most fun when played with friends
Yes
Let me start off by saying that I thoroughly enjoy this game it provide a very niche scratch to the horror stealth genre however As it currently stands modders can currently script mobs into the game I am not aware of this games security features but if this is anything similar to an exploit found in Dark Souls a little under a year ago it is only a matter of time before a massive security breach is uncovered For your own safety I cannot recommend anyone play this game in the discord server endorsed by the creators Play with friends or don't be surprised if you're patient zero for a serious breach
Gameplay 9/10 The actual content of the game is really fun I still haven't found a weapon combination that I'm truly in love with and that's probably my biggest complaint about the game There's a mission in R7E1 feels a little gimmicky as well Audio 5/5 If you have a section you're stuck on and keep dying it's quite frustrating to keep hearing the same character audio over and over Also a lot of the talking gets loud and it's difficult to clear rooms when you can't hear any of the enemies I'd recommend turning off the dialog options It made the experience significantly better The ambient music and enemy noises are also very well done Atmosphere 5/5 Turn the lights off in your room only play at night and have really good headphones in One of my close friends started screaming like a little the first time we met a new enemy Time Played vs Money Spent 9/10 There's a decent amount of content but replaying it isn't really worthwhile I've nearly beaten the first rundown and we just started on the 7th When I buy a game I try to go for 1 for 1 hour I've already passed that number by quite a bit and I'm just now starting to get a little bored of the game mostly because my group keeps throwing bodies at a mission instead of playing literally any of the other ones Content Releases N/A 10 I haven't been playing the game for that long so I can't speak much on this I did read somewhere that the end of the game is coming though so we'll see how much gets added Either way this is tied into my ability to get a good return on the purchase so I'm not too concerned Other Factors The content is pretty hard as you get further in The learning curve is pretty smooth and if we had to replay any missions we used to struggle on I'm sure we'd easily beat them This might not be for everyone but I quite enjoy difficult games and it's been well worth the time My only other complaint is that you absolutely need 4 real people 3 plus yourself in comms for the later missions as the bots aren't the best What can you expect though Final Score 9/10 Would like to see some new weapons Really fun game though Make sure you have 3 other friends with similar schedules to you don't buy the game alone
The game tries to go for a realistic brutality that imo just isn't fun If you are into hardcore FPS like Ready or Not or competitive FPS like TC Rainbow Six Siege this game tries to one up them and misses that mark I've noticed a few reviews mention that there is no celebration in the game and I think I agree I didn't feel good going into each game nor did I feel a sense of relaxation when we reached the end Just more and more pissed off Sure you can tell me to get gud all you want but the reality is only the most hardcore of hardcore players will enjoy this game Think the kind of people that would like Tarkov or Dark and Darker but without starting equipment All in all I just can't recommend this game Between the sheer difficulty terrible AI teammates and the incredibly frustrating amount of bugs that I had encountered in only 6 hours this game is a hard pass for me
1 Start the game 2 Make a very offensive joke 3 OBJECTIVE SURVIVE GET THE FUCK OUT
If you like to hate yourself AND your friends Perfect game
Look I like a lot of aspects of the game The atmosphere and sound design is great The promise and level layout is pretty cool My problem is that its so just repetitive While the level design is good the visual aspect is not because a lot of it looks the same You always do the same thing You deal with the monsters the same way every time The guns lack a lot of impact and feel very strange to control The whole things has a great idea of coop survival horror but then it ruins it by making you do the same thing over and over again I also played the beta so I have more hours then it says
UPD
Success is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results
Please make VR

This game is ass if you have any less than 3 communicative teamates this game with 1,2 and 3 people is impossible This game is only to be played with your friends
Does exactly what it says it does Atmosphere great Weapons great Maps great Play with friends if possible
runs like ass and the sw*dish devs are such whiny cunts they tried to sue people over creating mods why are all sw*dish developers like this
Super fun to play especially with friends
eef
currently the best co-op game for me is very hard every mistake punishes the whole team but completing a rundown with friends gives you the full satisfaction that a player can have 100 action and adrenaline that's what this game gives you I highly recommend it to play it with your friends
great game hindered by a terrible matchmaking system that takes literally forever longest waited was half an hour not sure if its the system or if theres no one playing recommended only if u hav enough friends that enjoy torture as much as you do

This is a very fun and rewarding game If you're a fan of team work aliens steep learning curve and mastery this is an amazing game The player base of this game is generally a bit older 18 which was a big plus for me It's a very unforgiving game making it very rewarding when you get through a level I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of tactical shooters stealth and teamwork
absolutely not worth the time it frames itself as a super hard game and it is but not for any good pride point of the devs levels are scaled to such a degree that beyond level two requires absolute perfect runs and no rng fuck ups and has virtually nothing to do with actual skill whatsoever allied ai is uncooperative poorly set up and despite having a whole list of commands only about two do anything or matter enemy ai is janky as hell have no consistency whatsoever and just super buggy enemies can and will be triggered for no reason and when that does inevitably happens will lead to the last hour and a half spent in a single expedition being totally fucked tl;dr dont buy unless you have three other friends with more patience than god or youve been trying to find a good reason for them to hate you and never want to hang out again
Roll up with the boys and I have a massive brown stain on my shorts Just like real life
I LOVE THIS GAME
Left 4 Dead but it hates you pretty cool
i nutted
eeeeeeeeeeeeee
When I don't play aggressively I'M SCARED
great game if you want to smash your keyboard an maybe monitor
Scary
gtfo goes so hard It's not hard to run and it has insane atmosphere Like the moment you startup the game you're in the matrix It's crazy also kinda hard
I don't have friends to play with
Did not GTFO Will try again
Get Three Friends OK
challenging and spoopy
run and hide its like Dr suess night terror
ulta bof
This game is a sleeper Frickin rocks
pls add sex
The computer feature is honestly cancer and such an annoyance to deal with
This game made me ruin my friendships And I also wanna die
play if you or your teammates have no strategy skills or patience XD great game
Awesome cinematic stealth cooparative game Probably you won't like it from first game sessions i tried it in 2020 when it was Beta because another pro players did all tasks and objectives without you but when you learn how to play recommend to play 1-2 times with bots you will love it This is the rare game where the atmosphere not broke if you play coop with friends 90 of game time is stealth in sielence and darkness GTFO is a bit like Alien Swarm 3rd person shooter of Valve But it's a 1st person shooter and more cinematic atmospheric
3-4
Great game and is one of the best games ever made with Unity The game is well paced and delivers exactly what you sign up for Though it gets even better when played with friends
👍

Game's 10/10 and would happily shit my pants again while getting chased by the local crackhead down by the KFC

yaaaniii
Best FPS game i've played in awhile
Play an hour to 3 hours of red light green light with the occasional attempt to reset your progress in-between There is no respect for the player's time and putting a checkpoint at the hour and 30 min mark of a mission doesn't make it better
Unforgiving game in all the right ways
This game is just love
5-7
fun but very hard
it sucks
10/10
nice
yes
buen shooter de supervivencia lastima que la comunidad no le de mas gancho a este juegazo tengo que jugar con latinos a horas de la madrugada en EU y la verdad que a los chilenos ni los entiendo
review
This game sells itself as extremely hard but doesn't give you the mechanics to properly survive There is no cover system and the dollar store flashlights you attach to your weapon can't light 2 meters in front of you You have critically limited ammo so every shot needs to be a kill but enemies jerk and jump around unpredictably You need a team of 4 to survive as there are too many enemies for any one person to kill just based on raw damage output but bots are not useful and enemies have unavoidable medium close range attacks You have to shoot enemies before you can even seen them
It is not like LFD2 at all Very strategic game sometimes

too many bug
My day be so fine Then boom scout
its hard as f u c k buuuuuut its fun as hell
its cool
Super intense but really fun
The atmosphere and aesthetics are really cool and creepy The game play is quite interesting combining both elements of stealth and shooters All around very fun but demands quite a commitment as the rounds can last multiple hours The recently added apparel feature allows you to customize the prisoners clothing and is really well done The load out customization is very diverse and allows each player to play to their liking though some guns/equipment are better than others
like siege and l4d2 had a child
A very difficult game with a really unique atmosphere and fantastic gameplay It definetly is one of my favorite games in a long time
In the rabbit hole we go
Super jeu en coop avec une ambiance vraiment prenante Peut se jouer en solo mais surtout fun en coop pour l'essentiel des interactions par le gampeplay
its a very fun shooter game Me and my friends prefer to play it with only friends because its just more fun
best game i suck at
the game is really great and its fun to play however the bots are pretty terrible they don't want the game playing itself and matchmaking is hit or miss the missions are long and thrilling but without friends or other people to play with its nearly impossible to complete missions if you are the type of person that's willing to LFG with the official discord or if you have friends who own the game then i highly recommend it
GTFO Get Three Friends
it is made so well
Quite fun with friends Get ready to die though
sLEEPERS.DONT WAKE THEM UPPPPP
b]The games alright.[/b At first the game was reasonably decent pretty good graphics reasonably decent Gameplay then I started to see how much game this game had not my in my opinion but thats me the whole repeatability of the game is mostly stealth which I do like but you notice really quick there is a pattern of sorts that you can follow with not much thinking needed its a Kinda easy game haha in the sense that you do the same thing every time not in the fun sense and the enemy's are pretty easy to deal with and not in the easy fun way either doesn't give much of a challenge at least for the 10 hours I played and at the time the servers where pretty dead in my region only level 1 had most players as it was the free play days Weekend I also later found out a good amount of the game is time limited I didnt fact check this as I didnt care enough to check At its price this game is not worth it for me at 39.99 USD even when its been on sale 20 off at 27.99 USD it just still doesnt seem worth it for me for what this game is and offers but thats just my thoughts on the price h1]Overall[/h1 b]I don't recommend[/b it if you want more of a challenge and want more game with your game h1]Other wise[/h1 b]I recommend[/b it if you are looking more of an easy relaxed game
help
they didnt have to give sleepers that much cake but they did anyways thanks devs for making me irrationally horny while im getting my ass kicked by otherworldly tentacle and vore creatures 10/10

Me and a friend bought this came because we are into coop horror I was a bit sceptical I've played rainbow six extraction and thought this would be similarand hopefully better Boy were we wrong What we got was a pretty unbalanced bare bones game that needs a shit ton of work and is barely enjoyable at all No player progression or actual incentive to even get through the levels besides a few shitty cosmetics and boosters that barely make a difference The game just isn't fun and I played about 3 rundowns fitting name because that's all the made me feel like Thats all I could handle I probably won't come back to this terrible game as it just made me angry and wish I and wanting a refund Oh by the way bots sre completely useless and match making is terrible and the game is dead so you don't really get game unless a friend owns Me and a friend bought to play and it just sucked hard-core ass Summary is don't buy this It feels like it should still be early access and needs a shit ton of work before its playable let alone enjoyable
Ok just let me sneak past him so i can kill the guy next to him alright but be careful DON'T MOVE OK WHO THE FUCK MOVED sounds of sleepers waking up For f*cks sake guys I thought you were in position well yea I was but i wasn't ready Quit talking and keep shooting And that's bascially 90 of my experience with my friends in a discord call of this game 10/10 would recommend if you wanna test your friendship xd
molto bello
Es Brutal Muy Hardcore y mucho Coop

this game is insane

I love testing friendly fire
CARA QUE JOGO INCRIVEL DEMAIS PARA OS DEVS NAS LEGENDAS E TODA HUD DO JOGO ELE MT TOPPER
painfully hard the smallest mistakes can ruin a run i like the cosmetics
Imma be honest the game is great the gunplay feels amazing but if you don't have friends to play with don't even bother buyin it the devs are a bit delusional i agree that game development needs founds to stay on the rails but jumping from 20 to 40 dollars is a shame expecially with the little the game has to offer.the game have around 500 players daily dead matchmaking doesn't really work so you are forced to join in the discord and look for a team there if you don't have one this game has so much potential but i can't see it as a long term title since the gameplay loop is basically join mission find door find key find resources,shoot open door complete objective extraction thats all.tbh games like this should really do something like lowering the price 1st of all events where the game is free for a couple of days just to attract new players and other things like that 5/10 game is unpolished af 8/10 for the guns and gunplay 2/10 no one to play with 6/10 movement is a bit clunky 4/10 for mission variety 9/10 athmosphere 2/10 nothing to win at the end of a 2 hour rundown except the victory screen
Pretty awesome game to play if u have friends to play with however its matchmaking system takes wayy too much time and useless if ur teammates dont have a mic.other than that its awesome
Good intense Game
It has it bugs but the gameplay is enough to keep you playing
Dude its legit fortnite but with zombies like save the world like black ops 3 it reminds me of minecraft
I don't hate this game it gets so much right That said the gameplay gets really repetitive since being super stealthy always seems the way to go It's pretty punishing to ever try to do anything else That's not itself bad but that's pretty much all the game is When I initially bought this years ago I was hoping for an Aliens like sci fy horror shooter but that's really not how this game works so if that's what you were looking like I was it's not for you
The game that acts as litmus for your idiot friends
si
Bastante rico y sabroso el juego Menos por las con tentaculos que gritan
Fantastic game Good challenge Wish my friends would play it
Hammer goes BRRRRR
Great if you have a good coordinated group to play with It does create quite a few hilarious moments when something goes wrong which can heighten the experience Only a couple of minor problems with bugs in certain levels and rundowns being phased out of rotation Other than that would definitely recommend to those seeking a challenging game

playing solo because could not find anyone online lol
The game is heavily stealth-based teamwork based objective based and very atmospheric a hardcore game with an excellent co-op If you play this game successfully with your friends then after that other co-op games will be a joke for you It's 9.5/10 for me gl
its a beautiful game just force your firends into buying it and have fun dying together its basically the best stealth game ever
Una cosa que me por tocar demasiado las pelotas y por lo que le doy negativo al juego es que estuve a punto de completar el primer nivel estando solo con bots de hora y media buscando por el mapa entero resistiendo oleadas y poniendo a prueba mi paciencia a niveles insalubres y justo cuando finalmente cumplir el objetivo principal y planificaba salir c4g4ndo leches de una alarma de de la nada y entonces una de bichos hasta por debajo de las malditas piedras Esto parece un trolleo asqueroso por parte de los desarrolladores que una de juego bien pensada porque vamos disparar en este juego no es como en Carlos Duty es apuntar bien los recursos escasean demasiado y son totalmente random los botiquines curan muy poco tan 1/5 de tu salud total si fuera un 1/4 te lo paso pero 1/5 es demasiado y el que te hacen los deformes de no es precisamente poco de que los enemigos son muy y resisten como si fueran minibosses incluso si haces puro headshot Y un headshot en GTFO es toda una En serio una hora y media haciendo el nivel y justo cuando estoy a un pelo de rana calva de lograrlo huevos Considerando todos los contras que te ponen de entrada esto parece bien una injusticia No la experiencia en multijugador y probablemente nunca lo sepa el emparejamiento bien muerto como 20 minutos esperando a que se conecte alguien y nada y por lo que he investigado en internet encontrar jugadores es toda una odisea INCLUSO en el Discord oficial del juego hay como 70,000 conectados de media pero STEAM Charts jugadores conectados a GTFO los hay menos de 500 y esto no puede ser buena A los pocos amigos que tengo no les interesa tocar GTFO ni con un palo Supongo que al final son 18 euros tirados a la basura.creo La verdad todo esto es una pena GTFO es un juego con potencial me desde el momento que vi sus trailers cuenta con una de las premisas interesantes que he visto en juego alguno y la jugabilidad es en extremo inmersivo a no poder pero o necesitas de 3 factores clave si quieres jugarlo con propiedad y sacarle provecho 1.-Ser un ninja 2 Saber apuntar como si fueras el put0 Chris Kyle 3 Ser un monje budista osea tener MUCHA paciencia 4 Tener amigos con quienes jugar Porque puedes jugar con bots pero la experiencia a fuerzas pensada para 4 jugadores los bots no bien programados cuando entras a una y quieres acercarte al panel para cerrar la puerta casi siempre uno de los bots o peor a veces todos te siguen de y terminan atrapados del otro lado justo al cerrarla En algunos casos la puedes cerrar a tiempo pero los bots traspasan la puerta como si no hubiese nada enfrente y terminan del otro lado igual Por lo que me he informado los desarrolladores tienen medio abandonado el juego ha habido ciertos problemas entre los mismos y la comunidad y ciertamente eso tampoco ayuda en nada Menuda pena como no hagan nada para solucionar lo que no funciona este juego tiene los muy contados mis miserables 18 euros
i like the game its cool and all but it gets boring very fast by yourself or randoms this game has a harsh 1 way to play event it never changes and it always the same no matter what this game is a friends only game if you dont have friends to enjoy company with you will just get so depressed and bored since the game lacks so many things to make it more gripping the games emersion was so cool for me but then i sunk my teech harder and realize how boring and repetitive it is it lacks flavor and variety once you get the hang of it its rng and then you just rush the game to a brick wall that you need a good team to help you beat the rest of it its just a game you play for 7 hours or less and never tauch again tbh shame

only Chuck Norris play this game alone
i spent 1.5 hours on a single level was extremely close to finishing it and my friend allerted 3 scouts that killed the entire team would recommend
There is something truly special about this game the atmosphere is immaculate the sound design is incredible and the core game is fundamentally satisfying It is an extremely fun game to play so why don't I recommend it simple it barely functions on good days the level design can be a bit uninspired and there are a ton of game breaking exploits that trivialise the entire game some levels such as rundown 7's D1 overload objective dont even function and will have downright mindbogglingly bizarre effects on enemy spawning unless everybody leaves the lobby and joins back before The semi recently added checkpoint system brought with it a literal mountain of run ending bugs every time a checkpoint is loaded the level will often continuously become more and more unstable doors will be completely invisible enemies from error alarms will just stop spawning and worst of all if anybody was even thinking about holding one of the large carry able items during the checkpoint scan there is a chance that they will find themselves completely unable to drop said item completely preventing them from playing the game killing the player or having them leave and rejoin does not work sometimes certain alarm sounds will just be permanently playing in the background before they are even activated timers sometimes wont appear fog wont be in the right place for some players which will either trivialize a level completely blind the players or make them unavoidably get infected This next one isnt a checkpoint bug but during an r7 E1 attempt the game randomly decided to teleport everybody back to the beginning of the level right as we were about to win without any explination one of the newly released enemies from rundown 7 which I will not be describing too much for spoiler reasons also has a plethora of issues such as bugging out and leaving a certain screen effect on a player's screen completely blinding them or just straight up teleporting players to the shadow realm where they once again must leave the match and cannot rejoin or be recovered the game also has various issues regarding it's environment collision What is absolutely baffling is that the problems include downright nonsensical hitboxes that allow for players to easily cheese the absolute shit out of certain level challenges as well as overbearing hitboxes that are seemingly meant to prevent cheesing in the most bizzare spots that tend to impede on general movement oftentimes players can get stuck on invisible barriers trying to walk up stairs or just not be able to walk into a completely empty corner yet somehow for some reason there will be collision programmed onto some random pipe that is 20 meters into the air allowing for players to jump onto said pipe and trivialise entire sections of levels other items that allow for this kind of cheesing include scaffolding rooftops of small indoor structures construction equipment solar panels actual fucking cliff faces giant black crystals railings shelves rocks pipes suspended wires sever boxes tubes random concrete blocks random canisters which not only can you stand on but you can also fall in between the tubes on this single setpiece which softlocks you as the game just puts you back there when you try to rejoin the match and many many more things this naturally leads me to my next criticism how easy it is to exploit the enemies despite the fact that this is supposed to be a 4 player multiplayer co-op game practically every single one of the levels ever released has been beaten by a solo player No this isn't because the developers are bad at balancing things there is reasonably no way that a solo player can actually hold off the waves of enemies on their own this game's enemies are fantastic at being intimidating at first glance even the basic enemy feels reasonably tanky without using certain guns which tend to be quite ammo inefficient they arent unreasonably unkillable however they are just durable enough to make your weapons feel just a little bit weak against them which makes a scenario where you wake up an entire room of them or have a hoard barging through a door during an alarm quite terrifying in a way that most base enemies in most games never tend to be capable of doing there isnt really any cannon fodder in this game which is absolutely fantastic starting out for a single person 7 or 8 basic enemies can feel genuinely overwhelming meaning you have to really think about positioning and strategy when you have to deal with a hoard of like 30 is what I would say if it weren't so easy to cheese these things outside of a few exceptions most enemies are slower than the player's running speed meaning you can outrun them quite easily combining this with closing doors behind you it is quite easy to make some serious distance between you and the enemies allowing you to run them on a wild goose chase around the level so you can run back to the scans for whatever alarm you are doing to slowly complete it bit by bit and this is even after the stamina system was introduced thanks to the various cheese spots that were previously mentioned with this tactic in mind the enemies become a bit of a joke in most circumstances that the game throws at you and even if you arent soloing a level if your whole team goes down except for you you can simply run around the level for a while to buy yourself time to revive your teammates which not only removes tension and punishment for playing sloppily but it is also just really really boring This is also not even counting the door glitch which still has not been completely removed despite the devs claiming that they removed it Which if you dont know basically lobotomies the enemies and permanently traps them behind air I also cannot go without mentioning the infamous sniper melee bug caused by desync between server hosts and clients which leads to very unfair seeming instances of damage being taken from what feels like way too far away which despite according to the modding community and the plugin that has been made to fix sniper melee is an extremely easy fix yet the developers still have not fixed it I love this game I really do however I cannot recommend it to new players because of how miserable it can be like 80 of the time there are those moments when this game really shines and everythig comes together and sadly nothing else comes close to it but as somebody who is working on making their own modded rundown this game is held together by paperclips

p good ig
GTFO is hard
This game has REALLY interesting mechanics and great atmosphere but it absolutely does NOT hold your hand The tutorial makes it sound seem like the game will alert you when an alarm is going to go off so you can prepare At the end of our first mission we suddenly hear alarms and have to hoof it back to the beginning Of course we got cornered because we didn't know this was a thing and that's 3 hours down the tube It's built for 4 people and even though you get access to bots they are.less than great Neither of them used their specials at all I can see it being good if you've got a tight group of 4 people MAYBE 3.maybe but 2 or fewer is a no go

Un jeu il vous faudra faire attention tout et vous entourer de vos meilleur(e)s mates pour mener bien vos missions Le principe de descendre de plus en plus en profondeur au fur et mesure que vous progressez dans vos mission est pas mal et on sent bien la qui augmente chaque niveau de profondeur Le jeu rend les classes disponibles et permet de trouver avec laquelle vous vous sentez le/la plus l'aise et le/la plus utile Le skill de chacun(e permettra de mener bien la mission Jeu mais reste d'une grande et je pense aux joueurs et joueuses casu que n'ont pas vraiment l'habitude de jeux comme ceux-ci qui risque dur prendre en main
You need some friends and a strong mental to have a good time with this game To be honest I have a weak mental and no friends but the game is still good
absoloutey fantastic game if you have friends and like to suffer with them
ist zwar bock schwer aber macht mega fun im Team
What I love about this game is using the old DOS commands at the terminal to plan out routes or locate items I have played this with other folks and with the bots and managed to clear some of the Rundowns This is not a run and gun game you really need to plan how to handle alarms take out enemies setup a good defense and anticipate what direction and thru what doors the enemy is gonna come I highly recommend this game solo or with friends

Eu sou um pai de 48 anos provavelmente uma das pessoas mais velhas a jogar esse jogo Sou pai solteiro criando meu filho que agora com 16 anos Meu filho sempre quis se sentir dentro de um filme de terror sentir o medo e a dos personagens algo que filmes de terror nos proporcionavam e pediu para que eu comprasse esse jogo a ele Ele vivia no quarto isolado ou com seus amigos Pensei que pudesse ser uma boa oportunidade para passar um tempo com meu filho e decidi criar uma conta na plataforma Steam e instalar o jogo em meu computador mas pedi para que ele me ensinasse a juntos aprendemos os movimentos iniciais e nos surpreendemos o imersivo um jogo pode ser Foram dias com bastante jogando a noite podemos esquecer a dor da perda de minha esposa naqueles instantes Mesmo sendo meio ruim e conseguindo jogar com tanta facilidade quanto meu filho adorei poder passar esse tempo com ele e criar muitas Me dei conta que todas as coisas podem nos proporcionar momentos felizes Recomendo

As someone who has beaten RLCraft several times without xp farms or anything this game was absolutely magical to me I love games that are challenging but fair but this hits that exact spot Mistakes are your fault or because you haven't learned how to handle something yet but the game does such a good job at teaching you that the second instance nearly never happens aside from stupidity There's nothing quite like the drop sequence and I can't get over the voice of Please Step Into The Bioscan it hits me just right
Things scream at me sometimes teammates sometimes eldritch abominations from deep within the crust They get shot all the same
is good

This game is surprisingly difficult and challenging but in a way that pushes you to want to succeed rather than to just let it fall by the wayside If you want a FPS with an actual challenge I highly recommend GTFO

Great game for those looking to for a challenge Would highly recommend finding people to play this with though cuz ngl the bots suck And yes I got the fuck out

great coop game pretty hard the first time you play but things don't come easy Fasten you seatbelt and ready up for diving
Saw the trailer of this game liked it bought it then tried it My experience so far is amazing Players I played with in the matchmaking are new like me and it's fun seeing all of us struggle to find out how to get to the objective looking for resources or knowing where the hell are we so basically how to play the game Though it takes a while to find other players but that's fine Kinda wish my friends would play this with me My favorite part of the game play here is the resource management and plotting your escape path When you accidentally wake up the sleepers got caught by victim seeking noodles or triggering the alarms resources depleted it is Found 1 ammo pack after wiping the hordes and we had to decide who gets it then when we opened the next door we found 3 big daddies near the objective that triggers the damn alarm You bet we got wiped out Do I recommend this game Yes Can I play this solo Damn right you can but it's recommended to have other friends or random to play with I think the bot is helpful enough during the expeditions Can I run and gun here I tried it didn't work out well despite the warning I thought it's one of those games that you just need to get good at
best horror strategies game with great stories and best introduction of new monster best play with 4-stack firends each rundown has different loot places so its not as boring if you repeat the mission Overall its very worth the money We ball
THIS IS YOUR HOW TO GIT GUD AT EVERYTHING TUTORIAL!1!1!1
one of the most fun and cerebral co-op shooters i've played game doesn't pull it's punches it's goddamn hard communication resource management and making use of mechanics like barricading+mining doors and sentry placement matters a lot this is one of the few games where i feel like strategizing situations with your team is necessary and it's very unique for it i'd say voice comms are basically mandatory hardest mission i've done so far was R7C1 which took us a whopping 3 HOURS but was really satisfying once we did beat it reminds me a lot of old school killing floor on higher difficulties and L4D realism mode downsides i would say you really need to play it with a full party especially at the more difficult levels there's bots but they aren't very smart playing with 3 friends is the way to go matchmaking works but i'm not sure it's worth using there is an official discord people use to organize games with randoms it's active and i've had only good experiences in it thus far but it is an extra hoop to jump through
SO GOOD
I really enjoy this game but there's one problem Matchmaking and it's unfortunate because when I do get to play(after waiting 1 hour in matchmaking and multiple reloads Its a great time full of raging at teammates for starting countdown when no one is ready but also busting skulls and amazing final stands at every corner I stopped playing this game a few months ago for the same reason and came back to find matchmaking even worse with the new update Could it be cause I live in Europe probably Either way I have no problem with matchmaking in other games that are smaller than this one I am rating thumbs up in hopes more people will join and possibly fix this issue
esta chido
shit sucks
one of the games of all time play with people you love to make them not love you
bishop sucks
Thrilling cooperative horror very challenging but if u can aim decent good awareness and some strategy even the hardest challenge is winnable Great game Would love to see some options for checkpoints so when u fail its not a whole hour wasted 8/10
just shit my pants
Fun The team AI kinda sucks one of them kept walking out of a door i was trying to seal
Super AIDs is real
Very scary and very hardcore very fun game tho for sure
urubu
it scary and fun
UPLINK_VERIFY FUCK
Intense horror shooter love it
This game is what would happen if you put Payday The Heist Resident Evil and Neon Genesis Evangelion in a blender It's not an exaggeration to say that the entry barrier is a brick wall but the game does give you the sledgehammer you'll need to batter it down Keep at it and you'll go from being crippled by simple mistakes to quickly mitigating the consequences of colossal screw-ups but don't get too complacent because it will eventually throw a curve ball at you If you're wondering WHY you're crawling around a foggy underground hell hole you're about on the same page as the people you're playing as Those pods they get pulled out of at the start of every mission damage their memories so they have only the faintest idea of who they are and what they're doing so don't worry too much about it Matchmaking is a bit FUBAR as I'm writing this so you might have to go poking around the game's discord to get a full group if you don't have friends to play with already You can play alone with bots and probably manage to complete at least Rundown 1 if you equip them properly They do make extremely stupid decisions sometimes though so be prepared for that On the bright side With the right weapons they can be relied on to hit their targets Just avoid giving them low capacity guns and you should be okay
took me 7 hours to beat the first level fun game if you're looking for a challenge
Juegazo dificil como tiene que ser y presenta un reto para jugar con amigos para desarrollar tacticas distribuir bien los recursos es como si Escape from tarkov y algun juego de terror hubieran tenido un hijo

Scary game
Fun playing with friends intense parties in the dark plus working to clear missions tha are different to each other ARE YPU AFRAID OF THE DARK YOU SHOULD BE
GOOD GAME
died many times was a fun time
DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME plz
GTFO is the game where you need to cooperate and synchronize with your friends to finish levels because all of you have an important roll to complete if not coordinate in simple words all of you die already and makes you very mad Since I played for more than 80 hours this game i said is a very very exciting interesting and very challenger if you play alone because you need to have an idea about how many things work as you progress through the levels it is highly recommended if you play with 3 more friends and if you want a great challenge give it a chance alone
Awesome game with an incredible atmosphere fun gameplay and an excellent coop experience
Great game Requires alot of patience and communication But is good fun to play solo or with friends
Great game better played with real friends and coms Any mistake can cost the game
ta re weno sexo
Very slow and boring gun sounds unrealistic damage and indicators haywire looks good but sounds bad You definitely need a dedicated team for this solo queue just doesnt work Not rewarding enough to keep me playing more than a few days might give it a try some other year
i liek
Amazing co-op game really tough and it heavily encourages teamwork in a fun and enjoyable way My two main gripes are the optimal way to do the stealth gets kinda boring real fast especially on the longer missions and that there's alot of quite important information that the game doesn't tell you or hints at in the slightest But other than this it's a great game
You NEED 4 people or unplayable so 3 friend paying 40 and a schedule that works or the LFG
amazing stuff
A great co-op game Coordination is key while slinging insults to friends Highly Recommend
shi coo
fun game join the discord people will teach you how to play
Tenso e de dar medo tem de usar e saber o que faz mas para jogar sozinho Consiga amigos e boa sorte
No hay gente para jugar en multi Pero buen juego
It is the best game I suck at Others have better more detailed reviews I'll touch base on a few things the mechanics are hard yet fair once you understand them I like that there's no grind to get better and better gear you've got your choice of equipment figure out what works best for you to get through I like that even if the objectives and maps are the same for each rundown the placement of resources and enemies are randomized to some extent to keep things fresh

Excellent atmosphere No real story telling to be spoken of that I saw I think the difficulty and gameplay setup is a long series of bad choices but that's just my opinion One hard truth that is important for any potential or struggling player is this If you don't have a small group of friendly players to devote hundreds of hours to playing the same boring levels over and over until you can actually succeed at them this really isn't worth playing

is okay
played for about 50 hours and havent even seen one mutant guy pretty upsetting gameplay
highly recommended for people that like L4D2 but a more intensive and stealth experience
well I'm just think wow and the smell of the environments is smelling bad like bad chicken so realism feeling immersion playing all the times you could like a constant dream state but then I'm wow I'm liking this game so hot and nice weapon with trade offer enemy type BU THEN I'm thinking wow sometimes I don't have anyone one to play with and I'm thinking wow WHERE ARE THEY WHERE ARE TheY MY FREINDS THEY ARE IN THE ENCLAVE SOMETIMES AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE THINKING WOW I HAVE TO LEVEL THIS WEAPON AGAIN AND AGAIN SOMETIMES IN SHURO CHI AND MAYBE LATER TONIGHT AFTER IM DONE WATChING SHANG CHI OVERALL IM THINKING WOW ITS GOOD RECOMMENDED
GOODGOOD
It is a nice game BUT its extremely difficult The gameplay relies heavily on stealth and guns are your last resort when everything else fails because there's not much ammo available in maps/zones We were dying all the time had to restart mission over and over again until it got boring I don't know if I would recommend this game xD

Hard but good
Absolutely amazing Really is the best game you suck at Amazing mechanics so much fear while in-game I played for 3 hours once i bought it and got hooked immediately I very much recommend this game to others and I would very much like to see a VR version
It's as if 10 chambers mixed 4 cups of killing floor 2 cups of call of duty 1/2 cup of deep rock galactic 2 tablespoons of SCP and mixed it together for 5 minutes then heated the oven at 450 degrees and put it in the oven for 6 hours and made a nice candlelight dinner and sprinkled sweat and rage on the top and put it on the menu Overall its a great game would recommend WALTER WHITE APPROVES OF THIS MESSAGE
Super hard and stressful in a good way You really need people who know what they are doing If you don't you're screwed I love the atmosphere It really sets the whole game
I had high hopes for this game cause i love stealth games But after a few missions with friends and one solo with bots i really have to say its really not that good Its lacks heavily on game mechanics b]This whole game is cut into two game modes.[/b Stealth and Firefight Both modes play out exactly the same everytime they occur making the whole game getting bland really really quick b]Stealth[/b You basicly play the redlight greenlight game What ever you do you slowly take your steps towards enemys until youre close enough to knife them Thats it thats all there is to it The next enemy packs play out exactly the same b]Firefight[/b You either get into a firefight cause you messed up the redlight greenlight minigame while opening certain doors or for a mission objective And here we have the exact same problem They play out exactly the same everytime you put down some mines maybe another turret and thats it now you just look at a doorway shooting stuff Coupled with mediocre gunplay and ammo scarcity makes you already not look forward to the next shootout There are many games that did really well with stealth mechanics that give you multiple options to tackle different situations People looking forward to a fun coop stealth game i hardly suggest to pass on this If you expect the freedom of like a Dishonored 1/2 Deus EX HR/MD Ghost Recon Wildlands any Hitman or LoU1 you wont find what youre looking for here Dont get me wrong i dont expect superpowers but atleast give us another way instead of just ONE No shit b]any game that has a god damn bow as a weapon will offer more stealth content[/b than this here b]All in all its just elongating everything it offers all 2 things.)[/b to make no content feel like there is much content
Yep as advertised Do yourself a favor and bring 3 of your friends along AI dosen't really help only when it's loud or to unlock crates
great horrifying game no bueno more like IWTGTFO I WANT TO GET THE FUCK OUT
My friends and I kind of gave up on the game but it's still a really good game We gave up because the game is obviously punishing in difficulty but the checkpoint system is kinda.rough We were on like our 8th rundown and during a run to each point and hold your position until it's done calibrating someone would go down Since we all took specific gear each person is vital to our success So like good team mates we leave the position to revive But of course on our way someone else would get 3 shot and now two are down then the last two get absolutely swarmed and shot from a distance Now obviously that wouldn't be TOO bad of an issue the games hard and we misplayed that's fine that's out fault What the absolute piss off was was that the last checkpoint was over and HOUR ago behind two stealth segments and a like 3 hold your positions All that while trying to conserve what little ammo and health kits we had After like the 4th time we all kinda just had enough if the checkpoints were closer together this would be be WAY better It's still a good game though and if you and your friends are really good at games probably better than us then it's worth the buy
Game is just not for me Nothing wrong with it per say but the AI is garbage and objectives can take awhile to figure out Different strokes for different folks it's a good game but I found myself getting more frustrated with it than having fun Others in our group loved it so this shouldn't be taken to heart
Amazing game Keeps you on the edge and makes you think and plan carefully in order to win
This game really needs to gtfo There are no unlockables making everything you do feel pointless I beat the first rundown and didn't feel accomplished at all it relies almost solely on stealth as you run out of ammo very quickly and the bots are absolutely useless so good luck if you have anything less than a full squad to play with 4 people Now you can matchmake but I have no clue how good the matchmaking is In short this game is not worth buying at all Even when on sale
So I completed a level after hours on hours but after was I was rewarded with clothes that have no benefits to the game there's no real incentive to play this game other than bragging rights
noice
This game needs to GTFO

Best game you shouldn't play
best game ever dont die in the reactor have atleast 4 people bc you will die very fast
10/10 will recommend
good helped me learn to launder money
an amazing action and shooting game with some strategy involved as well
This game is incredibly difficult solo and finding matches with other players is pretty unreliable having waited up to 15 minutes to get a full game Unless you have 3 other friends to play this with would highly recommend avoiding this game

great game the stress of the game is half the fun of it maybe more
This isnt a run and hold down the trigger game it requires thinking and stealth Each death allows you to crawl closer to that sweet release of a checkpoint An incredibly rewarding game with a nice variety in levels and enemies that keep surprising including the level where you cant use guns for the first two thirds
A common trend heard throughout every stage of my life whilst playing through video games in particular with FPS games is the ideal of the game A game so realistic so tense so brutal that it would mark the true peak of skill A medal for Gamers to wear on their chests like beating the original dark souls in 2011 Undeniable proof of superiority An eternal pedestal to stand upon GTFO makes a strong attempt at becoming that game though it brings with it the realities of what such a game would be like both stylistically and development wise There is no celebration in GTFO only survival There are no grand coats of gold to flex over others only drab unfitting clothes pulled out of a dumpster There are no heroes in GTFO only those who remain alive with these factors in mind that fallen in love with GTFO A game so unapologetically itself that it's hard to criticise what would conventionally be annoying For example gaining information on terminals as to where keycards resources and objectives are is essential for survival Yet the game never explicitly tells you how they work only giving you commands to enter and a stance that the player will either learn or not succeed And it works The aesthetics in this game have legitimately gotten my arm hairs to raise on multiple occasions Veterans of multiple rundowns still get panicky when faced with an unexpected scout It all creates an environment where you must face oldest fear the unknown The unknown of where the enemies lurk in the shadows The unknown W.A.R.D.E.N watching your every move unfazed by your death as merely another failed team with another shortly following The unknown of when you are battered and beaten and praying the next locker has ammo for the security door awaits and the W.A.R.D.E.N expects results or termination In place of the usual soundtrack review I instead wish to highlight the sound design of this game Alarms are loud uncomfortable and ear piercing as they ring out for all to hear just how fucked you are The sleepers are a particular highlight from the grotesque full body throbbing signifying your potential doom to their little chirps and creaking as they slumber in semi agony Furthermore the combat noises of the sleepers were made by the development team screaming and howling into microphones only to be digitally warped corrupted and bludgeoned as much as the sound team saw fit Resulting in horrifying but still faintly human cries as you see the horde crest round the corner Guns crack like thunder against the deep quiet of the facilities helping to further elevate the sense of power and importance of turning a room clear from a stealth mission to a last stand Gameplay wise the golden rule is given by the game together or die You can technically beat every mission by yourself without even the support of bots to assist you however this is the same vein of technicality as me being able to technically swim from England to France and back in under 3 hours Physically possible 99.5 chance of failure 80 chance of horrific failure The game is thus a mandatory multiplayer experience and even with close friends is an exercise in communication and teamwork GTFO is filled with situations where a half hour of progress can be lost due to one fuck up and you best not be the one who does said fucking up In conclusion GTFO is less a game and more an experience in my eyes An experience in a beautifully traumatising cosmic horror world an experience in teamwork an experience of endurance an experience of fear an experience of what makes games challenging Final score 20/100 alone 93/100 together
Love this game fun all around with a challenge
It's challenging as f but it's oh so satisfying when you finally complete the mission you've been stuck on it's borderline euphoria But seriously f the fog in this game 8/8 would r8 gr8
I am a 54 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 14 now My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him loaded into the game made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he helped me Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories Thank you 3
Gosh I couldn't play even play more than 10 hours on this game To anyone that is out there this game is absolutely terrible The game isn't actually based on gunplay believe it or not It is a stealth game that plays way too slowly is extremely boring and insanely punishing for messing up The parts where you have to use guns are just way too hard They don't give you enough resources to handle them and enemies are difficult to kill efficiently For example enemies projectiles have homing properties It's literally a ball of acid But no I didn't need that 10 health that I almost never get to heal Literally everything in this game just beats your ass into the ground resources are given in varied portions typically very small that have to be split between 4 team members The game is way less fun without friends and public lobbies are a joke you start with reduced ammo portions and checkpoints almost never happen Stealth is the main feature of this game and it's nauseating You have to very slowly creep up on enemies that detect you quickly with almost no room for error Now factor in 3 other teammates that have to do the same and you're bound to screw up at some point But that's alright I'll just give it another shot No you won't Missions take upwards of an hour to complete so have fun Of course there's the argument to just get better but who cares If you're a masochist that likes to get their cheeks clobbered multiple times just to complete one level this is the game for you But for the normal majority of people that just enjoy playing a video game in the afternoon this game is a work of chicanery that will provide less fun than purchasing The Last of Us 2 for full price while also putting a considerable dent in your wallet Even if you paid 5 cents for this game that's a robbery I would rather eat the fiberglass out of my walls after breaking my hand punching through a support beam than engage in more levels of this pile of poor game design
Good game would be better if they added sex to the game
Played a few rounds so far The game seriously reminds me of an 80's space genre movie like Alien or Aliens A lot of fun
eu odeio esse jogo ele me deixa com vontade de morrer mas bom vale a pena

Great fun game but you rarely ever get into games with other people so its good to have some friends that have the game

This game is really fun to play with friends th e only issue is the amount of resorces such as meds nd ammo s extremly scarce Te monsters take to long to kill and they deal way to much damage I get that this is what the game intended for high difficulty strategy but it take it overboard Overall it is worth a checkout
I've played this game on and off for a year or two It has only gotten better Me and one other friend were able to do the whole first rundown with the help of bots of course Don't get me wrong this game is hard but as long as you play smart you will be fine The rooms and different situations you are put in will challenge your critical thinking problem solving and patience This is a great game and I would buy it at full price anytime
10/10 would play red light green light with snoozers again
Fun friends start to look like sleepers in the extraction zone
only with freinds can get frustrating alone
I love this game It's fun and tense and when you have the right group of friends to play this with you'll find that beating a level is so satisfying when everyone learns the ins and outs of a level It might take several attempts but it's still a good time 10/10 would listen to people blame each other for moving and alerting all the monsters in the room
this is not a shooter game this is a stealth game with shooter aspects if you dont have friends to play with use the discord to find groups,you will find people to play with regularly despite what people say a mic is not at all required to play it honestly makes very little difference tbh chances are if you NEED a mic to do well your not very good,not saying a mic doesn't help but it is by no means a must have organising and awareness to your surroundings is way more important lmao this game has all the required features such as countdown call outs for different enemy types etc also learn how to use a terminal it makes a huge difference watch some gameplay before buying this is not a review on the game but giving people who might want the game the necessary information to help them decide
A horror FPS game It is strenuous but very compelling
Schwerer als meine Zukunft das Spiel
ta bueno jugalo
this game was so fking hard when it first came out Now tho with some friends it is super fun and still a bit challenging but not too hard
get the f out
babe
I really like this game and think it's very well made The atmosphere is incredibly good and everything just feels right My only complaint would be the levels being so long and how soul crushing it is when you get so far through the level just to die and have to start all the way from the beginning but that's also part of the fun If you can set aside enough time for this game though then it's an absolute blast
Oh yes
could not find anybody in matchmaking this game feels dead

Absolutely epic Requires great deal of team work and coordination I'm about 60 hours into the game and it feels like I'm still new to it In a good way The challenge walks a perfect line of not being beatable and just surviving 100 percent recommend to anyone with a mic Be sure to use their discord to matchmake
i love dying
It's like Deep Rock Galactic but instead of being a funny dwarf you're insane and constantly getting skull f***ed in the dark 10/10
GTFO PVP
really good
If you are looking for a game that is an intense shooter that really draws you into the environment this is the game It is easily one of my favorite games I have played You truly feel immersed in the world not knowing what you are fighting or why only trying to do your objective ans survive along with the dynamic of intense stealth and overwhelming amounts of enemies Teamwork makes the dream work and this game proves it all the while the game is extremely unforgiving One fuck-up and everything can go to shit This game is an absolute masterpiece with a good community and plenty of updates I have been playing this game for almost a year and always have more to do If you and a few friends like games such as Deep Rock Space Galactic Insurgency Sandstorm or Ready or Not you will most likely like this game

Great game for adults just please plan to not be interupted while you play Perfect for longer session gaming It is FUN even if you die USE DISCORD TO JOIN THE MULTIPLAYER GAMES THROUGH STEAM I bought this returned it and after giving it a proper chance I get it Its a nice niche dark foggy crampfest that will stress you out mentally I love it
One of the best game I ever bought Value for money Great Gameplay which requires a lot of teamwork The bad thing about this game is its matchmaking One of the lousiest matchmaking system I have ever seen Fix it developers
Its cute
very good gameplay i would recommend
3
Good game for people who liked to suffer Masochism game
very recommend
I love the monster designs and mechanics Also I like that this game encourages teamwork and strategy rather than blindly running ahead
I do not recommend this game if you dont have any mates willing to pay over 30 bucks otherwise fantastic game with constant content updates and changing mechanics very intense and actionful
a game that has been celebrating itself for the last 3 years but hasn't managed to create an offline option for the solo player just deserves a thumbs down Such games that only run online although it makes no sense at all always give the impression that bitcoins are being mined in the background on your own computer power
18 777 GTFO GTFO left 4 dead killing floor 10 10
This game is schizo Deep Rock Galactic and you can't change my mind
yes developed by 10 Chambers a 4-player co-op that punishes mistakes and is not for the feint hearted
solo
Ca de lui mettre une mauvaise note car le jeu est bien fini avec de bonnes mais il est beaucoup beaucoup trop frustrant On le marque comme un jeu dur et assez lent ce qui est vrai mais je dirais pas vraiment dur mais frustrant et pourquoi frustrant Frustrant car les niveaux sont assez long 1h30 en moyenne quand tu arrive vers la fin du niveau et que tu te fait pour une et que tu dois tout recommencer c'est pas vraiment mon tripe Il y aurait eu des checkpoint chaque ouverture de grosse porte ca serait plus acceptable Je jouais avec un pote et les deux autres sont des bots et je trouve les bots vraiment bien foutu sauf sur un truc le faite qu'ils prennent les medipack sac ammo pour eux et qui nous les donne pas Plusieurs fois ca nous est d'etre en rade de medipack et le bot en avait en reserve et impossible qu'il nous soigne tres rageant Apres quelque truc mais pas de quoi s'alarmer vraiment le seul point noir c'est de tout recommencer chaque fois ce qui me fait arreter le jeu
This game is pretty fun pretty challenging You have to work with your teammates to make sure you don't pull the rug out from under them Playing with randoms can be difficult since it takes so long to join a match usually 1 person that always leaves mid way through and the poor communication I know there is a Discord server where you can play with many people and use voice to help with communication But people just sometimes want to play the game without having to worry about Discord with randoms I think that a good feature that could possibly be added is the ability to join specific games from a list I think it would speed up matchmaking Overall This game is really fun really hard and is best played with friends Poor communication can mean the death of your whole squad resulting in a failed mission/having to restart from a recent checkpoint Matchmaking can be decent It takes a while to get a full squad sometimes but that usually doesn't take long If you are looking for a CO-OP shooter to play with some friends This is a pretty good choice
I lived I died I cried Good game
agony
Hard AF Fun AF Play with come close friends If you like challenging games that absolutely REQUIRE teamwork then this is the game for you It took a few games before I got into the game but once I did I was hooked Best co-op game I've ever played
10/10 would get molested by tentacle monster again
Nice idea but the balance for solo players is hot garbage Gunplay is also really shit
shet gaem
Scar but in a good way
coop stealth smash ugly monsters with hammer or spartan spear work together or die together pretty good advice has die F word in the title atmosphere kinda scary always low on ammo more hammer action overall good game if played with buddies
Quem quiser jogar adiciona ai tem eu e um cara
reeeeeeeeee
is hard but cool makes good for strategy game
Very fun stealth and Action and good graphics
they do be sleepy
Toxic Community game requires 4 people you cant duo with bots they are useless Fail once every one leaves and you will fail a lot New players are isolated Checkpoints are extremely punishing spend 30 minutes on a sector and fail and basically you have to restart the mission
Good game Excellent graphics/attention to details The game is based heavily on teamwork and stealth making mistakes can prove to be deadly or devastating to the team A very enjoyable game great story line and cool enemies
A great game with friends Great variety between rundowns a unique shooter experience and one of my favorite games on PC Would love to see it on consoles and with cross-play but I'm still happy to have it as is
I love how much this game revolves around teamwork and communication It's exciting thrilling and frustrating all at the same time I don't necessarily like the fact that you HAVE to have 4 players to complete a lot of the missions difficulty wise as it can be hard to find the people to play with and bots don't have the same gameplay as a person would in the thinking department BUT this is a very good challenging multiplayer game
its good i shit my pants only 8 times per hour
I love the art in this game It's unlike anything else I've played and mechanics like having to manually type in commands to find shit add an unreal amount of immersion in a game designed around difficulty and maximizing the use of your fragile senses It's extremely fun Good game alone great game with friends but any form of time-limited content makes my balls itch
pretty neat
watch out for the tyrones giga-chads scooters and the tongue-ee's they are sleeping and dont like random asshats messing with them the fog is intense and needs to be dialed back a bit but for sure the game is worth it
cant find a single lobby after a hour got to play one matchmaking game then nothing really
game has been really good it's pretty hard though
Un excellent jeu d'horreur coop ou la est la mais c'est fun en coop
Spooki
GTFO
I feel the strategy aspect of the game pairs best with its ability to build up horror through the countless scenarios you are thrown into Very fun and addicting
The average lock-down experience in China
I'm guessing this game will turn out rather underrated because to enjoy it it requires imo at least 2 teamamtes to play with and you and your team need to be into difficult stealthy but also intense fast-paced games This makes it difficult to enjoy for someone who doesn't have people to play this with or doesn't want to join the discord to find random people But if you do have said teammates then this game offers quite the unique experience for a multiplayer coop game Working together carefully trying to avoid any mistake that could waste your valuable resources this game puts us at the edge of our seats every run Beating a difficult run is just so satisfying but it does often require patience and restarting a run multiple times until you finally chew through it If you and your friends are up to this type of challenge then this game can be amazing
I like the game and I made some progress enough to know things you should considerate before buying Matchmaking doesn't work at all The only way to play with random players is going to a discord server made by the devs this been an issue apparently for quite some time now Bots while they are helpful and the best option if you dont wanna join some random discord server their Ai is mid at best and a death certificate at worst you can't order them to drop items nor to use them all of it is automatizated wich can be a nighmare since I had situations where they wouldn't use ammo recharges equally with the team or even start healing each other on the middle of a fight while getting destroyed by enemys making the entire healing useless and a complete waste Something similar happens when they try to revive the priorize reviving instead clearing out enemys Missions can take from 30 mins to 1h and the peak difficulty of missions is normally towards the end of them making it easier to fail at the point where you wasted more time That can be very frustating and time consuming for some players not used to the game Devs respond to the bots issue not quoting because I don't remenber the exact words This game is intended to be played with other players and bots will stay the way they are Thats funny since they also refuse to fix the matchmaking excusing it with the player base is so small that the amount players currently playing X missions is so low that is normal to not find other players with the matchmaking Well no sh*t you gatekeep new players with a matchmaking that doesn't work and instead of fixing it you use a third party app Btw if you happen to get banned on the discord server you wouldn't be able to even play multiplayer the way is intented Again I do like game but I simply can't recommend it if there red flags like this ones
limited time things are sorta making wish i didn't get this game had i known I get 3 days to beat this so i can get a backpack yes the event is 12 days but i have a job and a life unless this game is targeting kids I had to find a team of 4 to get a chance to get colors and it was a totally random drop chance of what camo color sorta made me quit and just seeing this is sorta the final straw till i see this game over hauled and fixed up Hope that happens
It is super fun when played with friends and i highly recommend it if you have a group of at least two because you can deploy two bots if you need help There also is story in it but it is difficult to understand 9/10
6
yes
I Cannot speak of if the game itself is fun or not all i can say is this if you are bothered by flashing/strobe lights or have any sort of Epilepsy stay FAR away i don't have Epilepsy far as i'm aware but the Flashing lights in this game is above and beyond terrible its like the developers set out to make it as bad as humanly possible with no option to turn the Effect off either within the first 5 minutes of playing i had a terrible headache i couldn't/wouldn't go any further uninstalled and asked for a refund until they fix this issue i can only look on longingly wishing i could play but the developers don't care about the small percentage of people who could become very sick from their stupid strobe effects
Oh cool they're advertising the 13.79 success rate now Literally in their twitter ads I've tried to play this game with several different friend groups We're all really interested in the plot and gameplay but failing 10 times to succeed once is only fun for a really small subset of people and this game aims to waste the time of 4 people at once I want to like it This game is extra hard for people with jobs and families I would get a refund if I could

Fun Very Hard The Fog is coming
good game just wish there was another free weekend so my friends can play with me
I constantly find myself in self reflecting on the trauma caused by this game like wow that was horrible I'm glad that it's over and nothing will ever compare to it yet somehow each level bring new fears and leaves me saying they topped it again I would like to note that this has lead me to become a mastic and enduring its pain is the best pleases I can get Please send help to R7B3
It's very frustrating for the first couple of times but pretty soon you realize that its's you who sucks and not the game The gameplay is very thought-trough and realistic you don't get to rush into every sector and simply slaughter everyone you simply don't have enough ammo for that You advance carefully share your resources and plan your escape when the job is done 10 out of 10 game strongly recomended
Hard to find someone to play with
this a nice game
This game is a brutal grueling time but if you play with friends it's worth it That being said you kinda need 4 Players the bots just can't make up for an actual Human I was initially pretty disappointed by this game as the trailers made it seem like it was more shooting focused and it's very much a 50/50 Stealth and Shooting game If you go in with that in mind and the knowledge that you won't win every mission on the first try then you can really get into it 7.5/10
This game is what you make of it If you treat it poorly play with randos don't use stealth play with a lobby less than 4 people etc then you will find that it's nothing special and frustrating If you treat the game properly then playing this game with 3 of your friends will take precedent over any other multiplayer game in your library
If you like fighting through hell and feeling dumb by the end of it Then this game is for you XD
there a Nigerian
intense action definitely need a good team and communication during play Great Game Challenging and fun
good
although very heavy on lag and delay with some adjustment this can be played even on laptops and the content is just fun and exiting
Never thought getting the fried onions would be this god damn hard
Ingenious game Laziest developers to exist What infuriates me is that beneath all the bugs and cut content and bad design is potential potential to be even more but well hey why not throw that under the rug and move on for a bigger profit Investors and Management probably loves that
El juego a pesar de ser bastante dificil esta buenardo y es mucho mejor y mas divertido si tienes a gente con quien jugar Es mas recomendable comprarlo si tienes con quien jugar ya que hay misiones que vas a necesitar de alguna persona para pasarlo NICE GAME
where are my friends FUCK THEY ARE ALL DEAD GET THE FUCK OUT GET THE FUCK inelligible sounds screams

The single best co-op game I've ever played If you can get 3 friends together and focus really hard on communication and decision making you'll make it through no problem Incredibly rewarding and punishes carelessness Beautiful atmosphere and lighting Interesting level design The levels are very long but you will absolutely not get bored Outstanding game
Um dos melhores jogos coop que joguei Uma verdadeira obra de arte
4 100 10
very easy
Purtroppo il gioco parecchio noioso lento e macchinoso ed un peccato poteva essere un bellissimo horror stealth ma purtroppo fallisce miseramente sia a livello di del gameplay che dopo aver pulito diverse zone dai mostri diventa un walking simulator claustrofobico in cui bisogna andare a cercare oggetti per aprire delle porte o completare degli obbiettivi e poi ripetere la stessa identica cosa nelle zone sbloccate successivamente Inoltre al fatto che essendo che alcune cose sono completamente senza un senso logico ad esempio la porta biometrica va scansionata seguendo degli ologrammi per un tot di volte ma questo scattare un allarme ora dico io se siamo stati inviati in missione non potrebbero darci un pass per evitare gli allarmi siamo dei prigionieri a cui vengono assegnate armi e attrezzature molto avanzate non abbiamo modo di sbloccare una porta senza evitare allarmi oppure la ricerca delle chiavi in stile doom ma non possiamo avere una sorta di chiave unica per aprire tutte le porte bho chi lo chiama gameplay io lo chiamo mi guardo instagram mentre i miei compagni lavorano

This game has some of the best lighting Iv'e ever seen Very challenging and fun Good replay value and definitely it it's own
This game is fun However do not play it thinking it won't be hard It will be very difficult so much so that even the tutorial is stressfull Very fun though if you like a challenge
too easy
So fun and awesome
FUCK U!Fisrt Did you play you game before you sell it?I wonder why these AIs in this fucking game is much stupid as I can think.SO fuck you if you won't make these fucking Fool AI better

Twerk Beasts
Nothing compare to this game Part stealth part hardcore shooter all fun The ambiance is new in the genre and so is the enemies A breath of fresh air on the 4 player coop shooting genre Cant wait to see the final product
spooky
Sweet game no lie
fucking hard but really fun you are going to have to have tight coms to make it through
This is good Yesn't
Me and the boys going to do rundown two Entire boys losen all moral
W game
good game
played a bit is gud gaem
Dear developers The game is intended for co-op but there are no servers hosted by the players themselves when we try to play with friends terrible lags I recommend playing without servers for such a price
We need to set up a server in China the network without a server will be online except the host others will frequently drop out of line
Great sex scenes
Fun
After 2 years still barebone game matchmaking still crap and fanboys still think its ok having to use discord to find players in 2023 Keep your money maybe check again in 3 years
good
The developers are proudly advertising that only 14 of concurrent players can beat any of the levels the game is artificially difficult and the checkpoint is completely obtuse and only serves to waste your time me and my friends don't want to waste 4 hours attempting the same linear section over and over again and we are also locked out of playing the rest of the content This game wastes your time don't let it waste your money too
h1 h1 h1 15 h1 h1 100 2 4 b h1 2023 10 Dark Souls b h1 i]WORK TOGETHER OR DIE TOGETHER[/i
GTFO is that game you know you die a lot but love for ones thats Hunt showdown and for others is this one or both why not grab some friends and make them suffer but in silence dont wake the enemies You are gonna love it
Basically feels like completing a GTA V heist but you don't get to buy the dumbest looking car on the planet afterwards Purchase if you enjoy getting yelled at by people with too much time on their hands
Gets very old very fast It feels like a 20 game
bad
this game is fun to play and i love the concept but the game is borderline unlpayable without a full squad of 4
Never have I been killed more by friendly fire from AI's but very hardcore and engaging
Take laxatives at the same time as you open this game This game will hurt more than the laxatives
Franchement la est C'est un jeu qui patience analyse et team leader Il faut faire attention aux ressources en permanence ne pas se et bien analyser les salles L'inventaire est il faut bien choisir ses outils avant de partir en mission ainsi que ses boosters pour le niveau Les boosters sont il faut bien faire attention quand les utiliser Un bon jeu de part cette mais je pense que j'aime beaucoup y jouer 1 session de 2 niveaux toutes les 2/3 semaines seulement lorsque je suis en groupe avec mes amis qui sont matures et font attention aux autres Atypique et fortement rewardant But high risk high reward La fin de mission donne des qui sont un petit plus
This game can be described this way i Hard enough to make you want to destroy the entirety of 10 Chambers office with everyone in it but good enough to make you want to come back and try again i Just keep in mind that you will surely need more people to play either friends or people in the official discord
It's a very fun game to play with friends
Great game sadly not enough people to play with c
1-2 3-4 2
My friends and I loved this game and have supported it for nearly three years At this point I cannot recommend this game unless on heavy sale The game was early access/beta for a couple of years and it had some issues which were being ironed out That is completely fine and don't mind that at all Recently 10 Chambers went on a small hiatus which essentially brought all development and tech support to a halt Since this hiatus the game has deteriorated in quality There are multiple networking issues when playing with friends Desyncs crashes and literally not being able to see other players are the more prevalent ones You can report these via their official Discord however their community-dev outreach will ask about VPNs then blame it on some sort of VPN even when not in use Other reviewers have stated that 10 Chambers is about to start working on other projects which completely makes sense for how they're responding and acting in the Discord Unfortunately this seems to be a game that will slowly get worse It had such potential and is still very very fun and difficult.when it works The problems we've had are consistent in every drop and are pushing us and some other players away I WOULD recommend this if you can get past and be patient with the bugs and networking issues Hopefully it has more support but I'm not holding out hope 3
This is I swear the best 4P CO-OP game released in the last decade You'll be left with your heart pumping until you chose to GTFO and quit
game lon
Game
awesome wish I had friends to play it with
This game looks iffy at first but once you get past the first learning curve then oh my god This game has you on your feet at all times and will test your strategist skills I 100 recommend this game for the 40 as it has multiple levels that will give you hours of content
need friends
Let them sleep But in reality this game drops you and up to three of your friends or bots into a cavernous dungeon and you're expected to find out how to GTFO This game is fantastic when played with friends but a bit of a rough experience played with AI Teamwork is a must it is an absolute key component of the game Fantastic game starting picking it up again with a few of my buddies and it's fantastic
very fun and thrilling would recommend
Wear brown pants You're welcome
Very Stressful and really fun even with just two people 100 worth 40 bucks
fun with friends
good try it
Get a friend group I cannot emphasize how important it is to have at least 3-4 dedicated people to playing this It's extremely satisfying and rewarding IF you enjoy serious and challenging games This game is a pure test of skill collaboration and patience If you don't like planning out a run discussing tactics and rationing out resources this game is not for you
After years of playing several coop shooters zombies and very similar to gtfo I have to say that this game is superior to all the others played the atmosphere the music the missions the difficulty the replayability the long campaign the huge maps integrated discord it has almost everything to be a perfect game the bots should adjust them and it is a bit tedious to play alone and we will have to implement find some things such as more dangerous enemies weapons inventory and something else But if you want to enjoy a good gaming session this game is a must buy I regret not having taken the early access I thought it would be a game of many but I was wrong!get food,water,and join the complex THANK YOU 10 CHAMBERS
you need 4 people to buy this 35 quid game or else you can lfg like the saddo you are looks really fun though
There are too few checkpoints in this game so once you fail you will have to start over from a long time ago and that makes this game require way more patience than skill I am not against the hard parts of the game but most of the time you are doing sneak kills and searching for items which requires little skill and is not fun Despite this part I will give the game 10 out of 10 many things about this game are just amazing but the boring and repetitive errands completely ruined the game it's just simply bad game design
i'm the bald guy

Do not buy Matchmaking is a complete mess and the only reliable way to matchmake is to use the official discord server which has an overly-complex system to host matches for players The only time my friend ever talked me into this we were immediately beset upon by two individuals who I can only describe as dudeweedlmao General gameplay loop is shockingly boring once you understand what is going on Each rundown is formulaic in that a vast majority of your time will be spent carefully crouching around hitting things in the back of the head with a sledgehammer so you don't alert the entire floor you're there and run out of the two magazines of ammo you are all collectively allowed to carry Vague objectives must be completed usually requiring you to again carefully crouch around the back of things and sometimes just wait for them to not be in a state where they can detect you anyways All four of you have to slink past these enemies successfully No checkpointing system Short missions take at least 30 minutes Screwing up on the last part voids all 30 of everyone's minutes Can't play solo Can't matchmake solo without the discord Bots are atrocious Essentially you will only see success on missions once you know exactly what you're doing and what to expect via trial and error
get it to convince all your friends to play your friends ask u to put 15 hours in before he buys put 21 hours in solo money well spent
Best Horror Shooting Game
I shit myself
shit my pants
Difficult to a point that is clearly no longer fun I'm all in for tactical survivor horror and it's a great concept but this game falls horribly short of delivering an engaging experience
Love it Me and a buddy started playing it today and we ended up playing 6 hours straight The AI on bots can be a little annoying at times but they are good sponges for damage The graphics are great and the game runs smoothly on a mid tier rig Hope the game keeps updating and that it keeps evolving so it doesn't become to repetitive The atmosphere is great and the game gets pretty intense at times love every minute of it I would definitely recommend for friends who are looking for a tactical team-focused gameplay experience Thank you to the Dev team
Fantastic with friends very difficult requires people that have patience and don't immediately get bored with stealth gameplay my brothers and my stepdad huge note that something made me not want to buy the game whenever new content is introduced old content is REMOVED FOREVER For example the game comes with little mini-campaigns called Rundowns and with each update it gives you a new Rundown and removes the older one forever This is excusable if gtfo devs keep making content but whenever they move on to their next project all previous content isn't in the game anymore It keeps testing down and promotes faster content development probably but if you ever wanted to fight that big dead space style boss in the trailers you'll never do it because it's not in the game anymore lol edit Since the release of ALT rundowns we aren't deleting any more content paraphrasing from a news thing but older content is still gone lol
I realized I had no frens to begin with
Adoro praticamente todo jogo inspirado no filme The Thing 1982 GTFO Impressionantemente bem otimizado recompensador apenas certifique-se de ter pelo menos 2 outros amigos pra jogar antes de comprar o jogo
let them snooze
If you think Dark Souls is hard try this Never had so much fun failing every mission Oh and it has no sh*tty MTX store
Grand Theft auto FOur
I pooped myself when playing Haven't played since
Waited and waited for matchmaking to happen yet 0 player came to the lobby If you want me to join discord first and assemble a team of 4 to play a game say it in the product description instead of letting me find out the hard truth after paying
Decided to play through R7C2 with a friend and two bots also decided to go for prisoner efficiency primary secondary and overload objective in one go Here's how it went Step 1 Do some preliminary looting in the first area Step 2 Start a 5 stage alarm that slowly goes up through platform hell as toxic fog rises while fighting enemies Step 3 Once the fog lowers go into a big hub room there's enemies in there so maintain stealth also loot the room you won't get much more so you're gonna need to make it last through three different huge areas lol Step 4 Go into the first of the three areas go through it stealth and get to the end doing another 5 stage alarm this ones a cluster though so get your running shoes on Step 5 Get the two RTX 4090s power cells and start running back to the first area quickly because fog will start rising until you put them in the generators of the main hub room there's a door locked by a generator in this first room that you use to get the overload key DO NOT USE THEM YET or you'll have to go through the next two areas in toxic fog the entire time including the alarms Step 6 Do the second area which is similar to the first except there's more enemies and scouts to stealth kill also you have to fight enemies on your way back through the fog once you get the two 4090s Step 7 Do the third area find the overload door and get the two 4090s after you do the alarm there's no enemies this time so go back to the first area through the fog you'll have 100 infection and 1 health so don't fall lol and use them on that generator I previously mentioned Step 8 Stealth through that side area there's a lot of scouts be careful and get the key to the overload door You'll also get another 4090 Keep it because you'll need it for the actual overload section Step 9 Go back to the third area use the bulkhead key to unlock the overload door make sure that the 4090 you grabbed is close and stealth your way through a ton of chargers hopefully you brought a spear giant chargers and charger scouts hopefully you brought a friend because there's like 5 and you need 2 simultaneous weak-point hits to kill Step 9.5 You'll likely choke on the charger scouts but that's fine just make sure your turrets are set up preemptively so you can last through the waves btw the toxic fog is still on the map so you'll have 1 health but it's fine just don't get hit Step 10 Bring the 4090 to the generator in the first overload room and slot it in There'll now be a 6 stage mixed alarm with multiple full team scans and flying enemies that shoot projectiles the fog still hasn't gone away yet so you'll still be at 1 health it's fine though just don't get hit We died at this part keep in mind we had not completed the FIRST objective of the primary progression and had not even started the secondary objective Will probably try again tomorrow
Lots of fun laughs and stress
make sure you have friends and that they have money to buy this game before buying it
This game has shown me that my friends and I have a combined IQ of 12
Yet another shining example why we need a neutral rating Technically speaking the game's quality is very high animations audio graphics levels you name it However I don't think it's my cup of tea It requires so much tryharding that by the end of the session I simply feel tired
If you love coop games I would highly suggest this This game gave me left 4 dead vibes but it felt even more painful when a horde awakes The really only major thing I did not like was the fact that you have to join the GTFO discord server just to connect and find a group I'm unsure why this is not shared with you when you do buy the game Overall if you enjoy hard coop games this is the right game for you and your friends
One of the finest co-op experiences I've ever enjoyed The visuals atmosphere sound and weapon/tool design are top notch The high difficulty and precision ensure this requires the close coordination of effort well on the level of the hardest raids I've played in other games destiny etc Exhilarating and rewarding
MARAVILHOSO procuro equipe kk
By far the most tactical gameplay i've ever had
Amazing game to play with friends lotta fun and hard very very hard
This game will give you ptsd
I do not write reviews for video games but this one is quite special I have replayed this game a dozen times and each time I revisit the cold depths of GTFO's oceans I feel a sense of revamped adventure that I can't describe and no other game can pull out of me Experience this game in its entirety every nook a cranny has something beautiful within it
It'd be alright if it's design idea wasn't bugging out every other second
Life-Changing
Fun game especially with friends and voice coms Excellent atmosphere
uhm
Pants shittingly fun A great game to play with the homies at 2am while we each slowly lose our sanity Terrifying at moments and utterly terrifying the rest of the time Can't wait for the rest of the rundowns to release so I can get all the cool cosmetics 10/10 great game would recommend if you like horror and strategy
Grinding 8 hours straight for a slightly cooler skin
Left 4 Dead trifft Dead Space
decent solo will piss you off but nothing feels better than winning
Don't buy this game is dead so unless you have 3 buddies to play with do not do it The matchmaking is effectively either broken or dead either way definitely not worth 30 for a game that you can only play single player even though its design for multiplayer

NICE
yes if u have friends
Definitely one of the most fun games I've played in a while That being said I also like games that push the boundaries of the norm and games that are frustratingly difficult because I'm addicted to the high you get when you finally complete a level or objective that you've been stuck on for hours The one catch as many other reviews have noted is that I don't recommend buying unless you have people to play it with Playing it solo is beyond brutal for people who truly hate and want to punish themselves
Do NOT allow certain people to melee scouts
i shit myself
Where to even begin This game is mindblowingly great While it is EXTREMELY difficult it's very fun regardless even if you fail your missions over 100 times This is a really fun but challenging game to play with friends The fact that it takes a single teammate to kill everyone is scary in itself You definitely need lots of teamwork to survive and even then you're not guaranteed success I love the challenge and I love the horror that comes with it
yawn
Excellent
spooky scary fun for everyone
tough as nails and will put your friendships to the test 8/10 a handful of minor cosmetic bugs but solid game play and atmosphere wise
This is game is great If you like the Horror co-op survival games this going to be right up your alley Very Team heavy I just got this game on 12/30 almost two weeks later sunk in 40 hours Other thing about this game is that you will need to have a discord I mean who doesn't these days in order to match-make IMO it is easier an better find a game I found out the hard way by just sitting and waiting for a game took 40 mins that way just to have no coms and throws in the game I recommend and the community so far with the vet players have been a huge help and guiding new players that are trying the game out Also there is a beg tab in the discord so that you can play with beginners and have some fun If are look for that 4 player hardcore alienish survival this is the game for you
klasse aber nicht alleine xD
Guggisapproves
Es macht einfach nur Bock wenn man wirklich ein Gutes Team hat Man kriegt immer gut auf die Fresse aber man lernt daraus Top Game Koop Spielerei aber Achtung Rage Quit inklusive
El juego esta muy bien pero siendo realistas a no ser que te lo compres junto a tus amigos no vas a poder disfrutarlo Es posible jugar solo pero por lo general se necesitan varias personas para pasarse los niveles y no las hay literalmente puedes pasarte en cola sin encontrar a nadie y aunque el juego dispone de discord oficial para encontrar gente sigue siendo muy insuficiente de un intento de de este problema muy deficiente
fuck
If God and Satan had a baby it would be this Pros Death is easy Cons Need Friends to play Would recommend if you hate yourself
it's dork in here
tengo amigos
Good game
Muy bueno
fua
To many FUCKING GLOW-STICKS Fun game tho
red light green light but it destroys friendships
es malardo y falopero no se que se habran fumado al hacer este juego
Fun cooperative game
shhh sleepers

this is why i hate apex legends
O Jogo e vai morrer Se gosta de perder vai jogar Minecraft ou outro jogo A principio pode parecer tranquilo sem uma boa e jogo em equipe provavelmente no fim da fase perdendo 1 ou 2 horas de jogo tenso e seu sido em Conforme no jogo novas aparecendo e novos inimigos Mesmo sendo e muitas vezes frustrante o jogo muito bom para jogar co-op com amigos e sempre fica aquele ar de desafio dando vontade de jogar de novo para passar aquela fase Recomendo muito
Challenging Game that gets way better with friends
this is my favorite game that i cannot play
An amazing Co-Op only game that is fairly difficult You seriously need 3 other people or a desire to play with randoms through the discord as the solo experience is virtually nonexistent Still needs steam achievements and a 4 pack bundle though
Estabamo en la feria de y al se le cayeron las gafas Fuimos preguntando por si alguien las habia visto pero eran todos unos siesos y nos chillaban en la oreja ademas que olian peste Al final un palo de hierro y empezamos modo bravo six a matarlos a todos pa ver si tenian las gafas del Antonio Po no que cuando las encontramos y nos estamos yendo dice el antonio Chavale se me ha caido el movil
I've never played such a thrilling game before This game has really managed to hook me Even though the setting is really scary the game is well animated and the levels are very well designed It is just so much fun to try out the really demanding missions with my friends The only thing that bothers me is that melee attacks are sometimes a little bit buggy which results in alarmed sleepers Definitely recommend to buy this underrated game
Un des meilleurs jeux de que je connaisse et j'en ai fait un paquet Prenant intelligent et gratifiant Et jamais injuste Seul impossible d'y jouer avec des inconnus Avec 2-3 amis s'impliquer un must have
Survival Horror is a genre I love dearly Games like those of the early Resident Evil franchise always stuck out to me The idea of scavenging every bit of ammo or meds and balancing not wanting to miss shots with not wanting to be eaten really defines that genre of games These concepts are a core part of GTFO but cranked up to 11 Try conserving ammo not on 1 or 2 zombies slowly lumbering forward in the narrow hallways of RPD but instead while gunning down a horde of monsters in a full sprint at you This game is a test of both marksmanship and nerve where every game of red light green light stealth could mean wasting more of your invaluable supplies Communication stealth game-sense and marksmanship blend together in this one-of-a-kind co-op experience Find out just how much your friends suck at video games and when you get tired of losing get carried by randoms on the official discord and see just how good the steam community can be at them GTFO is an experience I would only recommend to those who are willing to engage in a social game and willing to commit time and frustration to learning it If you choose to dive in your reward is getting to explore the dark and ominous yet gorgeously crafted complex and experiencing the mysterious yet intriguing story of the world
Too Many Glitches and Bugs with the game You fall 2 CM and lose 10 of HP You will randomly unable to interact with objects until you reconnect Edit Found more bugs you can get stuck in corners and forever lost in the void If you crash as host the lobby restarts Just started a game with boosters instant crash when loaded in It ate my boosters Great Game
Great multiplayer fps strategy game Gotta play with friends though
ta bueno
r1a2 xd
the BEST game you absolutely SUCK at It has won its award proudly
es un excelente juego para jugar con amigos se disfruta bastante muy el grado de dificultad es alto lo que hace que sea entretenido hay que ser bien estratega ya que el loot es bajo y muy random a veces y por un lo que eso te a saber gastar la y el totalmente recomendado
GTFO what a game and still have no idea what it stands for 200 hours in and still pumping them out I have learned a lot about coordination adaptation execution and your friends cannot be trusted in this game Shoutout to Cole and John for always standing by me always willing to try new things and progress deeper into the complex with me This game is an unbeatable experience of pain and fun with friends if you're into the masochism mode difficulty of gaming Only two things disappoint me with my time running the game the first one being the cell glitch in your hands when re-spawning at a checkpoint only had this happen on R7C1 The second one learning that alarm and/or scout waves can spawn in zones you have not cleared yet which I find a little unfair depending on if scouts are in the rooms namely R2D2 but this isn't a game breaker Delved into the modded experience for some more fun this week thoroughly happy with the experience thus far and will continue playing until the games eventual content drought
AMAZING GAME WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND
good
spooky
Jeu qui joue sur les nerfs je conseille d'avoir un bon groupe d'amis pour se faire confiance tenir s'organiser et avancer Jeu de et punitive Vraiment prenez votre mal en patience Mais bon jeu avec un lore qui se
Sehr sehr geiles Spiel macht sehr viel vor allem wenn man es mit Freunden spielt Haben uns dabei des erschrocken D
Decent game can be fun with friends but definetly not worth 40 euros Small amount of content and gets boring after a while
game is difficult but extremely fun
amazing except for the teammates can be about as good as my 3 inch cock with a stripper that's been gaped by three black dudes at once
Left 4 dead but very scary
GTFO
recommended kids all ages
Played the beta I miss the beta but it was still amazing And 10/10 amazing and fun game
En este juego TU ERES LA GALLETA
ES UNA VERGA Y A MI ME GUSTAN LA VERG.XD
it good game
yes
Stealth Fun Horror Strategy Difficult Action This game is really fun I just wish more players would play it If you don't want to wait 5 30 minutes finding a multiplayer game just play solo with bots or with friends It's even more challanging
I genuinely enjoy it its just super punishing It's a Zombie/infected based game and you play as a group of four prisoners that have committed huge crimes or have mental disabilities and are sent in to complete missions for the government in charge of your sentencing Sometimes it gets confusing with all the mechanics but once you learn for instance how to properly use a terminal or how to use commands with the Q function it makes the game all the more better You select your load out by a primary weapon a special weapon a utility and a melee weapon You clear levels complete security scans with waves of enemies and fight off different things and scenarios every time some being more difficult than others The placement of every mob and placement of resources is AI generated The issue normally run into is being on the same page and also resource management Very very fun game I would recommend if you're into that kind of game play Plus playing with friends makes it all the more better By far one of the most humbling yet rewarding games I've played I'd compare it playing Elden Ring fighting the same boss over and over and finally beating it
Incroyable bien sa Juste Incoryable
Buy ONLY if you have friends to play with You're friends must like challenging FPS co-op games and not have ADHD so they can actually stay still for a bit stay close to the team share resources and not talk all the time because it is going to be just chaos and frustration Not for casual gamers I don't recommend playing with random people
I got the game in hopes it would be a wild game to play where your running around fighting for your life but in reality you sneak around and smack aliens in the head with a sledgehammer now its not a bad game just the whole be quiet and sneak around part isnt fun to me the community is very nice and friendly and will help you learn how to play the game fast but the guys who play this take it very seriously and you spend most of your time sneaking around with them which again to me just isnt fun its very boring most of the guys dont have mics and that kinda makes sense cause your mic can actually be heard by the aliens or whatever they are i didnt play long enough to dive into what kinda organisms your fighting so theirs a lot of typing and using the in-game characters to say things to get communication happening I would recommend this game if you got 3 or 4 buddies to play but i cant recommend it if youre gonna go into lobbies unless you yourself enjoy sneaking around with the occasional fire fight most of the weapons are booty to say the least like the machine gun charges up idk who thought that was a great idea but it was not a great idea lol assault rifles are pretty good though just lack ammo but again youre not supposed to shoot things up but rather sneak around and club things to death if you like sneaking around in a horror space game then this is for you but if youre like me and like fast paced thrill that has you laughing as you run for your life then this aint for you the game is meant to be a sneak around not a shoot em up
one second your thinking your on top of the world the next second your leader was sniped like jfk 10/10
Its good Atmosphere is nice Its fun to beat the monsters with mallets
mmmmmmmmmmm
Need friends or the discord to play this game However great game very very challenging You will fail/die many times however worth it whenever you succeed
its a really fun stealth co-op game to play with friends with 4 is the most fun
need four people ggod
nice

It's fun if your into baby games To Easy
man this game is really hard
forgor
What all tactical zombie games couldn't be
It's the tension of THE LAST OF US mixed with the team aspect of Fortnite Escape from Tarkov or Desitny This game is a wild ride
opino que es un muy buen juego,para la gente que le gusta lo hardcore y lo cooperativo es excelente
I got banned from the discord because I kept joining the lobby and speaking really softly Then when they turned me up to 200 I screamed into the mic and shot everything around us Good times
pls help im traumatized
GTFO IS AWESOME With friends The difficulty spike is real painful at times even in a group of skilled players So completing floors or an entire rundown is satisfying Gameplay is fun engaging and often times COMPLETE pandemonium you'll see when you hit your first alarm door Definitely recommend Bring a friend You will need it
The game can lead to lots of laughs with friends it can also test your relationship with your friends Playing Vanilla GTFO is an experience that will test your personal abilities and how well your group can plan and keep cool I HIGHLY recommend this game with friends the single player is a different experience in my book the bots are alright however they do not equal another human player the big benifit of single player is you have absolute control over the mission and the bots as they will not activate or trigger aggro allowing the solo player to have full strategic control The game does not Support mods itself use mods at your own discretion and avoid any multiplayer unless your with friends See you all in the depths and take care
It was fun at first The skill ceiling can get pretty high but at the same time the learning curve can be too steep for a new player At this point there is technically a tutorial but it doesnt excuse the fact it took years to be added And there are is a good amount of stuff the game doesnt teach you I know the whole point of this game is trial and error but there is something depressing when the error happens an hour into an expedition Newer missions have checkpoints but the remastered old ones dont It's even demoralizing when the error is because of a bug This game has been out for 4 years but we still encounter a lot of bugs that will force a failed expedition My team has had countless of dc's and crashes Sometimes when the game is feeling generous when the host crashes it will pass the hosting on a different team member but no one knows how that works And somehow its always someone with a worse connection Like it doesnt even matter who is next in the join order Also I dont see a lot of replayability in this game You just stealth kill a room the same way as always you do a bioscan as always while shooting the same way as always you finish the mission collect a randomized piece of clothing Why do all the black/grey color palettes look like your character swam through sh_t and that's it Unless you really enjoy the gameloop the only reason to replay an old mission is farm artifacts I know not many players may share my point of view I also have a lot less time for video games and that could be an important factor for falling off with this game The game is alright it is better than when it released but it COULD BE a lot better
Game fucking sucks and I couldn't even get a refund for a broken product
Matchmaking is AWFUL The developers aren't even trying to fix it no updates or fixes on the buggy semi-functioning matchmaking for years Likely to force people to join their GTFO discord server This is very inconvenient and the moderation of the forum there is terrible Trigger-happy mods ban you for the smallest reason Mentally ill discord users disrespect you and try to make you accommodate their delusions and tiptoe about how you speak to them if you don't you get reported and banned The game is niche and has fun aspects but has quite a few bugs too I would overlook the bugs if the matchmaking was fixed Until MM isn't fixed stay far away from this game you've been warned
Don't expect it to be be another survival shooter The gameplay relies heavily on stealth and guns are your last resort when everything else fails I only recommend if you have someone to play with in co-op as going solo into higher difficulty levels is borderline masochistic
Poor controller implementation in fact menu navigation is impossible on controller without a special steam controller layout No way to change difficulty and it's already a very difficult game even with KBM Crashes frequently and catastrophically requiring reboot on steam deck It is very much a sweaty game for tryhard PCMR gamers if you play L4D on nightmare and it's still not hard enough GTFO must have been made for you There's probably a decent game in there somewhere but a couple friends and I couldn't get past the first level in the first run after multiple attempts Definitely needs a little more time in the oven and lots of quality of life enhancements including but not limited to real gamepad support and difficulty options
Man this isn't Animal Crossing
Love this game
DABBE 5 DEN AMA 4 DEN
fuckng shite cunt
very good but very harrrrrd and must be played by 4 friends
Great game for playing with mates couple of bugs but nothing major recommend
Pain
Great game some parts don't really feel fair but it's pretty well balanced for most of the parts Getting games is also extremely hard matchmaking also sucks
peed myself worth it tho fun game
Just get the frick out
good
Cool game but they weren't kidding this is a extreme shooter The levels are tedious some games will make the game progressively more difficult.not this game no mucking around on this one 9.1 hours and we made it past a couple of levels and then you start to realise there is no progression rewards just some skins rarely some boosters no weapon customisation,no unlocks for weapons nothing to get you motivated through the game but cold dark corridors feels too slow at times which is the style of the game I guess for a game that requires a lot of communication and coordination I wish the tagging"system was more versatile:you can only mark containers no enemy marking good game if you hate enjoying games
You are most def going to lose a lot but you need to in order to win Adrenaline is the only feeling you go through when playing this game Has to be one of the best games I've ever played
hardest game ive ever played my four good friends have put in many hours about 30 or so on one mission i think a check point system on easy is needed missions are long and its very annoying doing the same run over and over using different tactics to do said task then game may lag at bad time or you get overwhemled and have to do again and again its unforgiving and not in a good way its just not worth 30 when everyone feels the same about the game and nothing is done about it by devs this game has potential but it will not bring in new players who will only die after the first rundown level never progress and no way to just pick up and play game needs a way to fill refill packs to 120 using other packs a check point progression system armor to add to health a crossbow or bow or suppressed gun pinging of sleepers or directions melee should also have a shield as special for melee battles like a shield and club or knife combo easy mode should include more crutches so with time and skill more challenge could be applied when ready we will not be playing anymore unless at least checkpoint progression is added we will not recommend this game for anyone who is not some kind of gamer god fyi less than 1 of players have compleated all rundowns i think only like 5 have beaten second rundown so yea its too hard to enjoy
Bought the game to play with friends and randoms The in game matchmaking is a joke Good luck if you think you'll find a lobby with people to play You have to join the discord to find a group to play with
I can't use the use the Use key despite rebinding it to another key great game 10/10
Play the fucking game right now
Good Game

Don't buy this bloody mess Not worth the shot unless you consider playing modded gtfo which the devs last time I invested my precious time on it was against it at the point of throwing legal threats to modders But hey fuck'em they won't police you at all if you don't operate in their trashcord server anyway so Have fun ig Still don't believe me well watch this video
Es imperativo jugarlo en equipo Aunque no tengo problemas con su dificultad opino que carece de indicaciones claras o pistas de ir para cumplir los objetivos por lo que si juegas sin personas que conozcan cada se te muy Pero en general le hace justicia a su lema work together or die together bien optimizado y tiene bonitas 9/10
Apart from the Bugs There are a lot This is easily one of the most fun and terrifying game I have ever played I enjoy this game immensely You need communication in this game Highly recommended to play with friends Definitely with friends
Tactical need teamwork to achieve goal and complete mission
Gioco dalle atmosfere pazzesche stra consigliato se vi piacciono i giochi cooperativi Uno dei pochi giochi che mi hanno realmente colpito negli ultimi anni davvero difficile e affascinante
Fun yet difficult game My only real complaint about GTFO are the bots lose any sense of self-preservation during a wave when downed and focus entirely on reviving you which results in them getting FUCKED in the ass by a meaty tendril while bent over to get you up Or snatch one of the resources from a locker/crate and not use it when someone on the team could use one Besides that I really enjoy the atmosphere the feeling of triumph after completing a mission I spent so long on and the gameplay You must be stealthy to preserve ammo choose carefully how to set up your turrets mines and c-foam before a scan and what to bring for a specific expedition to be fully efficient highly recommend you get this game with friends say worth the price so long as you have friends to play with so you can effectively communicate and cooperate with them Like I said before the bots can be unreliable and frustrating at times when playing solo but also they kind of make up for it since they alert sleeping enemies Plus playing with friends can create memorable moments as well especially in the later rundowns where you meet more fucked up enemies So in conclusion GTFO easy especially if playing for the first time and even with friends It can be really frustrating and requires careful planning and patience
You will die a lot if you suck
don't make a sound
need way too much teamwork but that the whole point random matchmake aint that bad most know what they are getting into
einfach nur geil
work together or suck together
This game is great AND I FUCKING HATE IT SO SO SO SO MUCH and its so fun as well
its a very hard co op game but i can recommend find a team and work together to beat the maps
beh che dire bel gioco
Fantastic game overall It definitely requires teamwork but is a lot of fun and intense
Esta mamada esta mas que ecuaciones diferenciales
FOG BAD GAME GUD
This game is great Very hard but they're working at making it easier because the devs listen to the community They won't compromise on this being an obligate 4-player experience so they helped set up a community on discord to find squads But if you think you can accomplish any difficulty beyond the easiest without a 3 or 4 man squad then you're going to waste allot of time dying over and over This game is HARD Friendly fire isn't just on it's amplified Ammunition isn't just scarce there's actively not enough by design The Enemy aren't just hard to kill they're hard to see aim at and even hit and that's when they're inactive sometimes The Premise of this game is simple enter a maze-like building accomplish your Objective(s leave Preferably alive But it's so hard this takes up to an hour or more especially on longer harder levels And they refresh and computer generate the levels every new season or so to keep it fresh You've got a variety of gun types and tools that are all incredibly powerful but there's so many enemies and they're hard enough to kill that it doesn't help This is true horror to me Not some pansy ass Run from the enemy and hide because you don't know how to throw a punch like most modern Horror hide and seek games are In this the tension and fear come not from being a helpless rabbit but from being strong while your enemy is far stronger It's exhilerating 2nd favourite horror game after Alien Isolation Nothing else gets and keeps you tense after many dozens of hours
it's alright i guess
it a good game
muy buen juego para jugar con amigos,la opresiva super recomendable
11 40 10
i LOVE HOW TACTICAL IT IS
GTFO is a perfectly designed game with no bugs whatsoever lol but its good for masochism level difficulty in a shooter
Doom aber du bist nicht Doomguy
good game
Great game but i dont have friends
Gameplay is very solid and enjoyable
Hard as my cock scarier than an STD
It's like playing destiny 2 raid crouching with knife without ammo and health Refunded
combines stealth and shooter game into one environment is creepy sound is great and it is very difficult which gives you and your team something to build toward
Play it without context if you love sci-fi and hard games you'll love it
too much fun
made my friends stressed out
1 saat bekledikden sonra oyun bulmayan bir var 4 ekibiniz varsa oyun tek tavsiye edilmez
Pretty much the dark souls of shooters Only downside is that you need friends
Just do what the title says and you win
Your team is your biggest enemy
I HATE THIS GAME But damn I love it so much
I love the atmosphere and the base game play But it is too difficult to play with bots I have no friends that have it and the matchmaking yields no results So unless you and a group of friends are buying it don't bother
Brutal dark confusing claustrophobic This game pulls you in and takes you for a ride Friends on chat basically required but its good
if you find someone in matchmaking buy a lottery ticket
Now this is GTFO gaming(dies
Hardcore
UI is trash not user friendly intentionally

i like it a lot its very scary and intense and the littleguys scary me a lot in all seriousness its a very cool game super polished and it gives this feeling of intense claustrophobia without even trying it feels like the monster thingies aren't trapped in there with you more like you and your team are trapped inside with them please check it out
Difficult but Amazing lol

This game is amazing best with friends but also by joining the GTFO discord you can matchmake with people from around the world Edit almost a year later Still a great game and I am not leaving it any time soon Edit 18/02/2025 I still love the game but the discord server is not what it was I now play it a lot less and stick to modded solo rundowns as from years of experience the community has gone down hill completely and now ceases to be what it once was Only buy this game if you have a solid group of 3 friends to play it with you or if you are a pure chad who likes an extreme solo challenge Probably gonna struggle when you hit R2D2 no not the astromech droid from starwars D Other than that smashing game 10/10 for me but seriously think about if this game is for you before you embark on your journey into the complex Additional note The in-game matchmaking system isn't great just use the rubble which is the discord server or buddy up with 3 friends for a great time for the best experience Seriously don't go in alone If you've read the whole review I appreciate you taking time out of your day to read my review and hope you found it helpful Review Rundown Complete
They're in the walls
good with friends
need friend or shit but the goods
Cudowna gra 10/10
bom pra perder quem ama muito bom
Awesome game play with friends always better with friends
I love this game but it was just better before rundown 6 This game had real potential on rundown 5 with great optimisation fun mechanics and great animations but now since rundown 6 the animations just feel worse the game runs much worse with me having to put everything on low to have it stable 60 while i could run rundown 5 on everything max let's not talk about the optimisation of the desert parts and the game also feels terrible to play as a client because somehow the netcode or something got worse r5 to r6 Now they're bringing back old rundowns but it's just not the same because it is on current r7 mechanics even with the changes they do to the difficulty on some levels It also does not feel fun to have an enemy running around you for 15 minutes and you can't kill him on r7e1 but the other e1 levels are fun
When hours of gaming on FPS genres don't save you
edit I just realised something I used to know what a game is because they showed the gameplay and i got it and i bought by whether it is fun or not to me now they all act as if i dont know act as if the pointless trailers show fun gameplay And it looks cool buy it So if i hit a minor issue the gameplay sucks SO This entire negative review is just 1 big thing to say I still dont know what the fun is cause if it was fun i'd fucking tolerate 24fps I got scammed again I need to test FCKING GAME IS THROWING ERRORS AGAIN OK SO FUUCKKK the game is ok as in Mediocre it does not need the graphics it carries for its gameplay It does need the animation tho Can't have a game like this look as goofy as L4D2 or Payday 2 I appreciate the graphics but not when it gets in the way of performance basically its big fights every zone and then 1 big rush getting out Problem is Mouse lag Or something Its responsive as fuck but i can't aim where i want it feels like I am missing the enemy many times people on youtube as well horizontally there is an issue People can't track targets won't be a problem in no lag fps games Like cs or some other games i keep forgetting now people think that means i am shit at FPS And while im not CSGO pro Why does it matter In any other fps game when there is no mouse lag I miss I learn I correct and when i miss i know i wasn't going slow I know i was goign way too fast here it felt like i needed to differentiate between mouse and crosshairs sort of like arma but arma gives you time to take aim i feel the need to complain because none knows what the fuck went wrong look the entire fun is I DONT KNOW ok Im not the dev but it feels like its mild fear which in the moment feels like it might kill you intense and gunplay against terrors unknown And right now im questioning myself even tho in memory im sure what happened cause i tested The mouse very weirdly was slow or fisheyed which is a sign of the graphics and animation was good so it gaslight me surely if it looks this good im at fault the guns are not ok And the stealth becomes waiting boredom way too fast edit over I bought this game cause it looked awesome but i was also scared I bought this game out of compulsion i did not understand what i bought and that was my reason to buy this then i read that Ulf anderson from the Bo and Ulf andreson brothers founders of overkill Ulf being the creative director of Payday quit payday 2 then after 2 yrs of consultant to payday made his company and this game apparently simon vilkund works on this too and he's known for being into Payday 2 so i guess he's into this too Anyway That gave me a bit of trust and i went in the objective how you win is go in complete objective gtfo the game is basically 3 parts Hide and seek using red light green light walk until the blind enemies pulse then stop until they stop over and over until you get close to them and then clobber them if you don't they will all rush you Save ammo keep doing this until you get to a part where you WILL trip the alarm and then its a horde mode firefight until you all complete a Hold the objective objective.doesn't feel like i can snap shot them easily feels like either the mouse is too slow or the enemies are too fast but if i can click on the icon on desktop with ease then how come its a speed issue basically repeat these 2 loop to get to the objective Then the extraction point And the 3rd thing is there to compliment this The terminal Its basically very simple dos List to see items query to find what zone they are in and ping to find the sub-zone in which the item is basically zones are numbers Say zone 49 and zones may or may not have sub-zones A-Z Ping helps you with that so this part of the game is.well if it wasn't there you'd be playing a chore having to basically smash all boxes until you get the item you needed which would be fustrating and if they straight told you it would be boring.for it to be a game there must be a loss and a win yet all you need to do to win is query objective and then ping objective the only way i can describe it is Use dos or get lost in an infinite maze you won't survive if you dont use it cause not enough ammo and its basically mission based like payday but has trees of it or something idk but each level is basically its own hiest in a sense So dont worry about it too much just keep doing individual levels for fun So that's the game hide and seek Go loud on alarms find objective extract use terminals to find the damn thing using very simple how does dos work gameplay Why the no Recommended 1060 my 1060 6gb is used 100 on high AND low And well it stutters now i didn't think it would be an issue since during combat who even remembers that well the alarm happened and i didn't know if the enemy swipped me my aim was shit the sometimes jittered and i missed my chance to shoot AND and I bought it so i could MAINLY play it solo and sometimes with friends I didn't look like an online only coop games like that have a warning HELL PoE could very easily be offline yet the first thing you notice is online only but this game is ONLINE ONLY the game quite literally won't start without an internet What happens when the net is down and i want to play what is this PUBG I CAN PLAY PUBG WITH BOTS CAUSE I HAVE FUCKING ARMA something like arma 3 doesn't have the nerve to go fully online but these new kids and the fucking retarded Dons in game publishing think they have the balls to go fully online like google services or something Anyway that's why the no It can't handle performance after being well Not a lot of things going on It looks very realistic but so does Death Stranding And not a drop So does dark souls not a drop and offline issue that should just be a minor issue realistically cause it doesn't stop me from playing the game The game is there and it is fun I think.altleast it isn't Guess what the game is or perform a perfect no hit run or its not fun and we will kill you later on but i have to put up with 1 more inconvenience I might as well just give up If im using this much effort and ignoring many MANY other things about life and game I might as well just shut up give up and just work on office stuff all day if im not working im working to get better at working OH and toxic userbase on steam They will gaslight the FUCK out of you my 2080 i7 cpu isn't giving me good frames what answer would you expect Why how that sounds bad nope I have a 2080 i have no issues That seems like YOU have an issue none else has issues like these so we will priorities a bug and if you have a 1050 not a 1060 god help you Lol 30 fps its more than you deserve with 1050 lol lol old useless hardware and they give out jester awards as a you are a joke thing i guess Eh the mark of a cult always proves my point Useless people who what kind of human even patrols the negative review section anyway no until it gets to a level i can be ok with online always is ok the performance its not THAT bad its more than playable with mostly 60 but the stutters so are damn frequent on all quality levels that seem to happen randomly that im scared a firefight the reason i bought the game the guns look cool will die for me Just guns and Lag anyway its early access right Still has a few years to go before ready
10/10 Lost all my friends on the first level
The best game to play with friends
hard times but fun times
pretty good game huh
GTFO is an extreme cooperative horror shooter that throws you from gripping suspense to explosive action in a heartbeat Stealth strategy and teamwork are necessary to survive in your deadly underground prison Work together or die together
Good Game makes you feel like you suck the entire time but then you win 10/10
Not fun nobody to play with spend hours waiting for a match
Yes
This game is dogshit
A great CO-OP game would only recommend to people with 3 friends who also own the game
gud
gud
une pure Masterclass
This Game is highly underwhelming with zero replay value do not purchase it
lubisz biec przez jak szalony tylko po to zes metr przed kiblem to ta gra jest dla Ciebie
Ammo way too sparse way too difficult for the first mission where you have to wipe 10 time before successfully completing it bad UI design
I finally found a group to play with This game is really cool and a fun coop experience To me it's like Left 4 Dead that requires stealth and real ammo management When you get hit you get hit hard This game requires a lot of coordination but ultimately is a rewarding experience
Absolute banger
All i can focus on is the monsters pussy lips on the heads teeth aside they look smashable af fr help me
Usually I'm not too fond of games like this however GTFO is a different breed By far the best horror shooting game ever Even though it is challenging if there is little communication with your teammates the tasks are thrilling and fun
SO HARD SO MUCH PAIN DIVE AGAIN
w game made me feel satisfied and pain
sneak around and bop monsters on the head
I just beat the first level
If you are into punishing yourself everyday then by all means go ahead
gam is good but ofc u need friends very hard and they have to be good at games as well even harder
fun good with friends
Fun with friends
Este juego esta muy padre tengo que admitir varias cosas entre ellas que es un juego que se tiene que jugar con amigos para sacar su potencial si no tienes con quien jugar o no eres alguien social no vas a disfrutar para nada este juego solo que seas un tryhard que le encanta sufrir solo y lograr cosas solo la opcion si no tienes con quien jugar es unirte a los discords de o para buscar alguien que quiera jugar Al momento de escribir esta puedo decir que es un juego muy bueno para comprarse ya que metieron las pasadas remasterizadas no se si son exactamente las mismas ya que no antes el juego pero ahorita el juego va a tener mucho material con que jugar durante el 2023 que recomiendo comprarlo para jugar las disponibles a la fecha de esta alt://R1 alt://R2 R7 Las primeras veces que juegues a este juego te ca**ras de miedo con los enemigos que te pero dependiendo de la frecuencia con que juegues te volveras mas tryhard y te empezaran a importar poco algunos de los puntos de sigilo dentro del juego yo si lo considera dentro de la de survival horror ya que tiene lo de todo un shooter un juego de terror coop y se tienen que cuidar los recursos lo que se pueda ya que usar un o municiones en el momento equivocado puede hacer que pierdas 3 horas de juego Yo en lo personal recomiendo este juego y lo siento muy divertido con una historia interesante y con potencial para ser que solo un juego

I am reviewing this as a semi beginner This review does not highlight pro strats or take into account what happens when you sink 900 hours into this game min-maxing your whole life What you should bring You are comfortable joining discords to find teammates or have friends who want to play with you You are capable of being a patient team player for up to two hours without breaks You are capable of dealing with difficulty and overcoming skill and rng-issues sometimes retrying levels many times You can deal with others fucking up once in a while and you are not a prick The occasional bug that ruins your run does not mentally destroy you You are capable of preserving ammo You are able to control yourself and not panic the instant you see something move For the love of god bring a mic your voice is not as bad as you think Nobody cares if you are 12 bro What the game has to offer Many pretty long and challening levels for you to play and reattempt a lot Well balanced weapons and tools loadouts No ingame microtransactions of any kind Nothing like vibrant pink weapon skins the atmosphere and vibe are very well preserved in this game This game makes you and your friends a better team Stealth stealth stealth and stealth Big battles where you not only have to stay alive but preserve as much ammo as you can too SHOULD YOU BUY THIS I am a university student so my budget is rather small If you are like me don't buy this game at full price Buy it at or below and MAX Make sure some of your friends are willing to buy it too or be willing to meet lots of new people EDIT This game is what happens when you mix PAYDAY with LEFT4DEAD and add difficulty
Too punishing I don't have time to bash my head against the wall
I like any game that treats the player like they've played games before
Great Game
Hammer go boop much fun
im going to kill myself
For a game that LOOKS extremely well-made its gameplay loop in unbelievably bland and boring Stealth feels out of place and unpolished which transitions into gunplay sections that are too brief and repetative to be enjoyable GTFO is a game that wanted to be both a shooter and a stealth-game but came short of excelling at either of the two since these two identities are at a constant war with each other
Fear incarnate The best atmosphere I have ever encountered in a game only rivaled by few Play it with friends or don't if you want to suffer
One of the few well made horror and Co-op games Very enjoyable with friends but I personally had issues getting 4 people together so just keep that in mind but the bots are surprisingly decent at times The game play itself is like no other and has a good balance between sci-fi and realistic Recommended
Very fun even for me playing for 26 hours I've still got tons of learning to do None of it is easy of course it's a constant learning experience and failures only lead to a greater success just so you know I may not make it out ali Screams Unintelligible Augh Noooooo
it is fun game
The best FPS co-op game that exists
Terror GOD
uh
Yes
gtfo
i cant understand why do pople say this game is good graphics look like a 2010 game matchmaking is very poor if you want a teammate you gotta joind its discord and start searching there the only good thing about this game is its atmospher and its consept other than that waste of time
scary AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
we goin in sneaky beaky like
The creators are clearly passionate about this game The way it has advanced since release is fantastic Amazing game intense experience and extremely fun to play with friends
great fun
This game is visually great The game play is great You need at least two humans to play You can then use two bots with limited issue IF you do not have immense patience do NOT play this game IF you do not like to stealth about 85 of the time do NOT play this game This is NOT a guns blazing situation You will not progress without patience IF you do not have at least one reasonably smart friend to play with do NOT play this game My husband and I play this game together We are very good at gaming and this game is challenging for us this is not a brag.just truth)We have about 55 years of gaming experience between us We have 20 hours in game so far and we are on the third level on the first mission Make sure your friendship is decently solid You will yell at each other You will blame each other for things that the other may or may not have done The frustration is real What worked on one level will most likely not work on the next You will have to put thought into equipment and strategy for each level You will most likely fail each level multiple times before you succeed When you do make it through a level you will feel amazing I personally love that you have to change things up and plan ahead and have new strats for each level The only bug we have encountered is Mouse will freeze up at random times Example You will be about to hit a creature with say your hammer and instead of charging it hits as soon as you click and hold Which causes a shit storm Other than that every problem is one we accidentally cause lol I think this game is worth the price The devs are very involved The sounds are things of nightmares as are the creatures Highly recommend if you have the things I HIGHLY suggest I hope this helps you to decide if this game is for you
good game very hard
The game is fun so GTFO of this review section and buy the game

Buenardo
Amazingly cinematic and refreshing with every level It has core mechanics is very simple repetitive It is not going to give you an incredible amount of variety but it is definitely fun to play and you start hoping it doesn't Fun game
I'm gay haha
10 10
possibly one of my favourites games of recent very tough and atmospheric the tension doesn't just come from the horrific enemy designs or the claustrophobic tunnels but the very real possibility that one wrong move or bad strategic decision could end up in your entire team dying i love this game to bits
Hardcore Survival Coop Game with zombies and lots of environmental hazards If anything in that sentence doesn't make you smile you're dumb
Too difficult and unforgiving Imagine playing Chess against a computer that was permanently set at Grand-Master level and you were just learning the game No fun at all Unlike other games on the market this game cannot be tailored to allow players to adjust the difficulty of the AI gameplay etc I am sure the developers see this as a unique selling point and wanted to giver players a challenge but the formula that is tried and tested with other games is to allow difficulty to be chosen and adjusted by the player who after all pay for the game and so surely its up to them how they want to play it Rookie Regular Veteran etc therefore making the game suitable for all abilities 2 friends and I have played this in Co-Op many times and find it very frustrating We take our time and are careful and try and be stealthy and manage inventory etc and yet will die before reaching the end of the map We try again and fail again and again Everything is trial and error how to stop certain alarms finding items retrying the same missions over and over only to fail 13 Hours of our lives wasted and it doesn't feel like it was fun or well spent time It stopped being enjoyable We play it anymore simple
lmfao good luck
1 nike but 1 schwer
Kann man sich mal geben im Team als auch Solo man muss sich als allerdings erstmal reinarbeiten und braucht etwas Geduld Das Spielprinzip wiederholt sich halt und wird je nach Level dementsprechend schwer und zwar richtig schwer wo taktisches und strategisches Denken gefordert wird Zeit solltest Du da auch mitbringen eine Runde kann vor allem in den schweren Level schon mal 3 Stunden gehen und es gibt trotz Checkpoints keine zum Zwischenspeichern Wenn man es dann mal raus hat macht es zwar Laune aber ist mich nur was zwischendurch gibt aber auch Leute die damit mehrere 1000 Stunden verbringen welche euch gerne helfen Sonst Gameplay ist okay kein nerviges Leveln und Looten einfach altmodisch und klassisch je weiter Du kommst umso schwerer wird es Grafik und Design sind grade mal 15gb sehr die Monster und Umgebung insofern man denn mal was sieht D sehen wirklich gut aus aber man hat es schnell gesehen Auf jeden Fall kein Hau Drauf Shooter wo Du ballernd durch die Gegend rennst es ist ein First Person Strategiespiel und mit Sicherheit nicht jedermanns Sache Durch das wieder der aller ersten beiden Rundowns hat man jetzt auch ein relativ angenehmes nicht zu schweres Gameplay indem vorausgesetzt man kennt die Basics die ersten Level Solo zu schaffen sind Auf dem GTFO Discord Server findet man Spieler die einem die Basics insgesamt eine nette Community Dennoch ist es meiner Meinung nach am besten ein festes Team von mindestens 3 Leuten zu haben mit denen Du spielst sonst macht es wahrscheinlich schnell keinen mehr

hayvan gibi zor ama
very good and enjoyable game
E
The game does an exceedingly poor job of explaining basic mechanics E.g fields of view special enemies how to stop certain alarms Everything has to be found by trial and error retrying the same missions over and over The game also uses lengthy stealth sections which make this cycle feel all the more tedious The lack of clarity was acceptable when this game was very early alpha but for new players coming in now or for experienced players picking it back up after a long break it makes for a deeply unpleasant experience
takes like half a year to matchmake for some fuckin reason
No
gud game very scary
3/10 First the game was seriously good the atmosphere in this is dark strange and good in the same time,characters are well written Woods Dauda Hacket and Bishop all of them are prisoners of the warden and apperantly its a goddamn chip in our heads and not a person However Company that made this game for NO FOKIN REASON DELETED THE ORIGINAL RUNDOWNS and after that made them all over again Many ranged weapons but only 4 melee Me goin through the rundown 1 with just bots and completing it with no problem but after that rundown 2,3,4,5,6,7 In rundown 2 i got stuck on r2d2 and i needed help with r2c2 because its a loud mission for no reason.Now R2D2 This is where the game started to be idioticly hard Like no joke these fokin reactors levels after rundown one are seriously bad For no fokin reason you need to go through rooms to get a code for the fokin reactor First i liked them and now i hate them and because of Mike who was complaining so much that i started to hate them even more Rundown 3 was ok rundown and rundown 4 i am stuck on E1 R5 is the WORST Hard as all hell and many loud missions Me and Mike managed to get to D1 level and this is where the game and bots are glitched bots wont go to the alarm scan zones and thats why we lost that rund and after that i crashed Rundown 6 is the rundown that i like the most finaly some good story and how the infection got into our world and rundown 7 that is somewhere between bad and good Some of the missions also have secondary or third objective that is not needed to complete the mission BUT IF YOU DO THEM YOU GET NOTHING USELESS Also most of the rooms in the rundown are just copied Not to even mention all of the missions can take up to 1 2 hours and the objectives are also almost the same Now infected aka sleepers most of them can be triggered by walking by them and shooting BUT SOMETIMES A SLEEPER WAKES UP FOR NO FOKIN REASON When i kill an enemy I dont mean like 5 metes but like 20 metes away from me Now their what they are basic striker melee and shooter shoots at ya And there are also their big versions Now special infetced spitter cant be killed and vomits infection at ya infection reduces your hp Scout summons more sleepers if triggered Mother SPAWNS FOKIN BABIES Shoot her belly to kill her and QUICK Tank Can be only killed from behind and is though as hell Snatcher he takes your teammates away from ya This is my favourite enemy but only because Mike got scared when we first foud out about him Chargers My nemesises because they dont have head critbox and also there are scout versions of them and big ones too Invisible enemies they also have scouts and big ones Now bossfights Queen mother more hp and also spawns babies Kraken boss fight of r6 Immortal he is what he is you cant kill him and is on r7E1 More to the bad parts Bots sometimes they are so stupid that they go on the otherside of the closed doors and they dump all of their resourses into someone they prefer players and sometimes it doenst even look like they are shooting luckily they cant get detected even if you are moving THAT IS THE ONLY because most of the time they just die to a big striker like what happened to me they just stand and are getting hit Now to the matchmaking you need to matchamake through their discord to play with players because matchmaking doenst work GG 10 chambers for being stupid like seriously This game also has A BIG PROBLEM WITH CRASHES I was waiting for Mike to join the game and after 20 mins it just crashes Update rundown 8 is trash And the difficutly Its hard af stupidly hard af The difficulty at first was fun to play against and after my 100 hours in game i completly hated it Those last 200 hours i was replaying rundown either with Mike or all other players this game is dead for a fokin reason In short Confusing story in the rundowns anyway Stupid difficutly no proper ai for the bots many glitches and no proper rewards I wanted to like this game This game is deserved 3/10
fking love this game
Je viens de terminer GTFO et j'ai u]vraiment par ce jeu b]Ce que j'ai b list immersive et oppressante Les difficiles qui m'ont L'action palpitante qui m'a constamment sur mes gardes list b]Ce que j'ai moins b list Certains environnements devenaient un peu list b]Conclusion b Dans l'ensemble GTFO est un jeu immersive et exigeant que je recommande u]vivement[/u aux fans du genre
amazing for stealth gameplay
I just let my friends do the stealth parts for me
great with friends but it would be impossible alone and annoying with randos
v
traumatic
Yikes
I enjoy GTFO I'd like to be good at it one day
The checkpoint system will make you fight harder for your life when shit goes wrong than if you were being attacked by a grizzly bear in real life
10/10 will continue to play
gg
Unique playing experience enjoyed this game tremendously could not recommend highly enough
Como persona que tiene mucho sexo a toda hora puedo decir que este juego es 100 parecido a tener sexo con una mujer como yo siempre hago Obviamente este juego no me puso caliente no soy gay yo tengo mucho sexo con mujeres reales como para gastar de 15 minutos en este juego Por otro lado me gustaria recomendar este juego a la gente que no tiene sexo no como yo porque yo tengo mucho sexo con mujeres mucho como si hubiese una mujer desnuda y desnuda Ella se ve como una de mis varias novias con la que tuve mucho sexo He tenido mucho sexo soy muy guapo y las mujeres SIEMPRE quieren tener sexo conmigo porque soy muy musculoso y guapo y muy bueno en los videojuegos Todas mis novias dicen que soy muy bueno en el sexo y jugando videojuegos y siendo guapo Una de mis enamoradas me tener sexo con ella pero le dije que estaba jugando un juego de sexo y a llorar y se hizo lesbiana y se porque no tuve sexo con ella Tengo sexo con mujeres no con hombres no soy gay Soy muy cool y guapo que las chichas siempre quieren tener sexo conmigo porque soy muy cool y sexy Mi pene es muy grande A todas mis novias les gusta mi pene porque es muy grande y soy muy bueno en el sexo y lo soy tengo mucho sexo soy muy guapo y sexy y tengo mucho sexo
Very tough but fun to play with friends

Das schwerste Spiel in dem ich schlecht bin ich liebe es
Ah
c'est l'enfer
died with my own tripmine 10/10
this game is like if all of l4d2 took place in florida
It's fun with friends Main downside of the game is matches take a long time to complete and you can't just leave and continue them later
hereby sentence you to ten unsupervised minutes with Hillary Please street judge Bezos Have then I hereby commute your sentence to indefinite indentured A
Testei no final de semana quando estava de muito maneiro Mas precisa de amigos para ficar melhor a gameplay jogar sozinho tem tanta
sorry to say this but i do not recommend game mainly because matchmaking 40min waiting times is just toooo long bots are stupid and when i do get into match it lasts average 20min and then most players leave and then u wait another 30,40min until they solve server and matching problems its a big NO
Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE challenging games It is very rewarding and fun for me to get better and be good at difficult games GTFO just felt like a hard game that was not going to be fun at all to get good at Your character and actions are just so damn slow You run slow you can't reload while you are running shit you basically can't do ANYTHING while you are running The sprint speed in this game is one of the slowest I've seen in any game I've played You run faster in Tarkov with 50 kg worth of crap on your PMC Not to mention this game just feels lifeless and soulless I mean I can't tell most rooms apart from one another and I can't tell any two enemies apart from one another The game just has no character or charm in any capacity Is this game challenging Yes would it be enjoyable to get good at I highly doubt that and even if it would be there are so many other great games that are challenging and an absolute blast to get really good at Me and my friends have never been more confident in a refund than we were in GTFO and the game can do just as it's name states GTFO
super fun strategic and scary game great for people who enjoy cooperative play and gritty shooters
Esse jogo dificil pra um cacete achei interessante porem mt dificil os inimigos lembram os estaladores do the last of us
You'll think you're doing good but 10 seconds later you're dead 10/10
If you like L4D you'll love this game just keep one thing in mind tho is to always have fun and keep your awareness high with your buds If you think is pricey you can always come back for sales
Get The Fuck Out
Too spooky scary and hard had to refund would recommend
is cool game where you gtfo and doesnt afraid of anything
im bad
Muy clave para jugar con amigos un coop hardcore recomendadisimo

Wenn man ein anspruchsvolles Koop-Spiel sucht und drei Freunde kann dann ist GTFO ein top Spiel Es ist zwar hart und verzeiht selbst kleine Fehler meistens nicht aber wenn man sich darauf dann kann man viele Stunden reinstecken Das ist am Anfang etwas aber nach einer Zeit kommt man damit zurecht Nur Schade das man limitiert nutzbare Boosts nicht wirklich die Freiheit hat die Waffen anzupassen und man kann nicht wirklich neue Sachen Kleidung freischalten Alles im allen ein tolles Spiel aber es ist halt etwas teurer ist als die Konkurrenz andere Koop-Spiele
What dose tentacles do
very fun also i got blue balled buy one of those sleeping aliens i just couldent help myself
A Good Stealth/Guns Blazing game That improves with friends A Good Note Is That You Will Need A Decent Pc To Run This Game
This is the type of game that is absolutely fun to play solo until its not Anything beyond the B section of the rundowns are nearly impossible to solo The bots are slightly better since launch but still have a ways to go They still routinely run though doors that you're closing or stand right in front of sentries They also auto use items if you move too far from them can be a death knell for a solo run and don't seem to respond to the preset text communications aside from dropping sentries mines or foam Make no mistake this is indeed a hardcore game and its built around having 4 players with good communication skills The movement's very realistic for someone carrying weapons and gear I'd say this is about as far away from call of duty as a FPS can get in the best way possible Visibility is often near 0 and monsters can kill you in seconds if your not careful You can only keep one pickup item at a time Fog repellent Glow sticks mines foam High viz light plus only one Health Ammo or Tool refill at a time Managing what to divvy out is key to survival There are levels with toxic fog that will whittle your health to 20 and its not uncommon to sink 45 minutes into a game only to fail I highly recommend looking up the commands for the terminals you'll find ahead of time some shortcuts are lifesavers I think this is why i keep coming back to the game Its a good challenge and the difficulty never lets up I do hope they focus a little bit more on the solo side of things as it gets very unbalanced the farther in you get A good example of the unbalanced solo stuff is the Alt 2 B level where you have to unlock a sec door that spawns lots of monsters for like 5 minutes eats 90 of all team member ammo and about 100 of sentry ammo and then they chuck like 20 huge monsters at you all at once while your trying to extract it just seems like they haven't tested it at all with solo players All my friends are deeply afraid of this game as it appears too hardcore for some 45 min time investments are hard to sell and the matchmaking just does not appear to work for me Even on the quick play option not one person joined my lobby after a half an hour If they fix the matchmaking and add more solo based gameplay options i think this game would do twice as well as it has been I should also mention that it runs very very well for such a good looking game I've played this on a 3070 nearly maxed out at 1440p and I was getting nearly 100fps After switching to a 3080ti its been running 60fps at 4k nearly flawlessly with everything cranked to max This type of slow methodical gameplay lends itself well to 4k 60 and the extra details really add to the immersion Anyone whos a fan of realistic shooters should pick this up especially if you actually have friends just don't plan of using the in game matchmaking unless you use discord
intense hard terrifying and a whole lot of fun 8.5/10
game is a banger with friends Did make me lethargic after a while though
not a fan but i play it with friends
fun if you actually have friends to play with and can get them to actually play and work together
Tedious dungeons Literal crawler pacing Bots will fail extractions and players are few and far between for matchmaking Blinding back lights and fog that obscures your own lights Characters repeat the same lines upon every enemy entering LOS Audio mixing is med Drops will shatter your ear drums and every swing of your melee will start fight music even if there are no enemies left Mission objectives are blended into environment with little indication as to the objects even look like Confusing and repetitive ambiance TL:DR It's red light/green light with I Spy mixed with bad DOOM clone
This game is just really really hard I want to like it so bad but it feels like the QA group was a bunch of payday experts instead of average players Please consider making a better difficulty scaling system
Enemies are naked
AMAZING
A great game for my grown up children and I to get together with and plan an sneak about together very good for building communication and strategy skills
Fun not for kids and a very VERY communication essential game where you need to talk to your teammates in order to be able to beat levels
Mal otimizado
its pretty fun needs better matchmaking tho i absolutely recommend
This game has the potential to be so much more by having more people be interested in it I really think the game limits itself by the amount of pride it seems to have for being a game that HAS to be played by four people If the devs wanted they could have so many more people playing this game if there was difficulty scaling dependent on the party size People who don't have friends that want to play this game shouldn't be punished for it EDIT they added bots
Still early days as I've only played around 3hrs However so far what I've played I've loved The game is definitely balanced around multiplayer The bots are good for filling a slot as a semi-disposable meat-shield but not much else Sadly this means that solo is near impossible to do but it's not stopping me trying The key parts of the game are definitely stealth and resource management as a player you need to foster patience as rushing around will just get you killed Learn to use the terminals and the map They'll help you find the resources you need and coordinate with other players Picked it up for and got a great survival horror game with intense combat
Ooga booga is broken You'll understand if you play In all respect though this games is hella fun Frustrating but hella fun
Challenging gameplay fantastic atmosphere Matchmaking is still in alpha and that's the only drawback So far it's been a fair chunk of waiting for a lobby Joining the official discord circumvents this problem and the community is very welcoming If you got friends that are interested this for sure a must-play coop experience
we weren't able to GTFO
D
only good if you have friends to play with
it is very good and i love the big black guys that try to lick you
made my pelvic floor shatter and now when i hear the letters G T F or O i instantly piss my self
40
Really suck at it but damn this gameplay so good Sad I don't have some friends to play with
The hit boxes might be janky and the mob placing might be even more asinine but what other scary stealth game is going to make me feel as satisfied in winning with my friends in a red light green match for an hour and 30 minutes
dont wake them
This game is great visuals and atmosphere are done extremely well gameplay is fun and simple difficulty is done near perfection Audio is done extremely well too as all of the guns have a unique sounds and can be recognized performance was smooth all through out My only issue with the game is the matchmaking sucks As an online only game unless you plan to play with bots the matchmaking isn't the greatest and will need a dedicated group of friends as the missions take about an hour to complete They do have a discord to find a dedicated group but is better with friends overall 8.8/10 only main issue is the matchmaking but if you have a group of friends willing to play and sink in some hours you should be fine
its scary asf i would recomend playing with others who know what they are doing and have already played the game very stressful but really fun overall
One the best and most challenging CO OP games ever made and a must for SC FI horror fans
This is definitely one of the games of all time 10/10
Why do they have fat asses
I keep coming back to it I just can't help myself It is the best experience that proves you have no idea how to survive a true horror scenario
absolutely amazing
GTFO is a game that definitely could have been good great even but I really don't think it's worth your time or money Despite a strong first few hours as you acquaint yourself with the game systems and enemies the experience of actually sitting down to the game becomes a repetitive chore extremely quickly The approach to absolutely every problem is nearly identical the weapons are hit-and-miss as far as feel goes and what little context you're provided with is not only very poorly presented with voice-acting straight from The Scenery Chewer's Guide to Overdoing It but also has little-to-no reflection in the environment which given its anonymous aesthetic and lack of integration with the telling of the story feels procedurally generated even though I'm given to understand that it was not If you can sustain yourself through the repetitive trudge of the primary loop with nothing but the barest mechanical escalation and piss-weak context that roundly fails to tie it all together there is a solid foundation here Once you've found a gun that feels right for you the shooting usually feels good and the atmosphere is for the first few levels you play consistently oppressive and really rather solid But GTFO only has one mood oppressive Were it a single player game it might feel genuinely horrifying and legitimately desperate But the multiplayer barrier to entry and the episodic nature of the mission-based format gives rise to my main issue you never feel genuinely trapped Because of the episodic nature of the missions within the rundowns we leave at the end of every mission and go back in at the start of the next one and any sense of hopeless isolation is irretrievably lost That episodic mission-based framing doesn't work as well here as it does in an aesthetically grim game mission-based multiplayer shooter like Darktide though because Darktide is in fact a very silly game with a great deal of humour in its world even if it is only sporadically successfully funny GTFO has no such tonal contrast in its presentation and the inherent sense of detachment the format is therefore catastrophic to the intended oppressive tone for me Ultimately it's the sort of thing that would benefit from a sequel or remake add some even halfway-decent story context and integrate it with the environment in a way that is meaningful and you could have something genuinely special But GTFO is ultimately extremely unspecial with nothing really to recommend it other than it's very difficult and acceptably passes the time between cradle and grave
A GREAT GAME THE DARK SOULS OF FPS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
PAIN they touch me a lot
simple Get The F*ck Out or you will rage SIMPLE BOOMER
SHIT I DIED TO A REEEEEEEEEEEALLY LONG TONGUE
This is the best game I suck at
me gustan las mascaras
Don't buy this game for now I like the idea and how it should play out Unfortunately there are lots of issues The most annoying things for me and my friends atleast You cannot pickup and drop any packs for usage so you have to run back to the very start and swap packs as you go with the ones you find later It makes it a whole slog and is annoying You cannot place the stupid big lamp on the floor Like why even put it in the game Flashing with it isn't that good either Sometimes small critters spawn very close to players when they switch rooms quickly through running

GIVE ME BACK MY SOUL
Amazing job by 10CC with Rundown 8 Totally exceeded my expectations
Best game i suck at
One of the best games I have played in a while Game will beat you down and really live up to the challenge the devs say it is But just like anything else commitment is what allows you to overcome the obstacle and most importantly BE BETTER I will always hold my head high when talking about GTFO and the work the devs put in to give us such an amazing experience Thank you very much Ten Chambers
No difficulty control I can't do it with friends who aren't good at it
Great atmospheric game with incredible sound and object design The cosmetic update slaps and it encourages you to make your way through the game The only major issue it has is that it's hard very hard especially if you don't know what you are doing by being new to the game or have a lack of players in your lobby 3 people are advised That being said overall I can recommend this game if you've got 2 friends to play with and like something challenging to do as a group activity A nice tactical shooter for people that are into this kind of gameplay
My name is Walter Hartwell White I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Albuquerque New Mexico 87104 This is my confession If you're watching this tape I'm probably dead murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist Shortly after my 50th birthday Hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world Connections that he made through his career with the DEA I was astounded I I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was thrown confused but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family Hank took me on a ride along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make And I was weak I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed Every day I think back at that moment with regret I quickly realized that I was in way over my head and Hank had a partner a man named Gustavo Fring a businessman Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man and when I tried to quit Fring threatened my family I didn't know where to turn Eventually Hank and Fring had a falling out From what I can gather Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business to which Fring flatly refused to give him and things escalated Fring was able to arrange uh I guess you call it a hit on my brother-in-law and failed but Hank was seriously injured and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over 177,000 Upon recovery Hank was bent on revenge working with a man named Hector Salamanca he plotted to kill Fring and did so In fact the bomb that he used was built by me and he gave me no option in it I have often contemplated suicide but I'm a coward I wanted to go to the police but I was frightened Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA and about that time to keep me in line he took my children from me For 3 months he kept them My wife who up until that point had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what I had done why Hank had taken our children We were scared I was in Hell I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family Recently I tried once again to quit to end this nightmare and in response he gave me this I can't take this anymore I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me or worse hurt my family I All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is

THIS GAME'S PERFECT 10/10
yeah sh was alright
supply nda cukup bro
A game that truly delivers EXACTLY what it promises A true co-op thriller/shooter that is relentlessly challenging and demands co-operation and coordination between you and 3 friends It demands the upmost attention from every teammate and careful planning of equipment resource allocation and target prioritization Gameplay is smooth immersive and intense at all times and have yet to run into a single glitch The dev's perfectly executed on a vision the only question is if you happen to be a person who likes that vision I personally love it and there is not other game like it on the market I would NOT get this game if you don't have at least 2 other friends to play with or if you don't enjoy a challenge This game is not easy and is never going to be a casual game to just breeze through It's hard by design and if you don't like that you won't like this game
hard and scary a great game i suck at partially cos i have no friends and theres no difficulty scaling
EPIC AWESOME GAME FUN

Scary at first but funny now cause i realise im shit
Realized there's no progression system Without Progression the game feels a little pointless You can Customize your character After every successful mission you unlock new gear pieces but they're pretty much trash This game takes so long with the missions that just playing 3-4 matches put me at 6 hours Which means I can't get a refund for this game
pra jogar com os amigos
Good Mechanics terrible deaths Just remember to scream into to mic for your team to hear you clearly then just run it back again
its all about teamwork,if you have no friends then get some because that's a huge requirement for this game
repetitive game play and small player base would not recommend
COMPRALO
Sehr gutes Coop Spiel zwar selbst zu Viert noch recht schwer aber machbar Alleine zu Spielen macht recht wenig Sinn und Sehr gelungen was ich nur noch eine Abwechselung an Waffen und ein Modifikationssystem bzw Forschungssystem z.B Spezialwaffen etc muss es aber nicht haben oder bekommen Kann das Spiel nur weiter empfehlen
there is no point to playing this there is no real objective to the game at all you earn nothing from doing anything in the game the lighting is terrible and so are the weapons no such thing as survival and or skill just terrible
git gud son

Juego que te vas a pasar mas que bien si vas a jugar con amigos porque jugarlo solo creeme que es como jugar en rust contra un clan de 30 tios te vas a cabrear vas a cagarte en dios y seguramente le metas unas hostias a la mesa que el vecino te va a recordar me tire mas de 20m y no encontre a nadie con quien poder jugar en modo coop con algun random lo dicho lo recomiendo si vas a jugar con amigos porque te lo vas a pasar a lo grande tiene un factor de terror enorme que me recuerda mucho salvando las distancias obviamente a dead space te da miedo avanzar por lo que pueda pasar dicho esto Feliz navidad perros
GTFO is an immersive first-person shooter that distinguishes itself by putting an emphasis on strategy stealth and working as a team The developers have clearly put a lot of effort into creating an immersive experience the UI sounds story graphics and stealth mechanics mesh together perfectly Unfortunately as expressed from other reviews Ii you're planning to play with less than 4 people the experience is weighed down by a number of issues mostly related to the ai I would mostly recommend buying this game if you have a group of at least 3 people I was only able to play it with one other person I also enjoy playing single-player Consider the following issues The bots will steal any resources from lockers if you step too far away The bots are completely inefficient with resources I don't mind when the bots accidentally step in front of gunfire while hordes of enemies are attacking at a time understandable The main issue with the bot pathing is during the stealth segments The bots would often walk in front of players while lining up both melee attacks and gun shots which was incredibly frustrating and immersion-breaking Missions which require an b]item[/b be brought from one location to another do not mesh well with the ai The players can tell a bot to hold the b]item[/b but said bot has deployable equipment ie a turret they will refuse to pick the equipment up when told The bot will also automatically drop the b]item[/b when monsters are aggro'd Normally this is not an issue but if you need to bring the b]objective[/b to a location while being chased by enemies only the player would be capable of carrying it because the ai will refuse to pick it up The levels are littered with alarm doors that only open when the players have stood on specific locations in the room Instead of standing on the positions that would turn the alarm off the bots follows the player like lemmings If any character has been downed the bots will all simultaneously prioritize reviving despite the fact that having all 3 teammates reviving 1 person does not revive any faster This is often run-ending They will not stop saying the same 3 voice lines Never give Dauda the bio-tracker I find the most fun comes from coordinating melee attacks on sleeping enemies and splitting up to clear a room while playing multiplayer Unfortunately the bots will not do anything while undetected I wish the countdown function worked with the bots b]DESPITE ALL OF THIS,[/b I still enjoy playing every now and then for a super quick 2 hour session I can't deny how intriguing the story is and how enjoyable the game is despite the issues I greatly recommend this to anyone willing to drop 32
actually prety hard god dammit
4 2 3 4
this is a great game and checks so many boxes for a claustrophobic thriller game you know your probably not going to survive right from its introduction to a new map it already makes you feel very uncomfortable by strapping you into a pod with no protection from outside elements and thrusting you down into a deep tunnel where the light of day has long since been a distant memory at a frighteningly fast speed and all that you can see is a progressively increasing blur of cavernous walls with infectious materials growing from the cracks your only salvation from that beginning experience is the pods finally beginning to slow down and you can see your destination like an eerie light at the end of a tunnel right from the get go you know you aren't regarded as a tactical asset you are just cannon fodder and the game does its best to make sure you know that the maps are dark and you are very much out of your element and you are given a short list of tasks to accomplish before you are permitted to leave the hell hole and while the maps are interesting to navigate the procedural generated maps do become slightly repetitive after a while but this factor however is compensated with its computer interaction program which makes player feel much more like you are a bit more competent in navigating the map nearly every room has its own challenge and unlocking each one is slightly anxiety inducing your flash light is your best friend and your worst enemy rivalled only by your ammo capacity you cant be careless in this game it takes patience and team work from start to finish you can clear a room only to return to it later with new threats in the area so there isn't any casual roaming after you have cleared the area if I had any gripes for the game is that you can sometimes sneak your way to your goal with very opposition if you work together but once your done with your main task I haven't had one clean sneak away undetected yet for me it was always a frantic blitz of screaming enemies that fire magic homing light emitting projectiles that almost never miss their target which is you.and the monsters ranged attacks don't just chip away at their target again you they knock off 40 hp most of the time which wouldn't be a problem if you could just kill the enemy with a few bullets but these little bastards have weak points in randomised different areas that look like a grotesque raspberry like infection even blowing their heads off isn't always the end for them if you like an intense team focused game then I would highly recommend this game to you Just know that its best taken in small doses and probably not the best marathon game session
PLAYED 8 HOURS ONLY SURVIVED R1A1 great game

None of my friends want to buy this game
Extremely challenging but extremely rewarding survival horror FPS Game demands perfect play from its players and isn't for the faint of heart If you have a solid group of 3 other friends that are committed to learning it together and trying to beat it then you will have a ton of fun This could be one of the best coop games on steam Work together or die together
I died a lot 10/10 brb trying again
It is a hard game to get a hang of but it is entirely worth playing The atmosphere and setting of the game is only enhanced by lack of experience with it's mechanics Just don't forget to turn off your flashlight please
No es un juego para jugar si no tienes un grupo de gente con la que te comunicando constantemente pero si lo tienes es una experiencia Partidas largas y con poco de error te va a poner de los nervios pero jugado con la gente adecuada es un 10/10 si buscas un shooter cooperativo de este estilo
Amazing game to play with friends
pain
pure awesomeness
I have not done much with this game but it was a very intense and satisfying session It takes some practice and teamwork buts its a very fun and engaging co-op game
Safest and most ordinary NYC neighbourhood
Only get if you have friends to play with Online matchmaking is dead
GTFO It stands exactly for the acronym and is the only thought I have when playing this game So I will rate this game on a few scales They will be gameplay multiplayer gameplay overall mood while playing and mechanics Gameplay 9/10 Everything that happens is truly based on your actions If you screw up you pay the consequences of having your booty hole tickled by the whipping tongues of the monsters Only thing is sometimes the heads of scouts will go into a barrier while moving and it can make you hit the barrier and alert a horde of booty tickling men Naruto running towards you Multiplayer 10/10 Multiplayer is amazing and I think the overall tactics needed between all 4 of the players is super cool and can be difficult Don't let that one kid called Jerome play because he will forget to pick up and place his sentry on the extraction scan Overall Mood This can vary between a 3/10 to a 10000/10 The 3/10 is when you fail a run 5 times in a row and are just dying to finish tonight Just like me trying to finish with my lawyers have advised me not to finish this joke It is very frustrating to restart a whole run because of one screw up but that is just the game and it makes it really fun The 10000/10 moments are when you ace a run by doing it first try or barely making it out alive This will keep your adrenaline up Mechanics 7/10 A few mechanics are kinda game breaking and I think needs changed However there are very few 1 The sledgehammer is a great melee weapon don't get me wrong But it needs a tad bit more length It's hit range is a lot shorter than you'd expect Like yeah 3 inches is quite huge for some things but a sledgehammer isn't one of them And also sometimes I swear the hitboxes are a little janky for you characters since a tongue will tickle you too far to the left or right and you still get hit Even sometimes it happens through walls which isn't too big of an issue since it usually happens around corners but I'd love to see it patched Overall Score 10/10 This is a definite buy I recommend getting it on sale since it usually goes on sale but I would even pay the 40 for it BUT PLEASE HAVE FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH OR JOIN THE GTFO COMMUNITY DISCORD TO FIND SOME This game sucks by yourself because that's how most games are Additional thoughts There should be a dating sim for the 4 prisoners you play has AKA Woods Dauda Hackett and Bishop I would pay good money for a game like that Plus some people can live up to their kink of getting tentacled by scouts and get their booty tickled by the booty ticklers
Brings something to the table nothing else really does for me Love it
Imagine the best game you have played This is 10x better
Also habe es als Weihnachtsgeschenk bekommen und ich muss sagen das es mich positiv hat Es ist ein schweres Spiel aber mit Freunde oder Randoms die auch wirklich im Team arbeiten macht es sehr viel Es ist aber definitiv nichts Leute die ein schnellen Shooter spielen wollen wallahi isch euch 10/10
GTFO lo sin esperar nada y me con un juego completo absorbente y demandante Todo lo que fue con un compadre y la verdad se disfruta cada segundo A tener en cuenta que va a recibir aun as contenido lo cual deja lugar a mucho potencial
Big giga demon monsters will hit you like Mike Tyson
The Best Game You Suck At
hardcore stealth shooter with missions 2 hours long and no friends willing to play it was capable to finish only A and B missions with bots Atmospheric gameplay online meh found game only once had to use discord and social engineering to involve more people in it will you be able to bring 2-3 people with you if so get it
Hammer geiles Spiel vor allem wenn man es mit Freunden zockt

after 10H we stayed stuck in R1A1 still first map this game is insane great horror game
Great with friends
very scare
Mediocre game with pretty graphics Repetitive and boring even with friends
Skill issue the game
I can understand the appeal players may find with GTFO but it did not click for me GTFO is a more stealthy slow-paced approach to the Left 4 dead style gameplay I found the lack of a difficulty setting combined with the fact that enemies do not scale the game does tell you this and encourages you to use the GTFO discord to match up with people made playing with only one friend frustrating The bots are not terrible so others may disagree but i found the lack of difficulty scaling whether you're playing alone or in a group of 4 to lead to many wipes and ultimately i did not find the level design and variety entertaining enough to stick with it and get better
This game is like sex It's in your face and consistently questioning your partners positioning
bonne ambiance level design convaincant et des combats tendus je recommande vivement
hard to find way
if violently removing squatters from my new york apartment is the game then the average land lord is my name
nice
I cannot recommend purchasing GTFO despite it being a decent game As of recently it was announced that GTFO has entered the end stages of development and will be releasing one more rundown some time in 2023 After this the game will be completed and 10 Chambers will begin to focus on other efforts This is shocking news to me mainly because this game has several glaring issues regarding multiplayer connectivity and quality of life discrepancies that seem odd to run across in a nearly completed product This is disappointing and I cannot stress how annoying it is when obvious issues of quality exist in a product and people accept it as just another modern gaming experience The positive aspects of this game largely revolve around visual appeal sound design gunfire is distinct among the various firearms players can equip and many of the guns sound extremely powerful and difficulty This game is quite difficult upon starting out but once the player completes a few missions or has to retry the same mission over and over again they will be able to grasp many of the game's nuances and begin to speed up their in-game actions making smarter moves with each obstacle they encounter Even some of the more tedious actions within the game like typing on terminals become second nature once a player has dealt with them a few times Unfortunately the negatives far outweigh the benefits of buying this game now that we have a clearer picture of what GTFO's finished form will be GTFO much like 10 Chambers lead Ulf Andersson's previous game PAYDAY is filled with fixable yet ignored bugs and quality of life issues that range from annoying to deal with all the way to my friends and I just wasted 2 hours of our night because someone's game crashed mid-door scan It's painful to see how much potential this game has and how wasted it is due to what feels like a flat-out refusal to add features that are commonplace now in games For example GTFO's matchmaking system does not include a lobby list that players can choose available games from rather it merely has the ability to select what mission a player wants to play what languages the player speaks and if they have a microphone While this sounds like enough a player using matchmaking will often sit for literal hours trying to find other players to cooperate with Out of the 87 or so hours I have on this game about half of those hours have been spent in the mission select lobby waiting in vain for another player to join Additionally 10 Chambers has removed many of the rundowns that were once freely playable This is virtually cutting off access to over half the game and while these rundowns are slowly coming back with the final Rundown addition releasing soon it should not be the case where new players or veterans who just took a break for a period of time simply cannot access features that were in the game a year ago That is classic user manipulation to artificially inflate the active player base This is likely to hide the fact that GTFO truthfully has an active player base of just under 1000 people which is not good For reference Left 4 Dead 2 a game that launched in 2009 registered over 27,000 active players for November 2022 Finally if one chooses to play the game with the 3 AI-controlled bots it is very likely that players will never complete the more advanced levels as the AI is terrible in a fight and is basically a detriment to the team regarding certain objectives Bots are generally regarded as useless except for using their tools They miss almost every shot they fire seriously watch any video of a player running a mission solo and it's likely the player will be merely using the bots for their tools and not their presence in a fight So in order to really experience the game and fully complete rundowns a solo player will have to find other solo players to team up with if they do not have personal friends to schedule with Which comes to my biggest complaint regarding GTFO and a large reason why I am not recommending this game for purchase the community for the most part willingly accepts this matchmaking SNAFU as just a small side effect of an early access game while they chide you to simply use the GTFO Discord server if you wish to play GTFO with strangers/as a solo player While there isn't any major issue with this in a vacuum the more prominent members of the player base are quite picky when it comes to who they partner up with for a mission Because this game's shortest mission is around 30 real life minutes many players want guaranteed completion of the mission when entering the lobby and/or Discord call because most people do not have the patience to run through these missions more than once or twice One of my biggest issues is the feeling of wasted time while playing this game and this feeling is most prevalent when failing a mission at the final obstacle which will probably happen a lot because there is no checkpoint system sans Rundown 7 which does have checkpoints on certain levels It's all or nothing and many players from my experience simply are not good enough to jump into a match with 3 other random players and coordinate effectively enough to succeed This is especially so now since the game has had an influx of newer players since it went on sale The GTFO Discord creates a somewhat stark cultural divide in game availability for the average player with older players who have had GTFO since Alpha projecting a sense of inflated ego onto newer players when they match up together talking about the kids who offer to be coaches Those newer players looking to complete harder levels will likely go through what feels like a high-level job interview with the average older player being peppered with probing questions to assess your skill level While it is understandable to want the best teammates available it is also apparent that many players are willing to spend an unreasonable amount of time nitpicking you on your playtime or your choice of weapons more time than it takes to simply play through the mission and call out incoming issues to said new players A majority of the regular Discord experiences a player will live through will be one member of the party usually a veteran of the game trying to control every movement the party makes in-game Marine drill instructors give more leeway than the average GTFO veteran player will every small error resulting in a cacophony of condescending comments and rude diatribe Many players you encounter will have a my way or the highway attitude resulting in lots of passive-aggressive commentary from your team The only mistakes die-hard fans are willing to accept with grace are the game design failures from 10 Chambers Any legitimate criticism of this game's flaws in forum posts or discussions usually results in a loyal squad of fanboys rushing to defend the laziness of the developers regarding fixing these issues Stockholm Syndrome be damned I refuse to be a sheep and just accept mandatory usage of the Discord as a customer because the game should effectively matchmake for me if that system exists in the game I should not have to make a strictly-formatted post on a third-party service and wait around for some weird Europeans to join my game and harass me at every turn just to screw up the mission for everyone at the end because b they b got cocky and assumed b they b couldn't make mistakes themselves There is almost no progression system involved in this game Players looking to earn something will only be able to grind out clothing options which are mostly randomized meaning you can spend weeks playing through the game staring at the same helmet or chest piece There is also no weapon customization which feels like a huge miss considering this is an obvious factor of PAYDAY 2's success In conclusion do not buy Game's dead
Big guy here
It goes hard but keep in mind that this game is NECESSARY to have 4 players who are all determined to give their all and not dick around Any mistake spent bullet etc matters
Es uno de mis juegos favoritos en los Es extremadamente divertido si se juega con amigos si no es imposible jugarlo de la manera en que planeada Es como Left4Dead pero con mucha mas estrategia y dificultad ademas de ser moderno y no tan lineal Completamente recomendado
Only a few things are needed to be said This is one of the few games that accomplishes everything it has set out to do Worth every Penny Work Together or Die Trying

fun with friends bots have dogwater ai doe
Note 20
Super fun game especially if you can get a solid squad with 3 other mates to play with consistently
I love this game the challenge is definitely there and feels unfair at time but that is usually solved by just learning how to use your tools and weapons more efficiently I have been playing with one of my friends and we are having a blast slowly making it through the levels Solo is definitely doable with bots side note the bots in GTFO are some of the most helpful bots i've seen in any game but at the end of the day they are still bots but friends or randoms are much better teammates I highly recommend this game If you have a friend or two to play with check it out Maybe wait for a sale though
Love this game between the story The gameplay and high stress moments by far my favorite game of the year Highly reccommend it to anyone who is looking for a good game with a unique story and intense moments Looking forward to seeing new prisoners in the Complex
Fun
the best game you suck at and will give you 24/7 hours of pure CBT
Played this game with my wife and she left me Thank's GTFO

Game makes me sweat

Somebody fucking help me
such a terrifying experience yet so much bloody and tactical fun
Fantastic coop shooter with an amazing setting and atmosphere Made for people that love a challenge This game keeps me entertained even after 500 hours and I cannot recommend it enough Yes its tough and yes you need discord/or friends but give it a try The gunplay is amazing and there's enough content to keep you around for literally hundreds of hours Furthermore the thrill of finishing those toughest D and E rank missions after trying them for days is second to none This is the Dark Souls of FPS coop games
unappealing not seen any match making players either wasted 27
Worth the money
that moment when your friends dont want to play anymore so you just solo the entire rundown R//8 update Truly one of the games of all time I loved it when Hackett said It's time to GTFO and GTFO'd all over the place
este juego es una pija
Sehr gut
unappealing not seen any match making players either wasted 27
this game is death in a nutshell and it is great
I don't understand the goal It never tells me what i'm meant to be doing i just get in a match with a rando and shoot shit I also remember getting softlocked
good game
GTFO
Did I have 200 hours in the game Yes Did I get fucked Yes Did I enjoyed getting fucked Yes
Hard But Fun ass game
I launched the game and immediately thought it could use a lot of work Seeing the devs live streaming I jumped in to hear about future plans for the game The devs were talking about how much they love their cosmetics and it shows No gun variety no upgrades or unlocks 8 levels but only 3 are accessible Aiming reticules are awful neon and glowing making aiming in the dark much more difficult The sound design is awful and firefights feel like you're listening to a war movie through your neighbours wall The only think to unlock is cosmetics that you literally can't see it's a FPS The price for this half baked project is way to high especially since you'll be buying it for friends because it's impossible to play solo and the servers are completely dead
Think I peed a little
este es un juego muy recomendado a aquellos jugaros que busquen un survival horror cooperativo 100/10 el juego
love this game always enjoyed the previews watching other play it and from owning the game it even better playing it then watching other's
feet loud creature screech small drop crunch legs go for the hentai tentacles louder screech big ones slap your face door ALARMS STRESSS INTENSIFIES other players BLAME THEM near end EXECUTE TEAMMATES win and be thankful its over R E P E A T
El juego es muy bueno lo recomiendo solamente si tenes amigos con quien jugarlos entre 3 y 4 ya que la inteligencia artificial de los bots no es muy buena o no esta bien implementada a la manera en la que se juega ya que hay momentos en donde los 3 o 4 personas tienen que pegarle al mismo objetivo y estos no lo hacen solo atacan cuando los bichos estos entran en estado de alerta pero a pesar de eso los bots no alertan a los bichos cuando estos duermen Buena dificultad y jugabilidad ya que no se siente tosco es normal que a las primeras horas de juego no logres entender o en las primeras expediciones mueras es normal pero a medida que vayas jugando vas a ir aprendiendo sobre como jugar y cada vez cada expedicion se volvera mas dificil que la anterior Por eso mismo deberas buscar los consumibles y recursos exparcidos por todo el mapa para esto las terminales dispersadas en el lugar te ayudaran a encontrar cada medikpack o ammopack cualquier cosa que necesites utilizando los comandos correctos ya que para que la terminal te pinguee el loot tendras que introducir la zona en la que te encuentres Lista zone_34 articulo que quieres buscar Lista Zone_34 Ammopack y para distintas cosas aunque el mismo juego te muestra los comandos para usar en las terminales Lo recomiendo para jugar con amigos esta muy bueno y me genera curiosidad al investigar mas sobre su lore 10/10
I'm not gonna lie this game is very tough even with experienced players Some maps can be done solo w/bots but most maps you'll need at least one more human in most cases There are a few quirks here and there but I consider them minor Some of them are bot related so hopefully the Devs will continue to evolve/improve the bots gameplay The graphics are great I highly recommend this game if you like strategy teamwork and dynamic/evolving difficulty If you like to run and gun then this isn't your game
I was caught sleeping and paid the price

Excellent co-op shooter but it is poorly optimised
Going to discord and looking for a group for the map you want to play is just no fun for me Game itself is okay just wished there was better matchmaking integrated into the game itself
es que tengo 7 amigos que lo tienen y juego con bots
Jogo mais abandonado que angolana esquecida pela unicef
Juegazo Es perfecto para aquellos que buscan un juego que demande tiempo atencion y paciencia Es desafiante pero no injusto Premia en gran medida a un grupo de amigos/conocidos que logren trabajar en sintonia Pd Aprendan a usar las terminales Es la mecanica mas importante del juego y eviten usar guias Descubrir cada nivel en especial aquellos donde no puedes fiarte del control de mision en el HUD te a pensar por tu cuenta
I really like this game but there is a bug involving checkpoints which ruins the game for me and many other players I can't recommend buying it until this bug which has been around since the beginning of the game is fixed Developers currently say they can't fix it because they can't reproduce the bug but I find that excuse insufficient
fog do caralho
best game to die and fail over and over again skull
This is probably one of the best games I've ever played It can be extremely challenging at times but it is so fun to play One of the great things about this game is that there are no micro transactions All boosters and cosmetics are earned through game-play Another great thing is that all new rundowns are added free of charge The development team is the real GOAT Hopefully other publishers follow their example
If you don't like the game GTFO
I will recommend this game but BEWARE if you don't have friends to play with there is always the discord but then again it is really hard to find 3 persons who are doing the exact same mission as you so you might be stuck for a while there is always the bots option but it is not optimal especially for defence mission it is still a really great game tho i really enjoy it the atmosphere is on point
Fucking game always going to crack drop FPS glitch bug Recomment not buying this shit
For the people wanting to not play with bots seeing as it kinda sucks booty Join the discord it's constantly active and you can always find people to play with As for the game yeah it f4cks.hard 10/10 for getting bent over because my teammate accidentally slapped a scout
Really enjoyable game with satisfying weapons and tactics Better with 3-4 friends
glow-sticks 10/10
Great game and is fun with friends until someone wakes them up we start blaming each other hahahahahah
Alot more engaging compared to most coop games Teamwork is essential if u want to succeed friendly community and discord allows you to pair into games fast Well made just hope more rundowns get re-released soon
Stealth Galactic for masochists I am a masochist
the game is hard and great and all but the reactor stress test countdown sounds like a duck quack and thats pretty cool 3
Amazing graphics easy to run Fun missions Good strategy Overall an amazing game
Honestly the most fun and highest quality game ive played in a while Truly an underrated game
Very stressful very fun I give two thumbs up
game is insane i let my teammates behind
GTFO is a game about cooperation first and foremost and given my limited experience with the game I'm not necessarily the best to tell you what the whole game is like but I can tell you what is important Every level you drop in with 3 other players or bots if you're alone and are set with a certain task to complete The task varies depending on the level you're playing through going from Go collect something to Clear this area and etc Generally speaking your approach to all of these objectives can be very similar go into a room try to kill as many enemies as you can without alerting them and move on as you try to find hints to the location of your objective Playing alone isn't the most tedious experience bots can actually be quite useful at times with relatively good accuracy and their complete immunity to triggering enemies as well as covering you up whenever you accidentally alert one However the control over them is still fairly limited as you're basically only allowed to tell them where you want them to use gadgets this might change with a future update Playing with other players is a very fun experience depending on how good everybody else is I heavily recommend joining the discord server and using its dedicated LFG function to look for other players to play with as matchmaking can be hazardously random with the people you play with and never consistent If you get this try playing R2 and above R1 is relatively barebones from what I've heard and it doesn't shine what makes this game so special
yes
im obsessed unfortunately to the point where i will literally play this alone highly recommend
Survive as a team or DIE
Get the fuck out
Game is good but matchmaking needs fixing as its really poor
Jogo divertido principalmente com os amigos Mas nada impede de jogar sozinho Algumas dicas para iniciantes ou aqueles que tem um interesse no jogo Primeiro Correr em excesso te MATA corra e atire alternadamente para se matar dica se correr fazendo zig zag com o mouse esquivar da maioria dos ataques Segundo Armas corpo a corpo essenciais para sua escolha a que se encaixe melhor na sua Gameplay e lembre-se todos os recursos limitados mas sua arma corpo a corpo vai te salvar Terceiro Fique com os ouvidos atentos neutralizar a essencial mas se ela acordar muito complicado foque em reduzir seus sem risco de acordar eles Quatro use as armas de fogo que te deixe mais usar algo diferente e se pode estragar a e a vontade de jogar Quinto Caso esteja em 3 amigos ou menos recomendado que 1 dos Bots esteja com Bioescaner esles marcam na hora sempre vai saber onde o inimigo Usando a tecla Q pode abrir a lista de comandos e em ferramentas pode pedir para eles usarem a ferramenta especial torreta espalma etc ou ites como luminosos Nas de objetivo pode pedir que eles carregem/larguem o item principal da desde que esteja na mesma sala do objeto em Existe muito mais dicas Mas mais divertido descobrir por si mesmo E se leu recomendo usar o comando LOGS e o comando READ para ler esses logs e abrir arquivos da lore do jogo Nos vemos no complexo
Please fix the fuel cell bug I wasted my first aggressive booster and we were having a really good run an hour in and had to completely restart because one of us kept loading in with a fuel cell that we couldn't drop No matter what we tried he couldn't drop the fuel cell We did NOT go through the checkpoint holding the fuel cell its not because of that it just randomly happened pretty rough bug Otherwise a solid game

This game is great However my main problem is the fact that the bots really don't help much Another problem I have is the requirement of having friends The only way to play this game and actually make progress is to have friends who also own it Graphics and VFX 10/10 though
fun game heavily trust reliant or a singleplayer hell that is all Either you and your three friends coordinate and attack with the utmost trust in eachother or you die over and over and over again until you can get your acts together and work as a team to overcome the extraterrestrial-looking naruto-running pusbuckets of the campaign This game is fun for those with a taste for playing it sneaky and burning in the unholy abyss of pus secreting from all of these things orifices sub2despacito4morelol
Do you like calm fun and relaxing games well neither do I so come on down to hell where we we kill you
a fun challenge and amazing with friends
GTFO is what it says it is You will likely have an unpleasant experience if you only play by yourself but if you have at least one or two buddies to play with you're sure to enjoy this very polished horror sci-fi game It's worth full price but comes on sale every now and then

I have bought this game twice which is hilarious as apparently it was bland enough for me to forget playing it only half way through playing a mission when the boredom kicked in and i shift tabbed did I notice my playtime and find my own review 0/10 will forget again

This game is unique and interesting Overall I think it is worth the price
i have screamed at my friends more times then there are sleepers in the game
its aight
This game got me pissing shitting and cumming all at once
its a solid 9/10 the price is expensive which it should be around 30-$35 but i digress the gameplay is smooth it doesn't require a super computer to run decent frames and it has alot of content in context of levels
game is only good if you like C&BT
Absolutely fantastic game team work is rewarded and the pace is just right Towards the end of the levels the intensity is so damn high Not many games manage to make me feel this way anymore these days Thank you so much for making this
My favoureite game of all time a stealth game done right and it will never fail to get your heart racing i love the shit out of this game and i will never stop playing it
An amazing intense unique horror game which is held down by one big thing It's Co-Op nature if you have a group of friends to play it with you will have the time of your life and easily sink hundreds of hours into this game but if not then that will be fine too you can always find people to play with on the GTFO discord That however will not be as fun as playing with actual friends So in conclusion you gotta know what you're getting your hands on With randoms its a great experience With friends it's an INCREDIBLE experience
Didn't really like it played a long mission with friends and never touched it again
nice

If you want to play the game with a friend but doesn't have one The cold hard ground is your best friend here
Honestly I really recommend playing this game Its tense at all times and makes you think about your loadouts Aesthetically everything is pleasing to the eye and personally I really like the UI for the menu With friends it's an even better experience

the game is easy i won my first game like its peace of cake get rekt game
I did not enjoy this game
Vous allez mourir c'est certain et il est vrai que c'est frustrant de se faire rouler dessus en boucle avant d'enfin une mission ou ne serait-ce qu'avancer un TOUT petit peu plus dans le niveau Je ne que 6H de jeu et pourtant la du jeu m'a et fait souffrir N'abandonnez pas les heures de jeu prenant le temps de tout comprendre et de lire regarder des guides afin de comprendre un peu plus le jeu et vous allez voir que GTFO est bien plus qu'un jeu qui veut vous voir souffrir Ce jeu va renforcer vos ou alors les briser mais au moins vous allez vivre quelque chose de fort pour une fois qu'un jeu ne vous prend pas pour un con autant en profiter faut savoir viser un peu quand chaque balle est importante
I love this fucking game I just wish more of my friends did
He visto IAs malas pero la de este juego es lo peor que he visto en mi vida si vas a jugar con otros tres amigos sino un par de kilos de tilas y lo vas a necesitar y mucho
Fun when you play with a group of friends
Too niched game If you are a masochistic solo player or have the luxury of having companions that love you MAY enjoy the game Otherwise GTFO from GTFO u]Buy Rainbow Six b]Extraction[/b][/u instead far superior game
I really like this game with friends worth a buy on sale That being said prepare to devote 1-1.5 hours a drop minimum only have 6 hours so far and 4 completed drops would like a little more exposure to lore
Very gud game very hard tho
Very fun co-op horror shooter this game requires serious coordination for your team My advice start a discord call/skype whatever and make callouts to your team if you don't work together you will die
hardest fun game it doesnt matter how good you are you are bad here
Great strategy FPS game to play with friends If you take the time to learn the bot behaviors almost anything can be done solo with bots as of now R1 R2 and R7 with a few exceptions R7D1 R7D2 and while I haven't attempted it I imagine R7E1 also That being said playing with people is where the game really shines If you don't have people to play with DO NOT try matchmaking as no one really uses it Instead use the GTFO discord to find randoms to play with or convince your friends to get it The discord is also a good place to ask questions if you/your team are struggling on levels That being said there are a few bugs that can be annoying at times especially with checkpoints which were added to later rundowns Some of the more notable ones are don't hold objective items during checkpoint scans or they might be fused to your hands bots can't hold objective items during combat and one where c-foam will stop hitting a door My team seems to have mitigated the last one by having the lobby host have the c-foam gun but the other two are waiting on the devs All in all it's a fun game that gets even more enjoyable when you play with friends or randoms
Ni bon ni mauvais L'ambiance sonore et visuelle est excellente mais Ca manque de au niveau des et des ennemis Pas de progression ou d'armes non plus donne pas envie de continuer jouer du coup Le jeu est trop avare en munitions et les armes de corps corps sont un peu meeeh donc du coup bon y'a un qui devrait fait Le jeu et les devs visiblement n'aiment pas les joueurs solo non plus Gros point noir pour ma part Ah oui j'allais oublier les missions sont beaucoup trop longues Et pour ceux qui se demandent les maps ne sont pas du tout Seulement l'emplacement des consommables et des ennemis est Et aussi donne pas envie de rejouer En Il vaut 15 euros pas plus
butt hole monster fun with friends highly recommend if you have friends
Such a good game easy and friendly to noob like me Enjoy this game so much 0.0
best horror game ever made love it
the objects laying around the map are cemented in place and have no ragdoll effect.you could literally throw an explosive at a stack of cans and it wouldnt move the matchmaking,aside from pretty dead servers,are done through discord.which is mostly people using it as a chat forum.no one really organizes games.the regular matchmaking is worse than a 20 year old game taking 10+minutes to start alot of work to be done for this game
FKN AGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH WHAT
yes

If you enjoy surreal horror that never gets less terrifying while screaming with three others who only vaguely know what to expect If you enjoy constantly feeling hardcore anxiety for an entire 40-90 minute round this game's for you Honestly the feeling of completing such a hard map after hours of attempts feels better than an orgasm after hours of edging Would recommend WHO HAS KEY_WHITE_779 Unintelligible screams I'M OUT OF EVERYTHING NO AMMO TIME FOR HAMMER Aw man I wonder who has the key ERIC HAS THE F-ING KEY
The game mechanics can be a little dense at first compared to other shooters especially the terminal but overall the game is excellent and lots of fun with a party of 4
this is like one of my fav games of all time and i really like it but there are not alot of people playing Never the less if anyone does not have this game then buy it
is good
bots int harder than Japan when they bombed pearl harbor Also you will run out of ammo have fun with the hammer
Erbarmungslos und brutal Anders kann man das Spiel nicht beschreiben Es gibt keinen Level-Progress oder Loot der das Spiel vereinfacht Theoretisch ist man zu Beginn vom Spiel genauso stark wie am Ende des Spiels mit einer Ausnahme Die Lernkurve ist unglaublich und man merkt sehr deutlich wie man von seinen eigenen her besser und besser wird Das Spiel ist nicht Soloplay geeignet Es gibt Matchmaking und es gibt einen Discord wo man schnell Leute findet aber das Spiel ist eindeutig da um mit einer festen Gruppe von 3-4 Leuten sich immer wieder zu fordern und zusammen zu wachsen Man braucht aber Geduld und sollte bereit sein wirklich Willenskraft zu haben Es ist 100 Teamplay und wahrscheinlich besser als geeignet als irgendwelche Klettertouren Aber die deutsche Arbeitskultur wird wohl nie auf so eine Idee kommen Zudem man dann ziemlich schnell die Egoisten ausfindig machen Aber bei Seite das Spiel ist Wenn ihr Leute kennt die Lust auf eine Herausforderung haben holt es euch und seid bereit zu fluchen zu lachen euch zu freuen und diese Knicklichter zum Teufel zu schicken

Dis game is bewwy scawwy
Completed R1A1 and the atmosphere makes your heart beat so fast 0 The gunplay is so good
Really fun but challenging horror coop shooter I highly recommend at least playing with one friend preferable 3 Communication and knowing when to clear your rooms and where to set up choke points during the defensive sections will be the deciding factor in your survival
This game is good when you have a couple a friends to play it with you
yes
One of the best 4 player coop games I have played in a long time I have owned this game since day since the first rundown of the game I believe and I have to say this is one of my favorite games over the years Depending on the rundown length and the tenacity of your group of friends this is ten's of hours of fun I could even replay this game for hours on end too There is a random element to it with some mob spawns scouts that alarm waves of enemies and some endless wave defense scenarios if you take your time not focusing on the objective There have been plenty of bugs over the years but nothing to awful that kills the entire gaming experience in my opinion and the best part is the fact you can take a break for a few months and come back to all new content to play that is usually more difficult than the last If you don't have a squad of 4 please use the official discord to matchmake for competent teammates as the in game matchmaking works but you find much better players in the official server One other thing to those VR enthusiast like myself there is a unofficial VR patch to the game that is full VR with full VR controller support it is a lot like Pavlov in terms of the aiming and runs alright under a decent PC build
Honestly Pretty solid Although no levelling or unlock system which I usually really like in games it is still really fun to play through the environments in-game Definitely not for the faint of heart
3+1 5 1 1
Yeah Like hell
If u don't have any one more cringing crazy mad fellow who can try rundown for plenty of hours Good To see u here and F_uck Out of this game right now Actually Flashlight can't be a big problem footsteps standing up suddenly changing weapon and hammer stroke the origin of the Deep S_hit and bots they are all crazy they will never help u when u in danger and fk off charger scout and clocking scouts and GAS map is always duplicated never renovate but but still The PAIN that makes us stronger Keep going If u can make it never stop hammer it knife it spear it baseball it shoot it sentry it mine it c-foam it ignore it Do Anything U Can Do Despair Welcome to the painfull Gulag
just get it trust
This feels worthy of its own genre Red Light/Green Light but You Shit Yourself at the End It's like if Deep Rock Galactic but all the monsters were butthole demons and the player characters where geriatric mildly armed glow stick enthusiasts Honestly the guns feel great the gadgets feel better and the methodical gameplay is a nice break from the frantic high paced play of the usual game these days The maps and puzzles are cool and pretty satisfying They do a GREAT job of building tension as you progress through the game Tons of pros here to be had There are some cons though Resource management can feel daunting You'll feel like a pauper soldier most of the time carefully rationing your 4 and a half bullets and can of beans The hoards are always really challenging like challenging enough to make it significantly less likely you clear the level if you trigger more than one random one Over all though its a really fun survival shooter If you have a group of friends looking for a coop game this could be your Huckleberry
another game of pain if you feel your life wasn't suffering enough come try this one 2024/10/3 edit I beat the game with all my Blood Sweat and Tears I swear to God I don't want to open this game anymore
Incredible with 3 friends Requires teamwork and demands perfection 10/10
Boring game servers dead
great
I have had so much fun playing with my friends and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a hard core zombie survival experience
wow
bom para vale a pena cada momento de
GTFO is a great game to play with friends It's not fun solo This game is punishing you will lose missions after 1.5 hours and not make any progress but it's pretty much always down to player error If you play with bots be prepared for a bit of jank they are helpful if you don't have a full party of 4 but can be frustrating I never play with pubbies in this so I can't speak to the state of the discord If you've got a chill friend or three whose fun depends more on the experience and less on winning pick this up
Very fun to play with friends especially if they're more familiar and they teach you how to play with different useful tec and strats Trying to play this game in singleplayer with bots however will likely prove to be a nightmare maybe not so much if you become a god at the game but I imagine it gets hellish once you start getting down to the lower B levels if not earlier but I can't say that from experience just the bots are fairly basic and you'll need to potentially micromanage them yourself Preferably make sure you have a team of 4 friends for optimal teamwork since this game heavily relies on it It's pretty diverse in terms of gameplay and I've only gotten to C2 currently There is lore in the game but scattered around the world so make sure if you find a terminal with 2 logs not one you'll get lore from that If you'd rather find all the lore on youtube there's likely someone who's done a comprehensive guide on the lore though currently I've really only glanced at lore
Wasted 8 hours of my life after purchasing this game I'm gonna waste another 8 hours on it again tomorrow
shhh quiet dont make any noi okay forget about it run and shoot like hell's upon us
I really liked the concept of a stealth/zombie/weapon/equipment manager-type game But I think it was designed for the most part poorly This game is VERY challenging it is very easy to die with bots so you better have friends Stealth 6/10 The game revolves around stealth because you don't have enough ammo to go loud on every engagement I like this it creates tension and fear because you don't know how much you are risking while going close compared to going loud But it really just means coordinating charged melee attacks with friends while crouched and moving when the sleepy baddies aren't glowing That is to say after some experience the experience doesn't really change at least in strategy Sometimes when you go loud and use firearms some units in a bigger room don't wake up Which is strange to me considering there is a unit that screams when you touch its tentacles it screams and pulls units that just spawn in from outside of other rooms to come and storm you which can be VERY punishing That is also annoying when you take precautions to clear the previous areas just to have them storm from those areas anyway I was hoping for some sneaking that was similar to the last of us where you had baddies that were at different levels of awareness with much different body language to communicate this to the player The player's advantage is that we have more methods of seeing Including different states of awareness would add much more depth to baddies Especially one that could smell the player meaning as soon as the door opens they begin hunting until they have eyes on or equivalent then become aggro'd Zombies 9/10 The baddies are very well done they are up there with AAA games The way they move as a single unit and in crowds really adds a dynamic fluidity to combat they move so weirdly in crowds that it's hard to pick out a target It is difficult to get consistent headshots as it should be The baddies are TOUGH even the standard units They have range/projectile units as well as rushers who have significant range on their melee attack All this to say without a proper team with proper preparation and coordination any engagement has the potential to wipe out the team The addition of glowing parts helps target acquisition but is basically necessary because the game is so unforgivably dark The only addition I can think of is if the new boss became a regular hunting enemy that can kidnap players and put them in different rooms by themselves around the map Weapons 3/10 They do weapon classes in a very weird way that I do not enjoy Its system is similar to FO4 where weapons that shoot fast do less damage and have more ammo but weapons that shoot slower do more damage but also have less ammo Weapon calibers aren't addressed in any way so its not like there is a weight value given to the ammo per round You are just limited to a certain amount based on the specific weapon Ammo is also refilled based on a percentage of ammo not by round There is a generic ammo refill pack that gives 20 capacity of primary and special to the player regardless of how many are left So if you really like your primary and barely touch your special you could potentially be wasting ammo by refilling when your special is already full Weapons also come with predetermined sights and accessories One of the only thermals is on the semi-auto high caliber rifle which is unfortunate because there are few scenarios that allow a slow-shooting weapon to shine where as the fast-shooting LMG-likes would be best with the thermal but since they shoot fast they do terrible damage anyway I had hoped there would be a level of customization on par with like COD FONV or even better like Tarkov A system where you can collect weapons resources and accessories to constantly improve your loadout All while weighing the options of carrying too much ammo compared to other resources that you could have instead The argument could be made that players would just bring obscene amounts of ammo and dump them in a weapon cache area But this could be regulated by the price of ammo in the game or by an increased range of enemy earshot for firearms But I suppose that this improvement in customization might clash with the theme of GTFO and the story where you are basically a prisoner sent with minimal gear Equipment 1/10 The equipment in the game kinda seems like an afterthought There are few options for equipment but there are basically four options The first is a bio sensor that allows the player to sense bio signs in the form of white dots on a small screen within a short area and the ability to tag ONLY moving bio signs The first option is basically useless because the sleepy baddies glow in the dark periodically so you can see them farther away in gameplay than you can on the biosensor and if you were planning on avoiding them you can't even tag them in case something goes wrong so at least you know exactly where they all are It's mostly used to see if there are baddies behind a door But opening the gigantic loud doors does not wake any sleepy baddies up or even alert the one baddy that walks around blindly HUGE missed potential IMO The second option is an elephant toothpaste dispenser gun thing It secretes a substance that reinforces doors and slows down enemies that walk through it It's okay but the grenades that do the same thing are waaay better for reinforcing a door because they reinforce the door fully and in an instant The dispenser is also a hog on equipment refill packs It slows down enemies fairly significantly but the baddies are really tough so might be better to option 3 or 4 Option 3 is a laser trip landmine dispenser that dispenses landmines on any surface It is also a hog on equipment refill packs but they do a lot of damage but considering they are landmines there is not a lot of collateral sometimes they kill just one baddy which annoying because the one tough baddy you wanna kill is often in the crowd so you need to place high on a wall so only the tall baddy will trip it Or ya know just shoot the tall guy far away with a slow shooting gun it takes way less preparation and is often more effective Option 4 is really three options and IMO it is the only real option which is sentry guns There are three varieties shotgun machinegun and sniper gun They all perform as you might expect but they are damn effective probably more so than the players In fact they are probably the only reliable way to handle a horde without risking a ton of invaluable HP They all carry waaaaay more ammo than your personal weapons which makes no sense to me they are easily deployable and easy to pick up and the single most important thing about them is that they will be ignored by the horde So you can place them wherever and they will whittle down the horde while taking no damage and only expending a moderate amount of ammo Then the guys that slip through will be few and hurting so they get absolutely destroyed by the player posse The best method I found is to have only sentries and use them as often as possible have only one sniper sentry while whatever mixture of the other two works best Landmines feel like a waste everytime I use them and an extra sentry annihilates the horde instead of moderately slowing them down with the elephant's toothpaste dispenser At most have one bio scanner But there might be a surplus of equipment ammo if you do that which I find annoying because I want to have that slot open for med packs instead.If the player had to choose between supplying ammo to his sentry or to himself this would be a more interesting dynamic Like if a player had to worry about ammo compatibility in his loadout Computer terminals are a thing but they have no real impact on gameplay They are only used to locate things You can't use them to hack defense systems which don't exist or open doors which you can break

IT WAS ON SALE AND IT WAS AMAZING
not bad
Not a bad game at all pretty full on fun with a few mates but not a fast pace game by any means
Fantastic atmosphere very intense steep learning curve and heck of a lot of fun with friends Thanks to bots it's now also fun and doable solo There are also many great mods with extra rundowns to practice and even more challenges
6666
Amazing game Really fun to play with friends and it's hard which makes it even more fun Levels are long and it takes time to actually finish the game completely I love it
It's a damn good game It's brutal and hard but because of that it's also rewarding I highly recommend picking this game up if you have people who are willing to play it with you You could also pick it up to play by yourself or with randoms but I find this less fun The matchmaking works well and the game play is even better
I really enjoy this game its a fun but had coop game where you really have to work as a team to survive or get torn apart by the horde

game good 👍

fuck-off levels of fun with friends single player with bots is boring
Very easy game and relaxing game
refunded because it was just boring beyond all knowledge
gud gameee 0
Veramente molto coinvolgente e divertente si raccomanda l'uso di discord e della pagina ufficiale per giocare online da poi si accedere alla community del proprio paese e poter giocare con altre persone Work together or die together
Typical ragebait hardgame devs also hunt down and destroy community mods and efforts Pacing is all over the place when you mess up the way the enemies kill you looks more like a bug than anything else most players report the game being basically unplayable solo These are all basically just bulletpoints but yes Not worth your time
Al principio no habia bots era dificil de cojones no tenia subs al el rendimiento era pasable El lore no se entendia un carajo y el multijugador dejaba que desear Con el tiempo fueron mejorando todo eso Sigo sin entender el lore pero ya puedo decir que es un juegazo Comprenlo ya sea para jugar con amigos o en solitario Vale totalmente la pena JUEGAZO

honestly this game is hell and i love it my caveman brain has ascended to another plane beyond my man cave and now my mindset is just stay silent and listen for anything so i can attack them i used this on my teacher and they kicked me out
10CC your mother's ass was fucked by the cell that on my hands
Very good game experienced eldritch horrors fought with many friends had fun
So i am going to give this a negative review at this point i will break down my reasons below Bots in game are not really supportive and get in the way more then they are useful as there is no current command system for them currently they run around on there own mostly getting in the way as soon as you engage an enemy they just start firing at will in a stealth base game the overall game mechanics are hard to learn at first there is no real story also the interface screen is basically unreadable as all text on screen is exstreamly small red and blurry due to this its almost impossible to complete in-game missions the in game matchmaking is broken if you already have a friend in your lobby you want to play with and try to match-make it will split you up from each other most times leaving the host in the server by him self another issue with the current game is they expect you to use a third party program to find other players to play with Discord if you don't use this program you are SCREWED as the matchmaking system never usually finds someone else as the content is locked to only players that have completed the previous maps monsters in-game are pretty cool looking however the learning aspect of how to play is not at all straight forward you are dropped into a area with monsters that are exstreamly hard the tutorial is not very informative on how to play at all they only give you a few monsters to try to learn on and that doesn't help as level 1 gives new monsters that are not in the tutorial so your once again learning how to play all over now if you can get past all of that and you do go and get discord and chat with some of the community you also get to learn that previous content was actually removed from the game not just locked until you beat previous missions come to find out they take away all previous content every few months the website shows that you are getting this content when you buy the game an Example of this is Rundown 3-6 removed from the game all together meaning that if you were lucky enough to have got the game when they had this content it no longer exists and that's to bad for you
most of the missions are hard and fun to play However the bots are retards and shoot walls you also cant tell them to defend position on the reactor mission or to stop picking up useless health packs
Extremely fun and extremely challenging It has that simple gameflow that feels so good to play Reminds me alot of a hardcore Left 4 dead
Lubbly jubbly
great game hard asf
Fun
Great game but refunded because i don't have any friends to play with and playing with strangers just doesn't slap the same way The graphics and atmosphere are fucking great though
nice

Einzigartige eines der wenigen Spiele die ich als schwer anerkenne Waffen sind genial schwach sodass man nicht einfach drauflosballern kann selbst wenn man zu Viert ist sondern jeden Sicherheitsscan mit den Vorhandenen Werkzeugen planen muss Die Mechaniken des Terminals werden dem Spieler passend zum Spiel nur kurz und grob reichen aber aus um das Essenzielle zu Lernen wer wie ich dran hat kann kleine Vorteile durch fortgeschrittenes Wissen in diesem Bereich ergattern die aber keineswegs fundamental die Mission sind Ohne weitere Kameraden quasi unschaffbar mit Freunden ein einzigartiges Erlebnis auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlenswert auch den durchaus gerechtfertigten Preis

RATING 9.1 outta 10
fun
the words I have to explain this game fall outside of what is allowed in the rules and guidelines
I would highly recommend playing with friends it makes the game much more enjoyable probably not worth it if you don't have buddies to play with Great co-op game requires stealth communication fps skill and inventory management
Do not give these devs your hard earned money Why This guy sums it up real nice This game is way easier than I expected but people will keep telling you it gets much harder and all that nonsense because they want to identify as hardcore gamers This brings me to another point Not only the devs but especially the game's community is holding this game back with their absolute backwards mentality about missing features that a co-op game should have in this day in age People will tell you that a game like this does not need a matchmaking system or everyone is used to the discord already anyways which is so self absorbed of a take that I still have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that people come up with these arguments There are tons of other co-op games that are not only harder but far better developed than this Games I recommend instead Alien Swarm Reactive Drop free Deep Rock Galactic Helldivers Killing Floor 2 Left 4 Dead 2 Orcs Must Die 2 PAYDAY 2 Sanctum 2 World War Z Aftermath
Its a good game
Weak gunplay sights are more of a hindrance than a help can't see shit once you start shooting enemies are boring af too rushing you just to spit in your face Menu is very unintuitive nothing is explained well and bots are worthless Game has a cool af concept but fails miserably in execution IMO Hard pass
Most underrated game I've played
Game is crap too much waiting and stealth really slow gameplay waste of money

needs more the lack of content makes the game a drag to play with no feel after winning

great game best with teams bots are lame need to be slow and on point limit ammo and health items hard but still good time with the boys
it hard
Good game
took me 7 hours but I beat the first level
Ich habe nach 5,1 stunden kein Level geschafft Meine frau hat mich ausgelacht und verlassen meine Kinder wollen nichts mehr mit mir zu tun haben meine Freunde haben mich im Kreis zusammengetreten meine Familie hat sich vor scharm selbst und nun bin ich ganz alleine und habe viel mehr zeit um dieses Spiel zu spielen 10/10

Gioco stealth con una piccola componente FPS e una grande componente di tattica e gestione delle risorse Il fatto che sia inoltre reso volutamente difficile del necessario lo riserva ad una classe di giocatori che cerca la sfida che il divertimento Il visibile tentativo del gioco di creare un'atmosfera immersiva per me completamente rotto dalle armi da mischia assolutamente ridicole cosa che si nota ancora di vista la grande di munizioni e il fatto che si tratta di un gioco stealth Alcune rese estremamente lente in modo artificiale al fine del bilanciamento del gioco e con una sola noiosissima e ridicola animazione di attacco non si capisce in un contesto di possibile confronto con mostri grandi di uno scoiattolo una persona sana di mente dovrebbe preferire un coltello ad una lancia Il contesto estremamente nebuloso e si capisce sempre un gran poco dell'ambientazione eccetto eventuali e leggendari logs leggibili da alcuni terminali nei vari livelli Ma meglio altrimenti qualcuno potrebbe cominciare a chiedersi questi cristiani non siano in grado di silenziare le proprie armi o di costruirsi una balestra sicuramente silenziosa e utile di una pistola in un contesto stealth e forse anche utile della gran parte delle armi del gioco considerando che puoi recuperare le munizioni
fantastic game 8/10 i think more content in the way of weapons and utilities would be nice but i'm sure they will add more in the future
AAAAAAAAAHHAHAHHHHAHHHHHHH
Sehr toll und gruselig und es ist schwierig
learn what to do then u might enjoy it
why are the bots so stupid
First and foremost matchmaking needs to be easier otherwise it's pretty much unplayable alone with bots secondly there should be statistics of what each player contributed to a particular run after clearance since there are comparisons to L4D2 which has that unlike this and records of all rundowns finished previously lastly for the experience and content only get it at half the price i did STILL overpriced actually for the content
Awesome
stab
1 A very good and atmospheric game but well it has 1 big minus this is the selection of players in a group Bots are stupid and players are looking for eternity It's like you're the only one playing this game I hope the developers will do something with these because the game is cool and very promising
yes

Graphics 10/10 Gunplay 10/10 I want to love this game but if you don't have 4 competent real people that love grinding a mission until you succeed you will hate this game I want to game to have fun not grind a game like a job I feel the difficulty is cranked up too high for an enjoyable experience
30 50%~60
Fucking Great Ass Game
excellent gameplay some bugs which are fixed quite often i personally love this game to death but if you want to play well get on the discord or play with friends is sooooo much more fun that way i would rate this game 7/5 stars if i could its awesome possibly the best game i've ever played
Buenisimo
de me fazer quebrar a pra ter que passar em um faz o jogo ser divertido gosto de sentir esse desafio
A great game that REQUIRES team-work
Snag this game Play with friends Not too fun to play solo
Great to play with a bunch of teammates that screw your game-play all the time D
Matchmaking does not work and because of that the devs seemingly killed their own game No excuses a basic game feature that every other multiplayer game has Completely unacceptable Discord is not a fix for the problem fix your game This is like Darktide saying they would not provide support for Ipv6 and to use a vpn
you try to get out hr][/hr Spoiler spoiler you don't spoiler
butter knife
Got ripped apart from limb to limb it's a good game
Super fun team game definitely recommend having a good friend group discord setup for the optimal friendship ruining experience of someone not following instructions Have dumped 59 hours into the game so far and still not completed a full rundown revisiting and redoing missions with different friends is always a hilarious and fun experience as well as introducing others to the game Easy to shift playstyles up with different loadout/booster combinations no lame microtransactions and really active devs with frequent updates events and new levels to try out and die on Buy it throw an entire 45 min run by shooting a sleeper during a room clearout when no ones ready open a door no one was expecting and test your friendships to the max
Good
Easy game

Gonna need two more Player to join me and my friend
Eat sum forbidden spaghetti with me my friends
Easily the best shooter I've played since L4D2 Amazing amazing game No idea if this game is good solo but with a group of 4 like-minded friends you're in for a hell of a time
After playing for several hours I can honestly say this is the best co-op game I've ever played High intensity and a good variety of challenges forces you to work as a team if you want to survive Communication is essential so if you enjoy games where you can play on your own this should be a pass It does have bots but they often feel more frustrating than useful The graphics look great and the atmosphere is palpable I don't think i'll ever forget the first encounter with a scout The game does very little to show you how to play There's no objective points nothing to show you exactly what the thing you're looking for looks like and no aim assist This works exceptionally well as it fully immerses you in the game As you progress you learn how to play smarter and with each rundown the game gets more and more interesting If you don't have any friends with the game don't fret there is a very helpful player base on discord who is more than happy to help you learn The game rewards you with new outfits for customization with each successful mission so there's plenty of gear to keep you coming back Finally the game gets lots of support and constant updates with new rundowns gear new enemies bosses etc I highly recommend getting a group of friends to buy this together as it will give you hundreds of hours of fun and is well worth full price
Wait a sec let's get this big guy qui Free bird theme starts playing
horror fps hardcore PVE multiplayer experience A lot of fun that comes with a learning curve and the desire to jump into the unknown and treacherous GTFO is great to play with friends and the discord has always been friendly to players willing to learn and help each other out The developers were spot on in their use of the words Work Together or Die Together
Great game
Amazing graphics sick weapon terrifying enemies difficult levels a lot of replay ability really interesting lore very atmospheric so all in all its a fantastic game

gives me dead space vibes
it's great i love it there are some flaws but they're easily overshadowed by everything else the game does well it's really hard at times sometimes in a tedious way
best FPS horror game I've ever played been on this for a year and it still gives me the same vibes I've had since I started gives me the same vibes as my favorite horror game dead space 1 and 2 love this game
I really enjoyed the premise of this game and i am looking forward to seeing where the story goes I hope that there is some weapon customization in the works but we will have to wait and see
Still one of the best co-op games on steam
s
The game keeps getting better It's definitely hard But it's a welcome challenge Lot of potential I can't wait to see what the devs bring next
Un juego muy bueno para jugar en team con tus amigos Es increible como despues de 1930 horas no me canso Espectacular A estas alturas encima tenes Rundowns para elegir antes se podia jugar de a 1 rundown sola Insisto muy buen juego muy dificil muy divertido Traete a esos de gaming con los que mejor coordinas y dale duro a este titulo que se lo merece
Really fun
WHY DO GIANTS KEEP KILLING ME MOTHER FUCK

So you want to play GTFO Well do you like darkness Do you like spooky atmospheres Do you like dedicated co-op experiences And do you like shooting things in the face Then GTFO the level based survival co-op shooter is for you Bricky memes aside this game is fun The experience it provides is a niche one but what it offers compared to other games today is unique Guns have weight to them the enemies are actually threatening and every aspect knowledge you have for tactical based shooters will be tested Most other games have a great with friends tag tied to them Not this one though This game is with friends or at the very least a full group on voice comms My verdict Try it Writing this review during a period where the game is on sale for 27 so it's definitely worth at least checking out
Para jugar con amigos
I absolutely love the team stealth in this game Nothing quite as rewarding as dropping the whole floor in the span of 3 seconds with a perfectly coordinated team HOWEVER I find some of the game design choices to be particularly frustrating It's not uncommon for missions to easily be 1.5hr long checkpoints are a godsend but sometimes not quite frequent enough team stealth sections feel organic and flexible which is a stark contrast to the heavily-structured forced combat sections and enemy behaviour is inconsistent beheaded enemies may still be alive head-shots don't always kill etc What kills me is that I LOVE some parts of this game and HATE other parts it feels like squandered potential I do love some challenging games but I believe there's a clear distinction between organic difficulty e.g coordinated stealth and artificial difficulty e.g fog and the issues mentioned previously
GET 3 OF YO FRIENDS NOW
It's great fun w Friends or at the very least randos who can communicate
Really nice game with a lot of different things to do
very fun game to play with friends
Game has really big potencial and unique atmosphere Unfortunately gameplay does not attract too many people thats why i hope the developers along with other game changes add some PVP in the future to bring more players Sound design is pretty nice its kinda flat tho in undergrounds tunnels i expect some echo I really like the weapons animations it allows you to feel the power of each weapon Bunch of differend enemies is always I have feeling that if developers mix the GTFO idea with ideas from pvp games like tarkov or hunt showdown it will be much more fun to play and game would become much more popular

One of the most difficult games I've played in a long time it challenges me in ways no other game has done and I love every second of the terror this game gives me there are both moments of high intensity when the enemy spots you and high stress trying to avoid detection you will die over and over if you aren't careful good luck
SCOUTS ARE FRIENDS NOT FOOD
Played for 40 hours have lost about 6 of those due to deaths Got friends half of them don't play now just doing it with one other friend would recommend
It's just not worth the price It's a 15 game billed for 40 The weapons suck the animations suck the levels are copy-pasted all of the mechanics like checkpoints don't work due to bugs the challenge is some of the worst and cheapest I've ever seen in a videogame Also the entire game can be summed up as red light green light Very one dimensional People who defend this horrific game are beyond help I cleared R7 I can handle myself before fanboys try to claim I'm not good at this game They had to add CHECKPOINTS because their game was dying due to people rightfully quitting after they lose THREE HOURS of progress due to BAD LUCK And now they are re-releasing old content that they removed and billed as never coming back to scam people into buying the game before they cash out for good You need to use Discord because the dev team is unable to add functioning matchmaking It's funny they can't get a feature that is completely standard in any other modern multiplayer game after over 2 years This game is legitimately BAD DO NOT BUY

Great game wish my friends felt the same tho

One of the best co op games you can get on PC Hardcore left 4 dead with some interesting co op puzzle solving Finally they have given up with their plan of throwing out old missions every time new content is released Each update from here on will add back missions and gear that was removed from the game long ago Soon this game will be stacked with a huge number of levels permanently Best played with 4 players but the game is still acceptable to play if you can bring just 2 players You can play with 1 but the bots aren't the greatest at doing objectives at least 1 other person to help with objectives makes the game much better
oh fuck oh no shit shit shit
Si con amigos es llevadero sufrir
Just Play Lahhh
Bought this game but returned it due to the lack of content What I mean by this is that it would be a better game if there was a class system and skills trees The graphics are amazing the shooting mechanics is the best I ever played in a 4 player PVE co-op game It's not your typical L4D type game or Warhammer where you just spray n pray hordes in this game strategy is required The game is really well designed and it is very eerie It's a good game but not worth the price right now until they implement something more rewarding and progressive As of now you just choose your load out beat the level and continue to the next one It has a lot of potential to be the best PVE game right now if they get a class system However I would strongly stay away from the game and buy something like Dying Light 2 which was the same price when it's on sale You get way more out of that for the same price than this game I hope the devs look into adding more like what I mentioned The game is on the right path but they need to add more to save it
Don't buy if you expect matchmaking with randoms Servers in EU are dead empty Good game if you already have people to play with

I really like the game You need at least 3 players to accomplish most of the levels This game is only for people who can disciplinate themselves and work well in a team
it was unplayable refunded immediately took the game almost 30 seconds to realize i pushed forward on the controls so yeah no instantly uninstalled do not get this trash
We indeed died together
10/10 if you have friends you want to yell at for fun This game will kick your ass and punish any mistake you or your friends make but that makes for a super rewarding experience
if u have friends is a 10/10
i got the fuck out
With all the hype about this we couldn't wait to play it but as a 1st person shooter it's just not cricket Fog where you can't see so I use the infrared scopes well they don't work through fog cant see through the fog also it kills you D the enemies are fine but the ammo are we supposed to run around when alarms are going off and use our shitty weapons Enemies get alarmed from across the room with a silent kill It could be SO FRIGGEN GOOD but the Dev's have made it an unplayable unenjoyable since my partner and I wanted to play on SALE it cost us over 80.00 My partner would say a lot more about it but overall it's just not fun and its sad AF because it really could be a spooky fun crazy game but nah lol one I just cant get over is the inferred scopes cant see through fog its SO hard to see i get that its supposed to give you an experience but not seeing anything and getting swarmed by 20 naked noodleheads The alarm scanning system WTF WHERE THEYTHINKING bio scan and the team has to stay at the door yep that's fine but having a bio scan move around the room then ask you to run around like an idiot standing in red circles slowly moving around the map before the waves and waves come until you get it done you have to get hurt you get swamped and its just not fun bio scan once let the wave come ffs what is this moving scanning thing splitting off up stairs and around gardens it makes no sense and for what the experience ugh disappointing is an understatement

This game is amazing I love the intensity and atmosphere The challenge is exceptional it's so hard and requires team work and communication and no matter how many times I die I can't wait to drop back in for another rundown I can't wait to see comes updates come in the future
scares my balls off
it's hammer time
Even after completion you still want more I love this beautiful game for its lore its amazing gameplay the evolution of the monsters as you play through the rundowns all crazy I cannot recommend this game enough For those who wish to explore the complex and experience brutal enemies THIS is your game
Worked together still died together 10/10

muito mesmo Tem que ser com amigos Talvez eu precise ver uns videos pra entender melhor vim do r6 e consegui passar da primeira fase
very fun game
This game nails the presentation and atmosphere
Es una experiencia excelente diferente bastante y diferente de los shooters convencionales Muy recomendado pero Es un juego bastante que la media si te gusta la dificultad alta este juego es para vos es casi obligatorio jugarlo al menos con un amigo con dos ya bastante bien Al principio el juego te va a destrozar hasta que aprendas como funciona y como afrontar cada tipo de enemigo y nivel es un juego donde hay que gestionar muy bien los recursos y cada bala y cada cuenta pero que cuando empezas a pasarte los niveles te da un nivel de inigualable Los entornos son espectaculares la muy bien lograda una buena variedad de enemigos objetivos armas y trajes para customizarte tu prisionero y ahora que los niveles permanentemente tiene bastante contenido y va a tener mucho Van a tener que empezar a jugar coordinados con tus amigos y un error o descordinacion puede mandar la al diablo pero si se lo pueden permitir les ponerse a prueba y les da la pc recomendadisimo
pretty good game
I enjoy hearing the screams of my helpless teamates as they get horded
One of the best horror/tactical coop games I've played but will fuck your asshole if you mess up Must be played with friends
This is no ordinary shooter This is not a game to mess around with This is a hardcore horror stealth survival game with significant challenges It's incredibly fun but certainly one of the most stressful games I've ever played I hard to explain the terror I feel playing this game There is much trial and error You will die a lot but you'll eventually pull through and it's the feeling of victory in this game is real something Just make you sure have time to play It can sometimes take a few hours to complete one section in a rundown I do wish it was a little more rewarding You only get one skin piece or color palette per mission It's a very high risk low reward game Regardless it's fantastic Grab some friends you'll need them
GG
Firstly it's dark AF I've played Deep Rock Galactic which relies on flashlights/flares for decent vision however this game is not only way darker and with the occasional fog but you also need to be careful using lights because of enemy aggro It's important to learn a bunch of terminal codes in order to play at a higher level unfortunately the tutorial only teaches a single command Enemies aggro threshold is not easy to master sometimes it's frustrating when you don't know why they woke up Melee weapons can feel clunky when you miss a swing while the enemy is at point blank range Be prepared to suffer for a good 10-20 missions it gets better when you know what you're doing
Excelente jogo Destaco o bom trabalho da equipe de desenvolvimento indie sueco 10 Chambers
good game very fun
Very good coop shooter and tactical horror fps
The game itself is good with it's zombie-horror-stealth-style However to play this game you either need 3 friends or you will have to join the official gtfo discord server The ingame matchmaking is trash you randomly get kicked out of the lobby The develeopers don't seem to give a sh*t about fixing that which is pretty pathetic The problem is the gtfo discord moderators are really stupid Once you lost access to gtfo discord you can basically delete the game Not recommended with broken matchmaking and being forced to join their discord which is run by some really really stupid mods Edit After reaching out to steam-support i was told to contact the gtfo-steam-community-hub Which i did The result is this Be warned don't buy this crap
very good hardcore cooperation shooter game
This is a very nice hardcore game it is difficult to play but it really is challenging so it's a very engaging game for me
good
fuck my team im actually the best but its ok game still fun i carry solo ezpz
The numbers Mason WHAT DO THEY MEAN
Literally the most fun I have ever had in a co-op game cannot recommend enough if you have a tight group of friends
one of the games ever
THIS GAME SO BORING
A scary and fun game even if I die it feels fair and just
This game fucks
Very good game Some advice If you mess up.YOU WILL DIE There is ZERO forgiveness which i love
really wanna like this game but the stupid difficulty mechanics that just at times feel blatently unfair just ruin the fun if you dont have 4 friends min who play this dont bother cause even with 2 its near impossible the lack of ammo forces to melee focused gameplay which is fine when engaging the sleepers but in moving combat it is the most useless thing out there resulting in you swinging 4 or more times at a single enemy unless you get lucky and hit the weak spot then it takes less swings meaning if you run out of ammo at one of the security gates that cause an alarm you might as well quit the game becuase you cannot win in melee the absurdly weird hitbox of enemies is beyond infuriating at times especially the crawling enemies seem to sometimes flat out ignore or not get hit by fully automatic weapons the stealth mechanics are weird especially as sometimes you swing for melee only for them to die but instantly alert others and other times its fine gives the vibe of a shitty RNG mobile game at that point sadly but overall gun play is nice the game is fun and looks beutiful but the listed points above just ruin it it feels like a game with great potential ruined by an artificial difficulty spike insted of being hard and even harder to master like for example what the souls games go for which feel unfair but often times are becuase of player misinput in this game you can do everything right only for an enemy to die to a sneak attack and then alert everyone in a 30km radius it feels like maybe just increase the ammo by a bit or dont drop people into the mission with only 60 to 80 Ammo which is beyond dumb imo and fix some of the hitboxes and the random stealth mechanics and the game would be even better until then avoid this especially if you dont have a group of 4 i wouldnt even try it at 3 maybe if you are some extreme sweaty player go for it
Spoopy scary sleepers send shivers down my spine
This is the first review ive ever written on about a game and Honestly i adore this game i hate stealth games and always have This game makes me enjoy the stealth aspect so much The teamwork the gun the characters are all so well made Highly highly recommend
The anxiety is real Love it

Addicting in a weird way
The game is an extraction-wave-defense CO-OP game You could solo this game but I would not simply recommend it Also this is not the game for people who would try FPS games for the first time Sources are scarce you are pushed to use environment and melee as your best weapons Rifles are for the last resort tough enemies or when you try to defend yourself when security alarms were triggered This game is simply not for people who are trigger-happy Also it has friendly fire and fall damage Great game comes in fair price
Bugs everywhere and artificial difficulty mechanics like poison fog Not worth 40 If you grab it on sale and have friends to play with then it's worth getting
Lagg however good game
Muy malo no se entiende nada Consola Consola
I honestly have no idea why people like this game which is weird for me since I play all sorts of strange games Even if I don't like them I usually get the appeal but not so much here No matchmaking Every room looks identical you will get lost constantly and not in the fun way Gameplay is confusing even after reading a steam guide or two Extremely punishing enemies and ammo mechanics you WILL fail any missions you try for the first few hours Checkpoint system broke the single time our team tried to use it Content is gated frequently in an already fairly limited game I refunded this game and wish anyone who enjoys it the best but I really didn't get it

best duo game
The new-player experience is daunting unless your teammates leave some things for you to handle If they play as usual you will be crouching across the whole map when they wipe out the enemies find the lockers find the artifacts or use the console You are replaceable and if you're not fast enough you get nothing to do until the end when you get things to do but then you fail because this game has no difficulty slider and you're not ready to pull your weight Let's compare GTFO and DRG In DRG the difficulty changes depending on the number of players The overall difficulty can also be selected Each class has its own role that other classes struggle to replicate Even if the team is top-notch you can res your mates drill a shortcut light the cave or help to mine minerals In GTFO the difficulty is set in stone and dialed up to 4 persons always As a new player you're wandering like an NPC because everything is already done by your more experienced mates unless there is a place where you must help which of course you fail to do because you're new Also rewards What rewards All weapons are already unlocked the powerups are near useless at the start of your journey The only thing to aim for is to level up powerups and finish all secondaries GTFO has no progression basically Nothing in immediate vicinity to strive for And that was my experience in a trio with the guys I know With randos it would be pure hell Of course I'm a newbie who does not understand the beauty of this game yadda yadda My only regret is that I cannot refund this game because I played 3 hours instead of 2

It's really good even tho it has a little bit of bugs and I wish you could set a more controls on one key but besides that it's really good
game was fun would recommend buying and playing with friends due to the sheer amount of teamwork u have to put in to finish maps
its good im sorry
Great co-op game when your 4th isn't constantly disconnecting and ruining the runs
Holy F I managed to do one runtrough all by myself with bots It only costs me 10l of pee i almost realeased because i was so scared one soul from the devil my first born a heartattack 2l of sweat and 2 hours of constant fear of death 10/10 would do it again but with friends tho Bots needs commands you can use to use their skills but are otherwise not so useful You can play alone but you need patience a lot of nerves and you need to command the bots urself Otherwise grab some friends to play with and pray Pray a lot and be quiet and stop rushing yes I am talking to you random mates

GTFO is a Fantastic 4 Player Coop Stealth/Shooter/Heist/Horror Game that is quite unconventional with its philosophy on difficulty In layman's terms it's hard as hell challenging your ability to sneak to shoot to dodge to plan to use DOS Computer terminals you find are in DOS which sounds awful but is actually fun and frantic when SHTF requiring skill in typing but GTFO is also very very rewarding and well worth getting good at not just with the feeling of satisfaction when you beat that tricky section or mission but also to uncover the lore The Game is Brutally hard but fun and you have plenty of options when you try again such as switching to weapons more appropriate to the situation guns feel great to use and actually somewhat change your play style during fights from rushing the big dudes with an auto shotgun blasting to keeping your distance and giving your enemy ground to cover while you line up their heads with a sniper rifle different melee weapons Like the guns melee weapons are useful for different types of enemies Gadgets and Boosters which are buffs you add to your character at the start of a mission you gain these Boosters by harvesting artefacts in missions but you lose that booster unless it has more than one charge on the booster at the end of the mission regardless of it ending in a win or loss I strictly recommend that you have a party of four players to play this game Though to be fair there is matchmaking and a discord channel where you can find players but the quality of that varies drastically depending on who you find Then there's the option to use bots Like Left 4 Dead/Back4Blood/Payday GTFO has bots and they are nothing short of absolutely terrible Now the bot AI isn't just bad that would be something you can work around but the bot ai is not only bad but also malevolently bad where they will actively sabotage your matches I'm not kidding Such as picking up ammo and using it on themselves then they go into an alarm Where monsters spawn on you to fight while you move about the room standing on hologram circles to turn off the alarm with just their melee weapons or get trapped behind a door that you shut and be stuck until you open the door or running into their own turrets and getting blasted or reviving their downed teammates while monsters crawl all over them or leap in front of you when you're about to fire or shoot at enemies through walls bullets don't pierce walls or shoot you in the back of the head Which does Damage For some reason 10 chambers thinks that AI partners should be able to shoot you when classic coop shooters like left 4 dead had the clarity to not allow that But at least they're not affected by poison gas and Their gunshots don't alert enemies the AI is so bad that it is simply unacceptable the fact that 10 chambers thought their partner ai was good enough to release is absolutely ludicrous Granted 10 chambers has been pretty transparent that ai partners won't replace human players and you should only use bots if you absolutely cannot find players to fill the ranks of your team but even then I ask what is the point of having them in the first place Why waste resources adding bots Why not scale the difficulty Which is actually probably because of that philosophy on difficulty which is fine artistic integrity and all that But then just not have bots Or another solution would be to give the player better control of their bots Let us choose what supplies they will carry or when they will use those meds or ammo on us or where they will defend against the tide of enemies or when they can pick up teammates maybe have it so ai teammates cannot shoot you or turrets will not shoot them But with all that said GTFO still is an absolutely fantastic game and if you have a four stack all that I just complained about will be a non-issue But seriously make sure you have a four stack or go find players on the discord The game has a load of content the game used to have rundowns that drop every few months which are level packs so to speak that replace old rundowns adding new weapons and tools and enemies that other rundowns didn't have but now 10 chambers is apparently going back and re adding all 6 past rundowns together and rundown 8 rundown 7 is already in the game so is rundown 1 which is a good amount of content while you wait for the other rundowns to be added if they succeed in having all 8 rundowns in the game then that's a massive amount of content Not sure what they'll do after the 8th rundown but if they do nothing those 8 rundowns are still well worth the price and worth the effort and time to complete not to mention that some of the missions have alternate optional challenge areas and objectives you can do to increase the difficulty and get better rewards Some of the missions having multiple optional challenges that increase in difficulty Another thing to note is that the game has cosmetics you can unlock by completing missions to modify your character's look but no micro transactions or battle pass to speak of which is really cool

The solo w bots experience is nice It takes some practice and quite a few deaths to get used to This is a great mode for anyone looking for a solo aspect to the game The missions do become more difficult solo but not impossible
Interessante esse jogo original e diferente dos coop habituais GTFO desafiador tenso e requer Tem seus problemas por exemplo para juntar com tem que mandar um link para a pessoa no Discord Ou seja existe browser de servidores listados triste mas nada que te impossibilite de jogar Fora isso a proposta espero que o jogo desenvolva mais porque tem potencial
This review's only purpose is to fulfil the Steam Awards requirement I should play this game again some time though
to kto w****a
Fun with friends and a real test for your patience
Buen juego El mejor que he jugado con amigos y algo complicado y complejo pero ese es su objetivo 10 de 10
Muy buen juego para jugar con amigos aunque a veces es deseperante pero es muy divertido y el sigiloesta muy bien hecho el cual es el punto fuerte del juego la historia es buena y la ambientacion ni se diga
GTFO can feel like a boring stealth game when you first start out Your guns feel like they don't do anything and glow sticks barely work Once you start to learn the mechanics it's quite fun I enjoy going into games without reading all about how to play so the discovery of how to use the tools provided from trial and error is pretty enjoyable At first the glow sticks felt very pointless until i realised they work well at illuminating enemies in the fog and if you place the glow stick between yourself and an enemy their silhouette will be visible Learning how to use these resource is fun since they appear kinda useless to begin with till you know how to use them The game has two game play loops stealth and action The stealth portions can vary from boring to suspenseful For example if your team has lots of resources to use it can seem pointless to stealth when you can just shot the remaining enemies in the room On the other hand when your team doesn't have enough resources to fend off another wave of enemies it's suspenseful and exciting as one mistake will have great consequences For the action portions generally you get time to prepare since some doors will have alarms that trigger waves of enemies to come this allows for your team to develop strategies for how you'll survive the wave which is quite fun Other times you're thrown into the action usually when your team fails to sneak past a room full of enemies leading to chaos and using more resources then was probably required The resources are some what limited meaning you have to think about how to approach each new zone you enter Should we take it slowly to preserve our ammo or move a bit quicker since we can afford to trigger a small group of enemies I enjoy when a game makes you think in this way It feels very good when you have lots of resources available such as max ammo spare med packs and full sentries But as you progress through the level your resources start to dwindle It doesn't feel unfair when you run low/out of resources since the level does provide enough to get through it's up to you to make sure you use them correctly so you have enough to reach the end There are other things such as the terminals which once you learn the commands google is your friend here you'll be able to find resources/objective items much more easily which is very rewarding once you get the hang of it Overall GTFO does have a learning curve to start truly enjoying the game the mix of stealth and action is good and the resource management adds another layer of depth that keeps your brain thinking and engaged throughout the level
This game is surprisingly good When I first looked at the trailers I thought that it was just another shooter game I was wrong There are many elements that make this a good game First there is a big stealth element If you are cautious and have patience the stealth is rewarding It can make the difference in the level and give you some very satisfying kills some of the death screams XD very interesting There is a huge element of strategy It is about how you make your way through the level who you use resources on how much resources you use who you antagonise especially the scouts which doors to open which doors to close do you run do you hold your place who can you leave behind All of these elements and some make strategy a huge factor on whether you complete the mission or not Teamwork is critical in most levels especially the higher wave ones Sometimes team work just means you need the extra guns and firepower Other times teamwork means you can carry more resources and make it further when working together There are also highly valuable tools Having a team means you can have a variety of tools expanding on how you play through the level Occasionally you can also you through parts of a level guns a blazing This can be satisfying especially when you wipe a horde across the floor Careful of your ammo though There is also elements of story This is seen in the various facilities and rooms that you walk through in the levels You can also see some of the story by the corpses on the ground and the missions that need be completed Between R1 and R7 the story seems a little broken but you do get some audio cues into partial story lines which is very interesting All in all I would recommend this game Playing by yourself or with one other person is a challenge for some levels The bots can be annoying at times yelling doom and gloom all the time but if you don't have many people to play GTFO with I would definitely recommend some bots They help more than you would think and are pretty good at listening most of the time There are different elements which are worth playing through I hope more levels are released so we can get access to some of the older levels as well as some new ones Have fun on your adventure prisoner and kill or sneak past the monsters in the dark
good but hard
Hatte bei jedem Schritt Angst mein ganzes Team damit zu 10/10
more pain
Aussi terrifiant que captivant une excellente a partager a 4
solo paia multi foda D dificil p krl
I hate how much I love this game the next rundown gonna be
This is good sh*t BUY IT
Good game but hard as f**k
chink chink
Thumbs Up
amazing
It's okay Basically unplayable without a full team of 4 You might progress some without a full team but some missions will be borderline impossible if not completely impossible without it When you do get a full team it's way better but it is repetitive and feels like the same objectives over and over again It's not really much of a horror game and it's very difficult If you do manage to get a full team it might be worth a try but without that it's not worth it
Fun with friends otherwise boring gameplay that brings nothing new to the table
Limited ammo lots of sneaking good luck figuring out what to do on your first run
Speedrun through two levels with the boys and then have a breakdown on the third one begging for mercy Drop the game for a week to a few months and then come back and beat it first try 10/10 game
toooo goooooood to play with friends
Very hard game best played with friends Allways use your tools
This is perhaps my favorite coop game assuming we can get a full party of four to play it consistently It's full of challenging levels that often put you to your limits but it's also creatively fresh from rundown to rundown For example In one we were overwhelmed by babies In another we were chased by interdimensional meatballs And in another we were eaten by my friend's dog Mango We've also encoutered ghosts and shadow people And to be quite honest we've died a lot All-in-all though it was worth it TLDR If you're anything like my friend you'll have milk all over your desk by the time you finish Don't ask
It's quote work together or die together definitely fits while I won't say it's needed to have others with you especially since it has bots to help now it is worth having actual people so you can have proper resources for some of the missions

Coole und anspruchsvolles Gameplay Am besten zu viert spielen
Its a good game with some big flaws The most annoying part i feel is that when enemies are triggered they all know exactly where you are and have perfect aim which breaks the importance of stealth and trying not to make noise It also breaks the immersion a little as the creatures design looks like they can't see i may be interpreting that wrong but they don't seem to have eyes It would add more to the survival horror and pressure if instead the enemies were tougher but had to actively hunt you when triggered instead of going straight to the attack Searching attacking where they last heard you having to stop maybe echolocate and listen again to find you if they missed They could then deagro and return to their sleep state if they cant find you if an alarm is not active of course which would keep them in their search state
Fun game but no friends
hra ale je parta mi na tu hru D
giga kox
strictly 4 man coop game friendly fill bot is useless
Assez fun en Co-op quelques bugs d'affichage qui parfois sont assez handicapant les qui n'apparaissent pas portent ouvertes mais mais il reste assez prenant
If you don't know what Stockholm Syndrome is this game will teach you very quickly
Buy game Nag friends to get game Get stuck on early level because game hard Friend can't figure out computer Quit game Come back Cycle repeats
Cool coop game Btw you definitely need some friends to play Also I'd like to point two things 1 Devs are active and help with technical problems in game descussions 2 If you are an Asus user make sure your Armoury Crate App is the latest version cause it may cause crashes if crashes persists delete userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\10 Chambers Collective\GTFO\GeneratedIcons
I Love the Visual Design of the elegant Pre-Game Menus The overall Art Style is dark and moody with Awesome looking creatures for us to hammer Stab or Spear and maybe even mow them all down with bullets of Glory The combination of strategy between Weapons and Tools gives combat a very SWAT Team Vibe The smallest mistake could be your Teams downfall What more could you ask for GTFO challenges you to work as a Team and Survive
Let's not do that again
This easily contains the most insane co-op experiences I've ever had Only downside is that the missions can take quite long to complete so if you suck you might need to spend half a day on a mission

Challenging and great coop experience
This game is a tough but rewarding game There's a satisfaction when getting progress made with friends It mixes the horror and shooter genres extremely well
good
definitely need to communicate with your team to avoid unwanted waves
team
Excellent horror stealth survival game which requires others that you probably know Hard to get in to but definitely worth it
It's painful I'm a masochist
GTFO Tough
Great game Atmosphere is very immersive Much better when you can hear your friends dying in the background
nice game
I ruin the game for everyone when I decide to shoot the big boys thinking it'd one shot kill then watch as chaos ensues because of me 10/10
Its pretty good
Honestly this game is awesome I love it's game play and how you have to work together to get through the level and complete objectives The game is really challenging so it's hard to find someone who will want to actually play it sadly Overall good game
Balls
5/5
Bring reliable friends
Es uno de los mejores juegos para amigos que existen sin duda
In your face extremely difficult but very very satisfying when you do succeed Graphics are top notch too Played since the beta but not recently Play this if you like HUNT Tarkov Marauders
if you enjoy horror games and strategic games to survive this hell they send you to then this game is for you
Love this game You get to walk around calmly with plenty of ammo intelligent friends and AI teammates and it gives you a nice peaceful environment to work on strategy and teamwork You can trust me I haven't had to replay the 3rd mission 30 times and have yet to beat it at all
Great game cant even beat the first god damn level 10/10 would die again
Fellas I think we should make like a tree and get the fuck out me 2022
This game is really only fun with friends but with friends there is literally no other game that can rival the amount of genuine fun you can feel playing this game Playing since rundown 1 and its only getting better Worth it on sale make sure your friends are willing to buy before you buy because otherwise you will be playing with Asian men exclusively
Hard game that makes you play very precise but is very satisfying when you complete levels that just keeps me wanting to play constantly for hours and hours
Pros Very fun to play with your friends Cons Your friends will always get you killed
A quick round of GTFO is a great way to spend 5 hours of an evening
This game is interesting Very difficult and if you are too quick you will not have a good time Never beat a level but I would pick up and try again with friends Overall I would give it a 6/10

GTFO
gran juego para jugar con amigos
nice
There's something about GTFO as a game that is unlike any other niche genre aside It's like that 10/10 girlfriend you had that was borderline abusive but just enough on the safe side to be kinky more than actually abusive And no matter what you do she still occupies space in your mind at night so you keep going back for more This game is punishing exceedingly so but boy is it also a blast And if you mesh with it you'll keep coming back for more no matter what Now that I've posted my review it's time for me to get back to getting slapped around by Daddy Frank down in the complex
Erm I guess its pretty good
too hard
We even beat the first level 10/10
hmm muss nicht sein
Good with friends but chaos
great game to troll your friends by waiting until they're in the middle of sleepers waking them up
Funny hammer bonk
top top
This game is a real test on who you can trust when playing a stealth game while also having to look over your shoulders every second Your friends can easily make the missions easy or hard depending how much noise they make and how much bullet they waste before extraction Its a real hard reality on what one little mistake makes during the mission lol
I HATE JAMIE KIM he throws the game every time i play
Its an amazing game I hate it If you now excuse me I need to die in R7D1 again
O jogo quer que se foda se fode
Play with friends Absolutely brutal learning curve but great payoff and experience
Such a great time when playing with friends There is also a great emphasis on the need for teamwork One mistake and you're running and fighting with your friends while jokingly getting mad at them for messing up
43eed
P.S
very difficult and challenger game played for 2h with friend and we couldn't pass first map
We went on a date with a certain immortal on this latest rundown R7 11/10 would suffer this date over and over again
One of the most innovative 4-player coop games to date Where other multiplayer games are trending toward short compact matches GTFO leans into in-depth multi-hour dives My favorite byproduct of this approach is that you can't help but get to know your teammates and even bond with them as you work your way through the levels As long as you have the time I highly recommend
Don't Breath
gang
actuall good and fun game it is rly hard but it keeps it intense moments and fullfills you with excitment whenever you beat a hard and difficult level
fun time playing it
I didn't get the fuck out
its pretty gud

A wonderful dark and atmospheric game With the extreme level of difficulty a decent plan between players actually needs to be developed to move on Would highly recommend some friends to play with
It's good and fun

If you want to chill from casual games and suffer with friends or randoms then it's a game for you
Really fun game and it rewards you for trying again and again 10/10 recommend to play with friends Voice coms is a MUST
nice game
One of the best cooperative games but really intense and hardcore for beginners Like L4D2 on max difficulty and you all have to drag Chompskis
Consider playing this Game with a total of 4 Players definitely You CAN but probably not tested should NOT play it with bots Also possibly with 2 or 3 Players but the Game doesn't scale so it's gonna be harder Point of review I've finished around 10 level which would be roughly 1,5 Rundowns Level clusters for example Rundown 1 has 6 or 7 levels or a lil less Most of them were before the Rundown1.0 update u Things I really like about GTFO myself u You're really getting the feeling of the Game while it already starts with some kind of Hydrostasis Protocol to begin with I heard there is a tutorial now which seems to be quite useful Haven't done it myself and only seen parts of it Your comrades are probably the reason you're actually losing and not the level or enemies A challenge for yourself would definitely be if you like to plan things out because at least one mate is gonna do the Leeroy Jenkins There are many Weapons to choose from on any of the 4 Weapon/Tool slots to fit most of the individual playstyles Has actual Quest/Story targets and not just take this Item from the very last room and you got it You have a big complex which you can explore but you definitely don't have to because the object you're looking for is mostly at a place which doesn't require you to find everything beforehand Sets a really good vibe and kinda makes you actually stealth to be productive Also makes very good use of other aspects like Light Fog and obstacles There are no special parcour possibilites I meant based on the experience of gameplay u Things that might be annyoing or problematic u Meleehits sometimes connect to the enemies Shoulder and not Head even tho you're aiming right on the Head because it somehow calculates the way of your model to the enemies and doesn't go directly towards their head or smt like that Sometimes Stealth might feel weird It's a thing of train and error but they can wake up by you uncrouching or standing too close without doing anything so watch your step for real There are Rundown specific guns/equipments If you like a weapon and it's handling it might be only for one of the 7 Rundowns But that shouldn't be a problem too dramatic u So for the conclusion u I think it's a very great game in total it's very fun to play with a Squad especially if there's at least one Person missing the plan being very easily frightened or is just plain on dumb The Level and objectives switches often and it seems like the Game can also tell quite a story if you're careful and looking If you're more of a lone wolf I think this Game isn't suited for you because it's sometimes even for 3/4 people quite challenging Never forget there's always that one person how's able to make any situation worse this game filters them out to be pointed at
Awesome game
yes
good fucking game that you need good fucking teamate to play
Parfait pour les joueurs coop avec des missions hardcores
7/10
10/10 Would complain about impaired vision and killing teammates again Not your average run and gun co-op shooter Noise Death
Good horror game def would recommend playing with friends also
good game
just 4 man Warcraft dungeons
oke
I can't
GTFO is best with friends and teamwork and it is very hard to solo if you can at all i love it to death but teamwork when squading up is a hit or miss

Very fun but very challenging Sense of dread all around this game good with friends
You're gonna die a lot But it's still a great game for playing with friends
Great game to play with friends Keeps you on the edge with limited resources
h1 h1 GTFO GTFO GTFO P S
Me takes fall damage Bishop fucking monge
GTFO is so painfully fun My friends and I fail everytime but I appreciate what has been created here Visuals are great Atmosphere is dark dank and creepy Mechanics work well for what this game is Every fail seems like it gets harder on the next try lol The game takes coordination skills and patience If you don't appreciate a difficult fail fest you may want to avoid
When you see the scout for the first time pray to god your friends are not dumb enough to get in his tendrils
One of the best team building games I've ever played A highly stressful but incredibly fun one I have to say been here since the very first run down and every surprise they have given me every rundown is warmly received and knows how to make me pucker up at times Very fun Very hard and the best game I suck at Fun with friends and personally as a player I wouldn't have made it without them and by knowing their strengths and weaknesses 100 Recommend this game

Nice
Dur dur 4 joueurs
Amazing tactical 1-4 co op experience 10/10
Great game can be difficult at times but upon completion is one of the best feelings ever great with teammates or other players Been with the game since beta and can say that I have been happy with every minute of gameplay I've put in to it
Early levels are doable solo but afterwards you will need a team and pray to god that they can aim better than bots GTFO's discord is well done and needed if you are looking for people to play with but I do wish they add matchmaking later on and I understand why they don't have regular matchmaking Overall great game better with friends
I die
One of the best games I have ever played
This game is awesome requires a lot of team play team thinking team communication team is everything at the beginning our teamwork was terrible but this game quite literally taught us how to play as a team so far i love it
My pants are soiled
Gadussy Tadussy Fatussy Outussy
Look short review time the game is absolutely not for the feint of heart and the learning curve is more like a mountain but when you finally reach the peak you will never feel better because you know that when you're there you get to look back to all the great memories you made on the way to the peak Trust me that instead of thinking you're safe make sure you're safe or you'll come to regret it very soon hey wait it's not supposed to have gotten here NO WAIT RUN RUN BEFORE IT GETS TO US HEY WATCH OUT BEHI transmission ended
Best fun with friends while drinking
nice game

Es muy en solo ocupas para que juegues como de jugarse Si quieren jugar con alguien pueden agregarme
Definitely leans more towards the die together rather than the work together
I hate this game it's so hard I cannot stop playing it
GTFO
i hate fog
I don't have friends anymore 10/10

Why does this game love to hate me
Scares me all the time but love it
Pretty good especially with friends
Truly the most expensive way to play L4D2
pain
Just started playing and feels amazing
why is it so scary
Dieses Spiel sorgt dass man wieder etwas im Leben D Ich wurde von meinem besten Freund dieses Spiel zu kaufen Bereue ich es Nur ein bisschen Sound Grafik und einfach alles sind so gut auf einander abgestimmt es ist ein Wahnsinns Erlebnis Da kommen wir aber zum Wahnsinn der setzt immer genau dann ein wenn man die schwereren Expeditionen spielt Das Spiel kann dann extrem und zwar wirklich extrem fordernd werden An sich gibt es viele coole Features wie das nutzen von Code Terminals um Objekte zu finden oder zu Muss man einfach mal gespielt haben aber dringend schleichen sonst reicht die Munition nicht
daaamn they really got the fuck out
10/10 game new update on it makes it run and look a lot better
Solid game pretty steep learning curve to get started but it's very fun be sure to bring a few friends
amazing game and amazing journey since alpha to 1.0 the ride has been one of the best I've ever experienced o7
A tougher alternative to casual co op games GTFO requires more team work and strategy in completing Levels and being efficient The balance between stealth and action challenges also keeps the game from being too repetitive
fun with friends
Communication and team work make this dream work or if your too proud to sneak around try and blast your way though either way the dark always win
Very hard but incredibly fun with multiple friends Gets way easier after loads of experience
Great game with friends
Great fun with mates that makes you either want to kill them or marry them mostly kill them
Man Ohio going crazy rn

This game is amazing
Been playing this game since the first rundown Easily one of my favourites especially when played with friends who also enjoy running the same level 30 times just to die at the same part every single time
meh
Super fun if you have friends to play it with otherwise I would stick away from this game
GET THE FUCK OUT
I have no friends
Muy buen juego se nota el y de el estudio es un poco si tratan de jugar solos pero si tienen un amigo con el que jugar denle una oportunidad
lit
you whack guys with a hammer and then win
Always better with friends This game still send shivers down my spine sometimes 8.5 out of ten i would say
Unfortunately Pretty Boring Me and my 3 friends wanted to like this and the trailers looked really good and exciting like a gloomy oppressive claustrophobic shooter a little bit like Left 4 Dead It is not like that and it is not exciting After about 12 hours of co-op play with friends we are struggling to find the fun here A lot of time is spent slowly creeping around the very one-note and repetitive environments looking for your objective or loot like ammo or health Eventually someone will aggro the enemies and set off a horde for you to fight The guns do not feel very powerful and your ammo magazines are very small and reload times are long It is difficult to tell when some of the the enemies are down and they'll get up a few seconds later and hit you in the back causing heavy damage To be fair to the game it is not geared toward gunplay like other co-op multiplayer shooters and you are supposed to avoid conflict most of the time Which again means creeping slowly around a brown and dark environment while looking for numbers on the wall to direct you the right way If you're a group of players who enjoy long periods of little action followed by comparatively short and unfulfilling gunplay then this might be your thing But sadly neither me or my 3 squad mates did
The good kind of difficult The teamwork required could make or break friendships in the depths of the rundown
Brilliant game

Very good and hard game
Jogo muito bom e muito sempre bom se comunicar pena que as vezes demora um pouco pra achar um time e quase sempre abandona no lobby
A hardcore coop shooter that is actually supposed to be a challenge sounds perfect for me and my friends were all quite passionate fps connaiseures so we should make this and not get destroyed we got destroyed but it was fun
OK serious review time since this game is that special to me GTFO is a game that encapsulates the feeling of something like the focus you have while doing something like a very high tier MMO raid this game not only is HARD VERY HARD to say the least while still feeling just that little bit possible EVEN while being alone coming from someone who has pushed the limits wile being solo with bots most all of rundown 6-7 and 8 fully alone with bots including a complete no bot solo of r6d1 Nemesis if you plan to buy this game for some random fun night go ahead but DO NOT expect the game to baby you in the SLIGHTEST this game tells you NOTHING about its true depth when it comes to things like enemy variety weapon choices tool choices boosters map layouts objectives the true depth of the terminal system and many MANY more systems to truly understand this game you need to put in time and effort until you are so wrapped up in the complex its all you can think about this game is and will always be meant for a FULL group of 4 who can truly trust each other you will get mad at each other and you WILL not like certain very close friends in this game but please trust me it is all worth is when you see the expedition complete screen after many many many runs of the same mission over and over again then you may take a long break but once you enter the complex and truly sink you teeth in you can never truly let go of this lighting in a bottle experience Since i mainly play this game solo i have a semi consistent group sometimes as of recent but 80 of my hours are alone i have a far different experience than the average player this game tormented me made me angry had me blaming it for its few bugs and many more moments i hate to admit However I always came crawling back to try a few more runs on whatever i was doing just to see if i could finally pursue against the odds and by the skin of my teeth reach extraction IF you plan to play solo you are also as insane as me i HIGHLY RECOMMEND downloading R2MODMAN and installing better bots(any even some qol to fix its issues since you'll encounter many more while solo since the base game bots are laughable at best i get what they were trying to do with them but they just suck this games immersion is so far above any other insertion or extraction shooter that i have ever seen in my life the closest to it is Ready or not which you should also play if you enjoy GTFO the SECOND you open the game it blasts you with immersive menus unlike any other game everything is dirty and grimy like everything was made to just BARELY work since after all you are all just prisoners on death row doing the dirty work for the man upstairs for seemingly no reason you figure out the plan and the story does come together Playing this game feels like a bad trip that you'd want to experience again and again since it really is just THAT good.10 Chambers absolutely NAILED every single piece of this games setting UI sound design an every other thing you can think of It truly feels like it is YOU dropping into the complex and doing the wardens bidding Now time to stop giving the devs sloppy toppy for a moment Yes this game is buggy yes some level designs are just not enjoyable or have weirdly placed obj's or enemy variety but no game is perfect and you need to look at just how good this world lore and game play are There is NOTHING that truly mimics the feeling this game gives you and i will say that with COMPLETE confidence If you have a group that is ready to want to rip each other heads off while doing some of the HARDEST co op game play to ever be conceived in a video game then please god just do it IT IS WORTH IT If you come into this game like i did all the way back in beta determined to solo as much as possible then please just be ready for the mos challenging and unfair things you've ever had to go through but if you're anything like me you'll crave victory until it drives you insane and even when you see that mission complete screen you'll take a deep breath and remember that that was only c1 and you've got a lot worse coming but you'll be ready to do it all over again for an even longer amount of time I truly thank 10 Chambers for releasing such an immersive game and not stopping at anything to make you feel more and more useless as you go down and only through TRUE teamwork or EXTREMELY advanced solo play can you achieve victory Please try this game even if you refund it you can at least see the true effort put into this truly amazing experience Looking forward to Den of Wolves 10 Chambers i know you'll deliver a truly unique experience as your team did with GTFO

I like the concept of this game I want to like this game but the system is so unbelievably hostile to the player that I can't just push through and try to enjoy it You get punished harshly even in the easiest rundowns The occasional jank plays against you every time be it doors not working how they should enemies spotting you from too far away I've played for 2 hours and got the game in sale I'l be honest I followed the development but for now it will sit in my library waiting for a rework that might never came Maybe I am not the public for this and that is okay there are other coop shooters with sci-fi themes available If you like Aliens Fireteam Elite Deep Rock Galactic and those kind of games you might enjoy this But keep in mind that missions can be long at the start and despite the available checkpoints there is the risk of getting lost and overrun and losing an hour of progress due to an unlucky mistake One thing I will mention is that at one point is not just a matter of git gud-ism it's a matter of the game being hard and punishing for the sake of it offering meagre cosmetic rewards and not really giving replayability You need to play in a perfectionist way but the jank always will go against you Also if you didn't have the chance to play the first rundowns you've missed on the plot and progress of the history with barely an option to catch up
git gud or get cheeks clapped
gutes game um mal frischen wind rein zu bringen gemeinsam mit freunden einfach nur geil
This game is fun if you like spending 4 hours on a single mission and losing Also looks pretty
simply good luck and don't die within 5 minutes
Prepare some new jeans this shit is scary
La verdad que se sintio cuando me cogieron por primera vez pero esta vez fue grupal Si te gustan las orgias compralo

This game hard asf
Epic game 10/10 perfect in every aspect BUT and there's a big but only if you have friends to play with you can play with randoms but thing is most of the time Randoms peeps you meet on official GTFO discord server knows what they are doing so it kinda ruins the thrill of the game It's soo much fun collectively thinking and making decisions not exactly knowing what you are doing than just letting pro peeps carry you P
Good

Pain
Love getting a full team The bots make me ill Best time getting shot in the back I've ever had Would recommend
print hello world
Well let's start with good things about this game The game has very good ambience it gives chills at first u're probably gonna start shooting mobs around like in any other games and find ur self in a situation where there are no bullets left in ur weapon magazine aaand next thing u know u're dead with that being said it's difficult aswell u have to count your shots use your melee weapon more than your guns and yeah WORK TOGETHER OR DIE TOGETHER don't forget about your teammates play with team communicate with team help your teammates with ammo-health etc Soo the visuals are fun weapons are cool monsters are very interesting The game is really awesome but There are 2 things i want to talk about 1.Not enough players 2.Price of the game 1 You have to play with teammates as i said before work together or die together but unless you have 3 more friends to play with you'd have to control the bots all the time and trust me it's not what you want to do it's quite the pain in the ass with em you have to tell them exactly when and how and why they have to do something while being in the middle of the fight against the 30 monsters it's almost impossible 2 40euro well i'd say not yet It has alot of stuff to do and to achieve but not for 40euro Im okay with buying this game for 30 but i'd say 20 is the best price for this game rn And since you're going to be stuck for 5-10 min in the queue 40 way is alot to ask from the gamers
Difficult requires teamwork and made me scuff my underwears 10/10 bad for the baby
30 R1C1 8 8/8 9/8 R1C2 40
Really fun to play and lots of content now they are re-releasing old rundown It's better to play with friends as sometimes that AI companions are stupid and don't follow commands but that's only happened once that I've seen
8/10 would leave teammates behind as bait to die alone anyway
when but
Mmmm pretty good

Horror terror
a nice game to play with some friends
Really tense and fun to play with friends has some minor issues but nothing that cant be overlooked

Very spooky Scoobs
Funny Trauma Game
this game isn't bad but if your playing solo it is a nightmare to even do one run but if they either fixed the AI's that you play with or the difficulty it would be better
muy buen juego

Pinche juego todo porque no se le entiende ni madres

Good game
Good game
Play it with the homies for 3 days then forget about it for 8 months repeat
cool
how to repeatedly fail at the same thing with your friends over and over again simulator
10/10 would place a mine under my friends and shoot it again
is good gaem
A phenomenal game to play with friends
Nice game It's good if you play it with several friends because the bots are way to stupid The only job which the bot is good for is to carry the baby along the map xD xD
Ah shite look right there Don't alert them
Challenging but rewarding and fun
10 10
Very well thought over game with challenging play style while maintaining a good balance Only downside of this game for me is that you need all 4 players to be closely informed about all the aspects of the game and levels Player skill isn't all that relative as you need mainly one's ability to use their brain and keeping their cool rather than motor skills IMHO
Fun game
Always a friendly community whenever I tried playing it everyone was so helpful check the discord it really is worth it Even if you are solo
Fun game

this game sucks at playing solo but with friends DAEUMMM
Great game if you're looking for a challenge Steep learning curve there are no tutorials or instructions just vague objectives
ciekawa rozgrywka spoko grafika gra z botami nie ale zdecydowanie lepsze efekty w progresie z prawdziwymi graczami
You will hate it and love it but you need friends you can cuss at to play with
health gone tools used guns empty pants full yeah im ready start the alarm
Updated bot behavior
Ambiance stressante d'horreur comme se retrouver dans les film aliens
Seriously underrated game.So much better with friends
Imagine a Swat co-op game where you break into a house but it's a Survival Horror game in a huge underground complex The game is simple at first glance Go in kill sleepers don't die grab stuff run out If you play it more you'll realise there are so many nuances to the game You can and will get much better at almost everything in the game like setting up alarms and killing sleepers at the same time or when one of the sleepers is asleep when their hearing is weaker Each melee has its own purpose but you can use it in the same way as any other Each tool works perfectly in its own way without making the other tools inferior If you want to buy this game get other friends to play it with you The game has a matchmaking system but of course it's always better with friends Good luck
Very enjoyable with friends especially one of them is an idoit
hao
very poggers
I love this game but its better with friends and none of my friends want to play this anymore since it was almost impossible to beat the rundowns without the glitches back in pre-release

STFU PREPARE TO CRY EDITION
This game will test your patience and ability to work as a group definitely a fun coop experience
hard coreeeeeeeee
gayme
this game kinda sucks bother
With a group of friends this game is very fun If done right things will go smoothly If done incorrectly well lets just say youre not going to have a fantastic gaming experience Im not that far in but so far loving it
Must have hardcore game only play with friends
wssb
holy SHIT what a good game man
the game is fun and scary at first after one or two games it is no more has some bugs and performance issues theres plenty of hackers that just ruin the experience Get friends or people to play with on discord if you want a fun experience People said this was a hard coop game but it was exagerated it is hard and you rely on the luck of your loot because if you run out of ammo then you are practically dead if it wasnt for luck then this would be much easier
Really intense and draining because it is challenging but that's a good thing Juan shot ez clap first try the map and you will feel gud
yes
i need to review a game for the steam awards
Friends or hopping on the discord server is almost essential and expect play sessions to take a decent bit of time especially while you learn the ropes
10 10
OMFG the funny stuff you can do with your friends is AMAZING
God
Definitely a good challenge especially great with friends
A fun game to play with friends until you get sent to your checkpoint 30 minutes back by a big fella

Very enjoyable game to play with your friends
Yo I'm here for my steam badge biyaash Kidding aside I highly recommend GTFO for anyone who's into a dark sci-fi procedural first-person dungeon crawler You may notice that I did not mention the game being a horde shooter like Left 4 Dead or Vermintide because it's not I DO NOT recommend this game to people who expect a horde shooter from it Contrary to what most early marketing of GTFO and Youtuber let's plays make it out to be GTFO is more about slowly and methodically clearing rooms in stealth than gunning down hordes of Naruto-running aliens/mutants Unnecessary gunfights will deplete your resources First Aid kits and Ammo packs don't necessarily fill up your status There are no crowd control melee attacks or secondary weapons which means that every encounter with a horde will significantly drain either your health or ammo so the only good time to engage a horde is when you're forced to engage a horde Resupplies are so rare that any significant expenditure early on will cost you and means the difference between actually finishing a level Runs in GTFO also take a significant amount of time compared to horde shooters Where clearing a level in L4D or Vermintide can happen within 20 minutes at the most first time runs can take up to an hour and a half for new players and still around 45 minutes to an hour for more experienced players which does not include deciding to tackle side-vaults It's easy to shrug off a bad run in other horde shooters when things go sour and try again In GTFO you end up wasting an hour or two of effort in your life I remember the days when failing a run meant starting from the very beginning They have since implemented checkpoints to the game but you still need to set the expectation that runs still take a significant amount of time to accomplish Progression in GTFO is also different from the norm All equipment are available to the players from the start with no need to unlock them via levels experience or challenges Variety is achieved via some of the more specialized equipment rotating in and out every season/rundown The only unlockables you can expect from GTFO are cosmetic items for your character I think this is apt for the game as it highlights the game loop of successfully clearing each dungeon and not unlocking equipment for unlocking equipment's sake Before you get this game make sure to consider first if you have anyone else in your friend group interested in it If not you should ask yourself if you're willing to go into the GTFO official discord and find other players there While the game does have public matchmaking it's still filled mostly of players who picked the game up thinking they were getting some sort of sci-fi Left 4 Dead and have no patience in actually playing the game for what it is These kind of people will waste your time You'll be a couple of minutes into a mission when they snap and decide to go Rambo and you never get close to actually finishing any level Looking for a group in the official discord cuts down the amount of players who go into the game with the wrong expectations and you're most likely to find like-minded people there If you go into GTFO understanding that it's not anywhere near a horde shooter like Left 4 Dead where communication is important where the goal and satisfaction comes from beating the game's dungeons and not having the most number of kills among your team you will have a good time in GTFO TLDR The best advice I can give to people who are interested in this game THIS IS NOT A HORDE SHOOTER DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITH PEOPLE WHO DO NOT RESPECT YOUR TIME
Fun with friends
Must play with friends
Look the game is hard but I'll be damned if it isn't worth it
h1]Review zu GTFO[/h1 b]WORK TOGETHER OR DIE TOGETHER WORK WITH RANDOMS OR DIE PERHAPS WORK ALONE OR DIE DEFINETLY.[/b u]Zuallererst:[/u Diese Review soll bitte nicht als Stempel dienen dass es sich bei GTFO um ein qualitativ schlechtes Spiel handelt Denn das ist GTFO u]definitiv[/u nicht Es ist nur ein Spiel dass nicht alle bedienen kann und schlichtweg speziell nicht meinen Geschmack bedient hat Die Probleme des Spiels sind im Kern schnell Ein Koopshooter mit einem Gameplay dass auf Stealth basiert funktioniert mit Randoms oder mit Bots einfach nicht Das ehemalige Payday-Entwickler die hier an GTFO gearbeitet haben eigentlich wissen sollen Diese Heists waren nie besonders beliebt in Payday Zumindest mit Randoms Anders hingegen war es beim Ballern Genau das was man in diesem Spiel kaum bis gar nicht macht und wenn man es versucht wird man bestraft Mit einem hohen Schwierigkeitsgrad in Form von konfusem Gamedesign Munitionsmangel Orientierungslosigkeit etc Ich finde man muss definitiv zwischen einem Spiel unterscheiden dass schwer ist und einem das einfach nur ist und so eine Art von Schwierigkeit erzeugt Nehmen wir doch einfach mal die nutzbaren Terminals im Spiel als Beispiel Wieso werden Missionsbegriffe wie Items auf deren Suche man ist nicht irgendwo der Nutzung des Terminals eingeblendet um diese so leichter abtippen zu ist das nicht die einzige Baustelle wo noch verbessert werden Wieso zeigt die Karte nicht Umrisse von besser an oder warum werden verbarrikadierte oder nicht korrekt angezeigt Dazu mal nachfolgender Screenshot Durch diesen Gang kann man u]nicht[/u hindurch gehen Die Karte suggeriert dies allerdings Oder schauen wir uns doch mal den Nebel an den es auf einigen Rundowns Missionen gibt Wieso wird dieser nicht dauerhaft von Nebelzerstreuern zerstreut und so entfernt Wieso geben die irgendwann den Geist auf Logischerweise sieht man dann irgendwann nichts mehr gepaart mit einer konfusen Karte die nicht zur Orientierung Auf dem Papier wirken diese Probleme recht redundant aber in der Hitze des Gefechts Sicherlich nicht ich vornehmen es 2 Dinge Die Gegner sollten Xenomorphs aus dem Alien-Franchise sein und man sollte dem Spieler mehr Munition zum Ballern geben das ist das was Aliens Fireteam Elite sein sollen Dann es sich bei GTFO um ein komplett anderes Spiel handeln aber das ist egal Dann es vermutlich beliebter Denn man sollte sich von den positiven Reviews hier auf Steam nicht lassen Das Spiel kann bei derlei niedrigen Spielerzahlen nicht wirklich beliebt sein und man merkt als Spieler auch recht schnell warum Es ist ein Nischenprodukt das nicht lange unterhalten kann Das liegt auch an der Art und Weise welche Belohnungen man beim erfolgreichen Beenden von Missionen einmalig nutzbare Items die lediglich Buffs geben und Skins die man in der Dunkelheit der Umgebungen eh nicht von anderen Spielern bewundern kann Hinzu kommt dass eine niedrige Spielerzahl logischerweise ein Tod ein Koopspiel ist und mit Randoms WILL man dieses Spiel schlichtweg auch nicht spielen So einfach ist das Das liegt auch daran weil Bots nicht sind effizient im Stealth zu agieren und sorgen mehr feindselige Schwarmattacken als es einem lieb ist Bei dem kleinsten Anzeichen von Problemen die rum wie Rambo sodass man Stealth sofort vergessen kann Es gibt zwar ein Pingsystem dieses scheint aber bei Bots keinerlei Wirkung zu besitzen und ist lediglich echte Spieler ausgelegt um Gegner/Objekte zu markieren Bots anzuhalten und eine Stealthattacke zu synchronisieren und das plumpe Aufsammeln von ist hier einfach nicht Kommen wir die Schnellen unter uns einfach mal zur Pro-Contra-Liste u][b]Pro:[/b][/u Die allgemeine Inszenierung des Spiels mit einem Horror-Sci-Fi-Setting verpackt in einem Koopshooter ist VERDAMMT verlockend und mich auch damals der Kaufgrund gewesen Leider ist es mehr Horrorspiel als Shooter gewesen Terminals macht bis auf die Eingabe von Objektbeschreibungen recht viel Erinnert an alte Textadventure wie ZORK u][b]Contra:[/b][/u Viel zu herrscht auch in der Hitze des Gefechts vollkommene Orientierungslosigkeit Kleine Community Den offiziellen Discord zu nutzen oder 3 Freunde zur Hand zu haben ist meiner Meinung nach Pflicht um das Spiel zu Bots sind Teile des Gameplays hinderlich und definitiv keine Hilfe Nebel in einigen Missionen nervt SEHR Es gibt zwar Nebelzerstreuer die diesen entfernen allerdings dauern viele Missionen recht lange besonders wenn man mit Randoms spielt oder selbst die Mission noch nicht kennt weshalb diese schnell aufgebraucht sind und es gibt irgendwann keine neuen mehr die man finden kann sodass man in einer dicken Suppe Gegner im Stealth wohlgemerkt ausfindig und erledigen muss Nah viel Es mit Abstand interessanter gewesen man dabei die bereits im Spiel existierenden Terminals nutzen um die anschalten zu damit der Nebel dauerhaft verschwindet muss man sich das irgendwie verdienen Wer Vielleicht geht das nur an gewissen Terminals oder man muss ein Passwort suchen braucht man bei den Terminals den GENAUEN Wortlaut von Missionsobjekten Dieser ist jedoch man am Terminal steht nicht einsehbar weshalb man jemanden braucht der das im Voicechat ansagt oder man notiert sich das irgendwo wenn man alleine spielt Es nervt Logischerweise Wie gesagt Es ist diese die das Spiel mit sich herum schleppt Missionen sind viel zu lang Kurzer ist hier nicht gegeben Oftmals vergeigt man es dann auch gegen Ende nur weil man vielleicht nicht mehr Munition hat Sollte man mal eine Mission bis zum Ende schaffen ist es definitiv ein weil man eine Herausforderung gemeistert hat Allerdings spiegelt das die vom Spiel gebotene Belohnung in Form von einmalig nutzbaren Items und sinnlosen Skins einfach nicht an u][b]Prontra:[/b][/u Das HUD ist anfangs recht verwirrend und die wichtigen Elemente besser telegrafieren Ich mir dass die Karte auch besser dargestellt werden Da ist definitiv noch Verbesserung Zumindest in kleinem Rahmen Es mir schon reichen wenn gewisse Ebenen in gewissen Farben dargestellt werden oder man wenigstens die Grundrisse von besser ausmachen oder dass selbst nicht so nebelartig dargestellt werden Man kann ein bereits gestartetes Spiel als Mitspieler nicht im Nachhinein betreten Ein Unding in jedem Koop-Spiel Mir es wie bei den Nebelzerstreuern auch gefallen wenn die Knicklichter von Dauer gewesen Die Injektion beim Start des Spiels ist beim ersten Mal vielleicht ganz nett aber diese immer und immer wieder zu sehen wird recht schnell Es allerdings recht gut zur gebotenen bei Mehr Prontrapunkte gibts aufgrund der Zeichenbegrenzung von Steam in der Kommentarsektion Kurz Ich das Spiel empfehlen wenn man selbst noch 3 andere Leute hat die das Spiel gerne spielen und sich darauf einlassen auch mal zu verlieren Wer diese 3 Leute nicht zur Wahl hat sollte lieber die Finger davon lassen und sich Spiele wie Warhammer 40,000 Darktide anschauen code]Hast du noch mehr Interesse an Reviews wie diese Dann besuche doch meine url code
This game was really fun for the time that I played it With a full game with friends its a good blend of serious and goofy Really immersive
It's the best Co-op game I've played since L4D2 It's an unforgiving Sci-Fi Horror Co-op game I would recommended getting on the discord or have friends to play with
I can relate with the monsters in this game I also like to huddle in dark corners and react violently to bright lights
Fun Game
Dieses Spiel war jeden Cent Wert Anfangs hatte ich meine zweifel da es Rundown 5 damals echt nicht meins war als es zu updates kam und es nun sogar alles Rundowns spielbar macht kann ich jeden der Horror und shooter liebt empfehlen Mit Freunden 100mal besser
yes
Buen juego con una excelente Parecido a juegos como Left 4 Dead o Killing Floor pero el factor sigilo y survival donde los suministros pueden ser escasos y para sobrevivir la en equipo se vuelve muy vital La historia en si es un enigma no sabes por pero se va volviendo interesante conforme pones a los detalles y escuchas a los personajes que se comunican contigo Cada nivel significa descender profundo en las instalaciones de lo que sea en lo que te encuentres avanzando la historia y cada vez con amenazas nuevas de tus armas con equipo y herramientas para ayudarte a sobrevivir tales como torretas gel ralentizador detector de amenazas entre muchos por los cuales te puedas interesar y apoyar de distintas maneras Recomendable si tienes un grupo de amigos de cuatro con quienes puedas jugarlo aunque el juego sigue recibiendo de parte de los desarrolladores y ya se puede jugar con bots que puedan suplir los puestos que queden 9/10 Preferible si lo pillas en oferta
10/10 fun game that requires coordination
Good Game Much love a lot of blood
mhm
Jogo excepcional para jogar com amigos de ser bastante desafiador preciso habilidade e MUITO tempo para concluir cada Outro ponto que vale ser mencionado as trocas de fases em cada season sempre mapas e itens novos dos jogadores Me surpreendi bastante com as novas criaturas na Valeu cada centavo gasto
My heart rate always goes up for this and it's slowly killing me Would do it again in the afterlife
scary game that requires timing stealth and cooperation
Bots win
Epic hard game Also I love Dramabug Marvin 333
gtop
good game but fix the crashes
Friends did gtfo and never played again
bof
Love this game it is absolutely terrifying
A very immersive and thought provoking game It makes you really plan out your tactics and have a very sophisticated strategy otherwise everything will go to shit A very good game overall best played with friends
Work together or Die together
this game has brought me an inordinate amount of pain
11/10
you'll suck
poopy butts
Sehr schweres Game Umso tiefer man kommt umso wird es Alleine oder zu zweit hat man keine Chance Gerade in den tieferen Etagen wird Munition einfach zu knapp und wenn man keinen dabei hat der die Mechaniken und Laufwege kennt scheitert man Hilfe lohnt es sich auf jeden Fall den internationalen Discord zu besuchen dort findet man auch Mitspieler
Just play with friends this is a whole new experience and so fun but might be frusrating at times make sure to not let it get you and don't overplay this game It drains the energy out of you lol
noice
ok
very hardcore and traumatizing but I love it
Definitely a great time with friends Still feels like I'm bad
Honestly I suck at this game but god I love it so much
Molto bello e veramente difficile bisogna capire veramente come giocato altrimenti non supererete di due livelli
Die or don't
Played it a few years ago and couldn't beat a level Played it again a few days ago and still can't beat a level Why so hard
Wait for sale play with friends All you need to know
great game to play with friends
If you have friend to play together its worth it if not go out and find it's still worth it
Simon music
spoopy
Spooky not spoopy Simple premise executed with an attention to detail and difficulty curve made with the same love that the people who designed Blight Town from Dark Souls had Excellent horror shooter As with many niche shooters one will need Discord to use multiplayer
Creepy and fun Just bring some friends with you
this game is honestly amazing from the music to sound design to atmosphere its all-round a fantastic game and because of these things and its interesting game play loop it has become my nomination for GOTY genuinely a fantastic survival horror experience everyone even remotely interested should definitely check it out
Un l4d mas agobiante si cabe
Drop the mic
el juego tiene muy buena sobre todo cuando tienes a un compa que te ayude a entender mejor las de los enemigos y que hacer
Game does not forgive When they advertise work together they really mean it
juego kl de pana q si alertas a las criaturas dejas la caga
Spooky Hours
Super hardcore
Apenas compre esse jogo se vc tiver amigos competentes que tem tempo livre pra jogar jogos q n sejam do roblox Amo esse jogo 10/10 super e intenso
Invited friends for a traumatized experiences together 10/10 would traumatized ourself again
Get brothers and friends to play Watch them die over and over again Listen to them complain about not being able to complete every level Realize you suck at this game
good game
A really challenging game that should be played by a team of regular players Nice learning curve not that simple great mechanics and suspense of the game It is a bit HC but really fun to play Learned a lot from it and the way the rundowns work are great The opening of the story trough the rundowns and stuff The only part that is annoying is that it takes a lot of time for each session when you pass 2 or 3 part of rundowns Like at least 3h for average player that likes this stuff and if skill is even lower like 4-5h For someone that works 40h a week that is a really great repellent recipe to avoid it But nice coordination and fun Who can spend this much of time in it it is a BIG recommendation
Awesome tactical PVE-Sneaky-Shooter for up to 4 friends which I totally suck at
You def need a group of friends who never mess around to play this game with you trust me that will save you tons of trouble and time from consistent argument
Must have friends
quite a good death to game russians recommended killinkg with friends russians 5/5
Hard Dark Intense You will die You will kill your friends You'll say lets go again
Its nice that all runs are going to be available
I like this game It's actually pretty hecking good You should play this mayhaps
Recomendasisimo para hacerte kk con los panas,yo encima me lo compre cuando estaba en steam verde y la pena ahora esto es otra cosa,se superaron sinceramente,muy buen juego,buenos decente dificultoso pero divertido,en fin,te lo recomiendo
really nice game,although it makes me and my friends suffer:XP
Jogo muito bom para descobrir o de do seu grupo de amigos

Amazingly game which challenges you every time and gives very little to no room for errors
I think it's a pretty good game I like the aspect of having to approach every situation thoughtfully to save ammo

Excellent jeu en Des heures de rire et de stress
Psst sleepers
This game really lives it's slogan Work together or die together The success of a mission stands and falls only with your teammates Highly recommended especially if you have friends to play with
Ta bueno pero los pibes encima de que se cagan para jugarlo se caen a pedasos tambien
Not for ordinary people to play
stressant

Git gut
Is very good if u like stealth shooter
Great game Reminds me alot of SCP containment breach but as if your MTF sent in after the fact Hard but will also have you giggling at times
Great game Fun with friends
Run solo and torture yourself
super cool game with friends
vewy vewy spoopy
hao
Got myself a PhD just to understand the terminal
Work as a team and it is a great game D
par l'ambiance et le gameplay tout es juste la perfection je n'ai fait avec qu'une seule mission pour le moment avec 3 amis nous quand pris 5 essaie la es je trouve bien environ 45 minute pour une mission sans erreur donc compter 5h pour une mission inconnue avec les morts de toute ce qui donne aux joueurs la sensation la proie dans la cage aux lions
good
Super tough game and fun co-op based tactical horror Edit Rundowns used to rotate out but now they have brought back all the old ones so rundowns 1 to 7 are now all playable
Nothing makes you feel more alive than a giant Charger running towards you while all your guns are empty albeit only for a moment This has quickly become one of my absolute favourites Seeing your group getting better and better step by step and the satisfaction after finally beating a level you thought would take endless tries is simply amazing The unique style of GTFO captures you immediately in the atmosphere and the sheer terror of your first alarm door knowing fully well there are many more to come will get your heart pumping This is not a game for people who want to play a quick match or get upset when they lose Most rounds will take you at least an hour and you will definitely fail various attempts But let me tell you daring these tasks is worth it The feel of the guns is incredible rarely have I played a FPS where you could feel the recoil in a non-annoying way and could see the damage dealt to your enemies or friends Let's talk Cons The game still has some bugs that's for sure Luckily most of them aren't game breaking but some levels tend to be pretty bugged Bots could definitely be improved and I'm positive that they will be at some point Latency can be an issue for some people especially if you want to stealth But overall I definitely recommend this game Especially now that they include the removed older contents again there should be nothing keeping you away Grab some friends and dive down in the horrors
6
The game has high potential in the future The visual is on a strong ten and the optimization is simply a masterpiece Hardcore L4D2 mixed with stealth atmosphere and soundtrack makes itself felt All in all give it a try and you won't regret it
Best game I'm bad at
Mittlerweile auch als Normalsterblicher spielbar D
good good
good game
UI
Don't play with Max
Difficult but fun and rewarding
ses balles et prendre le moins de risque possible Voila qui assez bien le niveau de de GTFO En vaut mieux sacrifier les loups solitaire ils n'ont rien a faire sur ce jeux l'esprit est OBLIGATOIRE si on souhaite dans ce C'est difficile et les fins de niveau son intense Je recommande GTFO
No russian translate no problems
Ce jeu une tension une et une unique Il est fait pour avec ses potes toute une et dans une bien sombre c'est parfait
The best way to play is with friends tho bots are ok but they can be very dumb sometimes
Hard and rewarding
Less shooter more strategy Recommended if you have a group of friends that also play the game since solo clearing the last stages of an expedition is a sisyphean task that I wouldn't advise anyone to go through There's an official Discord where you can look for a group too but it just doesn't have the same feeling as fucking up together with your friends
Greatttttttt
aaaaaaaa
Big Goof
When you finish a level after multiple wipeouts and setbacks you really feel accomplishment This game doesn't spoon-feeds you
dark and spooky
spooky but also very fun
please god turn your flashlights off
good time very scare
hard to enjoy
if you've ever wanted to know what crippling anxiety feels like play this You'll figure it out
Get yourself 3 friends Go for a run Failed and repeat
Move quickly but silently when you mess up that try not to miss your shots or it'll all end faster than you can reload
One of the best games to play with friends and keep you all on edge The gunplay is fun and creating strategies for escape or defense is a blast 10/10 recommend I just wish my friend would turn his flashlight off when opening a door
GTFO is an extremely co-op reliant game to beat the multiple rundowns you have to work together with your friends or teammates and communicate effectively It is an unforgiving and slow-paced game where strategy and communication is key
The most difficult game I have ever played never finished a rundown truly horrifying when you accidentally alert a room full of creatures My friends and I lose hope stop playing after reaching the middle levels but always return for the intense but incredibly fun gameplay This has left a mark on us and we'll always return with fighting spirit
experience hell when all your friends try to play drunk
This game has been great sense day one but every update i find myself liking this game more and more The guns change so you have to learn new guns the maps and dangers change so you never know what to expect All in all this game is great but the hardest thing about this game is trying to get all 3 of my friends to be online at the same time to play it
111
GREAT GAME COMPLICATED AND ENCOURAGES TEAM WORK WITHIN FRIENDS

I have a love-hate relationship with GTFO one that errs on the side of love in such a way that I can't help coming back for more hence my 350 hours in the game at the time of writing this Its kind of like your ex being your drug dealer you don't look forward to seeing them but you tolerate it so that you can keep riding the high It truly is an extremely fun experience albeit not a perfect one The game has surprisingly enjoyable gunplay and the mechanics are pretty solid and feel great to master This is immediately offset by the game's BRUTAL difficulty which is not always fair but gives the Complex a unique identity that identity being that it doesn't give even a tenth of a fuck about you and your fun You should absolutely play with a squad of 4 people as this is both intended and substantially more fun but bots are available if your friends suck or your mom told you not to talk to strangers on the Discord If you are playing this game casually you most likely will not complete every level and shouldn't aim to as it will probably sour your experience overall The game is challenging in a way that feels satisfying upon completing a level that has been giving you trouble but for some can devolve into frustration quickly especially in earlier rundowns as they did not feature any checkpoint system and levels could take up to 3 HOURS to complete depending on how you play The atmosphere is fantastic and newer players will definitely feel the tension as they play Y'know if getting swarmed by 40 enemies at once is tense enough for you Every decision matters so careful planning is usually necessary alongside proper communication with teammates You never know what horrors you may encounter next so resource management is key to your survival as well Don't be the guy who keeps taking fall damage jumping off platforms your team will hate you and I won't blame them Speaking of horrors the enemy designs are grotesque and unsettling contributing to the atmosphere in spades Environments are crisp and grimy the UI is tailored towards the game's narrative and while the story is about as present as the story in a Dark Souls game it's intriguing enough to make you want to learn more Now the development process of this game is one of its weakest areas in my opinion While the devs have definitely worked hard to get the game to where it is today it feels like it should be far more substantial at this point For the amount of development time that has passed the enemy variety is still pretty limited levels get repetitive after a while many essential features like a functional ping system have never been implemented the progression system is not very satisfying as it only includes some cosmetics that can be very bland at times and there are still plenty of balancing issues Hopefully the devs keep their passion for their product and work out these sorts of things going forward The fact that they made it out of Early Access and didn't abandon us gives me some hope at least Overall the game is absolutely worth your time so I implore you to join us down here in the dark Be ready to die though A lot Oh and watch out for spaghetti
Awesome game even better with friends Planning and patience make it worth the difficult task of completing levels
wakers don't sleep em
sleepers don't wake em
Yes
Schon lange nicht mehr gespielt Hatte nicht so viele Freunde in der Liste die das Spiel haben Kann man denn jetzt mit Randoms spielen PS Nur den Award geschrieben xd
very spook make shit myself would let the creatures finger me again 10/10
This game has a scary atmosphere has tough and unique enemies It is best to play this game with friends as it is basically required to have a plan ready
Its fun if you have friends that can play tactical and slow You're going to replay the same level multiple times when someone sneezes wrong and everyone dies Still fun

Good game its better with friends I couldn't figure out how to command the AI and when i did it didn't work still a very cool game

Amazing atmosphere and sound design Very hard but very fun with friends
QUE jogo meus amigos Um dos poucos jogos que me faz relaxar de verdade Jogo de horda tiro terror bom pra krl O jogo fudido de que vc tem REALMENTE medo de morrer kkkkkkkk lindo maravilhoso e perfeito Menos os bots Os bots bons pelo porte do jogo mas ainda penosos de usar Mas em 4 pessoas lindo maravilhoso perfeito Se com tenha pelo menos um parceiro pra jogar Se tiver vai SEM MEDO ALGUM O jogo ainda tem att direto com novo e cada uma das campanhas costuma levar um bom tempo por conta da dificuldade Tem no minimo 100h garantidas de gameplay por 60 conto Vale a pena DEMAIS compra
Don't ask your friends to play this with you Force them to play by buying one for them Zero Sanity Gameplay moments
If you like having your balls in a vice then this game is perfect for you
Great game 10 10 yes
So fking hard
Very smooth and engaging game-play the atmosphere and sound design are also second to none The weapons all have their pros and cons and mastering them can be quite satisfying If you are like me someone who used to love playing Destiny and Destiny 2 raids but got sick of those games for whatever reason then GTFO will certainly scratch that same itch of challenging but fair and fun Do to these Rundowns having several levels of difficulty you can certainly approach the game solo with AI companions These bots do not work quite as skillfully as human controller but they are still quite useful That said at least one other real player is something I would recommend As for the loot I do wish there was just a little more variety in the way of gear and paint skins that you earn I'd say that as of typing this the legs selection is easily the weakest However given that you're playing in first person this really shouldn't be too much of an issue Also a lot of the event helmets are pretty slick looking I do hope that they'll be put back in the game to be earned again at some point All in all this is a great game and one that I would highly recommend to people who like cooperative objective based games that involve some minor puzzles and all-around solid shooting mechanics
Scary good for streaming and hard as hell
Yes

This is a great game to play with friends Players asked for the old rundowns to come back and the developers listened Thanks

welcome to GTFO also known as the great fear simulator this game is horrifying and stressful but the most fun game you will ever play it gets semi-frequent updates and it encourages teamwork above anything else I have not heard of a better tagline than work together or die together and if you don't have friends don't worry you can play with bots or visit their discord
Game is near impossible to play without friends but with friends it is really fun
its aight
Be Silent or go Ham blazing your guns Outcome is very simple Friends die cuz the game is meant to be stealth
great game constantly updated and feels rewarding to succeed in 10/10 would accidentally unload in my friend again

This game has consumed my friend's life for a year amounting to over 2 thousand hours
this game is hard

good
A surprisingly fresh take on the survival horror genre with all of the team based fun of Left Four Dead with fresh elements of stealth engaging atmosphere and voice acting Only downside is it is really required that you play this with others but there are discord servers for that Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a new survival game to play with your friends
pretty fun and scary
its ok

Very dangerous version of Red Light Green Light If you lose you get your face bitten off If you win you get to ride another amusement park free fall attraction and do it all over again
Le jeu est un banger Source Trust me bro PS On devient un peu moins mauvais la heure

GOOD GAME
I just like the game especially the part where my team gets wiped 20m away from the extract point
Amazing game with a good horror atmosphere good inmersion Do you like Sci-Fi horror movies like Alien etc This is your game game made to play with people online but you can play it single-player solo and with bots and you can do pretty much everything too it will be harder Give it a shot
Spoopy
cool game fun with friends knife cool
Amazing game that desperately needs a checkpoint system that allows you to quit and come back at any time It's very difficult to dedicate 2-3 hrs per mission in the later rundowns
good
Dieses Spiel wurde entwickelt um Freundschaften zu xD mach aber mega Laune
GTFO bietet ein intensives und kooperatives Spielerlebnis das uns von Anfang bis Ende gefesselt hat Die Grafik und Soundeffekte tragen enorm zur des Spiels bei und haben unsere Spielerfahrung beeinflusst Die Teamarbeit ist entscheidend in GTFO und die Kommunikation sowie Koordination mit meinen Freunden haben den auf ein neues Level gehoben Die anspruchsvolle Schwierigkeitskurve brachte herausfordernde Momente die als Team gemeistert werden mussten und dadurch den steigerten Die Horror-Elemente trugen dazu bei die Spannung zu und schafften eine packende Gesamtstimmung im Spiel
It is genuinely the best game I absolutely suck at Also has a good soundtrack and the stealth mechanics with the monsters are pretty innovative too Ultimately this game can be one of at least half of the nominations this year
Muy buen juego para jugar si o si con 4 personas
I bonk the sleepers on the head
Git
Super awsome game i would recommend but have etlest one friend to play with otherwise you will struggle
Good game
Great game ton of quality updates and I love the updates they have put out so far Keep up the great work devs
Very hard need 4 people
Gioco ben fatto per essere giocato in compagnia Serve molta cooperazione
Incredibly difficult but at the same time incredibly rewarding to overcome the challenges Except when your friends rush in like they're late for a flight with no regard for the team and succeeding
o tipo de jogo que normalmente jogo tem uma atmosfera sem igual e com amigos uma experiencia que ou cria amizades ou acaba com elas
Only played it 3 hours and already love it
Un juego extremadamente competitivo siendo solo PVE compradlo si quereis vivir una de las experiencias coperativas mas fascinantes y extremas que he jugado en los videojuegos
GTFO est un jeu qui joue avec vos nerfs C'est un plaisir de s'embrouiller entre potes car on est tous dans le bordel accomplir l'objectif et Des Barres et de la tension en perspective
Very fun game even though I haven't played it for very long You can even play with bots if you don't have friends and you can also change the bots loadout Pretty cool
Team-based AF
this game is scarry
dying wit da bois is fun
Este juego es una autentica fumada veces que las fases te de tus casillas pero esta guay sobre todo si juegas con amigos porque necesitas comunicarte y estar organizados
godeto
Sehr guter anspruchsvoller Shooter Mit Freunden noch besser
Be sure you have at least two preferably three friends and a 2-3 hour block of time set aside to play this game This game is very teamwork-oriented and you are expected to be in full communication throughout to succeed since very easy mistakes caused by a lack-of-communication can be punishing Too many of these mistakes wear down on your resources and can make late-mission objectives near-impossible Overall I'd highly recommend it if you and your friends are looking for a game that tests your teamwork in a tactical shooter setting
Fajne hra jen je opravdu svou partu s random lidma se to moc je se domlouvat aby jste se dostali
Mommy i'm scared
sehr interessantes Spiel wenn man zu viert spielt und garnicht so leicht wie man es glaubt:D

Help
This game is just not worth the price it asks I bought this game because my friend advertised this game as a super fun stealthy and atmospheric game I have bought it on sale which was quite minescule tbh and tried it As i started playing tutorial everything seemed interesting and some game mechanics e.g terminals were looking pretty damn engaging But as i started playing my first real mission with my friend i have felt some boredom as i was wondering around the map with repetative actions as killing enemies with melee weapons because it is the quietest method of killing enemies The tasks were also the same and i really did not understand the point of the game The second mission was to collect 12 id cards or something like that and for each one of them i would have to find a key somewhere kill a lot of enemies It felt like a very grindy task which i was not expecting in a game which costed me 20 usd i live in a region with somewhat cheap prices I really tried to enjoy this game as i quite like the style and especially the interface/hud but i have no intent to grind some stuff with no feeling of reward Sadly that's a refund
bad
If you have frieds be sure to check it out together
Play a level for 3-4 hours Die Repeat 10/10
Bonk
one of the best games i have played in a long time 10/10 will play more with friends

longas horas para passar um mapa caso consiga mas vale cada segundo
Work Together or Die Together the tagline couldn't put it any more clearly Gritty atmosphere and lethal combat amazing gunplay and the absolute requirement of teamwork elevate this game above pretty much every coop game we enjoyed before It's not for the faint of heart and be ready for failure but when you do taste victory or in most cases mere survival the taste is all the sweeter If you have like-minded friends this is a must-play Highly recommended
This game is an atmospheric triumph that exists as a masterclass in both sound and interface design It features a brutally hard and equally rewarding gameplay loop that effortlessly bounces back and forth between methodical melee-centric stealth and frantic unforgiving FPS combat Matchmaking still needs work and bots sometimes struggle but the official Discord channel hosts a healthy community that's ready to help onboard new players
Lots of spooks
dont shoot Shoots it anyways Dies
10/10 verdict One of the best atmospheric hardcore coop games I have ever played and it is really challenging It will definetley test your patience and communication skills with other players

I dont know why people label this game as Horror or say that the game is hard it's just a game about giving and caring for others You can trust me I am your average internet user looking out for others There are chickens nuts some guys called sleepers they look so cute sleeping 3 scouts go and say hello to them they are super friendly some beefy bois who love giving hugs and my favourites Daddy and Mommy

I am scared

Its fun
This Game is a lot of Fun As the Title says you need to Work Together or you Die Together It is very challenging and you need a lot of patience but this makes it a lot more exciting You need to communicate with your teammates or you will be in a lot of trouble The atmosphere is great and really terrifying Definitely one of my favorite Games right now and a very unique one You can not find another Game like this I would love some Skins for the Weapons
Spoopy
Steam co-op
I've had tons of fun playing this game with friends and I highly recommend to try it out with a group of friends because this game is not meant for solo play
gaming
Macht wenn man eine gescheite Truppe hat
Not good for solo
i advice to play this game i love it
Nice with friends
Bastante divertido
Play ALT://Rundown 1.0 C1 with bots Be suck at finishing it Plays another 5 attempts Leave the game for next day Fail to clear the stage again Currently playing the said stage for a month now Still sucked at it 10/10 game End of 2023 Still suck at it
So fun
i got out
I love the headussy friends
Good with friends
This game is definitely played best with friends and when you all know what each other doing
Great game meant to be played with friends
If you want a serious L4D gameplay style that fucks you up big time act like you some boy scouts divides your friendship with your mates and act like ooga boogas when u find at least 1 health pack or ammo refill while already in a 2 hour run This game is for you
5/5
Alta estrategia requerida para jugar de recursos y mucho sigilo Juego perfecto para poner a prueba todos tus conocimientos con amigos para completar los niveles
S U F F E R I N G A N D P A I N
Play it with friends Trust me
GTFO is a really cool game but before you pick it up with your friends be aware that it's a very difficult game requiring a significant amount of skill an co-ordination I still recommend it just be aware that it may not be for you
game
Hehehe.not so hehehe I wanna die
A really fun and hard game but you actually have to get good and try requirements 1.hours of time 2.focus 3.motivation 4.more hours after you die and restart also this game will eat you alive
yes
The worst and greatest time of my life 7 hours spent didn't even complete the level 666/10
O melhor FPS nos ultimos anos
i suck at this game 10/10
extremely fun and scary
I suck at game
Amazing game to play with your friends Definitely Recommend
Simply never learn to play
hard ass game very fun though
This is not I repeat NOT a shooter game This is a yell-at-your-friends-so-you-can-time-your-melee-attacks type beat
yee
Im one of the few who have completed runs solo and the game lives up to its name it is extremely difficult and daunting to play alone and with friends the fun is only more good game based around teamwork and its the best game you will suck at
Cool
great game to play with your friends
Q RICA COLA EEE
Me hace anal
intense but a fun game with friends
If you want to torture yourself or/and your friends this is the right place to be To complete one level it takes more than 1 hour even if you're being perfect if you reach a point where you just die and can't pass the room after hours of playing congratulations you have experienced what the game offers and what it is about
Reccomended for players seeking slighlty different approach of gameplay but I fear it may get sliglthly repetitive after the while as the game is not finished fully with all its content
Hard AF so hard it made me hard jk
This game good D The flashlight barely helps and you won't know their there until they start screaming and starts running towards you D Scary coop game but highly recommended game
THis game has an interesting process and I love it No room to just run and gun lol
If you like co-op games or if you like really hard descents into madness while you get stalked in the dark then this game is perfect for you It features active devs and an active discord serve to have very nice fun and entertaining games with friends or others
fun with friends
Dificil demais o que deixa melhor ainda Jogue com amigos/colegas
schon cool
cool
Funny game
this is one of the worst games ive ever played
terrifying hard incredible visuals all around great game
Very nice
Only squads that are pure chaos can enjoy being surrounded by chaos and still return for more
yeah pretty good
me and my friends play it everyu day it is the one o0f the games of all times ngl fr fr no cap
A challenging game that will test your and your friends bonds and nevrves just like monopoly but if it was deadly and need some silence to press forward onto victory against spooky sleepers and big bois and more
nice grafics D
very satisfying to get good
Hard challenging if more to combat without stealth Play with friends either fun or upset because the checkpoint too far Recommended
Ta bien
I am still mad that we had to wait 3-4 hours in line at Gamescom to get nothing in the end Other then that I can recommend the game but only with friends
Una
Just go in and out but the time has passed 3 hours another best thing is ping and shout resource box","YES
fun interactive hard game with lots of action good with friends yes
Game hard but game fun
fede lpm
Pretty intense game both when sneaking and when fighting The game can be very hard but it never feels unfair If you learn to use the in-game terminal pretty straight-forward to locate resources or if an optional zone is worth exploring you can better plan your approach to a mission Missions cane be long 40 min and you should co-ordinate with your team or the bots Although you can play some of the lower difficulty levels with bots you really do need to play with other people If you don't have any friends available to play the game the official discord server has a Looking For Game LFG section that is more than sufficient
This game makes me cry at night
Is good but get friends to play it with
Nice challenging game to turn on flash light anywhere
Pain.lots of pain I hope you enjoy hour long sessions that might end in failure League of Legends players would enjoy
Desci de elevador com os amiguinhos agachamo e fomo dai pra frente deu merda
Great atmosphere very immersive and the flow of working in a team in this insanely hostile environment the game throws you into is great You'll need a team of 4 the game can fill the lobby with some extra bots but I'd honestly just recommend looking for an additional team member on Discord or in-game matchmaking if you're short a person I'd say this is the game's biggest strength as it forces you all to cooperate everyone has their own role and the biggest weakness as the game is expensive and requires a lot of time so it's hard to get together people who can 1 afford it 2 enjoy this particular type of gameplay 3 get together regularly for runs that can take a few hours If you have a team together this is one of the coolest games I've played in a very long time Things I'd watch out for if they're a dealbreaker for you are 1 The game can be glitchy at times 2 It's hardcore and unforgiving which is a good thing for a lot of people and a bad thing for a lot of people 3 It's expensive for a multiplayer-only game 4 It requires a considerable time commitment on a per-run basis Overall I definitely recommend it but I think you should wait for a sale and make sure you can put together a group that will play this regularly
Why do i hear action Music
is good
pero bueno
game can be super frustrating and beyond unforgiving and better with friends cause they can shoot you in the back for a good laugh before everyone gets completely destroyed 5/5
4 dumb children ventured into the deep after loud screams of being assaulted by little grippy zombies and big tentical sucking fat dudes they all crawl out successful just missing a couple of limbs
Fun af game hard as hell highly recommend
Please play this game with friends Solo is fun for like 30 min then its just a hassle 2 friends needed
ISP doing maintenance at 11pm ended a 3 hour rundown early 11/10

Hope you've got a team that you can co-op with regularly this game is loads of fun with friends
u]1 Graphics and story 9/10[/u i]GTFO[/i as the description is in the store is an extremely cooperative first-person shooter If we know anything about the game it is due to the information we found on the game's official page as well as what the game offers a mysterious ambiguous terrifying climate whose places are depopulated and instead habited by unknown creatures We will play as prisoners who are awakened from their hydro-stasis state from the i]HSU units[/i The Warden will drop us into the depths once awake to fulfil certain missions of the expedition We walk through the corridors of the complex that are infested with sleepers unknown creatures that remain attentive to the sounds and lights of our footsteps Once the mission is completed as the name of the game indicates we must i]get the fuck out[/i]from there As we progress we discover a bit of the story behind the game We will find the evidence in each scenario that reveals what hides in the depths and with the tasks that we must achieve All of that is protected within the complex dark and atmospheric locations that allow for immersion and suspense of a sci-fi horror narrative Each place with an organic structure and with the resemblance of a maze proposals that challenge where every corner is lurking enemies which allows that tension with that feeling of absconding A game to some original and pretty challenging with adequate graphics for the purpose although it still needs some corrections and graphic bug fixes but nothing serious that prevents play u]2 Playability 10/10[/u The game's tagline reads together or die The game consists of performing certain tasks Carrying out the tasks make up the main mission and in turn the expedition The game is not all about shooting but it also involves strong teamwork The teamwork of this game will be extremely substantial to complete the expedition It will be necessary to create strategies to carry out these tasks from managing resources well advancing in stealth mode or planning escape routes Although the game is quite difficult for newbies it is recommended to play the in which the basic rules of the game are explained to you Once you are done with the introduction of the game you will be able to access the levels of the game The levels tiers will be unlocked at the end of the previous expedition Each level will be more interesting and with more obstacles whose tasks range from simple to challenging Just as you will have obstacles you will also be able to do that and gain time to continue advancing thanks to the use of tools power-ups gifts from the guardian when obtaining a certain number of artifacts with anti-Euclidean geometries and the variety of weapons that you can use This game has a reward system for the effort at the end of each expedition Keep this in mind without persistence and strategy the game will become extremely challenging u]3 Music and FX 9/10[/u The game is atmospheric whose ambient sounds predominate Although that is apparent The ambient sounds are reflected in the enemies when they are about to wake up Or there are ambient sounds within the complex as if something is there waiting for our presence Some sounds are almost organic which hardly spoils the immersion of the game Silence often rules at every moment that is sometimes interrupted by the characters dialogues That is why the importance of playing this game without a microphone although it seems to be the opposite when playing with people Although not all the time environmental sounds predominate on some occasions we will listen to horror sci-fi dark ambient music that generates tension at certain times That music is presented in a timely manner at certain moments for example when reaching the starting point of the expedition or ambient pieces with short duration that immerse you in moments of exploration on the complex The music becomes vital when the enemies wake up or the battle begins The music generates tension and uncertainty which they have achieved with that combination of dark ambient horror and dark minimal-classical music Despite the fact that the music pieces are short the game offers that mix between environmental sounds and the ambient music well integrated into the game u]4 Duration 10/10[/u In appearance the game will seem short but the difficulty adds a great challenge to the players The developers constantly add improvements and updates without forgetting the excellent idea of bringing the first expeditions-rounds that were in early access Also the game enhances that challenging difficulty for every level map you manage to complete So it can be said that the duration depends on your strategies and skills to complete the expedition You may complete a map in 2 hours or less or it may take days to complete it Each completed map you will get a reward This game can be played with bots or with friends which bots have decent AI and quite useful when facing difficult tasks Although it is advisable to play with people and there is a community on Discord so you can find your team and thus be coordinated during the expeditions At the beginning in my personal opinion I thought that the game had the logical similarity of a cube since there are different combinations of the same elements with which they create more possibilities in this case maps Since many times it will look like the same map but the location of things like supply boxes and enemies will change position It will not always be the same game or that allows to understand Be that as it may I recommend this game for players who like challenges cooperation strategy and the ambiguous story within the complex Highly recommended h1]Recommendation 9/10[/h1
its a very scary and fun game It describes itself best work together or die together However the most fun is just fucking around with friends I will never forget the pleas for unnecessary disinfection as long as I live

You keep getting screwed but keep coming back for more Whose fault is that
GTFO provides the perfect blend of fear tension and action You're always on edge and when things go wrong they go wrong in a hurry The game pushes your team to be stealthy and strategic especially when engaging enemies Perfectly timed melee strikes are your teams best friend However there are plenty of opportunities for those who are trigger-happy New missions weapons and utilities let you try out several strategies based on your teams strengths The game is punishing but boy is it a fun/scary time And when your team succeeds you feel like you are on top of the world Be mindful that rundowns can take quite some time to complete several hours in some cases So have several hours freed up before you begin your journey into the Complex Quick tips 1 The long range flashlight won't melt enemies 2 Scouts don't want hugs 3 If a lock screams at you you're doing it wrong Have fun
this game caused me to have ptsd with my ammo count
fun zombie stealth game
relaxing game
5 10 Don't make a sound 10
An absolutely amazing game ambience and atmosphere really keeps one on their toes at all times Understanding the core mechanics is easy but mastering them takes time and it becomes infinitely more enjoyable while playing with friends
Quick heads up Don't do 360's off of ledges on sleepers
Great game for challening team work skills
It is a very fun and challenging game Recommend playing it with friends for the best experience Careful tactical planning and patience go a long way in this game If you like games involving use of stealth tactics and heavy team based game-play give it a try
Test how much you can trust your friends and how competent they are disclaimer disappointment imminent
Very fun with friends
fun game yeah that's it it's just a fun game
go down the complex hell have fun life good
Your friends are your biggest enemy
bello difficile

Hard to find matches alone but if you go onto the discord it is easier to get players to play Also the community from my experience is not toxic and is very helpful to new players
The best game uwu
This was one of the best experiences I've had playing a game There is a constant feeling of tension as you sneak by enemies only to be seen and have to shoot your way out This is a great game and I highly recommend playing it with your friend groups for a real tactical advantage You will need it
Que passa pidoro
Super Spiel aber nur wenn man mit jemanden zusammen spielt
manchmal zu schwer um die level gescheit zu spielen aber es ist wenn man Herausforderungen und stealth sowie Planung mag ein sehr geiles spiel
Difficult but fun to play with friends
I played a lot back in the beta and it sucked me in instantly sadly now that i actually own the game thanks to a friend i didn't realy got around to play with the finish product a lot I can realy recommend even more if you have friends to do it with
This one is hard and atmospheric Totally worth trying out
Mas te vale tener con los que tienes porque hay momentos realmente complicados incluso en los niveles mas bajos Realmente es una experiencia distinta y que vale la pena jugar con amigos pero os van a dar por todos lados
good so far silly even
A Co-op masterpiece
Best with friends on friday evening
no mms ya lo despertaste el juego
Get a 4-man group and explore the depths a game aptly named after the desire of your team the whole way through Good struggle that's made nearly impossible without good coordination be ready to fight like your life depends on it
Good

Really fun if you can get three other friends and then get them to stop crying after the first 20 times we lose horribly awesome co-op game for intense first person shooting fun
The only thing missing in this game is some sort of RPG element progress say Would be 10/10 with progress Or like a possibility to upgrade/customize gear Without this it's a 2/10 after playing two maps
this shit is so scary
Alone you suck at this game With friends you suck at this game I like it
Amazing game that runs like shit on proton

Work or die together my friends f"ed me a million times
You better know some teamwork
Fun Hardcore survival shooter once you get used to it tho it all becomes annoying
15 4
GTFO is one of the most make you shit your pants games Your flashlight drowned out by the darkness of the map trying to get the objectives done as fast as possible while also staying silent so you don't cause a horde to come after you It's a game of fear which is rewarding at the end With friends this game never gets old
It's very cool but really hard the ambient is dark and heavy the enemies are kind weird what scares the most combat is instant and fast kinda a payday but if it was horror game
Best Team Game Ever
I suck at this game
I suck at this game but it is an intense coop game teamwork is everything
spoko gra ale nikt juz nie gra praktycznie
ha ha funny stick go poke
Terrifying Co-op Game that takes time and effort to progress in
sleepers
Un juego que pone a prueba las estrategias y la con tus amigos o en caso si lo haces solo manejar a los bots
A really fun and also very hard co-op games which relies on team work Perfect for a group of friends who like games in similar style of left 4 dead 2
Spooky game Quite a challenge and fun with friend
Softly softly the dogs are loose
Un buen juego en el que si te gusta el estilo tipo sigilo junto a la estrategia y si te gusta invertirle un poco mas de tiempo para entenderlo este juego te gustar porque las partidas suelen durar horas mas si es tu primera vez jugando y tu y tus amigos no saben que hacer y no se quieren morir a la primera tratando de entender el juego xD este juego sale un poco de lo que vemos hoy en el juego es entretenido tanto para buscar un porque el juego es de primeras se puede jugar tanto con amigos como estando solo aunque estando con amigos lo hace dar una mejor experiencia claro el juego cuesta entenderlo en la primera vez porque no que es lo tienes que hacer al iniciar pero con tiempo y se logra todo dicen aun lo recomiendo para salir de lo eso chau Pd nose si esto te ayudara a motivarte a jugarlo pero si lo hace es bueno creer lo que escribi ayuda eso bye 3

A blast with friends game with huge potential and lots of love given to it by talented developers
nice
BDSM game
I spent a number of hours diving into hell holes and dark subterranean laboratories However I did not in fact GTFO
This game has continued to improve and the rundown format is incredible for keeping the game fresh Highly recommend especially if you have friends to play it with
It is great if you do have some free time on your hands as levels may well consume a lot of time as a beginner And do not play this if your ego is fragile you cannot deal with failure or you just want to play a relaxing game Practise makes perfect but you will fail a lot along the way
bom pra quem tem amigos

Very good game
dingil oyunu gelse oyun
A little bit difficult for leisure gameplay However it is really fun and exciting particularly due to its dark environment One point a bit annoying is that the checkpoint is rare Enjoy this game with your teammates and its excitement brought from the abyss
a
so hard
Have you heard of our lord and saviour glowsticks
fun
While the atmosphere in this game is superb just like weapons etc I dislike the not very generous checkpoint system and the need to watch guides to complete a level which can take several hours Still if you like hardcore team oriented gameplay with the need of communication all within a rich atmosphere you should give it a go
This game is okay according to me and is worth playing if you're looking for a shooter game to play with your friends It has some challenges in it that make it much more difficult than other games which is advantageous if you enjoy being challenged and frustrated
everybody gang until the scout start screaming
Amazing Truly amazing
fun to play with your friends especially you are going to get them killed
Great game good visuals hard as hell though but even better with friends A good challenge for those who are a bit experienced in group horde shooters
The final release of the Game introduced matchmaking and a solid performance boost as well as the addition of every former rundown I can reccomend this game IF you have 3 friends to play with or are willing to jump onto discord and meet new people for an awesome hardcore horror coop-shooter of the special kind
i suck
I love the game The atmosphere is intense and the feeling of death is around every corner You have very limited ammo and healing Teamwork is essential and you will fail without it There is ai bots to help you if you don't have any or enough friends I do recommend you play the game with friends or other people Overall the environment is unique the sound you hear and everything in general is really good 9/10
Really dope game i love the sneaking stealth stuff where you don't have to rush like a maniac like every other horror game that counts on going ham to win you gotta time stuff with ya team and cordinate the time when to strike or else you are dead meat also def didn't bother to write this just cause of the steam nomination thing lmao but fr tho good game feels like WH40k space hulk without the big boi suits on
2-5
So hard But This is so much fun
Goes hard
10/10
toll
this game rewards planning and cohesion thats why i end up cursing my friends at the end of every rundown
this game is scary
e
I thoroughly enjoy GTFO and always come back to playing it and i play it SOLO so i am masochistic I have beaten most levels solo but some are just purely made for playing with others which is a stigma i hope the devs drop in the future as players completely die off and more attention and buffs to bots are made This game is too good to just let it die due to losing players All of the Old Rundowns are coming back which makes for ALOT of playtime The Gunplay and Stealth play are both great the game does lean heavily towards Stealth though do not expect CoD The Graphics are beautiful and the monsters look and sound great Whilst not all the weapons are super viable they all do handle and sound great The Lore and Story are both really intriguing The only gripe i have is there are some gamebreaking bugs that still exist after all this time Been playing since release Rundown 6 but i have only experienced a couple of them most notably when i HAVE tried to play with a friend or two The game is extremely brutal and punishing even for a group of friends/randoms let alone a solo player but the game was'nt marketed as a Solo player game but most of it CAN BE DONE with enough patience and practice I do hope the devs make the game more solo friendly in the future though as a QoL change it can only breath more life into it
Just be quiet
Da
is spooky runs
Welcome to GTFO The year is 2040 and you live in Shanghai You complained about zero Covid policy on Chinese social media and have awaken in the complex Too earn back your social credit you must work with three other low social credit individuals to fight the infected while completing tasks given by the Byte Dance designed social credit system AI the warden Will you regain enough social credit to GTFO Find out for yourself by getting the game
yeah its cool if you like sitting and listening to clicks for at a minimum an hour also with friends
Either learn the game properly and coordinate everything with your friends or die miserably and Get The F*ck Out I have to say this game can be an amazing experience and the way it tackles difficulty options is unique Definitely worth buying but if you're not really into the genre maybe wait for a sale Can't speak much to story since some aspects of it are scattered or hidden in the game to find through lore related tapes and such and my experience with the game wasn't focused on learning the lore Monster variety is good and it only gets weirder as you progress in a good way Ambience is phenomenal
This game is great to play with friends I like how every level is not the same and the levels change
h1
Join to die its worth the ride
this game is spooky
Zombie survival except the goal is to avoid all the zombies and your guns only hold 3 nerf bullets with one spare to use on yourself when you eventually screw up the run Insanely hard insanely rewarding You need friends to play this 10/10
Bloody difficult and the recent update to include all historic rundowns permanently is a bonus to any new or returning players who missed the seasonal cycles
The game is very challenging and realistic What makes it fun is constant coordination and communication with friends Apart from that the innovative thinking required to hold back the waves makes it real fun
how to play this game
I suck at this game
Frustrating hardcore strategic horror but also rewarding Better with friends
ok
It's so hard

h1]Quick review of GTFO[/h1 b]Great things about the game:[/b Updates are super frequent Devs are super communicative on their steam posts/updates Has an atmosphere that is unmatched by anything else Mod support Gameplay is incredibly intense and allows you to take it as seriously as you want to as long as you don't start trolling super hard Great Visuals enemy designs Bots were added to allow more people to solo levels b]Less great things about the game:[/b It doesn't have matchmaking In my opinion this isn't a bad thing because of the amount of information you have to deal with I'd rather not have to deal with a random person joining and trolling as well But I'm gonna put this here because I see that there are plenty of people complaining about this Since the connections are p2p sometimes during the middle of a run someone will disconnect or the host will stop responding and everything stops working for a bit They made their own discord for people to use in case people want to play without using the bots everyone who I've talked to from there seemed pretty nice but I understand why most people don't like having to join a discord server to play multiplayer with random people After every update they add and remove certain maps There's a rotation I'm not going to explain it because honestly how it works seems to be changing all the time and I just didn't keep track of it at all b]The bad stuff[/b Some levels take a GOOD while to finish and since you can't stop in the middle of it you have to have quite a lot of time to be able to finish some of the later levels It is incredibly punishing for a more casual type of player I'd say that most people who got into GTFO got into it because of the challenges that it presented with its gameplay etc But for a more casual player this can be viewed as a bad thing I think Since there are no difficulty options even though the first levels are often quite easy when compared to some of the stuff at the end of the game it can be quite daunting for someone who isn't experienced with this type of game b]The actual bad stuff[/b Sometimes there are some pretty intense bugs textures sometimes completely disappear the audio sometimes completely bugs out etc Sometimes these bugs can affect gameplay by quite a lot But usually it only happens for a second or two and then everything goes back to normal although bugs related to audio usually don't The audio levels are EVERYWHERE with this game every time I open it I take off my headphones because if I don't I know for certain that I'll go deaf by how loud that opening is the noises for when you're going down to a level are incredibly loud as well I know that you can make the argument that it helps with the immersion etc But to me those could be quite a bit less loud and it wouldn't lessen the immersion at all h1]Conclusion[/h1 GTFO is probably one of the best games to play with your friends wouldn't really purchase it if I didn't know anybody to play with me though
Great Co-op with friends Edit Great way to start hating your retarded friends
mmmm yes would be fun if u didnt have a dumba lobster shooting anything that moves
Just an amazing game with the addition of bots it makes it more friendly to people who don't have anyone to play with and who don't want to play with random people
Great game that is somewhat challenging
Me caigo a pedazos
I did get the fuck out wow
Tough
Ive been playing this game since its beta and ive always loved playing with friends and trying to be tactical then everything going down hill quick cause we mess up its had a love a memories over the years of its early access and even now its still the game ive bought for about 30 friends its an amazing experience and highly recommend this for anyone with a group of four friends looking to play something together
Very enjoyable
The only game capable of filling me with unmeasurable amounts of dread with just clicking
Great game with friends would recommend
the monster's are really good makes it fun and challenging at the same time

Yes
10/10
awesome game to play with friends
This game is always challenging but fun as hell to play definitely need to get a group of people together to enjoy it fully I think thought
Die Together
Do not bring that friend with ADHD

Fun game if you have a group of friends and enjoy dying a lot Communication and stealth are key but sometimes going loud is unavoidable or favorable

game is horrible best game yet
Cool game but pretty hard as well it has a learning curve and if you fail it's sometimes pretty disorienting where you start again
buen juego dificil para jugar solo
I dont hate this game And I dont have hours where my opinion matters but bruh i should be able to do the first fucking mission Failing over and over and over and over because they put the last part of the objective in the farthest part filled with hordes of enemies in the first level of the map is so unfun im fucking crying
brrrrelo
juegazo muy dificil para jugar con amigos

Excelente juego para jugar con amigos eso si tiene que haber y un plan previo antes de pasar a ciertas zonas en las que la escala de una forma bastante agresiva puede llegar a ser algo frustrante pero siempre hay una forma de sobrevivir

Developers have brought this game a long way hell of a lot of fun with a group
o
miedo suspenso y la debido a los conocimientos que uno adquiere hacen a este juego uno bastante hardcore pero entretenido para invitar a tu squad a jugar y llegar a lo profundo de este Recomendado lo llevan actualizando ya hace un muy buen tiempo y no defraudan
This game is not for the faint of heart It is very intense and stressful but very fun with friends You can also play by yourself with bots but it's not as much fun
yeah its ok
Me 3 2 1 smacks My Friend smacks 2 seconds later Everyone gets alerted Moral Have better internet or friends xd

Love this game mainly because it challenges you to be better and also to learn the mechanics I also love the atmosphere as well as the weapons Also the new addition of adding all previous Rundowns is genius
thanks i hate it
i can't get past the 4th level but I'm having fun
pode comprar

i'm really bad at this game but it's hella fun with friends D
Super challenging scary and atmospheric co-op shooter Fantastic with friends and the community is really chill too Has a relatively good story though it's shrouded in mystery Some missions are off-the-charts challenging however and it takes a dedicated team to keep at it Work together or die together
Chadded game for those who just are good
I sentimenti sono quelli che provi su CS ma qui ti diverti

Muy bueno aunque bastante dificil y jugando solo lo es mas Pero si no tenes amigos el server de discord es mejor que el sistema de matchmaking Y los bichos corren como Naruto
Just an incredible game to play with friends The high and lows are just mindblowing It's also perfect to get the whoooooooo aaaaaaa if you know what I mean D
Awesome game in general if you have a group of friends
is cool
One of the best co-op games there is if you've got the patience to learn it Be prepared to die a lot
This game is about its gameplay and atmosphere Your only goal survival Therefore requires teamwork and managing resources much like the old resident evil games It can be frustratingly punishing due to missing checkpoints in older missions But this game is not about leveling battlepass or unlocking junk Challenge is its own reward
I want to kill myself
un jeu bien fait J'adore le jeu mais j'ai aussi eu mes plus grosse frayeur dessus oui je suis une poule
Pretty cool
great game
sexy
Me This rundown seems fun Lemme see if I can beat this challenge Also me proceeds to get burned out after the 27th attempt at R7C3 In all seriousness this game is challenging but can also be fun as hell especially when you get that small or very large injection of dopamine after beating a level you've had trouble with
nice game
Es un juego pero si juegas con amigos es mucho mejor muy de ir en sigilo y no a lo loco
Co-op heaven
Gut einen Spiele Abend unter freunden
I could have nominated it for Best Game I Suck At Award But the aspect of playing it with friends is what I want to highlight I mean the fact that the 4 of us failed several times for hours and hours on the entry missions speaks for the other prize But isn't shared misery half the battle What's wrong with two or three hours of GTFO in the evening I can tell you It's the blood coming out of my nose and the sweat running off the back of my neck after we were finally close to completing the current mission and then wiped again All joking aside You need a difficult game like this A nut you can only crack together One day when my friends and I can talk about GTFO again maybe we'll give it another try
Difficult but rewarding The intense tactical style really encourages working as a team and learning from your mistakes Definitely better with friends
pissed myself 10/10
Better with friends
Great game with friends Very challenging teamwork based game play with a bit of stress and terror Love that they're bringing old rundowns back to play again with slight updates
difficult but amazing game
Teamwork and Efforts is strongly recommended before you start the mission
Love the game Hackett is funny
Needs friends Don't buy without 3 friends willing to put in long hours Treat it like a job You are NOT allowed to have fun during this game Buy it Do it
This is amazing
its good

really good game i find it funny how we are sent down with some ammo
Attempted to try playing the game solo failed miserably either I panicked and lost my way after a firefight or I got my strike face ea strike Attempted to play with a friend I accidentally team killed him and fell to my own miserable death Attempted to play with friends everything above happened and we got traumatized together Attempted to play with pubs b REDACTED b FUN 10/10
Enjoy with friends Bishop needs to be watched as he likes poking things that shouldn't be poked when we are creeping by
Honestly one of the best games i've ever played It's really a shame that I have not much time to play it you need like at least 2 hours to complete a mission The game is so immersive filled with tension and wanting to GTFO you know
Almost there

Truly the best game you suck at
It was very fun game

NICE GAMING

Thsi game is easily one of the scariest I've played in quite a while and the fact that it almost gets scarier when you bring your friends along only makes it even better The atmosphere the enemies the levels all of it is incredible Fantastic game

I got killed cuz I didn't share ma med kit 10/10
Awesome game
This is definitely a good game Since they've added bots to co-op for groups who may not be able to get 4 players in it's become more accessible to users and I think is something I can completely recommend now It's a challenging 4 person PVE FPS where you will need to specialize with your team members and play around each others strengths and weaknesses It will take strategy in the pre-planning phase to ensure a successful run and even if you get all your planning right you can still alert a scout and all stealth goes out the window Definitely a really fun time with your friends and I recommend this if you're a fan of hardcore PVE
Fall damage heavy ratio Scouts give me depression
Make sure you bring that one friend who can't STFU so you can all GTFO
very good
My friends and I have had a lot of fun playing this I recently found out we where playing it wrong and you can do some crazy stuff on the computer terminal

GTFO is a game which has potential and its more fun with friends
ez 100 achievements highly recommended for the achievement hunters

Si te gusta sufrir este es tu juego
Es y es mejor con amigos Yo en mi experiencia de 90 horas jugando lo recomiendo mucho si eres una persona que le gusta aprender y es paciente tienes que saber comunicarte sino es casi imposible completes muchas runs La es la leche la jugabilidad es la hostia y las misiones son jodidas de narices Si vienes con la idea de jugar un juego facilito que te vas a poder hacer las misiones a la primera o que vas a poder jugar como cualquier otro shooter bye bye de verdad que no es para ti El punto negativo le al juego es que no hay mucha comunidad a de hoy para ciertas misiones y tengas que jugar con gente de otro continente pero un alto ping y ya Y como punto negativo la gente que se va en mitad de una sin avisar y te deja con una persona menos de verdad y por favor no esas personas no lo que jode llevar 30 minutos de y que se vaya uno sin avisar porque jode toda la experiencia

I'm confused Nothing makes sense I'm terrified Great game The whole experience is unique and fresh From the UI to the creatures and missions every aspect is something I've not quite seen before
Enjoyable game where the gameplay can suddenly change from a relatively calm experience to a heart wrenching and panic-filled environment because someone touched a tentacle
Gaming
Play this game with friends
Nice game for night
not bad need more friends
Like the challenge
An incredible game/experience especially with friends The checkpoints and bugs can be a bit of a pain but doesn't take away from the the solidness of the game and what it has to offer
C'est pas simple

SUPER FUN AND SCARY 10/10
After watching big time YouTubers break GTFO in and send some traffic its way I flocked to Steam with the rest of the internet and downloaded it immediately I first played this waaaaay back when it was in early access At the time it wasn't like anything else I had ever played before or had even thought about playing before I dragged my friends into it and as you can see from my hours we played it A LOT In terms of the game itself it has seen a lot of updates and finalised updates that have brought heaps of content the devs really do care about what they're making and strive their best to produce updates that not only are they pleased with but also the community is pleased with The game play is your average Get to point A or Carry Thing from point A to point B but the atmosphere environments the enemies and the complexity of the lore behind the game make these formulaic missions some of the most butt clenching heart racing experiences I have ever had in a game The enemies are unique and really terrifying they really put your FPS skills to the test and are probably the most creatively designed creatures I've seen in a while considering that this is a FPS horror game and not just strictly a spooky game Playing with friends makes the experience 100 better than playing alone or with strangers You'll find yourself either becoming a troop of hardened and jaded militant soldiers OR a group of deliriously screaming babies who don't know what a russian stealth move is yet trust me you'll soon find out Working together as a team is incredibly rewarding when you finish a mission or perfectly clear out a room of enemies without alerting a single one My only setback with GTFO is that my computer isn't able to handle it This part is my own fault I'm playing very graphically heavy games on a Surface Pro 7 that can barely load Firefox without crapping its pants But even so there are settings in GTFO that do allow you to customise the graphics more than enough to compensate for older computers I still manage to play the game on the lowest graphics and other settings and the game still looks polished and amazing My true gripe with the game and my friends can attest to it it seems whenever enemies load in from another room or they're spawning in the game gets tremendously laggy and often freezes my laptop or in the worst cases kicks another friend from the game I haven't played GTFO since last year but with the way the dev team operates they've probably fixed this issue by now It's a 9/10 for me Great game to play with three close buddies on a weekend night hop on voice chat and scream your guts out lovingly at whoever is left standing to come and revive you
This game is brilliant Me and my group of friends play for like 4 hours every 8 months because of how fucking exhausting one session is If you've ever played SWAT 4 with a group of friends Like actually tried to be good in SWAT 4 you're probably half-way mentally prepared for this game The game also pulls some weird fucking shit I've never seen before and it's fucking nuts
Good
scary alone funny with friends
I wish more Brazilians played this game The atmosphere the sound design how hardcore the game feels It's just the absolute best combination for a Co-op game Can't recommend enough if you have at least 3 more friends to play this with

Definitivamente un juego que a pesar de sentirse familiar por todas sus inspiradas en distintos juegos logra sentirse fresco y entretenido Recomendado para jugar con amigos y estresarse mientras echan las risas
hao
Better with a team Don't bother playing with bots
Best with Friends
The game great when you have a full team of goofy friends that laughs at every mistake you made
Scary tentacle man go OOOOoooOOoOo chaos ensues
Unforgiving really hard would die again With friends 8/10
IT S BETTER WITH YO BOYS

It good
Incroyable
I finally have friends who own this
Needs a dedicated team of friends
I have to say this game is so fucking funny if you play it with friends it kinda sucks playing it alone but the discord is there for that It got a full rework recently and Im gonna sweat it trough

Exhilarating and beautiful
Spooky but difficult game
interesting
Crazy Fucking Hard
When playing you can get a good cooperative experience and a stimulating visual experience.But,the game needs to be better optimized and the high image quality has obvious frame drop phenomenon
Aaaaaalrighty then i think this is gonna be my most serious relatively speaking review I've written in all my time on steam This game is pretty good Cant really say much more or less than that After putting about 100 hours into the game I can say however that there are a fair share of really really infuriating rundowns that tested my patience to the point of breaking R7D1 3 anyways its not half bad i just need a break from it cause my god does it take an entire night to do one good rundown Just remember Keep quiet and we'll be Almond Joy
legal quando eles arrastam a bunda no chao e cospem na sua cara

Si buscas un verdadero este el juego indicado
It's hard but it is so fun when playing with your friends
Very difficult to figure out at first but has a lot to offer Bring some friends
Pretty good game with an interesting play style I got the game a month after it was released for early access and have played a lot of it since I've enjoyed the direction the game is going especially now with its 1.0 release In its current state GTFO has some features that I haven't really seen in other games apart from something like Tarkov This would include aiming down a scope and only having the scope zoom as many games don't do this and a very well done thermal scope that still allows you to see thermal images even while not aiming through it Overall a great game and I have had a lot of fun
I liked the part where we left our friend to die and then he rage quit
an extreme 4 player cooperative horror shooter where the player is dropped into a massive underground complex and must either take something deep into the complex and get out OR take something from deep in the complex and get out these are long ranging from 45 to 60 minutes and very tense you choose your loadout with a primary secondary melee weapon and a tool like a sentry or mines and drop in with friends friends are kinda required especially for the second half of that updates rundown you have bots and they do make a difference but you need friends if you wanna get far i would say only get this game if you have friends or i don't think you will stick with it long rundowns have 4 tiers A,B,C and D that get more missions as they go on A only has 1 mission most of the time and D has 4 again only get this game if you have or are going to make friends and play it with them

Doing the Warden's work has never felt so satisfying Great community atmosphere is awesome and learn which of your friends you can trust to sneak into a room filled with sleeping enemies

Jesus Christ this is one of the most difficult and stressful games I've ever played but hot damn it is so good It's a survival horror co-op FPS where you get in do the objectives then well GTFO You have limited resources need to land your shots and teamwork is b]absolutely[/b essential I've never played a game that truly puts a friend-group's teamwork to the test as much as this game If you think you and your friends are up to the challenge then there isn't much out there that can compare to GTFO

Cool game Ez 2 play
Just a normal day of coal miners in 2069
Try to synchronize kills Someone messes up We waste all our ammo Die in next room Rinse Repeat
So this game is not everyone's take But for those that stick with it and enjoy its a treat
Game is challenging and has a fair learning curve but the satisfaction of finishing a mission makes it all worth it
Very very difficult I think my ground has around a 50 win rate though almost through the first rundown together and have had a ton of fun with the scattered lore haven't looked up pretty much anything about the game so we can piece everything together ourselves

It's okay to abandon your friend from time to time Only if you pick them up a little later
This game is one of those where you'll either have a very negative or a very positive opinion about it depending on the kind of player you are With that said I'll say that if you enjoy slow paced tactical games with sprinklings of intense action when it does come you probably will like this game But it's also very difficult with a high skill floor to overcome when you're just starting out which that alone is often a turn off to many players The last major thing I want to mention is that when I say how this game is slow paced I mean it's overall very slow You can spend several hours just in one level because of how long things can take especially when you are not super pro and know how to blaze through sections in the fastest way possible So if you're interested in a slow unforgiving but greatly rewarding experience perhaps more alike with the life of Sisyphus than most seem to know definitely give this game a try
painful and prestine
super fun game to play with friends 3
yea i doggy style all of these creatures doing this for steam awards
desw
All around amazing game This game pushes the limits of what a challenge games should be
great game but you gotta be willing to communicate
Foda 👍
yes
Horrify
This game is difficult well made and re-playable to an unbelievable degree money well spent 9/10
spent 6 hours on one rundown from midnight to 6 am good game
Played it for a few hours mid game cucked by annoying and frequent bugs
pube
Bom jogo que exige muito da da equipe e principalmente na da escolha das armas de cada jogador que ajudar no decorrer dos mapas
Fun game to play from time to time with friends depending on the difficulty and your experience a session can take 1-2 hours or a whole day just to finish a level
sale su left
This game has a terrifying atmosphere and captivating design however the online multiplayer is not the greatest when it comes to connecting with other players if you have friends to play with definately give it a go
I love being held down and violated by big strong ugly men over and over It really makes you feel like a girl in a hentai Truly immersive
Supremely fun atmospheric and challenging with the right group of people Unfortunately the game's biggest issue is having to peruse a Discord server to find people to play if you're short on friends who enjoy the time investment and difficulty of GTFO A niche game but well worth it if you're sociable or have a group of pals to play with
I suck at this game but that makes it funny
A unique coop experience that i would want to play again if there was more game play variety
Nice
If you are looking for a demanding tactical shooter to play in coop give this game a try It even comes with some horror vibes on top The quote Work together or Die together is not just here for the cool effect the whole game is based on cooperation and communication with your team You have little resources you don't even start each level with full ammo and you'll need to look around to find stuff helping your team stay alive Share ammo health kits before one teammate goes down because the whole team might follow Using terminals to search for items and objectives through some useful commands can and will help you be more effective You are encouraged to choose your fights either be sneaky stealthily eliminate targets with your melee or prepare well before triggering the whole room Because all the different kinds of monsters will be legion and ruthless against you Sometimes you will have to defend yourself against waves of enemies until you complete an objective to progress The game is meant to be played with other people to have the real experience but there are bots filling the team that you can control with quick orders They do the bare minimum so get yourself some team mates For the Lore-looking rats like me there are hints and dialogues telling you a bit about what's going on but the real treasure will be hidden in terminals Overall the game can be pretty rough at the start but once you begin understanding how it works I can assure you that it is a blast The devs have a Discord if you ever need tips and teammates
Great game

Hopes new levels can be updated faster
Absolutely amazing Not your typical sneak and shoot Has aspects of defensive and offensive while being at the mercy of the alien horde
Fabulous hardcore FPS game the terminal with simple basic Linux core still interesting
It's a challenging game that can be made better with friends or even bots If you are struggling too much then plenty of people are available to give you tips and the gameplay is very intuitive for learning how to play There are times where you want to stealth where you want to go guns blazing or where you need to defend a position Stealth is a major part of the game and it works very well Every creature placement determines how you go about a situation if it's too saturated you back off if it's not saturated then you pick creatures off one by one with melee Or you can just ignore that entirely and kill them with your loud ass guns There is no right or wrong way to play only live or die It's unforgiving and you may lose 30 minutes to an hour of progress but it just means you get better when you play it again next time There are constantly new missions to complete Rundowns that refresh over time for you to continue to keep playing once you're tired of the new content that gets added if you're even good enough to finish the content that is

Great game Love that they scaled back the difficulty for the first few missions But it was still fun when i was getting my ass kicked
hard
spooky game that requires a lot of planning and strategy recommended that you play with friends for best experience
Si esta bien esto es por lo de steam eeh coso guarda con los bichos que te atrapan y te llevan a pasear por el mapa el cuchillo rotisimo y la lanza ta buena ademas me gane una mochila que tiene una planta adentro re bonita

Game very hard game very fun
good good good game sa
Great game for people who get off on working as a team
l
i love the vibe but this game is so hard ive barely gotten to play it lol
Its a challenging game that I'd recommend greatly to play with friends The community discord is also full of friendly players that are willing to teach you the ropes of the complex and I'd highly recommend giving this game a shot on sale
You will die A lot
Good as
no u

bonk
epic but hard game
spooky co-op fps game primarily good if you play with friends and have good coordination skills
Told my friends to turn off the lights still got overrun anyway he didnt turn off the light
I love getting tongued by big meaty boys
It's pretty good the downside is that i dont have friends to play it
Pros Great Game Great Cooperative Gameplay Great Enemy Designs Cons Some Performance Hiccups If using earphones prepare to be grossed out by some enemy sounds intentional Eh's a great game eh shots mushrooms and don't afraid of anything
Fun game specially if you can get a consistent group to play it otherwise the official discord is a fine place to find people to play It has a few more than a few bugs but I haven't encountered any game-breaking ones or have suffered any performance or crashing issues some people have experienced these things so the game is not free from those looking at you R7D1 Contentwise this is a game you play leave and come back to play when new content is released I wished the developers were more transparent with content releases but it is a minor gripe If the game is on sale I heavily recommend you buy it I can't really encourage a full prize buy however
i suck but if i play with my friends then we all suck
10/10
pay attention to the blinking
Juego pero muy entretenido en cooperativo p
A combination of horror strategy teamwork and luck will be all you get here May your shots fly true and yes there is friendly fire

Excellent jeu d'horreur encore meilleur plusieurs Assez exigeant demande de bien se synchro et d'adapter son Le son a une grande place dans le jeu ce qui joue beaucoup sur l'immersion donc conseil ayez un bon casque
Fucking hard man but you can feel the satisfaction when finish the rundown
Don't wake the sleeping Chickens
Really difficult game that demands stealth steady aim and some resource management Also pushes for knowing when and how to bail if the situation calls for it Not an easy game Some advice when you go to play Either go all 4 players or solo with bots I was told this and it's not a joke It's not easier with an in-between If/when you go solo grab a bio scanner for yourself
The sounds of clobbering the zombie things in the head is 10/10

Pensa num jogo bom pra jogar com 3 amigos Multiplica por 5.000 Mil QUE JOGO FODA Incrivelmente sempre que jogo ele eu jogo sozinho mas ainda sim muito bom Recomendo altamente pra jogar com amigos Sozinho meio triste pois os Bots possuem uma intelectual avassaladora apesar de atirarem melhor que os players 10/10

Well Yeah better Get the fuck Out or u will die no matter what
Got touched by a tentacle and died My only two wishes were granted
Melhor jogo para jogar mal compre para jogar mal comigo
GTFO o jogo que definitivamente vai se frustar jogar 1 hora em um mapa morrendo no final mas bem legal de jogar com amigos fica o aviso que da pra jogar solo porque os bots conseguem te ajudar muito por conta da dificuldade do jogo
Spooky but rewarding
nice
En efecto un buen juego de a huevo que de ganas para poder ganarme una insignia Pero que mis motivos no los confundan este es un buen juego Entonces buscas terror desmedido sustos que te despeinen los pelos de los huevos historia y giros de que te pongan de punta los pelos del culo pues es debes de seguir buscando porque no En un inicio y dependiendo de que tan asustadizo seas algunos brincos pos no Las misiones son entretenidas dependiendo de la que hayas escogido puedes tener de un objetivo pero todo es de mapas que si tienes la paciencia y los amigos necesarios puedes pasar un muy buen rato con esta joya
Difficult but fun Best to play with friends but can still play solo although the bots albeit an improvement from before still aren't the best Will definitely continue to play and would recommend if you're up for a challenge
A great game Atmosphere is on point with great gameplay It's just a little too hard for my tastes
While Extremely difficult this game is still a great stealth horror
Un juego pero si juegas con unos buenos amigos
Buenisimo juego y dificil si lo juegas sin estrategia
Pretty solid hardcore game if you're the kind of person to like a challenge It requires teamwork coordination and be sure to keep your cool while you dive deeper and deeper
muy buen juego coop mas q la rectm pero es genial

Best game to sit back and get carried by your friends would recommend for those who like spending 2 hours of grinding and getting shit on at the very end having to do it over again

You're a Hacker No I'm an engineer nobody calls themselves a hacker
God this game fucks me every time I play it but it's still fun so I'm not complaining
Bem oque posso dizer sobre esse jogo GTFO um jogo extremamente punitivo e onde sua maior dificuldade se encontra nas rundowns mais novas e em suas mais profundas Jogar GTFO uma tarefa que deve ser encarada em grupo jogar solo ou com bots totalmente nos primeiros leveis das rundowns mas quanto mais fundo for mais vai sentir a necessidade de pessoas te ajudando aqui posso comentar do server de GTFO tanto oficial quanto Brasileiro que podem ser usados para encontrar e reunir jogadores para porem quero deixar claro que o servidor Brasileiro basicamente morto e quase que a jogar com pessoas de outros oque te obriga a dominar em pelo menos um o GTFO um jogo extremamente agressivo com jogadores novos onde por experiencia posso dizer que vai se encontrar em que pode achar que e frustrantes essas sim porem um conhecimento do jogo bom como por exemplo dano de armas conhecimento do mapa e local de spawn de objetivos oque vem a fazer com que o jogo seja mais um teste de memoria e do que realmente um desafio justo e divertido ainda sim existe sim desafios como objetivos e overloads alem do famoso prisioner eficiency que extremamente especialmente sem um time completo de jogadores experientes e com conhecimento da porem que como anteriormente dito podem sim serem vencidos aqui eu entro em um pequeno porem existem e objetivos nesse jogo como por exemplo a R7E1 ou muitas das prisioner eficiency que sim porque eu imagino que devemos considerar uma que menos que 1 da player base conseguiu terminar sem a ajuda de hack ou glitches essas as vezes podiam ser completadas com glitches passados exemplo disso a R7E1 que era facilmente completada com o glitch das portas que atualmente foi corrigido porem que existem mais no jogo e que portanto de serem completas por mais de 99 da player base nova que aderir ao uso de softwares ilegais hacks No geral era isso quero deixar claro q esse jogo um passeio no parque e ele pra qualquer um pode chegar achando q esse mais um jogo de stealth ou um shooter qualquer porque esse pensamento vai te levar a mais a frente no jogo a ideia dessa review era informar novos players o que eles encontrar nesse jogo que as 2 horas de reembolso da steam lhe permitem chegar a esses detalhes que julgo muito importante para os jogadores porem eu como um jogador de GTFO posso lhe garantir que se conseguir passar pelas adversidades o jogo sim sera divertido quando jogado com seus amigos e tenho certeza que em menos tempo do que espera conhecimento para se aventurar em algumas das mais do jogo salvo algumas cof R7E1 cof Se chegou aqui e gostou da minha review se ela te ajudou em algo por favor deixei um gostei e se claro uma eu a de todos e uma boa sorte nas suas futuras

This game is Left 4 Dead but super spooky mode And when a horde breaks out good luck

Truly one of the best cooperative games of all time Has me on the edge of my seat at all times and requires actually tactical planning and teamwork to survive Definitely well worth every penny

Grab a bunch of mates play a single rundown tier for 2 hours and fail don't touch the game for weeks due to failure of convincing friends to endure more stealth screw ups This is what the Warden intended
It's one of those games that's definitely better with friends It's a stealth coop horror game that plays a bit similar to LFD but at a much slower pace
i like
It's a skill issue
very difficulty
this game is fucking awesome
I am scared
Prepare to yell at your friends
DA
lovely jubbly
Awesome
It's a lot like Aliens Only recommended if you have at least one friend to play with though if there are just two of you you can expect to get a little over halfway through the rundown before the difficulty reaches a point where you need to either go on the Discord to find people to help stop playing or brute force the level over and over until you know its layout by heart and/or get lucky with RNG on enemy spawns It's a very difficult game and there are plenty of bugs most of them related to the checkpoint system but I've yet to have one actually break a run without any workarounds My main issue with the game is that missions can take a really long time and while there are mid-mission checkpoints there isn't any way to save and exit the game
Es un juegazo para jugar con amigos y disfrutar Miedo intriga y mucha y con dificultad alta Si alguien quiere que me
its good
Go in get scared die repeat What's not to love
Nice game with friends a bit too hard but its fire and fun
yup this game is very fun me and my friends like yelling at eachother
fun
jogo pra se estressar com seus amigos
You like to scream to that one friend that runs off on their own Buy
Great game for cooperative experience with humans online yes Requires math's and logical thinking as long as you can count to 3 together as a group and perform a simultaneous action you are sorted But do not relax your butt-cheeks just yet you never know what behind the corner which is fun Encourage people you know to buy it 4 choki-milk out of 5

So Cool
Played it for a while didn't like it
truly an immersive and horrific experience it is so immersive and simple yet so hard and challanging this game really tests your limits for smarts and will power and is so much fun with friends
I'm just reviewing this to get the points The game is alright bit of a slog though
Game
A challenging yet rewarding game for those who stick with it
Cool game cool stealth can't heckin aim to save my life
Great atmosphere tense gameplay that awards planning and preparing It really is one-of-a-kind
great atmosphere and great laughs with friends
I recommend the game because of its thrilling atmosphere which reminds me of the Alien-Movies Its difficulty makes it almost impossible to get the f*ck out when you play alone So better play with friends And btw today I nominated the game for the Game You Suck Award
its like a bdsm simulator
good game
Buen jueguito requiere mucho el uso del pensamiento logico el cerebro el mouse y el teclado asi que si no tienen ninguno no lo jueguen
Great hardcode game to play with friends

Very good but challenging game good to play with friends and the solo experience has gotten better ever since they added bots
real good and gives good spooks
The knocking just won't stop Sometime's I see them sometime's I see nothing They're reaching for me but my friend's won't accept them as I have WE ARE ONE thump thump
Insane game with stressful gameplay plz add me if you want to play looking to 3 peoples who are ready to tryhard
Game hard
bring friends only to shout at them for not being good at stealth and remember failure is never your fault 10/10
Challenging
This game is brutal both solo and with friends but it is so addictive Been playing with friends and is keeps kicking our a but we keep at it and it feels awsome when you complete the level you have been stuck on for ages It would be nice to customise weaponry with attachements colours skins ect or possible sounds for different guns i.e pulse rifle from aliens ect it would give it an extra nudge for being personal to the player I don't mean pay2win or microtransactions just a more ways of unlocking things to make it more of a personal experience Definitely recommenced if you enjoy playing with a group but it is difficult and rewarding Love the mechanical/cybernetic limbs
A game has never made me this stressed out relieved or proud Make sure you have friends though
prank em john
I swear these tears are only from the fun I'm having
Definitiv eine Herausforderung aber mit guten Freunden macht auch das versagen D
Jogo bom para jogar em grupo de amigos
Es que el GTFO es facil El GTFO
Muy buen juego y recomendado jugar con amigos ya que se necesita mucha comunicacion para planear muy bien las areas ya que se debe ser muy sigiloso y cauteloso pero tambien habra momentos donde se necesitara usar las armas cuando activen las puertas
In this game stealth is not mandatory but is heavily recommended and rewarded with not having nightmares
It's a game about trusting your teammates building unbreakable links with them making sure everyone knows what they're doing and yet inevitably one way or another someone including oneself will make everything go upside down
it alright
FGUICK HELLP
Very good game 10/10
Insane amount of game breaking bugs crashes and fps problems Makes it hardly enjoyable at times which is sad cause this game is great Devs don't give a fuck about it Also whoever came up with the idea of the spitter enemies aka mines wanted all of us to have a very tedious and boring time if they worked properly it would be okay but they don't even after all of that its still one of my fav games
Nice game
is good
top
My friends won't play with me anymore
e
Macht wenn man auch vorsichtig spielen kann
Sehr
isso sim um coop apenas sair correndo e atirando Melhor com amigos
Very dope game once you get the hand of the team player aspect first levels get the newbies stuck that can't follow team play later rounds become sweating intense lots of planing and shooting involved some times less shooting and more Hammer time
Fun shooter but you need friends for this
I love peeping the horror with the homies
This game will truly test your patience and the communication skills of you and the three friends you decide to play with This is not an action game there are moments of intense combat but make it through one wave of enemies and you'll dread the next Most of this game is resource and risk management Too many screw ups early in a run and you won't be able to finish Ammo health and gear are extremely limited so learning to take the safest approach is a must A lot of time in this game is moving carefully and searching for paths/objects

It good but could be better
Better than L4D series and a bit harder too Much better with friends and not alone with bots
Sleep paralysis demon simulator and your friends are schizo
Good game but has to be played with 4 players
Keeping it short the improvements and updates over time have made it a game I could really sink my teeth into Grab at least one other buddy and you'll find one of the best coop experiences to be enjoyed today Very punishing if you make a mistake but your trust and cooperation with your friend(s will only grow as you dive deeper into the depths of this hellhole with the satisfaction of getting through another expedition making it that much more worth the pain
Great atmosphere Very challenging Best with a friend
Is good
This game is amazing atmosphere but needs a team to get full enjoyment

i got laid by a funny tentacle boy
Honestly some of the best and intense co-op fun you can have If you got a good group of friends this is a perfect game to play together Very spooky
Fun game to play with homies Go to underground lab to make bebe smoothie and bonk naruto runners Die to angry horde summoned by tentacle that found your ass in darkness
RAHHHHH good game
Play this game so that you can laugh scream and have your brain melt out of your ears from the eldritch entities that are revealed to you
Get good teammates otherwise good luck making it anywhere

teamwork and all that
My cousin yelling my name over and over and over and over and over and over again asking for my help because he is surrounded by the horde I had already DIED due to the horde He finally realizes he's the last one alive and goes Ahhh F.U.C.K This will always be 1 of the funniest moments of this game 12/10 would trip the alarm again just to hear my cousin yell for help PRO-TIP C-Foam doors and corridors
3-hour sessions of red light green light
no pls
Definitely not your average co-op game GTFO requires you to talk with your teammates think about which rooms and engagements to go into and manage your resources during a mission in a way few games dare to
es un buen juego re tryhard esta god
This game puts teamwork effort and success to be rewarded by nothing Epic,just like life
Extremely entertaining gameplay with competitive as its strong side Not so stupid bots great commands options scifi cyberpunk style alongside command line utilization makes the game superb To be fair player bots is somewhat weak part of the game Playing with them is easier and harder at the same time Enemies become weaker and much lower amount of them spawns but the bots can ruin your run at the same time They take and spend all health-packs if they shoot you even if you 95 health Then bots take more health-packs and all over again
Eu sou um pai de 45 anos provavelmente uma das pessoas mais velhas a jogar este jogo Sou pai solteiro criando meu filho que agora tem 14 anos Meu filho ganhou este jogo de seu tio o instalamos em seu computador e ele a jogar o final da semana ele tinha 24 horas neste jogo Isso foi para mim pois era encontrar maneiras de passar o tempo com meu filho pois ele sempre com os amigos ou apenas assistindo ao YouTube eu decidi fazer uma conta no Steam e pegar esse jogo para ver se eu poderia jogar ao lado dele Eu comprei o jogo escolhi minha skin e mundo e comecei a jogar mas eu estava preso no que deveria fazer Pedi ajuda ao meu filho e ele organizou um jogo para eu participar Adorei pois foi o melhor momento que passei com meu filho desde que minha esposa morreu Desde esse jogo aproximou eu e meu filho novamente e agora passamos um tempo juntos fora de casa Este jogo me lembrou que em tudo e trouxe muitas felizes para mim e meu filho

One of the best co-op game ever After completing a level with your team you really feel like you've accomplished something The game require you to play in tandem with your team or die All levels have a different structure and visual design The sound design is excellent you can hear different sounds and understand what is happening now The only downside is that you need a team to play this game

Muito bom

When they say work together or die together they really mean it Can be played alone but for your own sake get a friend or two to yell at it makes it more fun
noice
Wenn man ein Horror spiel sucht in dem man ein Shooter/Taktik als auch eine Art von Stealth haben will dann ist GTFO genau das richtige Aber Freunde sollte man definitive mitnehmen und das Moto lautet Bravo-Six were going Dark
Good
This is a hardcore 4 person co-op shooter stealth is very prevalent resources are very limited and communication between players is very important to ensure a win Guns feel satisfying and powerful and melee with the heavy weapons is always fun It should also be known that you should be killing most enemies using your melee stealthily and that not every fight is worth it in terms of ammo and health I do have a few gripes mainly with fog and smog levels being very annoying to play on as visibility is heavily limited and the smog damages you over time I also have a grip with some guns feeling like they never have enough ammo and you don't spawn with full ammo spawning with anywhere between 60-80 capacity Edit They reintroduced dodging again to this game so much easier to avoid ranged enemies attacks now 9/10

I have struggled to explain this game to friends and why I love it but i think i have it down now The Co-op style of Left for dead but the quieter and more thought you put into you runs the less you will suffer But when things go loud on accident or on purpose the gun play to me feels tight and clean I love the atmosphere lore and world building that happens in the background And now with the previous rundowns coming back it no longer feels like i missed a big chunk of the game This is the Brick Wall I just love Smashing my head into

My opinion has changed over time and now I SADLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME simply because of my personal experience with bugs If I could change my review to thumbs down without losing the 164 reviews this comment has I would but since I want to keep this comment the way it is I will leave my rating the same That being said THUMBS DOWN to this game WHY I NO LONGER RECOMMEND/THUMBS UP THIS GAME I have played overall about 1100 hours at this time and have experienced way too many bugs but especially recently I have spent about 10 hours over the past 4 days and 5 out of the 6 runs I did on C or D tier levels have been reduced to being unusable due to bugs Firstly the bots sometimes won't stand in a full team bioscan which instantly wipes runs as I don't have time to delete and re-add every bot before I die In levels with checkpoints the checkpoints are sadly completely unusable because 90 of the time it gives me some game breaking bug From not being able to interact with resources to terminal uplink objectives being locked because a terminal uplink is currently in progress to not being able to type in a command on a terminal necessary to complete a secondary objective There are simply too many bugs even while not in multiplayer as I essentially only play with bots to recommend this game If the devs were to fix almost all if not all the bugs and maybe even add in a way to complete the timed terminal objectives with bots then I would change my rating again but clearly the devs either aren't competent enough or don't care enough to fix bugs in their game to save players like me hours of wasted time THUMBS DOWN MY OLD REVIEW THAT GOT THE 164 REVIEWS A bit expensive but definitely worth it Playing with bots can be irritating at first but once you learn their mechanics/how they work and act it's actually quite fun At times the game can feel unfair but it's almost always the player's fault not the game's For example one thing I thought was a bug for the longest time was long distance aggro It turns out that if an enemy is glowing and has a line of sight to the enemy your killing it has a chance to get angry which was news to me once I actually looked it up At times you may feel like quitting or you may feel like you can't get any better but if you keep moving forward trying new weapons and new tool combinations and trying new strategies you'll eventually get it My only complaint is that some levels are impossible to beat with bots like R7 D1 At the end of the level you must do an alarm where one person must enter a code on a terminal while another player enters another code on another terminal However bots can't enter commands and many of the terminals are too far apart to run from one to the other in time This is quite irritating for me because I don't have any friends that are willing to play that level with me and I'm not a fan of the discord server If they were to give the bots the ability to enter certain commands where it would be impossible for the player or if they were to give the player more time if he/she was the only one in the game that would be one thing but straight up making it impossible isn't fair to players who like going in solo or with bots Like me
I like this game since I saw a gameplay of it the intensity and the dependency on teammates is a real deal in this game Would like to play with the boys and see how they'd panic on the required stealth in this game

Harder daddy
Good game
Looks beautiful Wish I could ACTUALLY HAVE GOTTEN TO F'N PLAY IT disclaimer I am in South America so maybe the devs never tested or got their act together for connectivity down under I was so excited to play this game with friends in the US But after many many attempts and soooo much troubleshooting official support forums reddit posts others I never got to even go past the drop loading screen The loading screen would just play infinitely not just for me but anyone in my game my buddies in my room on steam We tried switching who hosted too How many attempts Steam won't let me get my money back from a game I never got to PLAY past loading screens and attempts to get over the infinite drop loading screen Steam tells me I've spent 2.5 hours on this 2.5 F'N HOURS TRYING TO GET PAST THE INITIAL LOADING SCREEN That's also 2.5 hours annoying other players who were wondering why their game wasn't loading because I was stuck DO NOT buy this game if you don't live in the US I can't fault an indie dev for not testing outside their region cause I know how expensive and difficult it can be but I cannot recommend this game to anyone who doesn't live in the main markets this dev aims at cause you're literally going to throw your money away I have not been able to play this game online since I bought it many months ago And I cannot get my money back because ironically I tried so hard to give it a chance Thank you Steam for your it's not how much time you spent playing the game it's just how much time you spent in general policy and thanks GTFO devs for idk not letting me play your game online at all
best have friends and patience otherwise don't attempt
I like to play this game with my 2 friends but that's the problem The missions are scaled for 4 players That is IT You don't have 4 players Fuck you you're getting overrun Come on 10 Chambers put player scaling in
Dur souhait difficile mais possible en solo
it took me like 30 attempts to beat one of the missions in the first rundown
Left 4 dead 2 but every level is an expert level A really awesome,challenging,unforgiving yet a fun experience
This 1080p game while interesting seems very poorly optimized It's causing my 4k capable card to drop frames often enough it's almost unplayable despite me shutting off various graphics options turning down other options like frame rates several times Game itself is kind of interesting and reminds me sort of doom with improved graphics 32 gigs of ram 6 core i7 Quadra M4000 NVME SSD
Jeu hardcore vraiment pas facile jouer avec des bots mais si vous assez d'amis pour jouer il y a plus de fun et surtout sera un peu plus simple Mais l'ambiance est insane le stress On est sur nos gardes en permanence Un excellent jeu
A fun game if you have friends to play with
Survive Together or Die Together
Fun game that me and my friends play
you will quickly realize that your friends are the dumbest people alive
Get The Fuck Out and head to the Mosque
Matchmaking is non-existant developer instead wants you to use third party tools just to find a game Inacceptable
games not fun conbstantly having to redo the whole mission nowhere near enough checkpoints so sick of it probs not gonna play it anymore its not fun anymore
Amazing foundation but unfortunately the bots are complete dogsh!t making the game near impossible without 4 people You can YT some sweaty video of someone soloing every map but it's usually a stupid amount of time and cheesing the waves by training certain mobs before triggering an alarm door Which I'm sure took hours to figure out prior to even being able to solo it Fix the bot AI add some more checkpoints throughout and the game would be amazing
If you don't have friends bots won't save you
fun with friends
I love this game so much Although I haven't put much time into it myself I've watched so many hours of gameplay and absolutely fell in love with this game Make sure you've got 3 other buddies who wanna play with you though

Great game to play with friends
Today I realize one things proving yourself is a man is very difficult but proving yourself is a piece of shit is very fxxking easy here make an example about 10cc Yes of course you used to wish to us that this year will published R7 and R8 but what we saw just now is that you said is that you wanted to fork the old rundowns and after all begin to start the rundown 8 And after one months when the Alt rundown 1was published you still publish the Alt rundown 2 Is that means we need to wait for almost another a year to wait for rundown 8 Without publishing any new things like new levels new weapons and new enemies I think yes And the third picture also proves the fact that you willing to publish the rundown 8 this year.Am I right When it was in August at the Cologne Game players in your game wish to see some new things in gtfo however the only information we received is that you said you wanted to make a new game even you tell us you wanted to give up gtfo your action prove now Ohhhh it really give your fxxking face a big hit In one case you really hate those players who use model to make some new levels and new monsters but at the same time you plagiarism their ideas you think is ridiculous I think so know how to make a game just make it Just do the fxxking actions of cheating players You may not believe it now choosing anyone inside the model players will makes gtfo better Also I remembered you once said that you guys really wants to make a game likes L4D2 for about 10 years At that time likes most of the players I believe you really used your heart to make this game Now proves you are using your fxxking s to make gtfo
This game is Fun and challenging which i like I play with my friends and they are not the easiest bunch to play with but we still managed to get by eventually With the conclusion from all of us is that the game is great aside from the lack of personality within the characters dialogue Other wise great team oriented experience if that is what you are looking for just make sure you got some people you can tolerate

GTFO ist ein echt geiles Game bei dem es so einige in meinem Freundeskreis gegeben hat Es ist echt hart auch mit vollem Team
GTFO is a peculiar if not one-of-a-kind coop shooter where the act of shooting means something has gone terribly wrong is about to go terribly wrong or actively trying to make it go horribly wrong On the other hand if saving 20 minutes on clearing a 3-level pitch black room with invisible enemies by alerting them all and funneling them into a kill zone is wrong then I want to be right Note than while the part is optional Get some friends or get over whatever social anxiety you might have but having more than one bot make a for a good gameplay experience There is enough misery in store for you in this game as it is Descend into an enormous underground mine as part of 4-man crew with intriguing backstories and personalities expressed in over 25 minutes of recorded dialogue for each character of which hear the same 10 lines over and over again because 10Chambers decided to cut it all out for whatever reason Preserve the peaceful slumber of hordes of sound and light-sensitive nudists by turning it into an eternal one with a selection of thoroughly satisfying melee weapons Lament never having enough ammo for the equally satisfying guns Experience the glory days of DOS and the command prompt at the local terminals because apparently Enterprise-level Windows licenses got so expensive by 2052 that it's cheaper to acquire thousands of brainwashed rent-a-cops and the most nonsensical security system ever devised in fiction instead Carefully make your way through various hazards as they steadily grow in difficulty from flickering lights scarce resources and alarm-tripping doors to impervious infectious fog rooms full of boss-level enemies alarm-sounding spaghetti monsters complete blackouts and game-breaking bugs that remain inexplicably unfixed since the release Force yourself to unlearn worth of bad habits acquired via Left 4 Dead and Vermintide and relearn the value of patience planning stealth and methodical kleptomania as opposed to rushing ahead Experience utter despair as even the best-laid plans fall apart anyway due to failed attempts at stealth panic or worst of all poor speed typing skills Delve into the deep background lore that starts with deceptively simple and entirely accidental parallels to the Current leisurely takes a few pages out of Dead Space and then suddenly jumps off the cliff into a byzantine abyss of intrigue that even the dedicated residents of the lore channel of the Discord are struggling to make sense of Spend 3 hours to complete a mission with all the convoluted optional objectives and experience a dopamine release that will probably earn you the attention of your national drug trafficking control agency Engage them in an argument that using mods and abusing bugs that work in your favor cheating on the grounds that 10C fixing the game-breaking ones either and the mods are mostly quality-of-life and should be part of the game in the first place Bash your head against the wall in some other even more convoluted mission for days Swear to yourself never play this garbage again Spend the night pondering tactics and come back anyway Adapt Improve Ultimately succeed There are no levels no grinding no gated content Whatever you earn in GTFO by your skill alone Well either that or you got carried by your team but finding one is also a valid skill to have
this game is good if u have friends i dont but i still think its good
gratis
This game will give you some sort of mental illness but said mental illness will also protect you and help you survive the complex
If you like difficult stealth based games with high tension moments its a great pick up its scary for a while but once you understand the game mechanics it loses the scary feel However its a very thrilling survival horror game when stealth goes wrong trying to manage your tool ammo gun ammo I was able to beat the first Rundown with bots the game takes a lot longer with them but they are decent enough If you have a group of friends who like team tactics and a challenge would probably be a better experience
its really boring was expecting a fun horror coop game hope future updates makes it fun for others but for me its simply boring
b]TL;DR This game is a glorified item fetching WoW quest set in Resident Evil's Hive Except if it was actually The Hive it'd look better.[/b Garbage The game claims to be a 4 player hardcore experience When it says 4 player it means you actually cannot play it solo It's impossible to complete any levels as a solo player even with bots All bots do is follow you and shoot enemies They don't complete objectives besides bio-scans Now you might be thinking It has matchmaking and you would be right except the game is dead 500 players online on average matchmaking takes ages and that's coming from someone who used to play Hunt Showdown If you don't have 3 friends to play with don't even bother looking at this game Next problem I have with this game is that it claims to be a serious challenge but the only serious challenge is the dogshit design of the levels the poor execution of what fun objectives should look like Basically all you do is walk from point to point fetching items that's it That's literally it Once you've fetched the desired item you're prompted to go back to the spawn point There are no fun mechanics and the only difficulty this game poses is how badly it's designed Lighting is atrocious you have a flashlight that's basically useless With your flashlight on you can see 2 meters in front of you God forbid you use your flashlight in the fog which seems to be everywhere It's annoying frustrating irritating It's not creative fun and definitely not challenging Another big issue is the enemies They're all very similar to each other visually with no real differences in attacks besides the clear distinction of ranged and melee There are 3 big monsters that have a unique ability but again it's a very boring design that doesn't really prompt you to change your playstyle or think about the game differently The only enemy mechanic is basically don't aggro them if aggro'd you'll get a big swarm They don't have different weak spots no real strengths besides less or more damage dealt Speaking of enemies it's almost impossible to hit them because the hit registration of this game is horrendous Not to mention the models of enemies glitch back and forth sometimes even seem them stuck in the floor up to their torso Everything mentioned above repeats from rundown to rundown it does not get better as you progress it does not change with different items different weapons It doesn't matter It's an absolute joke this is what came out of a 2 year early access game The overall graphics of the game are okay until you take into account the performance Barely running 70fps with everything turned off and low The game does not look that good to be running this shitty Obviously it runs on Unity engine because why would you actually want your game to run smoothly and have proper lighting I can't say why it's optimized like dog poop but considering it's Unity the problem is probably memory leaks Pretty common for this trash engine
Sneaking around smashing heads trying not to die with your friends It's a good time
Nightmares BUT WITH FRIENDS
great game
Builds social skills better than any other game I've played that's for sure It's worth the price-tag but not your sanity good luck
Sorry I couldn't hear you over the sound of me shitting myself
I'm writing this having only 10 hours under my belt so I'm basically still a noob but this game is obviously a masterpiece Every level is a smart excercise in teamplay and/or planning and to pass it you need to build your experience fist messing up dying wasting precious resources and time taking hits of adrenaline mixed with frustration Once you have your plan developed you beat the level making it look easy There's some lore smartly weaven into the game Aesthetics are great Gunplay is designed to make you feel like things gone to shit and the messy part started so don't expect to make any 360 noscopes Don't expect to find a team via matchmaking but you have an options either to go to GTFO Discord and assemble the team there or host the game with bots it's basically a solo game but is great for exploring the levels All in all GTFO is a deliciously hardcore experience for any shooter fan with good taste
highly recommend this game if your looking for a gritty squishy spooky coop survival horror game iv played it a fair bit in total and are even in the discord and its a fun game for a 4 stack of friends looking for an hr or more to grit through together and survive it it will test your screaming ability and trust of one another not to accidentally shoot one another but that adds to the fun watch ur fire take down the creatures but most importantly,try to survive
good
Fear so much fear You will want to kill your friends after Levels feel like days You will lose sense of fear after so long You will die You will repeat levels Your friends will kill you You will forget your light on This game shows no mercy None Not a drip of mercy for you Oh and they nerfed shotguns to the point it takes 3 shots at point blank to take down the weakest enemy I do not know why because they did not start OP This game is a 10/10 Worth every penny I spent oh and any devs reading when dropping in the hole everybody gets a major fps dip do to trying to load every asset into ram And this is from m.2 loading to 12gb of ram on the graphics card itself
super fun with friends
GTFO is a great survival horror/first-person co-op shooter that as many here have said is best played with friends Right out of the gate the game dumps you in the world's worst rollercoaster and kicks you half a kilometre underground expecting you and your schizophrenic comrades to do the bidding of the mysterious Warden The gunplay is great the weapons punchy and the gadgets and gizmos incredibly fun This isn't the focus of the game though which would instead be the team-based communicative stealth/thriller-style sneaking that you have to do in-between alarmed security doors to ensure that you've enough supplies to fight off the horde when they arrive Whilst the game is definitely best played with friends the developers have included bots that can at least act as a few extra guns in a firefight but don't expect them to be much more than that The true enjoyment of this game is found when it's shared with others
Difficult scary and immersive Also tests your friendship
Made my heart race like a red hot Ferrari engine Solid atmospheric co-op experience 8.5/10
the women in this game scout scream when they touch me with their tendrils just like in real life
Brutal hay que tener algo de paciencia y mucha estrategia y en equipo Lo recomiendo
meow meow meow rawr meow
Played it with a few friends but after the 2nd or 3rd run you have to get really tactical or else you start all over again with your team This can be somewhat frustrating at times and even though i like the Gameplay and Atmosphere i probably won't play this again
not daijobu
A wonderfully eerie and punishing co-op game where you sneak into an abandoned research complex You have various missions throughout exploring this huge multi-level facility level by level One more difficult than the other Often you have to hack or gain access to relevant doors from locations that are off the beaten path ultimately coiling you through corridors and rooms like in a maze Ideally you want to reach your destination and sometimes back again with as little attention drawn to you as possible The base is filled with monsters mostly blind ones that have keen hearing and can pinpoint you easily if you make a ruckus So essentially about sneaking and avoiding confrontation until you slip up or the game forces you to trigger alarms to draw in the hordes You only have so much ammunition to go around And nothing is more disconcerting than arriving at your final destination with an empty magazine knowing about to go down nothing really unique about the game i]on paper[/i very much a co-op shooter like a lot of other games before it What makes it unique though is the atmosphere and pacing also very particular in how it wants you to play You need a steady hand Patience always scrounging for ammunition It has a very oppressive and hopeless feel to it always i]just barely[/i pulling through regardless of how well you know the mission I love it Highly recommended if you want a slow-paced and gritty co-op shooter to play with some familiars
If you like a challenge you'll like this game good fun in a team a bit frustrating as a solo player I really recommend it
You can play this game in VR and even tho that's just a mod it's horrifyingly functional With or without VR this game will make you uneasy and it has quickly become one of my personal favorite VR games If you have a VR headset and controllers buy this game get the VR mod from the FlattoVR discord or google and have a diaper on stand by

This game doesn't have RPG progression if you want that kind of power fantasy where you get literally stronger as you play play Vermintide/Darktide etc This game DOES however support a very noticeable skill curve and has some incredibly satisfying sound visual design It's very tense at times and at others you're mowing down hordes of enemies Play with friends and it's a fantastic time
for 10 Chambers I hope AI will hold the fog turbine or hsu when I order for them

Your friends are your biggest enemy

amazing game
This game is indeed cooperative and a shooter but scary No the enemies don't look sound nor act scary They are pale make clicking noise and are just standing immobile If you want a scary shooter just play Dead Space
Bright and colorful game easy-going for new players perfect to chill with friends plentiful resources a trip mine can wipe out your whole team 10/10 would die again
a game worth your while
Best with friends

Looks like a lot of fun the immersion is good gunplay is okay eneymies variety are great But after doingtthe game for 9h and doing the r1 and r7 camapaign i learned that all the campaigns of gtfo are locked behind time event so has of now i can't have new content until the game does rotation the game lock you from seeing what he has to offer and force you to wait so after only 9h i did all that was to offer and i need to wait 2 month to have a small amount of new content Not great

Tag-line sounds a bit cheesy at first but it's the perfect summary of this game Properly brutal but in a very satisfying way Highly recommended but only if you either have 3 friends that are willing to get it with you or if you're not afraid to LFG on their Discord
This is such a great game ruined by such garbage bots If you dont have 4 players you're basically required to play with bots but the bots are programmed so poorly that they wont even stand inside of scans making you fail missions for no reason whatsoever
With friends this game is the closest thing to a shared horror nightmare absolutely dreadful and ghastly in a way in which relying on your partners is mandatory to keep a gaming sanity Little to no other games provide the same sense of accomplishment for surviving and achieving objectives as a unified mind an absolute masterpiece
I don't know it really pushes you out of your comfort zone

Hello I am ConnyS The Man The Reviever The Legend The Friend Be Warmly Welcomed To My Review Of The Century This Time I'm takong on the gamer gamer GTFO It is a Excelent Game Supposed to Be Scarish but also it is very Hard It is the break of the sweat of course i am wet First of ALL GTFO stands for Get the F**K OUT xD is a funny prhase Also So funnier When you try to be in the game becaus you are try to get the fuck out When you realize the faciliti is full of fricking monsters and faaaking Very Fast Guys GTFO is also very Aggresived to say very cool as well as badass as it is xD ha Seconf of all it is a very Hard game like Me xD You really are suposes to try to supres the fraking gangsta bad guys that try to run for you and kills you hahaha you are the slow you are the fast once i forgot my past da suns tells me to domniate the WOOOOOODL xD Third of all The game is very Scary Not really But Could be If you were was a feaker p+ssy-man lmao laughiny my rofl off LOOLO then of curse you can be BRAVE and horny I HATE KIDS I HATE KIDS Also the Atmosphere is Galantically Good Cons of All Give the gun a more Ammo Because I want to Kiss the P+ssy Summary Great Game Great Times S Great Times E Great times X Great Times PS GoodByes and Hugs From Conny The S Ratings 0.232/0.314 S3X 1000 Family Life And Friends Status 78 mashine-guns The game requikes friends btw you if arent known that also Good To Know
I got this game especially for the atmosphere and it was WAY better than I ever expected Most games I play I get bored with after a month or two but even after finishing both rundowns that are currently out I still go back and play earlier levels with new people It nails the team aspect of it and one of the best things about the game is actually its community I have only met ONE toxic person in the 150 hours I've played so far comparing that to some of the other games I play that is really good Most of the people that you find in the discord are very nice and genuinely try to help new people out If you are thinking about buying the game and really like cooperative strategy games that punish you for messing up then this is definitely the game for you And even when my team messes up and our progress gets reset I don't get mad So I would 100 recommend this game to everyone
This is a strange review for me to write Looking at the sheer number of positive reviews for this game I feel like I'm missing something because I did not enjoy this game at all and co-op survival horror is my jam so this surprised me There is a ton of potential here and the core of the game is strong There are some great visuals and good ambience throughout but some things felt really out of place For one the UI is clunky I had to search online to figure out how to create a multiplayer game with my friends Ammo tool and health packs weren't intuitive to me at all When I picked these up I couldn't figure out how to use them The UI font choices are very small and in some places the contrast between the text color and background is not sufficient so its very easy to miss UI queues Lastly the weapons feel pretty shitty compared to other FPS games I was constantly underwhelmed by the damage I was doing to enemies and frustrated by how unrefined the guns felt This is difficult to explain but I've played a lot of FPS games and the machine guns felt cheap No matter how good my aim was it seemed like most shots were missing just for effect The questing is very tedious Go find this item now find a terminal and enter a command now go find a key card now double back and go open a door but wait for the security scan If you compare this to Aliens Fireteam Elite the level mechanics just feel unnecessarily slow with lots of doubling back and repetitious tasks to perform As I said before the bones are good This game has potential and I can see how others may love it but it wasn't for me I'll come back in a few months to see if patches have smoothed out the UI issues and streamlined the gameplay experience
VERRRYYYY GOOD BUT I HAVE UGLY PANTS AND I REFUSES TO GIVE ME ANY MORE
good gunplay intriguing setting great visual design

stressful and action packed the game also give you the least amount of ammo because this game is a sadist

A multiplayer horror game that's too timid redundant predictable and time-consuming to actually be scary or even entertaining for that matter The game has exceptional environmental detail and lighting mechanics but ultimately provide the unpredictable and diverse arrangement of antagonists or high stress game mechanics the Containment Breach-esque genre requires
Pain suffer pain/suffer dissapointment pain awesome expirience Havent enjoyed a game so much for a long long time Game for gamers not mass-market casual clown-looking shooter Hope devs will continue same way they always did so far Wanna c more varity of monsters and their mechanics More guns More bad-ass traps
Very fun game with friends
Gutes Game Es sollten 4 Spieler vorhanden sein

hard and tense 100
Very exciting coop game I just recommend to try out
This game is phenomenal It actually makes me wish I had friends
very good game the tension in all of the levels the enemies are horrifying,i would reccomend
stupid monsters i hate
Extremely buggy and unpolished but without a doubt the best hardcore co-op FPS
Joa kann man machen.Ist janz
Great game if you have a group to play with
fun
If you aren't good at working with players to achieve an objective together then this isn't the game for you This game does take a lot of strategy and running in guns blazing isn't the strategy here ammo and meds are limited and checkpoints are far enough apart that it's really annoying to die The thrill and atmosphere is amazing and it really makes you feel like you have a team and are working together to get through the rooms to the end 10/10 would try
1 2 3 4
It's like Alien Swarm but if Alien Swarm wasn't shit Gareth will still shotgun you in the back though
dont go alone cause this will happen to you 15/10 recommend this if you wana piss your pants
On the whole this game gets a lot right but also relies a little too hard on trial and error tactics in some places of the game to substitute genuine difficulty If you have at least one friend you play games with regularly have a lot of patience and are willing to die/wipe and lose in the region of an hour or two for the sacrifice of slightly greater knowledge of the task ahead You will be able to enjoy this game with the help of bots to flesh out the team The game rewards careful planning and understanding of the mission It rewards effective dispatching of enemies resource planning and conservation of ammo and health and the subsequent teamwork required to ensure everyone keeps moving There are some amazing moments in this game when everything clicks together which will stick around as being some of the most fun you'll have with friends in an online game Tense firefights with meaty gunplay fleeing to the extraction and methodical stealth are all excellent in this game The atmosphere is perfect and often genuinely scary difficult to achieve in company of others and the game looks great and runs well The games biggest issue is the way it implements difficulty into it's level design In my years gaming and recently coming to appreciate difficult games I've come to learn that there are generally two schools of thought in difficulty in games Difficulty that requires trial and error and difficulty that rewards the players mechanical skill and understanding of games systems While quite a lot of GTFO falls into the latter category the alarm doors unfortunately fall into the former It is the games biggest weakness and is in stark contrast to the rest of the games excellent design Alarm doors require you to stand within circles which are placed throughout the environment in order to unlock the door while at the same time fighting off waves of enemies The problem with this mechanic is that there is no way to know beforehand where the circles will appear rending it impossible on first try to effectively and strategically position yourself or your turrets/mines and deployables as you may end up going to the far end of the room exposing yourself to danger or having to place yourself in the line of fire of your turrets killing yourself in the process The game does not give the player any way of easing this experience or rewarding their mechanical skill or knowledge of games systems to overcome it This is intended to be difficult But an absence of knowledge does not translate to fun difficulty Just inconvenience Fortunately the circles are not randomly placed each time The result is that the most efficient and convenient way to play this game is to just rush into the first few attempts of a level with the specific intention to wipe purely so that you can learn it's layout and see where the circles are placed allowing you to eventually map out the proper strategy required to eventually beat the level I still enjoy the game and would recommend it but that's the sort of game it is and it requires a specific kind of person to enjoy it It's very gamey and instead of rewarding skill it just rewards patience to its frustratingly unforgiving save system spoilers there isn't one in order to unlock knowledge of the map which you could skip by just watching the level on youtube if you wanted If you can execute a solution on first try by just watching a youtube video the difficulty is not skill-based You cannot watch a playthrough of Dark Souls and then just smash the game it requires skill In my opinion this could've been handled much better while leaning into the strengths of the game Allowing for a much more rewarding difficulty experience based on skill and teamwork It would be MUCH better if there was an option of learning the position of the circles ahead of time which requires careful planning and execution to achieve For example maybe an optional side-objective in which you have to locate and hack a heavily defended terminal The circles would be randomized each time you play the run but hacking this terminal would give you their locations ahead of activating the alarms later allowing you to effectively set up a defended position In this way the players are presented with the option of either risking the health ammo and resources required to complete the secondary objective and being able to more effectively prepare or stocking up going gung-ho and hoping for the best I'm not a games designer but I am passionate about player agency and the alarm doors are not good in this regaurd which is surprising given how great the rest of the game is To be clear I still recommend the game fully to those that can stomach this one aspect The reason this review is so fixated on the alarm doors is because its the only area of the game where I feel the ball is dropped It's otherwise a solid game which has now been updated to include boatloads of content and will provide hours and hours of rock solid co-op fun for those of us who can set aside an hour or two every now and then to dick around and learn the levels
I had to carry around my son in a steel seed looking thing while shooting at weird creatures and always running out of ammo I named him Andy I'm sure nothing bad will happen to it Caution If cronenberg body horror disgusts you this is not for you
Buen juego tactico a nivel de crear clases y de estrategia cooperativa
This high intensity and INTENSELY Difficult shooter is best played with a team of four human players however you do not NEED to since the bots have been added The atmosphere and darkness will give you an unparalleled sense of claustrophobia and fear during the stealth sections When the facility goes loud and the alarms start blaring there is no game that gives the sense of hopelessness and determination quite like this game does Seeing dozens of tough as nails zombies flood towards you in the dark cramped halls of the facility all while counting each and every bullet just gets my blood pumping Something that I enjoy that lots of players dislike is the instant access to all the equipment and loadouts in the game There is no real progression in the game besides beating the mission and going onto the next one as well as the collectible single use buffs you can take at the beginning of a mission Similarly to Left 4 Dead with a Pay-and-Play mentality with no unlockables or conventional progression Working together is VITAL to survival and I CANNOT STRESS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS OR A TEAM The fun factor of this game scales TEN FOLD when you have a good group to play with If you have EVER enjoyed Left 4 Dead 1/2 Killing Floor 1/2 Vermintide 1/2 or just enjoy Co-op Shooters THIS IS THE GAME TO PLAY Co-op Fantastic Game Solo Kinda Bad Game
si
very good and suspensfull game would recomend playing with friends though
Half of the time me and friends are screaming very fun but really bloody hard and i love the game for it it doesn't hold back any punches and i can respect the devs for sticking with the hard difficulty
My friends and I drew the sussy impostor on the map then died to horrific monsters
Incredible game punishing yet very rewarding Atmospheric tense and very eerie Voice acting is well done Stealth to fighting for your life in a second Very unique hud and ui 10/10
its has men
Very underrated co-op game You should play it
Masterpiece
It is scary but so fun with other people tactical stealth and the multiplayer is essential As the game says work together or die together and a good weapon selection same with melee sort of 4 choices hammer not good at anything but is a jack of all trades the spear same stats at the hammer but longer range no sprinting while charging an attack has more damage to the nape head both sides and top of the chest In my words training wheels but it is the best counter for one type of enemy scout The knife a very quick charge up time about 0.5 seconds Good for taking out a group of enemy's fast assleep good pun and the hand bat similar to the knife with a 1.2 secs and bit more damage very fun i rate it out of 10 8.5/10 all in all a very great game
yes
this game is pick your poison you either play with your friends bots or with both but its hard to tell which are which
I accidentally bought this game last year and I still don't understand all the hype This is how games should be made my ass
Will test your sanity like no other game can 10/10
TERMINAL v1.0 2023/12/10 Terminal System Update FeiLiya/:writing message 8.0 FeiLiya/:close terminal system System/:system close
Its good D
i'm so bad at tactical games but i love this one so much the lore the weapons all of it
I hesitated to buy this game for the longest time worried about how easy it'd be to pick up how well it'd run how stable it'd be etc As of writing I've completed two runs and had a fairly chill time with one other friend You don't need four companions to have a good time you don't need a try-hard mindset Just a trust-worthy partner some patience and a taste for tension
Ive had this game for a couple months now but only played it like 4 times Never played it with more than just myself and the only reason I don't play it much is because of the absolute TERROR i experience when I play it 10 10 game imo
lksdjlaksjdlaksjdlaksjdalkjdlkajdlkajdlkajdlkasjdlkas
yeah it's alright get friends tho
Great fun with 3 other friends The bots make the game playable alone but it's not as enjoyable A truly challenging and terrifying experience would recommend
Spooky They make clicky noises
once you get going its a challenging and heart racing game that rush to the extraction gets my heart racing every time The matchmaker totally sucks and having to use discord for games is a pain
team work horror
It's an awesome game when you have reliable friends who are actually able to work together coordinate and plan ahead It's an awful game if your friends have none of the qualities mentioned above.same goes if you don't have friends at all I know this might be an issue for a lot of people In this case.just.just stay away from this game Have a nice day
A sci-fi masterpiece But online is around 0 Finding teammates is the most challenging part of the game at the moment You either play with old fans on discord who spoil all secrects and interesting things everything about following map or try to find first-timers whom are sadly very few
GTFO REALITY This game is really test of your patiances knowledge and friendship if they are team player Every bullets counts in game and you can get dry real fast and good luck finding them in long expedition or BS ones Simply my favorite hardcore tactical horror co-op game out on market One part of game is creepier than Death Stranding entire game
rundown
It is a good game for the most part Good with reliable friends better with unreliable friends Could do with more enemy types and a gunsmith

Honestly triggers my nostalgia Makes me think of OG CoD zombie mode It's a little more intense than that but if you miss co-op shit like that you'll enjoy this game 3
SI QUIERES JUGAR AGREGAMEEE El juego vivo de lo que pensaba es simplemente espectacular conoces gente chida y tiene una muy buena es bueno que te acostumbres a probar todos los tipos de armas y accesorios para que nunca dependas netamente de una sola te da aires de y es demasiado entretenido que si quieres jugar GTFO o HUNT SHOWDOWN agrega que le damos

da amante dei survival horror dico che un ottimo gioco Da solo il meglio giocato in 4 con team completo
I really hate that I have to not recommend this game because it ran great and seemed like fun but it's just not something I can see being worth thirty bucks The main reason is because it does not have enough players to justify being a multiplayer-only game It took me about ten minutes to find a match my first try and I didn't even get three other players and only one of them had a microphone The menu design is also extremely confusing I spent at least ten minutes just trying to figure out how to navigate through the menus and what all the sections did and I still don't really understand it It shouldn't be like that I understand that the devs were going for a computer terminal access-type theme but it just doesn't work It made me feel like a baby boomer trying to understand how to use a computer Players shouldn't have difficulty just navigating the game's main menu All in all I think this game would have been worth the purchase if it had more players and if it wasn't so confusing to get into but I refunded it because I'm not going to drop thirty bucks on a game that I'm not even sure I'll still be playing in a month
Amazing game like payday but more intense
12/20 at the moment Good gameplay and visuals but the game at the moment is not worth and above with only 2 rundowns Especially when the levels environnements are repeated through different sublevels From what i heard we will have a lot more rundowns later and then it will justify the current price but for now seems more reasonable key outside steam Having multiple rundowns with multiple environnements underground bunker maybe underground lake underground monster hive or forest etc and each level a different objective will make me change my game rating for sure tldr Definitly keep and eye on this good game but wait a bit more for more content

great game rlly hard solo had to get 3 friends to buy it to play lmao but would reccomend
This game is like a bad relationship The highs are high and the lows are.low I love to hate it and hate to love it You need to have friends like REAL friends if you want to be successful It's like a survival-horror-shooter-puzzle-story-team game I've never been so angry and happy at the same time Thanks GTFO
Jogo muito bom com dificuldade extrema mas o desafio que sempre bom pois se fosse o jogo teria sua personalidade por que o jogo quer mostrar que simples combater monstros desconhecidos ansioso por mais monstros novos e muito mais agora minha analise extremamente positiva a desenvolvedora pelo seu jogo

This game is really good for dedicated friend groups who would like a healthy dose of challenge and hardcore co-op experience There are a lot of funny scary and fulfilling moments to be had with this game
i got in a random lobby with a bunch of people and kept asking where the pack-a-punch and perk machines are

GTFO is a lot of fun with a great gameplay loop It is best played with a full co-op team of 4 players yourself included Finding 3 other players for missions can be somewhat difficult but the GTFO Discord is there to streamline it all and makes it a good community to get into the game with Missions vary in difficulty as you progress through Rundown sections Teamwork makes the dream work Quite literally you work together or you die together Playing with bots or completely soloing is an option in GTFO but to my understanding these options are better suited to players who know the mechanics very well and have worked on their personal skill I would absolutely recommend full team co-op for the best experience
Gameplay loop is too stressful difficult Takes too long to progress and any little mistake sometimes not even your fault sets them off and a whole swarm overwhelms you The Bot literally stood next to one of the infected and it got stuck in the agressive pumping mode I couldn't move and as soon as I tried anything they all went aggressive Scarce resources down to the level of the Resident Evil franchise levels of scarcity difficulty Takes way too much of my computer even with the graphics turned down my whole PC was stuttering chugging hard to keep the framerates but it still failed most of the time It was the first time I had motion sickness from a game that doesn't tilt the camera much after disabling any shake tilt settings I can't explain fully but I hated it so much the entire time I despised playing this and I am not sure why
Absolute misery with bot teammates make sure you have at MINIMUM 3 PEOPLE for this

I'm sure at 100 hours I'll be an amateur at this game
This is a fun game that will have missions that take 30-60 mins depending solely on the skill level of the group at hand It's great with a great online community cool story fun game play A great mix between nail biting stealth followed by red hot and sometimes completely unexpected action Totally worth it on sale or for full price New content always coming out as of review and the dev team is super active 10/10 Would bonk spaghetti man with sledge again

I got this game with the power of friendship
banger
This game is incredible Atmospheric slow methodical this game does it better than any other game I've played The enemies are terrifying the alarm doors send shivers down my spine and all the quiet moments fill me with an intense fear that can and has only been replaced with a genuine sense of confidence as my time inside these missions has continued Teaming up is always a good time whether you're strategizing or running around but its a chilling and difficult experience going in solo Definitely not impossible buta challenge to be sure Enjoy frivolously live cautiously kill rapidly my fellow inmate

Games boring and unnuanced No block dodge or cover mechanics gun play is clunky at best with little variance in equipment to choose from earn or unlock Enemies are generic and lack variance in both appearance and attacks/tactics Levels take hours and there is no save system just one or two checkpoints about 45 minutes to an hour apart Its worth about 5 bucks so if you have a horde of friends to play with and are unemployed there for have time to play this AND its on sale for 5 bucks or less go for it But I genuinely don't recommend it Its quite boring and for the wrong reasons People boast this game is difficult but it really isn't its just boring
O jogo muito bom mas totalmente abandonado pouquissimos jogadores Demora uma eternidade pra achar alguem pra jogar
Good game

excellent game I enjoy it even when playing solo Which is rare for a game intended to be multiplayer The gameplay is fun and easy to grasp a hold of and it's always a scary experience to open a door and see a scout behind the door
Intenso muy interesante para jugarlo tanto solo como con otra gente

This game is a metaphor of 10 Chambers being Warden giving us players prisoners of this lazy project some objectives to accomplish in the facility Complex which represents their entire code base of the game Not surprised that terminals is the main communication device to be used on the mission to communicate with the complex Sadly warden doesn't care to crush some bugs himself Lore in GTFO is almost non-existent because you can't connect some aspects of the story You go far deep into the Umbr cough cough sorry the Complex as a prisoner along side 3 other prisoners because Warden want it I bet that even devs don't know themselves who the faq is Red Queen oh sorry Warden Let's imagine this if there is a facility far down below at least 500m deep you would need to somehow deliver personnel and equipment down using let's say maybe an ELEVATOR Yet you are dropped down using some kind of tripod or whatever Did I mention that you are a prisoner wearing clothes covered in mud like jogging pants shorts and pair of sneakers looking like a damn urban sprinter even though you were in Hydro-Stasis Unit whatever that means going down the facility that crawling with unknown bio shit Take a look at a best object in the game A winner is a faquen TRUCK Yes why would you need a truck in a facility filled with a god damn stairs Only devs know I can go on and on with lore part but I hope you also got the sense of the atmosphere in the game Feel free to leave a comment with your best guess on why truck is in the Complex Gameplay wise it is a standard FPS game with horror like elements that provides you with a variety of different weapon types and buffs that are called artifacts to help you on your rundowns There are 3 types of artifacts with 3rd being rarest to give you buff and a debuff at the same time because they are so powerful Another point to lazy devs using simple geometry shapes to represent an artifact that doesn't make sense in terms of narrative Main and only gameplay mechanic is Rundowns which is divided into different tiers where expeditions take place with deliver bring interact and survive the wave objectives types which get boring quickly The deeper you go through every level of the complex the harder the expeditions get 10 Chambers claim it is a multiplayer/online co-op game bla bla bla yes but no Matchmaking button is there but I don't think it function should be guiding you toward using discord to find people to play with manually You either play as 4 men party with friends or with random people from discord because bots are tedious GTFO is not in early access anymore for quite some time now and sold for 40 EUR but for some magical reason this games feels like it still in early access with game breaking bugs known for long time and not dealt with One of the reason might be that CEO mentioned on Gamescom that 10 Chambers already working on techno-thriller heist shooter which is a good news but on the other hand it could mean current game abandonment Even bot functions are broken such as dropping objective item to setup a sentry and grab objective item back but unable to do same move to pick up sentry Bot not able to open and close doors and so on Animations well when a low tier enemy running at you like naruto should sum it up but Communication between animation and what creature looks like is an important moment when you consider choosing a game with horror atmosphere I know it's a hard balance to achieve but there are so many examples to get inspired by and in combination with possibility of modern tech tools such as UE5 to get the rich and right setting for your game There are a variety of monsters in GTFO but very few are unique just a standard bigger and a one of different kind assumingly per level and how difficult it is I haven't done my homework properly to see through so many fake reviews for that game There are many positive reviews that have a couple of hours on account giving it a thumbs up but saying this game is shit You can simply google everything and compare dates with how many copies were sold against reviews on steam I know it wont be a big news for many that reviews are sold but it's an easy and quick way to make a buck for some I know I have a small amount of hours but I will try to force myself to play for a few hours more to prove maybe I'm wrong Sadly and obviously I didn't get a refund because from the creators of steam top notch policy makers 2h refund window was exceeded So well played devs you created a tutorial and first mission long enough to pass 2h mark I will not cover anything about horror part because you can't be serious with enemy running at you like a damn naruto If you want some real horror try Hunt Showdown

Really worth it

One of the best coop games I've played on PC Requires a lot of coordination among your team if you wish to be successful It also requires a lot of patience You are likely to fail over and over at first until you get the core mechanics down If you want a challenge with some friends this is it
fear
I really enjoy the overall feel of the game I just wish it was something more well known Such as the aliens franchise I usually play 3 players 1 bot The majority of the game is sneaking around and having boring melee kills on the enemy Then when you're forced to be in combat none of the weapons feel all that great They all have balance and quirks because of that The situations where combat is necessary are often easily overwhelming to your team Almost feels like the difficulty is just cheap because you can't hurt the enemy all that effectively but they can slap you The time investment needed to complete a level is far too much with too few checkpoints to allow breaks in gameplay The idiotic loyalists will bash you for not wanting to spend 2-3 hours just to get somewhere in this game There is little reward to playing the game as well Occasionally you'll earn a few cosmetics The story part isn't well told and there is nothing making you want to return It is a good game but could be better than it is
i died lol
Very good need strats and tactical thinking Could be more a bit harder tho Also you need friends to play with
Never have I clenched my asshole this tight in my life Glad I had some mates to help me out otherwise my heart would not handle it
The Game is tearing me apart when i ask myself if i can recommend it or not On the one Hand its stunningly beautiful both Graphics and Gameplay Wise It can be a lot of Fun while looking absolute Banger and still running perfectly fine On the other Hand for me its a questionable Concept in general Its built around being a 4 Man and its incredibly hard to be successful even if you are the required 4 Man Now the Gist of the Game is that its extremely difficult and punishing by default so i would say that in the Nature of the Game lie many Features and Gameplay Mechanics that make it not very attractove to the Majority of Players I think with the Way Developers intend the Game they will never bring a larger Audience to the Game which is fine if they can pull trough with what they have going on right now Even though its incredibly difficult and might never truly take off i still recommend playing it especially with Friends And even if you dont have any Friends the Game atleast has Bot Support that is okay-ish
okl
Monsters glitch sometimes through walls and players Melee hits often doesn't connect Guns hits often doesnt have hit marker Every maps are recycled from one other Half of the loots are useless like glowsticks lock melter Game often breaks when someone join the game Trying to give ammo to others players is really difficult and result often into giving to yourself When doors are destroyed some part of the doors is blocking your vision but not the monsters vision so you cant aim but you get hit thats awesome Monsters hitting through corners and walls 40 is way too much for so poor and unfinished content At 10 my comment would have been positive despite all those problems
I loved the game

Le jeux n'est pas dynamique le feeling avec les armes est nul et c'est encore plus chiant que la vie c'est toujours la chose
Best co-op experience this game's moto says it all Try to get 3 other friends and ya'll gonna suffer together in a good way

so true
SHHHH.sleepers Don't want to wake them
The gameplay is a combination of incredibly tense stealth and frenetic action and it is certainly not for the casual gamer who scares easily It's challenging punishing and unapologetically violent
Overall just a fantastic game

The best game to fuck up with friends
Buy the game if you want to play with friends The atmosphere is great and the game is challenging If you want to play with random players don't buy it You will spend more time in the lobby looking for players than in the game The game is dead
Are you sick of the really good relationship you have with three of your friends Ever wondered what it would be like if you could cancel years of shared love tears and friendship in a single 1-2 hour gaming session You've tried those other friendship ruining games and still been stuck with one of them offering to give you their kidney to save your life a day later Look no further than GTFO From opening your very first door and having someone forget to turn their flashlight off to arguing over who deserves the single charge medkit the most all the way to fighting over who gets to bring the Cum Gun This game will test any friendship to the max Communication trust in skill and ability faith in the one guy brave enough to go hunt the Scout by themselves you'll either come out stronger than ever or you'll have shed some dead weight you didnt know you were carrying till you dropped into Garganta and came face to face with your first sleepy toothy boi 11/10 would yell at my friends for sprinting into a room and bonking all the bad guys again Buy if you hate your friends Buy if you love them

GTFO ist ein gelungenes CO-OP Game es macht durchaus und es sieht sogar Grafisch gut aus Aber warum empfiehlst du das Spiel dann nicht Es ist einfach zu es gibt kaum bis keine aktiven Spieler Solltet Ihr Freunde haben mit denen Ihr das Spiel spielen dann Empfehle ich es euch und nicht das Game zu Kaufen Ihr werdet euren haben und dann ist das Game auch das Geld wert Allerdings habe ich es so erlebt in mein ca 3 Std Spielzeit habe ich ca 60-80 Wartezeit das ich eine Gruppe finde Dann habe ich ein Game mit Bots aufgemacht auch dies kann man machen allerdings muss man den Bots alles per Befehle sagen Wie z.B stellt euer auf oder Sammelt es wieder ein usw Das weitere Problem ist das die Bots nur die ersten Ebenen gut sind Habe es selbst nicht getestet nur aus Videos meine in 3 Std habe ich nur 2 mal das Game mit Spielern starten und 1 mit Bots Bin am das Game aus diesem Grund

this game seems fun will play more
tough game to play but feels very rewarding
Good game Sidenote Why are people complaining about the game's pace or the need for a structured team Don't they do research before buying a game for And the slogan of the game is literally work together or die together
Great to play with friends both creepy and challenging

T.L.D.R Gud game u find and keel togefer Honestly 100/100 game really lives up to the live together die together you talk a lot to your team as you play and u better really like typing like your running lines of code because its a key feature Also the story of the complex is vague AF but if u put it together its VERY good As of now its a game play based game instead of a visual masterpiece as its still in its early stages and becoming part of the discord group is a good idea as multiplayer is still in beta However the future looks bright for this game and the team behind it
Si tienes un grupo este juego es la hostia Te al filo de tu asiento te querer aprenderte oscuras que no te llega a explicar el propio juego solo para intentar mejorar y avanzar Es un juego te tienes que preparar mentalmente que tus primeros intentos van a fallar Puede que mueras en una alarma que os sin o que sin querer hayas alertado a toda una sala de enemigos Si te mola desenfunda tu maza y ponte a romper
Great relaxing Coop vs AI Shooter
joe cool
A horror-shooter mix of Vermintide and Alien Isolation Amazing game Really love the atmosphere of dread when entering a new room The game has procedural generation and makes each run unique The music is so atmospheric spoiler love the way you gasp when a rundown starts spoiler Play this with friends The chaos from playing with 3 others is so much fun I only played one run with randoms from the community discord But I don't have any Steam friends who play this so haven't put that much time into it as solo isn't the most fun experience
Sound design in this game is some of the best I've ever heard in gaming also this game is really good at making you truly immersed in it's cool aesthetic so get a good group of friends and strap in for a punishing but satisfying tactical experience
tentai monnsters gud game
Great with friends and crazy good atmosphere
Fantastic team based shooter great mechanics lots to learn
It's a mixed bag with this game The feeling of Co-operation is great atmosphere is good albeit it wears down pretty quickly after seeing samey looking areas fog fog and more FOG no visual story telling no data pads or codex at all just fetch quests Some guns don't feel powerful which is especially annoying when enemies can live even after their head gets blown off Lot's of backtracking annoying stealth rooms which can take hours to navigate through and even if you have full ammo and health you can go down in seconds It all comes down to RNG No real progression or unlocks so your character will stay weak no matter what which is a shame because would have liked to customise GUNS at least to make them more manageable you don't even start the run with full ammo I guess what I'm trying to say the game doesn't feel rewarding One would think the gameplay is a reward in itself but not in this game Obnoxious enemies snail pacing and when hit hits the fan one can barely rely on low ammo weapons Now I get it It's hardcore and player's supposed to struggle with resources perhaps avoid combat altogether in some rooms but if you have to stealth few rooms and then are forced to run through them because of some obnoxious alarm all the while enemies are shooting chasing you then I think there is some balancing issues Played all the Souls games Monster Hunter and never have I had so so many frustrating experiences than in this piece of software In other games you get at least checkpoints or bite size challenge but not in here Loosing after 40-60 mins with no rewards and progression makes for a bitter experience Especially when we consider enemy placement RNG roulette buggy A.I triggering at random spawning behind NPC companions glitching or doing dumb stuff like shooting instead of using melee alerting the whole room etc ONLY PLAY WITH 4 PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOADS and I MEAN LOADS of PATIENCE Some rooms were designed in a way to synchronise 4-5 stealth kills due to how close enemies can be placed yes it's possible with 4 players to kill even 10 enemies in a row with melee sure some enemies will wake up but it takes a few seconds before they attack so it's not that bad if you have a good team Not recommending it due to repetition tedious stealth areas with no silenced weapons or mods gadgets no progression except cosmetics reliance on 4 players always online requirement some under performing weapons enemy A.I and quite honestly how fast the novelty of the atmosphere wears out

paci sa mi ta narocnost a zavislost od teamu
getting the f out has never been so fun
Had this game wishlisted for a while finally tried it when it went on sale but I just could not get into it The atmosphere is pretty cool performance is decent and I like the premise but the weapons just feel so bad and the enemies are not fun to shoot at it feels like something is very wrong with the hit registration
I love it
learn how to melee you f**king morons
Fun game to play with friends good community on Discord to find groups Different vibe than a lot of other games I've played
11 weapons disabled content no longer available for that reason I don't recommend Instead of keeping the levels weapons from Rundowns they remove them instead Also when it crashes if you hold the key item it disappears for everyone else so they need to restart and if you do restart from checkpoint you can no longer hack or use terminals breaking the game Once we start a match were stuck in a loading screen for eternity or arrive but with all teammates invisible Multiple times we could not drop the objective carrying item How is this not still in early access No silencers for bots which shoot when you use melee on sleepers which wakes up the whole room full RNG makes some matches an instant restart Why is friendly fire enabled for bots
good
El mejor juego que puedes jugar con amigos sobre todo si son ciegos ya que puede sonar una alarma y nesecitar 3 generadores y ninguno de los 3 encuentre nada salvo 1 amigo que a ti te digo amigo te ganaste el cielo de no ser por ti de seguro borro esta mierda y encima me agarro a golpes con los demas 10/10 Perdi a mis amigos

Fun game definitely better now with one of the recent updates fixing friendly AI It's much more fun with a full squad of friends but what can you do Anywho I recommend this it's fun
yes very fun game
Play this on a free weekend because normally it's actually 40 which is too much for a toy
Instead of praying you better look for ammo Instead of hoping for a good ending ready to suffer Always use consumables first on yourself then on others Light is your salvation and your nightmare Always be sure that you will kill on the first try because the second will never become Always be prepared to be killed for a first aid kit Always close the doors it will give you a couple of seconds before hell Always be prepared for things to get worse When hell has begun spare no ammo Always listen and you will hear them If you believe in God forget it because the deeper you go the more meaningless your prayer Don't trust the Overseer
One of the best games ive played

amazing game
While the graphics and gameplay is good for a casual gamer like me its hard to appreciate the difficulty
this game is fucking gr8 m8
If you are looking for a game that will make you want to see if you can fly of a building repaint your room in red or fight with your veins then the perfect game In this game you have to kill people in their sleep rob their house and if they wake up kill all of them It is perfect for me as I pass university and I will need a source of income and this game can teach me how to get it 10/10 wake them up
The most immersive Multiplayer game I've played
Game of unmatched atmosphere and hardcore gameplay The only thing is you NEED other people to play real people people that you know Playing this with randoms is just sad If you have 3 real life friends this will be an awesome experience otherwise just skip it Idk if I would recommend this game or not since I wanted to enjoy it but I just couldn't but I don't think the game is bad at all
No apto para celiacos
Stinky Game Enemy too stronk they tongue me from 50m away and i diez
Amazing game having fun and got myself a birthday present pretty good game with lots of team play
Definitely an ONG moment
This game is REALLY hard definitely one of the best fps/stealth games out there I'm currently playing Rundown 1.0 alt with my friends and the expeditions are really challenging 3 Highly recomended if you wanna experience something different
i love it when the shadow monsters kill you
Hush or they'll eat your butt cheeks
Yeah just Yeah
whee
Overall I love this game and it can be so much fun to play But I am seriously struggling with wanting to play it because of the bugs The main bug that is keeping me from playing this game is the fact that at some point in the run I can no longer interact with items i.e I cannot pick up items deploy items use consumables etc Which sinks my chances of making it through the run and more than anything makes it incredibly frustrating to play My friends and I have also been screwed over multiple times while moving through the checkpoints because the neonate objective is showing up in the hands of one of us while also being on the ground As long as one of the neonates is on the ground whoever was unlucky enough to have it in their hands cannot put theirs down So essentially they just walk around until someone else picks up the second neonate I want to play this game and I want to love it but I am honestly having a hard time coming back to it because of these issues
Fun
Berbat ne oynayan var Nede Yapay zekalar gibi zaten bu paraya da ediyorum gelecek ama haldeler sevmedim Ne yapmam zaten Nerden tutsan

AAAmazing
Pros Awesome cooperative missions with friends Resource scarcity makes every bullet precious and makes scavenging feel rewarding Variety of tools to make everyone feel important Interesting horrific world Cons Stealth can be a bit tedious Level design is confusing No story The map is actually awful There will be spots on the map showing no obstruction and you'll find an impassable wall Biggest con Fog levels Turned my group from happy and joking to pissy and annoyed If the main focal point of your level is your players unable to see rethink your level Seriously skip the fog levels 7/10
Very thrilling It is very very scary by yourself A great game for teamwork with your friends If you like being tensed up and scared because your friend without warning shoots a sleeper which then unleashes the full fury of the brute that was right next to you Then you will LOVE this game
Good game but before that either get 3 friends or kidnap 3 monkeys to play with you it is nigh impossible solo
buenos graficos
Difficult but very fun assuming you have others to play with-this game is extremely difficult maybe impossible to play solo all the way through
Red light green light with monsters 10/10
I'm scared
Oui merci monsieur
Great fun awesome graphics Very team based game
Este juego es el mejor que he jugado de su genero y lo recomiendo totalmente Sus su jugabilidad su modo de juego hacen que este juego sea muy bueno solo lo puede jugar en el fin de semana que lo dejaron gratis dos y cada cierto tiempo tiene descuento pero es un descuento muy bajito mucha gente lo si tuviera por lo menos un 30 o 35 de descuento re bueno para el tremendo juego que es
Es ist eins dieser Spiele welches mit Freunden einfach am geilsten ist Wer auf Extraktion Shooter steht den ist das hier ein MUSS Die ist echt 10 von 10 und einfach ist es auf keinen Fall habe bock auf weitere Runden in der Dunkelheit
if you like scary survival games that you can play with your friends then get this cause you might like this game
Could not progress past the first mission because the game would not recognize a completed mission objective On subsequent playthroughs the AI would no longer stand in the security door circles in order for two separate players to progress This issue has users asking about this for 10 months now This isn't an early access title Progression bugs of this nature are unacceptable
impresionante el mejor survival horror al que puedes jugar
Yuh
This games difficulty and atmosphere are unmatched every decision has an impact on the outcome of your run Every decision has a risk and sometimes there's no reward so you really have to think about whats important to you in that moment and if you can even afford to make that decision but also if it might be valuable to you in the future For example this door isn't important to the main objective but I'm low on ammo and my buddy has low health so maybe that room has what we need to get back on our feet but it's full of sleeping enemies that'll wake up and make us waste even more resources if we screw up Is that worth the risk Making these decisions are what makes every mission feel so unique and new even if you're playing the same mission you just failed moments before Even the decisions you make before you start a mission have a huge impact on a run What weapons and tools do you need for this mission do I want the shotgun for taking down bigger targets or do I want an assault rifle for fighting back a horde Do I want a turret to help slow down and kill a horde of enemies or do I want the bio tracker to give me information about my surroundings without putting myself in danger or using precious resources This game is just as much about making the right decisions as it is being able to land that shot on an enemy that if not taken down correctly could cost you the entire run You will fail A LOT but perfecting your skills and decision making for a run are what makes this game so great You go into a mission with a loadout and halfway through you realize maybe the sniper would be better for this mission than the machine gun or maybe I want C-Foam to slow down the enemies while I do this scan GTFO can be played with 1-4 people and they recently added friendly bots to fill up space for teams that couldn't get a full team of 4 but this game is very challenging and I wouldn't recommend playing it without a full team of 4 The game is balanced around you having 4 people so the enemy count will not change if you have less This is a coop game so even though the game has matchmaking and bots I would not recommend using either as they simply can not give you the same experience as working with your buddies on a plan and will only lead to frustration So in conclusion if you have 3 other friends looking for a game that will seriously challenge you with a immersive atmosphere and plenty of content with much more on the way I think you should seriously check this game out Now if you plan on going in solo I still think the game is good but you will struggle with the immense difficulty of this game I can not recommend this game enough and the devs should be proud of how polished this game is I've only run into one minor visual bug in my almost 80 hours of playtime Also worth mentioning there are zero micro transactions and every update is free
a pouco tempo e considero pacas O jogo perfeito para jogar a noite com mais 3 amigos e se divertir com algo novo e complexas e bem executadas dificuldade alta que exige boa e o jogo perdoa falhas na de planos e seus recursos muito escassos Passa a de jogar algo e diferente da mesmice que quase todos os jogos hoje em dia E o mais importante ao jogar em grupo vai descobrir o idiota algumas de suas amizades ou e repensar algumas de suas escolhas na vida
awesome game super scary
Amazing experience Requires real friends Most immersive experience I've had in a video game save for a couple VR experiences Graphics are stunning and the UI is the coolest thing in the world Gunplay is great Buy it
If you're searching for a truly hard and challenging coop game look no further In GTFO you and your 3 other friends will each pull your own hair out while you're looking at the mission failed screen for the 5th time today The main challenge of GTFO is mastering all the mechanics enemies terminal shortcuts mini-objectives and level layouts all the while trying to conserve ammo and stealth for as long as you can While stealth is optional it is highly valuable to be kept and if you're not skilled enough taking it slow is the way to go Your objectives wary from mission to mission these include collect X items carry item to specific location type in something in a specific terminal stand in moving circles while defending a reactor etc I like to compare GTFO to how people play new WoW raids once they're released You never really beat the raid the first time or the second or maybe not even for a week but with each try you learn something new and the next night you and your guild mates might just make it slightly further GTFO challenges you the same way it is in its core predictable the levels layout is always the same for the same mission this includes keys spawning in the same rooms the types and amount of enemies within certain rooms the alarm levels on security doors the layout of the fog but lockers ammo and health pickups door states and other small pickables might not be at the same place challenging you to adapt GTFO is NOT a horde shooter it is primarily a game of efficiency In GTFO if you decide to break stealth willingly or by accident you will pay a price of ammo and health you might not want to give up Resources are limited and being resourceful is key The missions are structured with difficulty ramping up with rundown progress so every consecutive mission gets harder than the previous one Some missions offer secondary objectives and even overloads a second harder secondary basically which test your planning and playing skill immensely Sometimes you will be in complete darkness other times you will have invisible enemies sometimes you will be inside thick infectious fog that slowly poisons you other times you will have to think quick and be adaptive GTFO will try and surprise you on every step You will die and you will fail but with every try you will get more prepared and closer to finishing it Things that I like All weapons and tools are always unlocked there is no true progression other than skill progression and boosters which you collect and carry between missions these are consumable Combat feels very tightly tuned every tool melee and ranged weapon has its use Runs very well looks very good Very challenging requires good navigational strategic and mechanical skill Things that I don't like No rewards for completing secondary overload or both in the same mission used to be now reward are spread over main objectives only You really really have to have 3 other friends who like this type of game it is not for everyone You have to be willing to accept frequent defeat The missions do not scale with the number of players they are meant to be played with 4 people only There are bots but they can't replace coordinated people especially for harder missions You need 2-3 hours at least per play session if your team is really good this gets halved Not much replayability once you finish a mission even though it is randomized to some extend there is no incentive to replay it other than doing secondary/overload if you're up for the challenge

so far the game is DAMN hard and doesn't hold your hand about it either a solid team of mic'd up chads or chadetts is essential to survival.you can go stealth.or you can go LOUD!.the first option will keep you alive longer when its time to go loud go LOUD drop your turrets set your mines and always shoot first shoot some more shoot again and when everything is dead ask your questions.also be wary of firing lines so you dont block other players bullets and with a solid team everything should be.ok.yeah that's about as good as you'll get.ok.death is a constant and you will become aquainted with her quickly.but have fun non the less.no one else is gonna go down there and clean up that mess
bonk
My children can tell that this game will help you to find the god
Had to return the game entirely due to the unsatisfying gun-play Weapons lack punch and feedback Enemies don't seem to react to getting hit by bullets until the moment they die after which they also no longer react to bullets The closed beta of darktide showed how it's done properly
One of the best co-op games out there It gives of a nice atmosphere has great visuals and is just awesome 10/10 would recommend
I feel like every time I play this I age more in life
The two and a half hours playing this game was dealing with an endless horde because the bots bugged out and refused to get on the bio scan This is the first door you open in the game I retried this mission for two.and a half hours doing everything to get the bots to stand in the bio scan with me They never did.for two.and a half hours I did some digging and found threads of people having the same issue.a year ago The tag line for this game Work together or die together felt true.for two.and a half hours
I was freaking scared even on the tutorial
Fun intense scary I absolutely love the main menu and start up of this game as well as how intense the drop sequence into each level is I have not played solo Definitely seems like it is more enjoyable with a group
A very good game for the price but it could be 100 times better if it had femboys Let me clarify I AM NOT attracted to femboys However it would be amazing if it had femboys to make the experience much better Again 100 NOT attracted to femboys Please add femboys just for research Edit PLEASE ADD FEMBOYS NOT BECAUSE I AM ATTRACTED TO THEM BUT BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO WEAR A SKIRT IN THIS GAME
This game is unreasonably difficult and with almost no checkpoints and long slow sections it doesn't make you want to replay very often in order to actually get good enough to beat it
juego solo le falta mejorar la la conocimiento de mapas posicionamiento de la mira strafe rifles pistolas granadas flashes molotovs posicionamiento retakes y control del spray Fuera de eso es un excelente juego
Very spooky and a nice amount of teamwork is involved
You like the game Try it solo
The easier missions are good fun The medium ones need friends to complete but are still fun The hard ones are impossible without a cheat engine
it a good game
Do you like the same backgrounds over and over Do you like 20 minutes of boring then 5 minutes of mediocre shooting then 20 more minutes of boring etc Do you love getting lost in early 90's RPGs doing the most boring stuff over and over only to find the most unrewarding solution Do you like leaving a game night with friends tired and bored and feel like getting back into microsoft excel rather than playing again Well this is the game for you
Brutally challenging yet highly addictive The best FPS ever
Pague 300 pesos en su momento ahora vale 2 lucas El juego es zzz pero me da valor a la cuenta

OBLIGATORIO jugar con 4 de tus amigos y que tengan las ganas paciencia y en el equipo Los niveles son emocionantes tienes que estar muy pendiente con todos tus amigos para jugar ya que los seres son muy sensibles a la luz y al sonido asi que mucho cuidado cuando caminan e iluminan con sus linternas Es un juego muy brutal donde vas avanzando abriendo puertas con alarmas que provoca la llegada de los enemigos tener siempre las municiones cargadas o ahorrarlas porque es un juego de superviviencia y las municiones son limitadas En serio nada es broma cuiden bien su salud in-game y a disfrutar horas de jugadas Si alguien es nuevo y quiere jugar conmigo pues me agrega como amigo de steam y le damos las partidas

Game krajok for people of krajok
If you are over 25 years old you need to try this game
GTFO has an immersive atmosphere A visceral frighteningly real and up close terrifying experience makes multiplayer almost necessary A decent community keeps GTFO installed on my SSD
Woke up from water sleep got to listen to funny breathing as I plummeted downwards at an alarmingly high velocity did a scan at a security door and after the wall of enemies in front of me broke the door and my turret began my body was torn apart so fast I got to shoot exactly one time 10/10 TL;DR if you don't want to read my small love letter to this masterpiece most gripping experience I've had with a game but you need at least 2 others willing to play on a more genuine note the trailers don't do this game justice its not a generic looter/horde shooter but a masterfully crafted experience its terrifying suspenseful and unlike anything iv'e ever seen every bullet counts every medpack toolkit ammobox is a miracle every time you creep through a room terrified of waking the goofy quiet place monsters your filled with suspense walking on eggshells and it makes those rare horde encounters so much more fun however as bricky said this game is not more fun with friends THIS GAME IS WITH FRIENDS its nearly unplayable with 3 people it took us 6 hrs and multiple tries to beat the first fucking level its a shame that its not more accesable but if you have 2-3 buddies willing to spend 40 each buy it i highly doubt you'll regret it
Hardcore mais pas comme il a pue dans le gtfo est un incontournable des jeux difficile horreur et avec une ambiance excellente et qui se renouvelle et avec les mise a jour il vaut vraiment sont prix et avec une bande de potes vous serrez pas dessus attendez vous quand a des quand le con du groupe a sa lampe torche
DO NEVER TRUST YOUR TEAMMATE when he says lets kill tank mutant by stealthy stabbing him in the back I've wasted 3 tries in total of 6 hours because of this planing idea P.S Don't buy this game If you lack patience or don't have people who can communicate well AND suggest GOOD TACTICAL IDEAS overall sometimes scary but fun Like Alien Isolation but in coop Like Left4Dead but with really good communication opportunities Like Sea of Thieves cause rewards are cosmetics and feeling that you belong to the tribe that you not alone can be useful if you experience mild temporary depression or just struggle to find friend irl
This games sucks ass
very good serious game make me big head must be teamwork 200
schizo underground explorers but the monsters are real
Difficult but awesome fun with a good group mates Some laughs some spooks Worth the money
dobre bo trudne
what A phenomenal game
your friends are the biggest enemy in the entire game yeah lets give prisoners guns and send them down to hell
THIS GAME IS LITTY TITTY
Stealth is really tedious a lot of time is spent with nothing happening might change my mind in the future
don't buy it
Game Good
big boi slaps me for 40
10/10 in every aspect it has set out to do Its essentially a pseudo horror stealth survival shooter The enemies are less spooky and more Eldritch in my opinion though Each map is essentially a maze between you and the primary objective with in which you can do secondary tasks to make navigating the maze easier and more straight forward although these are always swarmed with enemies Gun play is very smooth and not a single weapon choice is down right terrible or beyond better then the rest 2 weapon choices with no restriction on weapon type you can carry 2 LMGs essentially as well as a melee weapon and a gadget from turrets to mine launchers to heartbeat sensors They get you with enemy diversity first few missions i was like why is it the same enemy over and over then they threw a new one at me outa nowhere and it really threw me off and continued to do so character customization for appearance seems limited but not bad Level Design is fantastic and environmental hazards spice things up with having to find or save up gear to more safely navigate the terrain Definitely a challenging game that's best played with friends however the AI for single player or to just fill in a lobby is actually pretty good in most aspects and you can give them commands to place gear and gadgets and retrieve stuff as well among other things my only real nitpick is fall damage is outrageous if there a 5 foot drop and u see a ladder or a ledge take the ladder the fall will cut 25 of your HP 10/10
Not gonna lie I havent played too much of this game so take my review with a massive grain of salt I do really enjoy the game and I would hate to leave a negative review beacuse of how good the game is however there are some issues with it for me First and foremost the main reason I dont play much is beacuse like most other internet creatures I dont have alot of friends to play it with nor do most of my friends have the game Secondly the ingame matchmaking system is very weirdly setup and a bit buggy Ive also encountered numerous hackers who ruin others game experience And yes i would LFG in the discord but it feels very daunting and it feels like if i were to find people to play with they would all be basement dwelling neckbeards who would at any moments chance give you alot of negativity for not knowing what to do especially at my stage where I have had the game since beta but not put much time into it and not fully understand all the mechanics Aside from the multiplayer issues i do feel as if the game is a bit repetitive in what youre doing as in youre just going down into a pit going through killing stuff then going back up and youre done And its more or less the same for every rundown like i said not many hours so take with grain of salt but other than those two things the game is good and has a great base idea
This game will require you to hold your breath in real life
spooky
The best coop-horror game that I've played in the last 5 years Nice sound and game play You really need to play as a team to survive 8/10
This game is fun sometimes but sometimes it is mind-numbingly boring and makes me incredibly angry if only the dev didnt put a black keycard in a room with 30 baby strikers so i have take 30 FUCKING MINUTES to get across the damm room and back or i could get the key to spawn in a different room by restarting the level i just spent a entire hour on fun game sometimes but the later levels are very difficult devs version is difficult is making the game fucking boring as hell
Generic gameplay either go loud or stealthy Difficult shooter game where you just bash some monsters heads with melees by sneaking close to them in a dark environment where in some parts you dont see sh*t due to the fog literally can't see what is 1cm in front of you i you are like a blind person tapping your way out by clicking WASD until you managed to get out from the annoying fog)[/i Now do this in every single level but for one hour everytime People try to label this game as a hardcore game I wouldn't even call this game difficult or challenging it is just frustrating and time consuming as hell to the point where you get easily bored from playing one single level You have to open doors by going from one room to another in a maze-like structure where you get easily lost no mini-map spending one hour to find keys and do basic objectives which equal the interestingness of following a straight line If you fall jump from a ladder that is maybe 2,50m high you lose a lot of health If you die to the attacks of the monsters i](whose accuracy is higher than my moms accuracy of throwing her sandals at me)[/i just repeat the mission many times till you got it somehow 40 or sale price is not really worth for this game nothing really special or horror about it I thought I would sh*t my pants at least since I enjoy horror but the monsters were at best funny looking Spend your money on 6 kebabs if each is than buying this on sale Never been so disappointed with a game as I was with this one
J'ai connu le jeu son BETA voir ALPHA et que dire WHAOU Les devs n'ont rien de gameplay nouvelles saisons du RPG sans dans des serveurs plus performant et une toujours plus quel plaisir
Hit the same enemy with hammers for 30
Oui
This game is borderline trash tons of problems for pretty generic gameplay There is no progression you don't unlock anything Getting relics earns you boosters that are permanently consumed when taken in your loadout There are a handful of tile sets and the map all looks alike easy to get lost in especially with no minimap The navigation map is pretty lackluster as well The voicelines are ultra repetitive and grate quickly A bot with a motion scanner makes the game almost unplayable with how much it keeps spamming lines The stealth in this game are localized to rooms Any noise you make in one room will not affect enemies in rooms you haven't unlocked Everything takes a long time to do feels almost like Metal Gear Survive in that regard You have to hold a key to literally interact or pick up anything So annoying Like I said localized rooms so there's not point in it taking so long you're rarely under duress It just makes the game have this ponderous feeling about it Hacks are the same way It causes noise when you fail at hacking but the room is localized failing doesn't matter if its been cleared Realistically there are no optional enemies It's just more practically to completely clear every room out Idk what they are implying by going around enemies The learning curve in this game is patience vs efficiency If you are infinitely patient you can pretty much clear anything It's more of a matter about breaking down in sheer boredom and making rash decisions That's not a good gameplay imo The enemies are really uninspired and really stupid They fire these super accurate homing projectiles and whip their face at you and some of the enemies you'll see scooting their butts across the floor like dogs with intestinal worms at 20mph It's not scary it's really stupid looking The start to every level is grating where you're going down a pitch black drop punctuated with your character gasping for air It's the game for every level and though a minor gripe its tedious to always sit through I'd rather have a blank loading screen There isn't anything innovative with guns no dodges no tilting for sights no real mechanics besides just crouching behind cover The only gun I can describe as neat is a glue gun called the C-Foam Launcher that lets you weld doors shut and make sticky floors That's as adventurous as they get here The melee weapons seem to basically all be the same with the most minor differences they're unnoticeable in actual play Pickups feel like a grind to look for with almost no gain Lock melters glowsticks high intensity flashlight even medkits pretty much all unnecessary What's left is just ammo and tool ammo which could have been done in a way better way like a L4D box with maybe limited uses after security doors Map scavaging feels tedious and more for padding the game time super unfun and unrewarding you can never become immersed because of how slow it is to loot Really this is by far the biggest issue with the game You can get away with having 20hp for clearing rooms and it's often preferred because you can suffer fall damage without worry letting you move faster It removed the survival aspect of the game entirely Oh and the fall threshold is hilariously stingy You character's legs are made out of Styrofoam The missions are tiring in length Dealing with localized room after localized room makes the game monotonous and often you're there to fetch something hidden somewhere requiring consoles to pin it down without tearing into every nook and cranny for it The character customization in this game is total mega garbage If you play with friends everyone unlocks the same cosmetics at the same time Everyone is identical at level 1 you have no options I don't remember a game besides Halo where where everyone is 100 identical with zero options to change their appearance in a multiplayer game It's beyond lazy Pros The game is hard doesn't hold your hand That's refreshing it assumes you've played a game in your lifetime The console idea is really immersive and neat though it could be much better executed That's pretty much it Everything unmentioned is just middle of the road
All I hear is sleepers Seriously though play this game
yes
A different experience Fresh from the rest and stands out Very enjoyable and challenging Worth playing 4/5 8/10
Here is the thing about GTFO the game is super fun but I find many players in two camps someone who insists the game is task that must be finished and someone who has fun and just wants to see others have fun I highly recommend you have at least one friend to play with playing with bots terrible but there are just times you need more human brains to make things easier It is not an impossible feat lots of people say it is either you will be bad in the beginning a game everyone is bad in the beginning but get used to it have fun and feel good about beating the level Get someone you communicate well with go in blind and figure out what works for you and when starting to get the hang of it remember there is something new to learn This game is a blast I really built a strong friendship playing it because you spend an hour on a level talking through issues laughing at mistakes and calling creatures dumb names Get it go nuts and GTFO
i already bought this game what happen why do i need to buy it again
decent game but expensive
1 20 2 3 4 1 5 6 7
Hard game You'll need friends to play or join the discord But the feeling of this game is amazing
FUN
Its just a blast if you have a few hours to kill with your pals give this a whirl and you wont regret it
Note I have played this game much longer than the time recorded here I enjoyed the game more just after it's release I do not like how later rundowns/levels have overemphasised the exhausting grinding of overly complex/difficult sequences of objectives/enemies that require playing the levels over and over again many times to try and synchronise everything perfectly get lucky This means that the game is now just about obsessing over the exact right way to play if you are going to ever win and having to know everything in advance including the map layout objectives types of enemies where/when enemies spawn weapon deployment locations etc This takes away from the fluidity of the gameplay experience or immersion in the setting It can also lead to unpleasant encounters with other players who obsess over how to play the game and are generally impatient with those who have not played a particular map 10 times before like they have or are just rude about doing everything the right way It would be better if the developers were able to release new levels more frequently by making them somewhat less detailed/long but therefore at the same time less grindy/difficult to complete An even better option would be for the developers to focus on getting a full procedural generation of levels for on demand play This would mean that players would never know what they will face when they drop in including which objectives will need to be completed what the general map layout is or what enemy types are beyond the next door With enough variety in these elements the game would retain a more fresh and exciting experience The developers could then also bring back the mapping tool from the very first trailer which I think symbolises how the game has gone astray because as it is now there really is no place for any roguelike exploration of an unknown environment and hence why the mapping tool has been abandoned altogether One reason the developers say they do not add on demand procedural generation is because they think it will mean people cannot brag about completing a particular mission to their friends as each random mission will be different every time Firstly this seems like a very poor argument not to develop such a feature secondly if the core elements of a level were based upon a particular seed number then these could be shared with others Procedural levels would require players to plan more broadly for a team that is equipped to adapt under a variety of potential circumstances rather than just picking gear based on an exact knowledge of what is going to happen in advance This would also facilitate added game mechanics that can only work when mission elements are unexpected For example a variety of environmental traps/hazards that can be sensed dismantled if players are careful enough or a variety of breaching tools that each take up space/weight but might allow the team to progress through a level more quickly or avoid a room of enemies say through a vent or by forcing open a jammed door These kinds of mechanics make no sense as it is because people always know exactly what to bring since the game is built around only being able to complete missions when you have played them many times which itself is not a very rewarding experience more like exhausting Instead I would like to be forced to improvise and think on my feet in response to unexpected events In summary I think if the developers keep releasing new levels in this grindy format where you need to play a level 10 to 20 times to stand a chance of completing it then the game will never feel fresh again What I want to see is not so much new missions new enemies new objectives new weapons but rather an entirely different experience that has been missing since the early rundowns and which could be brought out to it's fullest through a roguelike procedural level generation system
there are two types of gtfo players people who live and are stealthy or people who ARE TOTALLY BADASS AND DIE A LOT
yipe
this game could be fun but the way it sits it is way to difficult there should be difficulty levels and not just one which seems like nightmare mode all the time me and friends bought played for 3 hours and couldnt even beat the first level died in the very beginning just wasn't fun for us so we all refunded the game
who needs a bio scanner
needs more checkpoints
Super unique deep and rewarding expedition cooperative shooter with a cool atmosphere to boot
games fun yigepe
Great game but only if you are willing to find a group It is aggressively 4 play sundays-are-only-for-GTFO only Like if you like stealth games with a oh shit here comes the horde then peer pressure some friends into playing it Or just join the discord I don't know I ain't your dad
It's super challenging but I'm getting better and you will too
This game is absolutely terrifying even when you have a full team of people it is still very hard as any consumables(I.E ammo health etc meaning that stealth is paramount in this game hince motto of this game Literally played this with a full team of friends thinking that we got this and boom we die at the very end of the extraction Highly recommend that you get this game if you're into intense co-op games and have a couple friends who are also into it
I need that feeler to feel me up ykwim
This game is one of my favorite games ever Trust me this is different GET THE GAME
zombies have butt worts 10/10
In 5 attempts to play with my friends we only got it working 1 time UI it's beaultiful but not intuitive Start the game it's a challenge itself

Kinda Boring
valid
Solid game Great challenge
The game is fucking ass bro don't buy eat ass
heavily enjoy
fun but challenging almost tactical zombie shooter
bored in half an hour
As the title says you either work together or you say goodbye
This game is like if you took a toddler threw it in a dark room and then shot it in the forehead
It's harder than a loveless marriage when you're staying together for the sake of 3 kids that were the spawn of your wife's affair
it's fun
GTFO

Best horror co-op game out
damn
terrible game i never thought ill get so bored looking for GREEN_KEY_812 GO TO GREEN DOOR ALARM TRIPPED DIES TO FRIENDLY FIRE i wish i got a refund I had a good run until a bum wrecked it
No pain no gain If you don't like to lose or don't like to spend your time starting over again and again after failing Do not buy this game This game has more suffering than you can bear
it gud hrd wid postyy
It's a great game ONLY if you have a tight crew with good comms It's brutally difficult but with the right people and gear chosen it's extremely fun If not You're going to die in a few moments Every ing time
I wish i had friends to play this with because its really fun 10/10
Please remove the stand on red circle mechanic it is the one reason why my friends and I don't play
YES
Spooky
This Game Is Real Bullshit Dont Waste Your Money
I played this game Duo only and it was very challenging and fun Extremely time consumeing to figure out what to do which i like alot
If I say the game is ez even though the game is hard people will award my review because it is funny The joke is that I am saying it is an easy game when in reality the game is really hard therefore the comedy comes from the fact that I am claiming the opposite
This is one of my Favourite Games of all times it is really difficult and i write this wiith a singleplayer bots point of view And tbh i think that mostly every level is possible to play it alone And i love trying and trying and trying again until it works I love the idea of playing a level to not complete it but to gather information about the level so you can optimize your equipment for it Always the feeling of not knowing what will happen next makes a perfect atmosphere Yes there are some bad things but if you can accept to try a level again because of a bug which happen often This game is running flawless even without 60 FPS and it looks beautifully realistic Everytime you see something completly new you will get excited but also having alot of thoughts about what will happen next The Sound design feels perfect with some really cool jingles The enemy variaty is really good and it gets more with every update The enviroment is good and it can still show you some rooms where you will be like Wow The difficulty is very high but there also some really easy levels I play with randoms cause mostly everyone is doing their own thing or use strats to break some rules of the game and then i feel like that i do anything Having friends is nice but bots are only a bit worse in my opinion sometimes bots are even better than real players and sometimes it is the other way around I am not the best shooter person which means i really hit their heads but it is still enough to survive and to beat levels so i say that you need a good shooter experience You need to be calm and slow the stealth section of the game is still the biggest and to prepare your defense for an alarm The more you know about how the game works the easier it will be for you to beat difficult challanges And four burst sentries are the key in my opinion depends on some enemys But to say it it is a very solid game and i will love to experience R4 again where everything started I love R1:Alt becasue of their really small levels which is a great alternative and also relaxing But R6 will be my favourite for now cause of the worldbuilding outside the complex and i hope to go back someday
oral cum shot is how we do it in da hood boyz
good game
Its fun until the game hits you with a Gotcha moment as they spawn hordes on you with absolutely no warning after completing an objective
My favorite non-diablo game
if you have friends who like tactical shooters this might be among the best coop games you guys will ever play the community seems active but as a new player your experience can get screwed over pretty quickly as most people do not care enough about somebody elses experience in their team so while you are sneaking around warily of the monsters and try to play it safe and explore the experience somebody experienced in your team will just run ahead and kill everything as they know it all already and have the skills and timing to rush through while you are basically left behind and carried through there are bots and they are useful and not overly stupid but this is clearly meant to be a group experience buy if you have friends its amazing really i'll find out in depth once i have some myself
Best game to suffer
She bited my peepnis yeeeeeOOOOOOOUCH
deep dark fantasy ass DDFA GTFO
i love game soo good to upgred
spooky
challenging good gameplay nice action Perfect for a saturday night with friends
GTFO is a great game for people who enjoy stealth with some fire fights every now and then When playing you have to understand that stealth and quietness are the best option to get you further especially when ammo and other supplies are very limited If you fire your weapon even by accident it can and will be your death due to a horde There will be times like security doors when you have to use your guns and turrets to move forward which is why it's important to conserve your ammo Another and last thing I will say is that it always works best when you and your teammates coordinate what you are doing as well as when you're doing it and stick together Do not run off by yourself nor just attack anything cause you can You will fuck it up for everyone

Gutes COOP-Spiel macht mega die paar Tacken sind es wert
A must play adventure Developers are not supporting any DLCs or micro transactions but they are always updating and bringing new content and fixes Pros Most Rewarding feel in any objective based rundown games Dark Atmosphere that needs to be Tactical Feel with every second you play Live Service updates Cons It's too hard to start if you are playing the game for the first time Result The game is being what intended to be Dark Objective base hardcore rundown game 10/10
gg if u have a group of fwends
I am horrified yet intrigued Game is painfully hard but very rewarding
There are no co-op games like this one
I have never been so spectacularly erect
good game but hard
i]hits an invisible enemy sharp drifting noise[/i
Fun yet stressful all really depends on who you're running it with but overall could use more bonk 8.5 out of 10 good game very fun
Excellent game with friends to coordinate and set up defenses The atmosphere is something that very few games have managed to do properly Guns handle excellently and the enemies are truly terrifying and a real threat You could easily poor hundreds of hours into this game
Buenardo me dio mucho miedo aqui en cuba paso lo mismo hace tiempo
if you turn off the lights while playing this game you will soil yourself
SHHH SLEEPERS
What this game has set out to do they have nailed it completely This game is about teamwork through and through I haven't played it for long but I just love it It's a challenge of a game one that I welcome and can't wait to play more of But I do have one thing that I hate about it the fog Fuck the fog I can't see Sleepers But for real play it with friends cause there is no other way to get the full experience
Fun to play as a group definitely enjoyed the strategy required to have an efficient run
This high intensity and INTENSELY Difficult shooter is best played with a team of four human players however you do not NEED to since the bots have been added The atmosphere and darkness will give you an unparalleled sense of claustrophobia and fear during the stealth sections When the facility goes loud and the alarms start blaring there is no game that gives the sense of hopelessness and determination quite like this game does Seeing dozens of tough as nails zombies flood towards you in the dark cramped halls of the facility all while counting each and every bullet just gets my blood pumping Something that I enjoy that lots of players dislike is the instant access to all the equipment and loadouts in the game There is no real progression in the game besides beating the mission and going onto the next one as well as the collectible single use buffs you can take at the beginning of a mission Similarly to Left 4 Dead with a Pay-and-Play mentality with no unlockables or conventional progression Working together is VITAL to survival and I CANNOT STRESS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS OR A TEAM The fun factor of this game scales TEN FOLD when you have a good group to play with If you have EVER enjoyed Left 4 Dead 1/2 Killing Floor 1/2 Vermintide 1/2 or just enjoy Co-op Shooters THIS IS THE GAME TO PLAY Co-op Fantastic Game Solo Kinda Bad Game
ekelhaftes nuttengame wer das spielt und hat dich
l
Cool tactical shooter DO NOT PLAY WITH BOTS You are better off without them But of course you are best off with some friends that's when the game is most fun but the game doesn't manage to stay fun forever every mission is overall samey but fun for the first 10-20 hours with friends
el juego esta bueno pero no hay gente para jugarlo que si no tienes panas para jugarlo pues ni lo compres
Great game with friends a must try
Only for jackasses I'm a jackass

Let's get this clear first I review this game from a single player point of view The game is probably enjoyable if you've got friends to play it with I 46 have got one dude who I can play Space Marine with occasionally but that's all Sure there's matchmaking in the game but PUGs Let's just say I'm an old enough player to have tried a lot of games with co-op through the past decades and in my experience PUGs are like playing Russian Roulette with 5 bullets in the revolver Anyway I bought this game because I fancied the idea behind it and after some research I found that there are bots to fill up a team even if there's only one player The most common opinion was that they are servicable can not substitute a player entirely but also not useless I found that true and I might even say that the bots are actually better than inexperienced players Yes there were a few fights where I did not see sh*t but the bots pulled my sorry a*s through So if you plan to play this alone it's not entire unfeasible although supposedly the later levels may have objectives which require you to split the party up which the bots can not do There were a few issues not related to single player that annoyed me though Annoyance 1 The flashlights are simply f*cking useless with like 2 meters range and in a good number of situations they actually make you see less There are a long-range flashlight you can find during missions but you either have those in your hand or your weapon In other words either you see what's happening or shoot it to prevent it from happening Umm come to think of it maybe they can be used alongside with pistols Oh well Annoyance 2 The enemies are either fast-af-bois or stay well out of the range of your awesome flashlight and pepper you with tracking projectiles Third option they are bullet-sponges and hit hard if you let them close I assume on later maps you'd get enemies with the combination of these attributes Which I'd like to emphasize would not be something I complain about but combined with Annoyances 1 and the upcoming 3 it was enough to make me mention it Annoyance 3 The alerts I mean WTF is this sh*t I want to nominate them for the Most Immersion Breaking Stuff In A Game award To progress through the levels you have to open doors and some of them triggers an alarm So far it's okay You are even notified which door will bring all hell on you So what I did the first time was based on what I saw in the trailer put sentry guns strategically to cover the door expecting the attack would came through there Well one thing was to be learned here the attacks don't come through that door So at the second such door I place the sentries to cover as many of the other doors as possible I did not expect them to stop the tide alone and they did not to say the least but that's okay we have guns for a reason So far so good mostly But By default the attacks will not stop until the alert is active To stop it you have to stand in random spots all over the room for several seconds all the while you are being attacked from all directions Insert Ryan-Reynolds-asking-"But why meme This is really amongst the most unreasonable things I ever saw in a game Why couldn't it be a terminal a team member must hack and God forbid if spotted before opening the door a defensive perimeter could have been established around No instead you are forced to foresee which door the enemies will come and even if you guessed right you're still not much better off because you have to stand in perfectly exposed places for several seconds And HAHA don't forget the alert at the end of R7B1 it moves around slowly while you get a new type of enemy which flies Geez It did not make any sense before but this was the actual event which pushed me over the edge and made me give the thumbs down Annoyance 4 This is kind of lone player specific Save system Which does not exist in the game okay understandable you get checkpoints instead at certain doors so you don't have to play through the map again from the start Nice idea But take into account that even the first maps can take around two hours to finish playing solo at least and the last checkpoint and the final all-hell-breaks-loose are usually like 15-20 minutes apart sooo yeah You either have the nerves and/or time to play that much again in case you die you will or you'll have to play the whole map the next time you start up the game Sure the second time around you'll spend way less time figuring out the puzzles but still So all in all the maps are too long to not have actual save possibilities but in the end it's understandable and not that big of a deal There it is rambling Once again I can very well understand those who love the game and if I had at least one friend I mean real-life friend to play with then even the mentioned annoyances could be forgiven Maybe even the alerts but honestly f*ck that sh*t
Lo en la stage de la niebla porque no se un zurullo ni El juego buena pinta sencillo y a la par que hardcore pero se han pasado de hardcore si me metes de una hora buscando una caja a ciegas por una niebla densa que el agua normal que me ralle y deje el juego en el olvido Pd los cachirulos antiniebla no son suficientes
To preface this review I fucking love this game ever since I started playing in R3 I fell in love with the art direction the atmosphere the music and the gameplay I found new people that I played with on LFGs that I still play with to this day In a sense this is probably my favourite game of all time However The recent direction being taken by the developers is downright infuriating I cannot understate the lack of communication that exists between the developers and its playerbase I get that you don't want to give away everything to maintain hype and interest in the game when a new rundown drops but the fact that the supposed roadmap is just literally a summary of everything they've done in the past without any indication of what features content or rundowns they're aiming for in the future is honestly pathetic To add insult to injury after 4 months of waiting the developers decide to surprise us with wow here's rundowns 1 that we remade and are so generously allowing players to play which we banned players from playing in the first place This is what prompted me to write this review The lazy attempt at modernising a new rundown pretty much consisted of them recycling every single level from the old rundown adding in stamina adding in new enemies on a single level and then keeping in weapons from existing rundowns and then calling it a day The probably didn't even bother to playtest and make balance changes because if they even bothered to play their own game they would realise how the weapons in the current meta are simply too strong for the gamestate that rundown 1 was in also further nerfing the game by introducing shadows in their current iteration Rundown 1 was not balanced around piercing weapons high damage high mag size and sniper bio synergy It's apparent that GTFO is now moving to its life support phase with the new game in development taking priority The fact that this alternative rundown without any new objectives introduction of enemies in interesting ways without new dialogue new dangers for us to explore in the complex Levels that can be easily cleared first try without any prior knowledge there's probably something inherently wrong with the design of the levels My friend and I cleared all 6 levels in the alternate rundown in the matter of 3 hours GTFO is a game that has lost its way from its original roots The pre-release GTFO could essentially be a completely different game compared to the game that it currently is now Maybe I fell in love with another version of the game and it just sucks to see the devs drive it further and further into the dirt with every decision that they make It is clear that they cannot be trusted with the delivery of a bug free challenging co-op experience any longer Blatantly broken this being introduced into the game like provisions scattergun bio sniper sentry symbiosis r6 sniper make you wonder if there are any bug-hunters or people who playtest and balance the game before they release content at all Thank you for taking your time to read my review I am extremely passionate about the game I wouldn't waste my time flaming a game that I don't give a shit about but its about time the devs woke up I'm praying for the longevity for the game because I love playing it with my team and pubs alike Addendum to the review because I'm apparently not allowed to express my opinion about the game and if I say it's bad I'm throwing a tantrum LMAO grow up please Ah shit here we go again I love how when I raise points and give constructive criticism it's called throwing a tantrum and just because I've played the game for 700 hours I'm not allowed to play it anymore and should just let new players enjoy it and I'm not allowed to make any comments about the game In response to your points I'm allowed to negatively review the game because from my point of view the vision for the game is already dead GTFO is no longer a hardcore game and there's no point pretending that it is To address your points about new player retention I was always a strong advocate of introducing things like tutorials and some form of guided mode maybe not as intrusive as checkpoints but something that would provide newer players with a more pleasant experience because I know that the new player experience for the game prior to R6 was quite frankly awful If I didn't get carried for my first 200 hours of the game I don't think I would've been able to complete any of the rundowns I played at all especially R4 and R5 But here lies the problem in staying true to GTFO's identity as a hardcore game while still being able to retain new players who are interested int GTFO's challenges but not knowing where to start In my opinion the high or compulsory objectives of levels should be relatively easy to clear this will allow newer players to be able to beat the high objectives of levels up until the D tier levels BUT optional objectives are optional and hence they SHOULD BE HARD Levels that are high only inherently cannot have this type of depth to them and considering that the majority of R7 and Alt R1 do not have layered difficulty there's literally no point providing the same vanilla experience to someone who has played 1000 hours vs 10 because their needs and wants when playing the game are completely different The purpose of optional difficulty is to cater for this And no new players should not be able to beat all the levels looking back to R1-R5 there was pretty much only a clear rate of 5 for levels above C tier And now that levels are here to stay it makes even less sense for levels to be dumbed down and simplified because you will eventually get better at the game enough to be able to beat these levels I remember running 20 runs of R4D2 PE and spending over 40 hours on that level before I finally beat it and the feeling that I felt when I beat that level was nothing that any other game could provide me with I can respect that people cannot dedicate that much time to the game and obviously have other things to do outside in their lives but at the core GTFO is no longer a hardcore game It handholds and babysits you even when you're a full grown adult capable of doing whatever you want Secondly my qualm with R1 is not that it is easy to clear it is that there was simply no effort put into it at all for the 4 month intermission between alt R1 and R7 No new objectives optional objectives revamped enemies they even got rid of the lighting in R1 which was so good at building the atmosphere and tension R1 alt in terms of the experience it provides is a clear downgrade to the original excluding quality of life changes and I would highly recommend anyone who hasn't to go play the original instead Brother if you think there are no bugs in the game you are dead wrong there are many gamebreaking bugs that have been in the game since R1 which still haven't been fixed Sniper melee only got fixed because we nagged the devs for over a year to finally fix their shit C-foam door bug only got fixed because Kephri posted a video on it and drew attention to how to actually use it R6 on release was pretty much unplayable because Checkpoints broke every single level It's clear that after they pretty much got rid of all their bug testers they don't playtest their game properly anymore Given you won't really fully notice any of these bugs until you're quite familiar with the mechanics of the game and play pretty close to the limit these are still groundbreaking bugs that have been in the game for years without seeing the light of a patchnote or even worse when they say that they've fixed a bug then you encounter it in the exact next game
It's a Top tier thriller,action,shooting game with lots of suspense if u have friends and wiling to die a thousand times playing rundowns then this is ur game
Babe wake up It's time for your bio scan yes warden

Playing with randoms makes me want to stab myself in the eyes
One of the best games ever very hard tho
one of my top favorite games hands down been playing this since launch very little games get the heart pumping with my mates like this game ffs love it so much and recent update to add old rundowns is refreshing too
Great game all around easily one of my favourites of all time The story is great lore is good and gameplay is amazing smooth Great tactical co-op game Best with 3-4 people but playable with 2 if you are well coordinated

An extremely unique and difficult game VERY high stakes stealth segments and huge adrenaline rush loud segments The game only has 2 objectives scan things and collect things in lockers but its not about that Each level is made in such a unique way where the mechanics of this game are used extremely well A LOT of work goes into making these levels I see game having only 1 real con The levels take waaaay too long to complete if you dont know whats going on It is not uncommon for it to take up to 2 hours Sometimes the levels dont even have a single checkpoint
Wish anyone would play this with me
Great visuals and aesthetic Probably the best thing about the game The gameplay is meh bordering on taking way too fucking long to do missions Add the fact that you need a dedicated group because the game is not made to be played without a full group and you have a good idea ruined by bad execution I hate games that require dedicated groups because its just unrealistic Not all my friends have this game and not all of them want to play at the exact same time This leads to having to have empty slots or playing with randoms Both experiences are not fun The devs insistence on not allowing anything aside from full teams makes it so I can absolutely not recommend this game at all Very few people have dedicated groups who can run missions this long Its about as bad as raiding in an MMO but at least in an MMO you have a lot of content you can do solo or in pairs This is an all or nothing Save your money and play something else I regret buying this game and wasting my money
scary
Hart Schwer Nervend alles in einem Kriegt man nacheinander reingeknallt nichts bleibt aus Wie sieht es wohl hinter der aus Hoffnung oder absolute Verzweiflung man Reichen die Ressourcen Spielen alle im Team Eine Mission kann sich in Stunden ziehen Die ging bei mir von 22:30 bis stolze 4 Uhr Morgens und Trotzdem verkackt Die des Spiels gibt einem immer wieder Motivation die zu Durchbrechen Alleine alle sind Down Monsterwellen kommen Was wird man tun Wegrennen Hat man eine Chance was zu bewirken Die Hoffnung und Verzweiflung sind ein Begleiter in diesem Spiel und das ist end KRASSS

Se siete giocatori che si difeniscono hardcore a cui piaccono le sfide e avete bisogno di un titolo con cui sfidare le vostre insieme a quelle dei vostri amici almeno 3 questo titolo fa per voi Se siete da soli o non riuscite a formare un gruppo di almeno 4 persone non vi piace prendere affrontare con calma e situazioni sconosciute o non vi piace attivare i neuroni per trovare soluzioni semplici ma altrettanto geniali per determinate situazioni allora saltate questo gioco a pari Il gioco di per alterna fasi stealth a fasi decisamente concitate dove non solo facile commettere errori ma ogni risorsa munizioni vita equipaggiamenti scarsa e va conservata e spesa con cura Il sistema a checkpoint permette di evitare di ripetere la parte precedente di gioco ma purtroppo in alcuni casi ancora buggata e bisogna stare molto attenti a non avere oggetti trasportabili in mano o a lasciarli prenderli mentre si sta salvando il checkpoint Una grossissima rottura considerando che il gioco uscito da molto tempo L'ambientazione senza ombra di dubbio la parte venuta meglio di questo gioco vi davvero di essere dei poveri s*****i per nulla preparati e in un posto buio ed estremamente pericoloso dato che combatterete nemici sconosciuti Le mappe purtroppo non seguono uno schema molto logico ma le sfide proposte sono sempre sul pezzo e se non proverete frustrazione per certi espedienti es nebbia infettiva i livelli in cui penserete non andare peggio dopo questa non mi nulla puntualmente verrete sorpresi con sfide apparentemente insormontabili o incredibilmente difficili ma mai impossibili Da questo punto di vista non mi piace particolarmente che alcune volte quasi impossibile passare certi livelli se non si conosce l'espediente del livello in questione mi dispiace ma non voglio fare spoiler con esempi ma d'altra parte fa parte della del gioco Una cosa che apprezzo particolarmente in questo gioco sono i terminali per chi del mestiere avere l'equivalente di una shell in un gioco e farti sentire un hacker semplicemente pingando le risorse presenti nell'area in cui ti trovi non da poco La trama e la lore sono carine ma dato che le rundown i set di missioni cambiano di tanto in tanto alcuni pezzi non sono recuperabili Vi conviene guardare video sulla trama lore se non volete passare a leggere i log dei terminali Complessivamente raccomando questo gioco ma innegabile che abbia ancora alcuni problemi inaccettabili per alcuni e che non sia fatto per tutti ma questo contribuisce ulteriormente di questo titolo
I love this game's gunplay and it seems criminally underrated as the community is small Make sure you have at least one friend if not then the discord which is free to enter has channels full of people ready to play I've not encountered too much toxicity and the community itself is very friendly I'd say it's worth the money
the game's well made I haven't encountered bugs but the NPE is abysmal and no having a solid community which it does doesn't make up for the worst new player experience I've experienced
Fantastic game Great aesthetic and style This game definitely drops you into an immersive experience that is challenging and therefore inherently rewarding when you succeed The visual/audio quality is amazing Very fun loadout possibilities that add to the experience 10/10
This game gives me anxiety 10/10 recommend

i love this game i wish i got to play more than just the demo
yes it's hard yes you will have to make friends to build a full team and yes this game will make you hate them is it worth it definitely high challenge but highly rewarding and satisfying gameplay Still somewhat frustrating after you've restarted a level a literal dozen times to get past a challenge whose only solution is Git Gud the skill barrier is real and if you fear it invest in a different game
Despite the limited character customization all characters are male for some reason
Tense and scary but lots of fun
good game
The game was more fun when it was brutally punishing with kiting than it is now tbh but its still good
amazing game to grind with friends
I've played this game during a free weekend months ago I had some fun definitely would buy if not for the extremely low player count I know it is supposed to be hardcore but it needs to be simplified and newbie-friendly to draw more players Also stealth killing is boring but it's the optimal way to clear rooms that means you either go the boring way or find yourself in trouble later on the mission due to lack of resources
Friend bought this game and crashes left n right despite making different changes according to troubleshooting guides so I returned it too F it
I like this game but my friends don't
highly suggest you play with friends its fun to experience the game with someone who knows the game as much as you do yes you can find people in discord but sometimes you end up with pros the just carry you through out the entires stage rushed and you don't even know what just happened back there with that out of the way ingame match making is still broken guns are fun to use but some of them have unnecessary annoying looking sight this game involves with a lot of planing and decision making and sneaking other than run and guns each rundown present you with different kind of f@kery some people would say this is the challenging game but there is a line between challenging and f@kery if you like get get f@ked yeah give it a try
Worth trying especially if you have friends who are interested in playing just make sure to join the discord for a better experience
garbage
gun go bang
No entiendo a dia de hoy que no haya un matchmaking en el juego,con los avances que tenemos hoy en dia,y que tengas que jugar en grupo por discord esto no quiere decir qeuno lo recomiende pero hasta que no haya un matchmaking no lo pienso tocar con ningun palo
Go down the caves to fight the psychically ill people that are completely white Also don't forget to stay quiet or they will come in massive waves Overall one of the best games I've played very nice recommend getting friends first tho was no easy task
very good
incredibly hard a real challenge highly recommend with friends horrifying pretty graphics me and my buddies uninstalled got so mad couldnt get past first level we are bad L bozos we are funny lol optimization isnt the best highly recommend with friends
good

Get Three Friends
Extremely difficult game almost impossible to play alone once you get a few expeditions in even if you're good at the game Nonetheless extremely fun and definitely one of my favourites even if it is often hard to find friends to play it with
This game is really fun with friends not so sure alone but the strategy and difficulty are both so well done
I'm sure it's a fun game literally couldn't use the menu play the game without the UI HUD giving me massive nausea
i have never seen hackett's face but i know he's hot thank u to my very patient friends who set up the lobby so my dumb ass can play as my boy every time 3 good game btw super difficult but incredibly rewarding wish i could play it all the time but you REALLY do need friends and a lot of time set aside to play it if you and your mates are looking for a game to kick your asses this is perfect for you lmao
The difficulty scaling feels unfair with how the game is designed
Probably not this game has a really good premise and i think thematically its very cool but the levels are so hard and take so long to do that without setting aside 4h for a single run of some levels i feel completely useless and unable to really do anything
amazing game such a shame its fucking unplayable 90 of the time
Brutal painful and unforgiving GTFO is a game that requires you to be smart and resourceful If you're looking for a run and gun go somewhere else this isn't for you
this is super difficult with one person highly recommend a squad
Game is fun in a not so fun way
Get the fuck out Get the fuck out Get the fuck out Get the fuck out Get the fuck out Get the fuck out Get the fuck out Get the fuck out Get the fuck out Get the fuck out Get the fuck out Get the fuck out
A Great multiplayer co-op game requiring high levels of teamwork to survive Incredibly rewarding when you finally achieve victory
Hammer Game Der Anfang ist schwierig aber zu schaffen Die ist Angst und Sehr stimmig diesen Shooter Auch wenn man keine volles Team hat sind die Bots gut genug um die Gruppe zu Gegner sind machbar aber nicht ohne Wer auf eine Herausforderung steht der ist hier richtig
Teamwork is key in this game One of the best FPS games out there It sweeps away anything else in comparison This is not a solo-ing game as it requires you to cooperate plan strategies and not just go ahead with brainless killing You could of course do that but you soon will run out of ammo and health thus just worsening your experience with the game dynamics The tempo of the game is determined by the team's maturity in working together The voice system within the game is really good as well My team is normally using Discord to communicate We also use the team leader's Discord stream to watch his terminal screen while they're typing and helping out with entering the commands passwords and queries
good survival horror fun with friends
Love the chaos
Thank the Devs For Bots

Work Together or Die Together I've never seen a phrase sound so well related to a game This is not a co-op game for those who have heart problems or for those who think they will get in and kill everything that moves without being hit if you think like that then i recommend you to close the GTFO page on Steam and go look for something different I love the stress that the game provides the difficulty of having to save ammo the need to define a strategy to eliminate the waves that are to come the environment is so immersive that you can pee in your panties without realizing it As already mentioned in some posts I advise you to play with friends 5 Stars
its bloody good
As a solo player the game is impossible Can't sprint to cancel reloads so if you try to squeeze a crucial reload in thinking you have the time you are stuck there until it's done You can't sprint while carrying things in your hand Checkpoint system is literal dog water Fight through 2 zones and then carry this thing that cripples your legs all the way back to the start while having enemies spawn on top of you without dying OR die and have to do the last 2 zones painfully slow again just to get another shot escape sequence at the end Sadly the game plays so slowly that by the time you realize how terrible the checkpoint system REALLY gets and how shit the game is at treating solo players it's too late to refund the game What a joke
good in general and better with online players
No achievements No progression to speak of There is little reason to play GTFO when so many other games deliver more MEANING to the gameplay
Le jeu est difficile mais pas de la bonne Les zones de de portes sont assez chiantes au final Le fait de devoir courir droite gauche et d'attendre dans le vide n'apporte rien Les points de respawn en cas de sont assez peu 1 par salle serait sympa car juste retraverser des salles en rushant car t'es mort 3 salles plus loin n'est pas du bon gameplay L'aimbot de la part des mobs aussi il y'a pas ils te touchent c'est tout Sinon le fait d'exploiter les terminaux de commandes peut assez fun mon les 2 missions est que le jeu est plus frustrant qu'autre chose
spooky
hen hao game
This game is fantastic after this few games it kinda loses the scary aspect Now its just a really cool stealth sorta shooter Wish the matchmaking was a bit faster or stabler Still a great time especially if you have a group of friends to play with Completely worth it
Removing all the cool mechanics and replacing them with call of duty just ruined the game
I know I don't have much time in GTFO so please take my opinions here with a grain of salt I'm probably going to hop back in once I've gotten through some of my backlog A very good game that I'd recommend if you have a consistent group of friends that want to play together with and a game that provides a great sort of suspense I rarely see in shooters The levels Rundowns contain several maps which are all time limited Luckily there's re-created versions of the old maps coming and they're going to be according to the devs different with a different story etcetera I wouldn't recommend it if you don't have or want that though I've found that by playing with randoms really removes that level of suspense GTFO only feels like a horror game if you want it to be a horror game When your squad goes in like they're playing Call of Duty it's hard to keep up the atmosphere Matchmaking if I recall correctly was quite bad The vast vast majority of players use the Discord server so if you don't want to use that you're out of luck Ammo seems more abundant than you would expect from the game I don't think I've ever run out of ammo I started on Rundown 6 The actual combat feels very good The guns have this weight to them I struggle to describe that really makes it feel like every shot counts and the stealthier phases really ramp up the tension as you sneak past enemies that seem to be close to waking any second and coordinate to take out groups at the same time so nobody can raise hell TL:DR Good game needs friends or Discord Doesn't really feel like horror unless you want it to be horror
10 10
Super hardcore game You need to have good coordination with your team to finish the game

One of the best co-op games you can play with 3 other friends period The challenge is exceptional but fair and encourages teamwork more than any other co-op game I've played so far GTFO easily sits within my top 10 games of all times and can't recommend it enough especially now that they announced they're not only bringing back all the previous rundowns for those who missed them but they're also being revamped with features introduced into later rundowns I'm assuming these will be things like enemy types and secondary objectives as those were not added until later on It's sad we've only got a few more rundowns left before they switch focus to their new heist game but that won't stop me from enjoying this absolute gem for years to come
HP100
me no like
Highly recommended game I've played many hours on 2 accounts seen and still played since rundown one The community discord always has games running even if you don't have like a core group to play with you can always LFG on the discord and get a game running fast New people are exceptionally well welcomed there are always experienced players willing to help new bro's get up to speed The strategies and tactics of both combat and mission success are well placed and well built I've enjoyed this game so much I've even bought it for multiple friends whom I still regularly play with Since i've stuck with this game for so long i've watched the graphics environment and combat evolve
is good
It's very close to a yes but finally lands on a no The game looks good the gunplay is fun the atmosphere is great and the basic gameplay loop is fine However even with the rundown system or perhaps because of it it gets quite repetitive Maps are very similar though they add new biomes with each rundown which is very nice It's a difficult game which is fine but some of the obstacles are just not very fun Fog and darkness can be oppressive and simply make it frustrating rather than challenging especially since you don't always get the tools to combat them
I wanted to see scary monsters chasing me but I didn't only saw monsters that would like to penetrate me Did not satisfy the horror feel made me horny instead

Its not a game its a experience
Best co-operative game ever made
Veterans told me you start to feel the improvement starting from 100 hours recommended
k
I recommend this with heavy asterisks next to it Do you like spooky shit if no just walk this is full of tense atmosphere and gross monsters Do you enjoy challenge If the answer is no don't bother You can do a run you've done a dozen times and end up dead if something gets weird Do you have a lot of free time Even with a communicative team where maybe even someone knows the run you're gonna need to take your time to a degree this a well thought out and paced game Do you have a core group This game thrives with teamwork If you don't have a core group are you okay with using a third party app to get a group There is matchmaking it is not very good most people use the official discord to group up If you did not says yes to pretty much all of those just don't bother its not a bad game in any way but is not an easily accessible game I'm old with a family and I don't have time to wait 30 minutes to get a group going to spend two hours in it to lose and need to start the cycle all over again
It's a very nice game It never gets bored
This game makes me want to kill myself Very fun game to play with your friends
good game very hard
Funny game except when you move your toe one mm and the entire station is on you
Very scary game for Halloween HumblePig25 would approve
very hard but very cool they should add sex
this game has a naughty word in it but thankfully its abbreviated or else my mom would get mad at me
An sich ein echt sehr cooles Spiel hat echt sehr und coole Coop Aspekte und man muss halt echt hart mit seinen MItspielern zusammen arbeiten Wenn da nicht diese spielbrechenden Bugs das man z.B dauerhaft keine mehr kann weil man anscheinend einen schweren Storygegenstand mit sich schleppt oder sogar seine Waffen nicht wechseln kann weil man ein Item nicht ablegen kann Man kann praktischerweise auch nicht seinen Spielstand laden da wenn man zur Lobby geht der GESAMTE Spielstand des Levels wieder reseted wird und man wieder ganz von vorne Starten muss Sterben hilft auch nicht da man einfach wieder mit dem Bug respawnt Echt schade denn das hat jetzt den Spieldrang bei uns da man wegen sowas nur zu 3 ist und nichtmehr weiterkommt Achja und die Bugs sind aufgetaucht eigentlich nur wenn man im 1 Run stirbt ein 40 Euro Spiel das schon seit einer Weile als Full Release drausen ist erwarte ich schon das sowas nicht vorkommt aber anscheinend nicht GTFO wird die Zeit definitiv nicht angefasst bzw refundet
i've found that it is only fun for me when i play with a full group otherwise it's just too difficult
Amazing game amazing atmosphere Great concept with the terminals and how the story is told through the environment 10/10 Coop Horror Shooter
Turtle Rock Studios helped define the cooperative squad-based genre with Left 4 Dead and its recently released spiritual successor Back 4 Blood 10 Chamber Collective a small group of ex-Payday developers was undoubtedly inspired by the acclaimed zombie-slaying franchise In truth the debut project GTFO is Payday meets Left 4 Dead but with a deliciously dangerous learning curve satisfying mix of tactical action and all-encompassing uneasiness will likely appeal to FPS fanatics yearning for an electrifying challenge And now that its two-year Early Access period has ended 10 Chamber survival horror shooter might reach a wider audience So how does the full version of the game hold up Despite a repetitive loop GTFO smartly differentiates itself from its predecessors while still being an approachable thrill ride My four-player crew is held captive by an entity called who forces us into an underground facility known as to retrieve miscellaneous items that help uncover the truth behind a devastating virus consuming the Earth immediately apparent that best quality is its oppressive tone Rundown 6.0 the latest series of available expeditions is an all-out assault on the senses From the claustrophobic plummet at the start of each mission to The discombobulating layout of laboratories and dig sites every component of gameplay is inundated with high-stakes tension Early expeditions listed in increasing difficulty by the lettered tiers A-D offer vague tutorial details locate the objective proceed to the specified zone survive an alarm-raising door scan These tutorials become virtually nonexistent as I press deeper into The Complex Fleshy grotesque humanoids sensitive to light and sound sleep in the darkness Any sudden movements or flashlight misclicks can lead to doomsday scenarios I appreciate these severe constraints Clear communication and kit experimentation feels more gratifying this way especially when extraction becomes harder on higher rundown levels

necesitas gente para jugarlo el online ta medio rotaso bots completamente inutiles los bichos necesitan 20 tiros en la cabeza y en el cuerpo para morir,a lo que voy con esto es que le explotas la cabeza y siguen vivos sumado a que te dan entre 3 a 6 cargadores completos dependiendo del arma no podes pasar el segundo nivel porque los bots se quedan quietos sumado a que se quedan sin balas en el primer asalto de puerta un desperdicio de plata y tiempo si no tenes 10 amigos que se lo compren en temas de rendimiento bastante copado bien optimizado cuando salio en el 2018 era una bosta que te tiraban en el medio de una colmena a matar bichos,todo a oscuras y sin mapa ahora es lo mismo pero mas estetico con un poco de contexto y luz antes te morias simplemente por el echo de quedarte sin balas o bugs que no abrian las puertas ahora solucionaron el tema de las puertas pero sigue siendo la misma cagada 2mil magos el juego mas otros mil de interes al pedo
solid if you've got friends
yeah
sus
Great multiplayer game

6/10 The gunplay is satisying the environment is very atmospheric and pretty It's a really good co-op game But the gameplay is way too slow for my taste clearing a level/map effectively takes a lot of time and preparation Often times in a span of 1 hour that it takes to clear a level 40 minutes of that time is spent talking and planning and the other 20 is actually playing the game Sometimes I fell asleep before I even shoot a single bullet It's more of a worker placement boardgame than a shooter Don't buy it if you're solo it's meant to be played with a coordinated friend group Just like a boardgame
Muito bom mas muito 36h e terminei a B1 Jogando sozinho claro
gowno
Game is dead/dying you should only buy this is u have 4 other friends to play it with Hope to see this game get popular again
great horror game but id wait for price drop of some sort or use eneba.com for a discount
not balls
It's great
Incrediby immersive atmospheric and daunting truly a great game with friends

Left 4 Dead
game is cracked
game has so many issues cannot start matches when doing coop just an endless loop to drop in but once you break up the coop it starts items that you have to interact with to progress the mission wont be there got thru a whole stage only to find out at the very last room the item i needed to interact with to progress the mission was not there waisting everything i did and you have to restart the level all over again when shooting for whatever reason the game wont let you zoom in or reload you have to switch guns to fix the glitch not a huge deal just another issue
Ok the main problems of the game are as follows 1 Players can get stuck and not be able to get free Meaning you either have to end the run with all 4 people Or replace the one person 2 WHY THE EVER LIVING HELL ARE THERE SO MANY BUGS In E1 my team have lost 50 times in hour long runs because of bugs Terminals not telling us the right log name enemies spawning where they shouldn't be enemies getting stuck and getting free two waves later Not to mention a bug they did fix Sniper-Melee was originally made by a mod developer Which the mod team from what I know took the contents of the mod and put it in then game without giving credit to the modder 3 More bugs But this time host related IF the host looses connection it does a host migration but theres a chance for it to break the entire game People not able to see enemies move Enemies that are simply invisible rooms that are supposed to have enemies no longer do doors disappear people cant pick up sentries or use the interact key at all Not to mention The host migration doesn't even leave you where the team left off There's a chance that it puts you back at the beginning of the level Which after an hour can be quite frustrating since it's not even in your control And if you are host enemy animations sometimes fucking break In conclusion the devs need to fix their goddamn game Ive been playing since rundown 1 and they have fixed a lot but for everything they do fix another 87 problems come with it And it takes them literally 6 months to send out a patch that often breaks more than it fixes It is baffling that this game is in 1.0 Fun game if it worked properly Buy at your own risk
I hate teamwork
good
10/10

EXTREMELLY punishing game Nothing goes according to plan Shit hits the fan in 0.1 seconds You get stuck on 1 level for 3 days bc your dumbass teammates dont know how to STEALTH Very good game
en su y mas que vivir en ARGENTINA historia profunda literalmente y muy bueno para cagarse con amigos
A game that puts you into a mode of constant stress always making you aware that if you mess up once then that is your run over The eerie atmosphere easily adds to the thematics and your overall enjoyment of the experience that is GTFO
No
Be me Have 3 other friends to play Go into c1 Standard monsters no problem Come to checkpoint with lots of waves Not going good Suddenly vore monstor runs from the dark and vores me OH SHIT.png Get downed because not enough health The rest of the team gets snoo snooed to death by giant man Loses the run 2 hours in I hate vore monsters got vored/10 would not recommend
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH WHY BIG GUY TENTACLES
I like to run into the rooms and wake up all the enemies and leave the problem with them while I run away
Everynow and then there comes a time when playing a game and you ask yourself I having the mere fact that you asked that question also provides the answer And I have asked myself that question several times while playing this game Everynow and then there are times where I can say but out of the 1 1.5 hours each round takes I can only answer yes to about 10 15 minutes of the round So why is this game not really fun Well I have seen a lot of people say this game is difficult say it is very hard and why many find it fun but this game really difficult at least the hard parts the unfun parts but they are the 10-15 minutes of fun in each round really this game is tedious This is because the majority of each round fighting off waves of enemies making your way through this dark foreboding underground labyrinth trying to stay coordinated amid the chaos of battle but is instead spent crouched in a dark room with 3 other people slowly making your way from room to room and silently meleing each enemy to death in 1 hit When I say that most of the time is spent doing that I mean most of the time The game even have anything to spice it up either beyond some toxic fog that gets added and an enemy that has tendrils spread across the room Honestly the sneaking mechanics and gameplay is perhaps the most neglected and least fun part of the game even though it makes up 85 of every round you play That is why this game really fun as the thought of going through that part of the gameplay is enough to make me cringe at the though of playing this game for another round Its a shame too because there are moments of great fun but they are moments small parts of the overall game When you have to spend an hour of tedious grindy boring gameplay to get to a few minutes of actual fun that good And it's a shame too because the gunplay is amazing WHEN you get to use the guns because there is so little ammo you rarely get to use your guns the atmosphere fantastic and the audio beautiful Do yourself a favor and skip this game Wait until the devs release some fun sneaking mechanics or features for you to play with if they ever do it the devs of this game are notoriously terrible with their PR and handling of development
meep
Wasted purchase if you don't have 3 more people playing Gameplay is fine but in 10 hours I don't think there's much in the way of progression Kind of how L4D will switch up Tank spawns and stuff the runs differ a bit but overall it's the same maps same monsters same objectives
After playing more time I'd rather change the opinion to negative to attrackt the attention of developers Dont get it wrong the game is extremely well tailored the setting the atmosphere wepoans core mechanics everything is made extremely well But the game balance is an issue that spoils the experience Lack of resources and often overvelming amount of enemies during onslaught waves well this game can be fun its just too hard in difficulty right now Even changing too parameters like more resources/less enemies health will make the game more about enjoying killing enemies than crouching for melee and dying alot on alarm events Initial review Extremely atmospheric but also punishing game Overal we had a very good time playing it so far I would like to mention several things that could be fixed to improve the game experience 1 some weapons are unplayable due to lack of ammo capacity this corresponds primarily to shotguns Basically damage is secondary to the amount of ammo during the match so adding shotgun ammo x2 would make shotguns a reasonable weapon For now it seems like smgs and revolvers are top tier option 2 monster projectiles have a noticeable tracking and also flying throu obstacles This is extremely annoying Taking into account that any wave is deadly enough making ranged attacks less punishing will not spoil the experience these are major problems In general the game is a very good team oriented survival shooter Definitely recommend if you have 4 friends ready to launch it
Is this game good Yes Do I like playing with incompetent friends that get me killed Hell no
sehr cooles Spiel du machst die Stages mit nem Dulli Squad Rennen die Idioten einfach in nen Raum voller Monster mit TASCHENLAMPE rein Ich kotzen
If you only have a duo then but get Better Bots Mod trust me or its pretty impossible If you do have 3 friends to play with make sure you are ready for a real challenge Game is good but so hard and long its really hard to recommend to casual players BUT If you want something super immersive and do have at least 2 others its a really really cool unique game
no need to give me the spookies man
If you can find 3 more friends to play it with you have a perfect on and off game coop if you need to use discord you can get bad players that rush everything and dont coordinate one bit the game in and of itself is awesome but the teammates are a hit or miss
Ummm ye I like to play the victim Later gets f*kn hard but still fun 10/10 being raped by strange blind creatures
Y-ees?Ye-ees?YES?YEEESS?!YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
the game shines when you play it with friends
good
The gun play is fun the atmosphere is dark and the gameplay is both dishonored and payday 2 Great selection
this game very gud would recommend also fly plane like Bruce lee
great game for playing with friends
Required real friends not shitty Lol/Valorant players
Security Doors destroy the game for me The game was very easy until the security doors I felt like they are impossible When watching guides people tell you don't shoot them too quickly or they respawn faster How is that not emersive breaking If I would still be able to refund I would have just said its not for me but o well that difficulty spike is really ugly

Excuse me
my average GTFO experience Please be ammo or fog clearer s OPENS BOX WTF GLOWIE STICKS
This game is amazing albeit with some major flaws The matchmaking hardly ever works and your forced to use the discord way of copying lobby link and joining there isn't a story from what i could tell you do a level the the background guys talking to you then at the end there is no explanation for what you just did so in the end its a waste of time.The game play is the major draw here to begin with its very fun/scary great with friends awful with bots the lack of ammo it a fun concept since most big guy require a full team to heavy attack down,i feel like there needs to be a bestiary or Monster log so the more you kill them the more you learn there weaknesses.Hate the charging scout type thing if your going to pick this game up make sure you have 3 friends that are going to play it with you too the discord can get a little toxic all in all iv enjoyed my time so far and ill continue to play it till i complete it
game breaking bugs
No me gustaba este juego porque mucho del matchmaking consistia puramente en gente speedruneando los niveles y usando glitches y exploits para pasarlo por enesima vez pero con el matchmaking integrado los bots y las nuevas interacciones sinceramente me alegra decir que se puso muy bueno otra vez
pretty cool
not bad Quiet We got sleepers They'll call their friends and then we'll be in deep shit

GTFO Get Three Friends Get The F**king OFF
The game is enjoyable as a difficult co-op shooting experience where every single bullet counts every hitpoint important Hearing the pounding on the door and the gunfire of sentries while you watch the security scan slowly move around the room creates such a great intensive atmosphere that few other FPS can To me this was a dark souls fps experience with my friends were we would attempt a mission fail try again and again and again learning from our mistakes and composing our OWN strategy When you finally complete a mission after many tries it feels like an accomplishment Sadly this can only be really experienced with friends since you learn the game together Mistakes are bound to happen but everyone can learn from them and you progress as a group however this is only the case when you play with a consistent group The game has matchmaking but you are matched with strangers of different levels of experience in the game which can lead to frustration from all parties The enjoyability of the game makes or breaks depending on the players you play with and for me the game broke when I did not have a consistent group to progress through the game with There was always one missing and the session would never happen This was due the lenght of a mission in the game It would require to dedicate multiple hours just for run of a mission which makes it difficult to arrange a session which was convenient for everyone Due to the length of missions the game requires patience as checkpoints exist but are sparse and one hasty move could lead to all progress lost while I do not think of as a downside it is to be taken into consideration when looking to play the game I enjoy the game but I cannot recommend it unless you have a group that you know are up to play and are willing to dedicate time to play
pasta monster fun
GTFO is an initially enticing but ultimately superficial game which encourages a slow cautious exploratory playstyle but does little to reward or incentivize it It seems like an honest and genuine effort to make something that is approachable while also being hardcore enough for gamers who don't want to be treated like idiots They seem to have meant well and have had a clear idea in mind I'm especially glad they tried to make a cooperative game in an era where PVP still seems to be the big ticket Relatively short sessions that don't require too much involvement but punish players for being mindless or not working together I think that the game may have needed a little more time on the drawing board though Unfortunately where the game prides itself as being complicated it ends up being more simply tedious with sort of arbitrary padding and repetitive objectives requiring similar slightly fiddly interactions making up the bulk of play time THe use of command line terminals in games as a means of interacting with the world is interesting as a diegetic interaction but it feels overused here Most levels consist of some variation of 1 Pick up large item that prevents one player from firing or interacting 2 Proceed to terminal for instructions on what to do with item 3 Terminal out of range of objective Proceed to area XX for terminal 4 Zone XX inaccessible Proceed to zone XY for terminal to find keycard 5 Keycard out of range Proceed to zone XZ 6 Find terminal in XZ 7 Locate keycard and bring it back to the first important door Find terminal 8 Terminal inaccessible Proceed to zone YX to find keycard Rinse repeat I don't know that it's overall a bad idea per se but to me it feels like command line terminals in video games are to tension as jumpscares are to horror They feel artificial and they are frustrating for the wrong reason Everything feels arbitrarily tedious and there is not a lot of narrative reward in return for this tedium The game isn't really a thinking game either as so many describe it The solution to every problem I've encountered in four hours is crouch with your light off don't move when enemies are glowing or making noise use charged melee weapons to quickly eliminate them if you have to and save your ammo and sentry turrets for alarmed doors I will try again during the next rundown and may revise this if the levels are more interesting But right now most of the fun seems like it's meant to come from social interactions facilitated by the game rather than the game itself
my only complaint is not being able to see in dark areas even the slightest amount game has a great atmosphere and controls making it easy to pick up after you find friends to play with
Elmo2020 has a crush on WhiteHood
What is even happening
scary,hard and fun as hell
very very hard
mid
Muy buen juego extremandamente dificil y necesitas trabajar en equipo
Since the release of this game this game has gotten better and better I give props to the dev team for making it easier but still equally as hard of a strategic and patience game
game is great checkpoints really fucks with the friend group though causes month long breaks though if u get a dedicated group its fun to push through and the rush of relief you get when you complete a mission is on par with like some of the most enjoyable experiences i've ever had in gaming
I MEAN THE NAME IS THE GAME VERY SIMPLE The game in general is pretty nice and very hard
I would have loved to give this game a good review but there is this one bug known for months but still there that makes the game unplayable unless you have godlike skills and win in first try all the time when you die after a checkpoint in a mission involving carrying objects there is 90 chance that you will respawn with said object in hands without the possibility to drop it making the checkpoint unusable as long as this critical bug is not fixed I can't recommand this game
Jeu bien mais le bug de sauvegarde se produit et ruine de jeu Un PATCH svp

Jogo dificil da mulestia
My god this is horrifying however nothing is more satisfying that beating a new mission
10/10
Gotta have a crew to play with but other than that it's really fun to coordinate strats and go through rooms
Top gutes sounddesign ein als Team Erlebniss gut sichtbare und die grottenschlechteste die ich jemals mit meinen durchaus nicht die creme de la creme Augen ansehen durfte Muss jeder selber wissen
The only bad part is having a hard time playing with others during off hours and even more so if you don't use the discord which is mainly because lack of players Kind of sad to see since this game is so fun so buy it and join the other players of the community for a nicely balanced difficult PvE experience where you can enjoy the company of badass bots or randoms from Discord And surprisingly meeting random people in game is actually fun too most of them are fans so they don't troll people just want this game to do well
It's really fun but having to use a third-party app like discord to play multiplayer made me give up on it
quest item bug at checkpoint where you can't drop quest item is game breaking
pretty good
Fun GAmE butt it hard need 3-4 plagers to do a mission aND nOt LOse TO BIg GuyS and FLyinG eYes But it g o o g gam
FUCK NO
THERE COMING UP THE STAIRS RUN MF
Jugue 1.5 horas por el hecho de que 1 mis amigos son todos unos casuales asquerosos que se la pasan o jugando fortnite o lol que ya de por si es malo y 2 porque me tocaron con puros brazucas y yo con los brazucas no me meto exceptuando mi amigo lucas que dice ser brasilero pero tiene mas ascento argentino que portugues Dejando de lado esto es un must have en tu biblioteca si sos sadomasoquista te gusta que te garchen te gustan los juegos hardcore tirando para sistematicamente imposible y te gusta la cooperacion Recomendadisimo
Average Graphics Highly Teamplay requires to survive Long Chapters(Maybe too long Good Thrill CO-OP Squad Action in Combat Awful matchmaking system Too Dark and Too Foggy/Misty maps(It is like a cover for the average graphics Weak mechanics not intense Seems not sturdy Note Bring some friends to play hard to find a proper teammates
Cool game if you have friends to play with and enough time Levels get a bit repetitive with rooms blatantly copied and pasted but if your in it purely for game play then it should not be a problem
Un super jeu coop dommage il n'y a plus personne avec qui jouer jeu
Brilliant Absolutely gorgeous
GOOD
Very cool atmosphere and challenging game play will have you coming back to this game time and time again Active devs have shown dedication to developing new and interesting game mechanics as well as continued quality of life improvements Outstanding experience when played with irl friends
Needs to be more scary and then I'll call it a masterpiece
No importa cuantas horas inviertas en este juego en cualquier momento los enemigos te van a dar por el culo de la manera mas humillante tonta o grotescamente posible Aun asi juegazo muy dificil para tacticas y comunicacion en equipo OBLIGATORIAMENTE jugarlo con amigos literal es casi imposible acabarlo solo y mucho menos si apenas lo juegas asi que ve a buscar amigos que quieran comprarlo bro

Mix of stealth and intense difficult combat Just wish the guns had more weight to them The sound design for the guns sounds very inaccurate compared to what they look like
Really good game Has good graphics and sets the mood well Would recommend to play with friends However for some it may be repetitive other than that its a great game
A lot of fun Good game to play with friends
this game needs disinfection
Oyun cok guzel ama kasiyo
Very good and fun game
did I shit my pants

buenardo y muy exigente lo recomiendo jugar con amigos pero si quieres jugarlo solo es completamente disfrutable al final la tencion que se siente con las alamas y los enemigos que visualmente dan el miedo que merecen pero toda la inmersion se siente muy bien
Difficult and unforgiving extremely rewarding Good game
sneak or waste all your ammo on one monster and then die and have to go through the beginning cutscene over and over 10/10 game This is not sarcasm btw this game is the only game in a while that has me wanting to play it whenever my buddy is on
Dead game dont even bother
feels bad some may like just not for me
Hands down one of the best games ever made
AMAZING don't give up
Un juego excelente que si o si necesitas jugarlo con tus amigos La historia sinceramente es muy confusa pero cuando vas alineando los cables con cada te das cuenta que valio la pena
i dont know why i bought this i dont like zombies or overly spooky games honestly gives me the same vibe as drg but Deep Rock has funny dwarves and this game has mentaly ill convicts
There is a point where games can be to hard and this game is just to hard to where its not fun I get people who like a challenge but you arent able to play this game even if you are good because you cant do it alone Its very team based and if even one of your teammates isnt decent then you arent gonna win the run You spend 1 hour in a match just for someone to leave or for your teammates not to be good so you dont complete the mission and you keep trying for days just for the same thing to keep happening so you dont even get to experience the game since your always stuck on one level Its a great game as far as like the neat little story and gameplay and I really want to see more of it but your just not able to
veri goot
me gusta por que mis amigos me obligan a jugarlo asi que tengo que decir que me gusta C
Gameplay is fun if you dont mind a combo of l4d and like realistic halo do not even attempt to buy if you dont have 3 other friends that will actually play the game because if you and 2 other people want to play and your third flakes its really fucking hard to do the latter missions 5/10 without friends 8/10 with friends hope next run down is fun
truly amazing team game would highly reccoment
Very good game highly recommend playing with friend bots are extremely stupid and often stuck at door or ladder if they hold an objective
Play this if you need to figure out who's the likeliest friend to kill you for the hell of it
The game is fun but until real accessibility options are added I can't recommend this game
Fantastic game only complaint is that the game is not optimised for lower spec pc's but honestly thats forgivable
Game was fun until they took away bunny hopping
I probably died more often than started a level but I love it Really hard but I'd say very fair game Get a group before playing tho it's much more fun that way Solo is still fun but be prepared to die
caro
I have 5 hours trust me guys
je veux des grenade et des molotov car il manque surtout sa car des armes qui font des piqure de moustique merci a oui une option silencieux et de reduire les foutue item glowstick sa commence a bien faire a et une option pas de tir se serait aussi pas mal
Very unique 4-player coop shooter Part stealth part wave/horde mode A lot of features that I never seen in other games in this form like hacking Cool experience especially if you got 3 friends to play Really intense and rewarding feeling
Just played 2 hours and this game has left a very good impression Just completed A1 with a friend and 2 bots Took an 1 hour 14 minutes We went full tactical taking every precaution and managed to complete it first time with no bleed outs Still Extremely difficult but I can say for me that is what I wanted very enjoyable Definitely recommended
Why is this game so expensive I recommend the game but for the price i'm sceptical
The bots can't even stay inside the Full team cap
The tutorial mission is pretty straight forwards Seems nice that they are willing to ease new players into the game Then you proceed to be given an involuntary rectal exam by those SCP abortion looking things immediately afterwards when you try to do the first actual mission
I wanted to love this game but I'll say it I'm bad at this game This game is really cool and has a lot going for it but if you aren't ready for the difficulty it might not be the game for you I don't wanna cry and moan about the game needing to be easier I bounced off it once and went back with friends and bounced off it again I generally can get behind a game with some difficulty and maybe someday I'll try it again but till then I think I'll stick to games more my speed I wish I could do a middling review rather than a downright dislike but oh well Maybe their next title will be something I can enjoy more
running out of hairs to pull out
Spiel ist tot Ohne Mitspieler nicht schaffbar und man findet keine Auch nachdem die dappiche nominierungen nochmal eine reflektierung erzwungen wird bleibts dabei is toooot
Shit game

Mouse doesn't work in this game Works in all other games
Great if you have friends that also happen have some spare money
bro this game is really scary to play you may have guns but you know you're not going to action hero out of everything
gud game
GOOD
Boring
Ich habe keine Kritik das spiel ist gut ausgabe voll verdient nichts zu bereuen auch bei dem hohen Preis hat geringen suchtfaktor und ist nicht auswirkend wenn mann nur wenig Zeit Games Bei der ich mir dass das spiel einen was gibt wobei andere Spiele mit hohen suchtfaktor grob gesagt Dich im Hamsterrad lauffen lassen um zu verhindern dass du zu schnell voran kommst das ende erreichst und das game dann langweilig wird Auf Langzeit Besitz gesehen ist das von mir eine Gute Empfehlung die dies nicht kennen/haben Das spiel Bietet einen eigenen Discord server sodass du immer global gesehen ein Team hast wenn du englisch kannst
I listen to music while playing this game all the time
Monster go brrrr
stealth shotguns and trip mines are key including glow sticks
It's alright
This shits too fucking hard
By the end of each level you've reached Level 100 sneak
Love the game hate that most of the run downs come down to door defender If you don't know what I mean then let me explain In the last two current rundowns it was just run to the security door fight waves as the alarm goes into poison circles around the enemies entry point back down to poison Even with a full squad that is goofy Damage it takes vs the damage received is hella wonky as well as the battles that occur Another example the pod shooters pods can clip through solid objects to hit you which means cover is not an option Melee weapon variety is pretty neat but none of it means anything cause they all end up just being the same stats just minor differences But these are just nitpicking and my opinion I love the game and they are updating it regularly as well as adding more content and even some story just enough to get your attention and enough unsaid to leave it vague and creepy
its like school
Hard to get good at very fun game non the less
69
fun game wish it was a bit scarier
40 2\5
Amazingly challenging but way too much fun Great lore fantastic game play and its a good time to scream with your friends
I like to bash my head in so i want them too also get some
gotaaa go sneekay or da brixton bullies gonna feal u up and go kablart
amazing just simply fear personified
think game bad cuz bad get gud hav fun
A very good game but it pretty much requires almost a full team to enjoy If you really liked the harder heists in Payday 1 and 2 then you'll probably really enjoy this game as well I would say as long as you have 3 or 4 people it is probably the best hardcore coop game out there but it's not really worth it if you're trying to play solo or with 1 other friend
Really good game with friends D
I buy gam 3 year ago and gam very fun wit frend and wake up scot and alarm shoot zombi
good stuff here
Died together A lot 10/10
This game is like being in a toxic relationship where the sex is amazing but your partner is literally insane You're gonna have fun but you better get a therapist Also you may want to bring a friend or two because sh!t's gonna get wild
Amazing game Great execution I love the deeply unsettling atmosphere This is not the equivalent to fast food though Take your time act as a team play with people you know or you will probably not have much fun
first few levels are basically tutorial but the stress level cranks up pretty fast stealth gameplay with a foot in tactical resource management and an excellent lesson centered around bottlenecking and setting up a meat grinder for a flood of enemies wish more of my friends had this game
1.LIST ZONE_XX 2.QUERY ITEM_XXX 3.PING ITEM_XXX you are good to go
I want to like this game but I can't play it If you don't have time to commit to finding a group of people on discord every time you want to play then the game is unplayable Maybe if the Dev comes out with rundown 8 which I hear may not actually happen then I'll finally get to play the game I purchased in early access but had trouble playing because there was no matchmaking and functionally there is not
too many crashes game is good but unstable edit I basically cant procede with the game as any time i try to start the second mission it crashes my build consists of rtx 3060ti and amd ryzen 7 5800X cpu with 16GB of RAM ddr4 so it's not a power problem since i also run it at 1080p medium settings i would ask for a refund if i didnt buy this on instant gaming

GTFO more like GTFI get the fuck in cause this game is good my friends disagree so i shot them with a big gun
good
This game brings about feelings of dread I haven't felt for years The game play is great the graphics are great the monsters are great It has a lot going for it but what truly carries this title is it's level design and atmosphere I'm very glad I picked up this game and I have recommended it to all my friends
die a lot in this game but damn is it satisfying when you complete a hard rundown great game
Very immersive and super fun but make sure to bring friends Patience and cooperation are necessary
game haard 10/10
This game is quite fun especially with friends I believe that the difficult aspects of the game are what differ it from many other shooters like it The need to conserve equipment and ammo make the game challenging and forces you to think strategically before entering a room The comments saying the lack of checkpoints make the game unfun must not realize that it is the point of the game to be challenging and having checkpoints every time you get past a difficult bit would completely change the punishing flow of the game Not to mention that games now baby you through every single bit of it and most things are easy to achieve so an extremely challenging game is a great change of pace One mistake can decide whether you pass a match or not and makes everyone take time and think before they do instead of just shooting and killing everything throughout every level My only complaint about the game which is not a very big one is the AI It can be a bit frustrating at times with the mistakes they make but for the most part they do fairly well in combat and helping the players Overall I recommend the game to people that have friends wanting to play this as well For the solo players this game isn't really for you
This is the most horribly optimized game I have ever had the misfortune of trying to download for myself I have had it for a month before I tried playing the game and it took me two hours to even get to the main menu I have never had a game lag on me very much before and this game pissed me off to the point of uninstallment through sheer lag
please for the love of God don't play this game this game ruined my mental capacity i wanted to uninstall playing this honestly
Gameplay is mid
GTFO is a horror game that i love now that being said it doesnt have that many players but after playing for 327 hours i can tell you that if you are in to horror fps games this is one to check out its got great mechanics and great loore the game also gets a new rundown every 6 months so you cant really get board I'm also a small youtuber that plays this game and has a crap tone of fun with it
it's all fun and games until someone forgets to turn off their flashlight
Game could be a great first person co-op and is when you can play but you only get to see the game about 25 of the time the rest is ether covered in fog looking like a spoiler warning on a image about 50 of the time or just black with only UI really see-able They say they are offering dread and excitement but it comes off more as disorientation and bootless errands If you want a great first person co-op I would recommend checking out both of the Warhammer Vermintide games They have plenty of challenging content and progression paths
It was fun when I could play it and I would love to play it more soon I can't wait to get the game and play it more
This game is fun with friends but I get burnt on sneaking around all the time but a well made game none the less Shout out to Evil Murray for this one He is a master of leading the group You have to have a leader calling the shots or you will not get far
If you love tough co-op games this one is for you and the community is great for the most part highly recommend
I don't understand the hype for it at all It's not very good as a shooter a horror game or a strategy game Just a total slog A guy convinced me and two other friends to play it and we were all alt-tabbing and wishing we were playing something else an hour into a game I've never felt like I was actually wasting my time playing a game until I tried GTFO If you want to play red light green light with budget CoD zombies sprinkled in then this is for you I guess
I scream like a little girl its great
game gud game scary and hard game quiet mode
I love this game so much Hopping on the game with the boys and running gunning and strategizing against enemies is a great way to spend time This games difficulty provides an interesting experience as you progress The constant events and updates also leave you with a community of great developers and players I would recommend this 100 Best money spent
I love the gameplay of GTFO so much but the game is so hard to love in general if there is no reward/incentive per run Give us skills give us weapon unlocks/customizations Give us a level up system Anything
Bishop is a legend
is a good game a bit spoopy but is not bad
nice game
get the fuck
Fast and fun gameplay that is best with 4 players for coop

The Hardest and most stratigic L4D game ive ever played but cant get past level b2 or c1 because blind people can see better than we can on those 2 levels
10 10 10
Vorrei che ci fosse gente italiana a giocare questo titolo credo meriti veramente molto
Very disappointed There is no save feature within the game so if you are 3/4 through a mission and have to leave you have to restart all over again with no checkpoints Do not buy unless you have tons of free time to sit and grind a mission start to end
absolute master piece
It's get fun with friends
one of the best Game i have ever played its full of action and horror 10/10
had a friend snipe a brute in a room with 4 of them after another friend stabbed a sleeper spoiler alert we lost
good game
the gameplay is great the atmosphere is perfect the need to conserve resources can be punishing but also makes it fantastic and forces you not to just run and gun through the whole thing the lack of checkpoints is terrible and makes the game near unplayable unfun and not worth your money its so upsetting it seems like such an easy fix but it just makes the whole thing feel like a chore it is fun for an hour or two a month with friends but if you reach a hard part and it takes 30 minutes to reach it from the last check point and you fail a second time it ruins the mood everyone leaves and it can take months to get people to try again it literally just needs one check point on the longer maps two minutes before the end events and this game would be the best atmospheric shooter ive ever played instead its frustrating and disapointing
Now playable solo up to about C1 with bots after that you really need a team The GTFO discord server is your friend for finding groups One of my favorite co-op games
vary good geym 10/10 would poo my pants with friends again
PARASHA
yes
GTFO has quickly become one of my favorite gaming experiences It's a very unique game that places an emphasis on both skill as well as tactical planning and greatly rewards learning the game mechanics without holding your hand the whole way through As mentioned by others the game is difficult but when you complete a level after failing many times the feeling of satisfaction is unparalleled So many level finales are intense and come right down to the wire which really makes it feel like an achievement when finally completing it only to unlock the next level which is even more difficult The experience is definitely best when you can play with a full group of 4 friends however I have been able to complete later game difficult content with just one friend so it's certainly possible without a full group It's probably not the best game for casual gamers but if you're looking for a truly unique challenge to play with friends GTFO is honestly one of the best games around
Very nice game too bad they desert it

Wenn man Bi ist auf jedenfall empfehlbar ansonsten ist das Game sussy daddy
Never felt like hitting my head off a wall and shit myself at the same time 10/10
100/10
One of the greatest cooperative experiences you could ever ask for An absolute must try
Really fun game but holy hell is it so underwhelming if you don't have friends that have good pc's or don't have friends in general
challenging and fun
wished it was more scary 9 10
excelente juego de sigilo con una gran inmersion y realismo que lo hace muy adictivo al jugar con tus amigos y pasar mucho tiempo divirtiendote

I wish I liked this game I wish I got to see more of this game I don't and I didn't This is a suicide note and I'm getting creative Suicide by cop is so last year I'm committing suicide by l33t gamer SoMe posse Buh-bye cruel world Here we go The idea of the game is brilliant a pure co-op with slight assymetry between team members you can't be everything so you pick a role with strenghts and vulnerabilities a role you all agree on not some dull template I love it The ambience of the game is brilliant too It's a pure gloom and despair festival I just think it's a shame the developer is so uncompromising and made the game so hard and thus inaccessible to many players A prestige contest I dunno I just don't get it We're outta prestige ourselves It all just seems like a bad financial decision to me It would have reached a wider audience with a little more accessibility Call it something humiliating a l2p n00b mode or whatever we don't care So we are this group of old gamers We are so OG our teeth are beginning to fall out hair is already way gone We were there at the birth of pro gaming QW we were there at the birth of MMORPG's with hard content long before pansy WoW But we are too old these days to keep up with the hardgames now you know what's coming zoomer It's just that GTFO isn't even like Dark Souls or something There you have a comeback mechanism at least Here you don't You spend an evening trying to crack a level You're cautious You discuss You devise a plan You deal with situations It takes time And then towards the end of the level you wipe anyway And all your efforts are down the drain but it's too late in the evening for another go Try again from scratch next week And then next week you wipe again at the end of the level And the week after You need the patience of a Buddah all of you in the team You also need a lot of time for back to back sessions Oh and a young nervous system A highschool dropout could be the ideal player We grew bored and gave up on the game And it's a shame I would have liked the game

Very good game love every aspect of it except for few bugs here and there The official discord server is also very good No friends No problem go to the official discord server for matchmaking the community is very very helpful
you can tell when devs are loving the work they work this game is a solid 10/10 for what it's trying to do excellent level design very immersive guns feel good difficulty ranges from challenging to good fckin luck very teamplay focused
GTFO steps on me and I i like i it
super fun super hard
good

Es un juego donde el trabajo en equipo lo es todo su cooperativo es su punto fuerte preferible entre amigos porque ratos de que te pueden hacer querer mandar a la m a cualquiera o a todo Y lo mejor que ahora ya esta en que si estas demente este es tu juego Problemas el matchmaking asi q unete a un grupo de discord y programa tus incursiones x ahi Te dije que son misiones a cumplir o morir pues si no hay puerta trasera una vez dentro no hay como salir o sigues adelante con tu equipo o espera a que los mutantes te destruyan
intense
10/10
dis gaem is very fun it is not repetitive at all yet i just completed the first level with atleast 10 attempts and due to the items respawning randomly when you restart the level not when you die you never know if youll find useless glowsticks or if youll get a 4 use medpack
The four hours I have were only for the first level this game is pretty difficult and kinda hard to figure out but it is absolutely amazing the ambience is just perfect and I have heard some people complain about the weapons being weak but I find them perfectly balanced and very fun to use 9/10 deff worth it at a discounted price only thing i'm worried about it repetition as the levels just have different designs but still the same mechanics and objectives

So me and my coworkers had just finished putting our baby in the baby crusher Suddenly a swarm of freaking DND BEHOLDERS came out of nowhere and attacked We desperately held our ground in the extract point with no ammo as more and more spawn 12/10 would take tentacles again P
13 hours for just a few matches oh god no
very intense better with friends
THE GAMe should get more guns through gamplay and unlock more equiment
It's mechanically demanding like a 4 man raid or dungeon from any number of MMOs or Destiny You will wipe you may spend hours nailing some segments Surviving a level feels great but you'll have to work for it
Really fun as long as you have friends to play with
Great game if u have friends
yolu var zor ama oyunu uzatmak O
Vim mudar a review o jogo melhorou muito tanto em quanto em performance recomendo a gameplay
good game
this shit runs like walt jr in a swamp
This game is more fun if you have friends its also a trial and error experience so get ready for an extreme hard gameplay not even joking this game is hard as hell
This game is riddled with game breaking bugs I've played two rounds and could not finish either of them due to game breaking bugs after spending 1 to 2 hours in game progressing through a round
Its a fun game and you heard that from me the captainpopo pros you can smash guys with a hammer and their fuckin heads explode cons everything is grey
Esta bueno 👍
Fun when you have friends
get the frick out O
Very fun to play much better with friends
Can't drop the power cell after after spending three days and countless attempts to get to the first checkpoint 0/10 The game has a lot of potential with lackluster execution The environments are outstanding and the graphics are surprisingly good for an indie title However where the game falls really short is in the stability and checkpoint system It's perfectly fine to have a very difficult game where missions take multiple hours and dozens of attempts to make progress However the bugs this game has and the broken checkpoints where players respawn with items stuck in their hands leaves a lot to be desired Don't get me wrong this is a really fun game when everything works well as every mission level is unique and requires several initial tries to even figure out the general layout My biggest problem is that the development team does not seem the slightest bit interested in fixing the significant bugs Even if making loadable saves is complicated the bare minimum is that the already very scarce amount of checkpoints should be stable to makeup for any other unforeseeable early access bugs as it's extraordinarily frustrating to have to redo a three to four hour mission after a horde of enemies desynced from the host client and the checkpoint respawned me with a power cell permanently glued to my hands No amount of this game is MEANT to be difficult is a valid excuse for broken game checkpoints in hour long missions
GTFO is a experience This feeling of 1 hour of intense gameplay and teamplay can not be compared to any other games Now i am fairly new into the game so my adrenalin keeps pumping The community is awesome Had some really nice pro players guiding me through the basics After that it is just experimenting and always testing the limits You can rush rooms and i recently started doing so but the danger of enemies waking up and you pulling the whole room is always there Get on the official discord You NEED to be in a call with the people you need intense communication And you will be highly rewarded with intense action and great stealth
10/10 pls add achievements
The game is borderline broken and unplayable at times but if you can get through and have 3 other friends who dumped a s#!%load of money on their computer it is fun The challenge present in the game is monstrously huge for new players Walking in blind has a steep learning curve It's not all about the end though and GTFO is the latest game to handcraft a variety of levels for players to master and overcome Sense of accomplishment and the urge for just one more run are at amazing highs with this game This game feels like you are strategizing an intense game of catan against wall st brokers trying to rip you off but instead of building cities and roads you are given a assault rifle sidearm and a foam gun to fight walking vaginas as they attempt to rip you a new one Individual levels take my friends and I weeks to complete let alone doing optional objectives which can increase the challenge by a whole multiple but the high you get when you finally finish the damn level is unlike none other 5/7 nights a week are spent in absolute frustration 1 when we spend hours chalk talking a game play to finish the level and 1 every other week where we see the survived screen Each level if you don't die takes about an hour to complete but requires so much concentration you're constantly engaged With constant updates to the game players are always engaged in new challenges in levels they've completed or brand new level sets which is almost enough trade-off for the amount of random bugs that will appear in levels and absolutely toss ur shit up The main downside is the required co-op My friends and I playing the game takes actual real life scheduling to get runs in almost like a club sports team Playing with bots makes most of the levels borderline impossible to make real progress in unless you've mastered the games mechanics and I'm sure someone has If the game had better handicaps for single-player and wasn't filled with random load/crash bugs I could recommend it to everyone but for the hardcore audience I can assure there is tons to enjoy here
shit myself
I've played 17 hours at this point and I really enjoy it I've made minimal progress three levels due to teammates that leave early the infamous random lagg and admittedly a lack of skill on my part Teamwork is essential requiring a lot of communication and coordination Finding teammates is a challenge but worth it Without Discord you probably aren't getting lobby filled with humans Success is worth the time and is satisfying
colnfun
EXTREME
Please bear in mind I only played during a free-to-play event with roughly 5 hours in total Pros Great atmosphere and narrative context A prisoner forced into dangerous servitude to appease supposed higher ups Gun play feels pretty good some weapons feel great others I find lacking in feel and oomph Sound design in general great LOVE the lack of tutorials you need to remember information to complete objectives Such as hacking computers for example No hand-holding is a plus in my books Cons Mechanics seem at odds with objectives The game gives the players so many tools to hold down a small location but the vast majority of objectives and quests in the time that I played involved in quickly moving from spot to spot Two missions were particularly guilty for this Every so often removing players from what feels intended and comfortable is a great tool but this should be the exception not the norm Stealth seems very arbitrary In a game where ammo is scarce and you often have to rely on melee weapons it is very punishing to use melee It's clunky and the best I could hope for when attacking with melee was trading a blow for blow outside of stealth which is most of the time after a certain point Especially in higher difficulties Progression seems entirely cosmetic and for me I dont care about a different helmet Id much rather not have all the tools in the beginning and have to play in order to acquire more Overall a fun concept but falls just short for me of becoming a staple in my crowded library The biggest offender is the tools the player has not lining up with what the player has to do that is unforgivable
Start with thinking hardly until you got brain dead for playing the same stage over and over Start with scared of normal sleepers until you go into deeper zone Best you got a gun yet you still difficult
One of the most fun horror shooter games on the market but you must have friends You can match make but every time I've done it the people are too good and slaughter everything which is cool and all but it completely removes all the blood pumping close calls that make it so fun to play 10/10 when played with fellow noobs any other way and it's really not worth it but that's just how this game is Bots exist too however they are gods among men They never miss they move through terrain and can fly up through floors and walls when too far away and they are immune to being spotted until you make a mistake Playing with them is like being carried through a war zone in a wheel chair only you're in charge
GG Easy
this is definitely a game where teamwork is necessary to complete levels other then that the multiplayer matchmaking is kinda broken but that's what the GTFO discord is for just hop on and see who is willing to play and you will forget about the matchmaking altogether
Super challenging Extremely active Discord with a lot of helpful veterans Awesome atmosphere and mechanics Every Rundown makes for hours upon hours of fun and getting stomped 8/10 Not recommended for everyone Bugs to be expected
Hard
10/10 Would walk when i'm not supposed to again
i love fun game
fun and great graphics
get the fuck out Scout
Peed a little
pretty fun pretty hard a masochist's game
Guys Yeah I released the hammer too soon
An amazing and difficult horror stealth shooter Emphasis on difficult Like bend you over a table and make you its bitch difficult Definitely not for everyone Also four people HIGHLY recommended
pretty litty ig good time with killing stuff while holding guns to kil stuff everytime i wanna kill time i play GTFO to kill time which makes the dya faster
I JUST WANT TO LEAVE
its lit
fun game
Yes big recommend
It's not even scary jk
It's a really good game Surprisingly fun movement and shooting with great monster and encounter design The weapons are all really cool and the levels are all fun to play I'd recommend everyone at least give it a try
LEFT FO DEAD
honestly I think the game is too easy
game cursed at me
u learn how important patience can be
WOOOOO
muito bom
Ah sweet man-made horrors beyond comprehension
i can sum up most of this game with 3 bullet points 1 lots of fun 2 very challenging 3 strategy horror i love to play it with my friends not so much by myself cause the bots are useless however its definitely worth your money if you have friends willing to play with you
bad game i cried
Ive played it off and on for a while theyve added a lot changed levels and made it terrifying to explore monsters are fun to kill and or sneak past Try playing with friends There are bots that can get filled in instead of doing matchmaking and you can command them to do different things but i still suggest bringing a squad a 4 for better odds
pretty dope
I like to run away from naked humans and scream
good fun
bad game
where the Durag at Pick up your deployables
I like the strategicness and the reliance to coordinate with your teammates
This game is amazing The gameplay is extremely fun and very intuitive and the audio and visuals of the game are done amazingly but 10 Chambers continues to prove that they really don't care about the game at all The head developers for this game are the same ones that made Payday 2 and they left that game high and dry after updating it for a long time This game seems to be no different as they have just announced they are working on a new title and want to end GTFO on a high note On a high note Ah yes the high note where in Rundown 6 Extended a level was literally unplayable for some due to performance bugs that they never fixed the high note where Rundown 7 has gotten exactly 2 patches since it's launch I love this game but I cannot recommend anything 10 Chambers makes as they are a company with nothing but profit in mind and care not for the playerbase of any of their titles
sim 0-0 Divertido sim Simples Resumindo muito bom com amigos lembre-se de apagar as luzes D Nota O jogo muda a campanha com o tempo mesmo que termine a campanha atual em breve a atual sumir e teremos outra campanha assim tornando o fator replay maior ao decorrer do tempo
UI UI
Fun for the whole family even an infant could solo this
fuck this game
sleepers
This is definitely a thinking gamers game You and your team have to collaborate to get out of these missions alive You have to take care when choosing weapons tools etc otherwise you'll find yourselves out of ammo trying to slap every monster you come by I've only clocked 3 hours of play time at the time of writing this review but it definitely left an impression I'll update this review when I clock in more hours
10/10 I would play with brain dead teammates again
TL;DR 1 Matchmaking exists ONLY through the use of Discord 2 Bad actors can join your lobby and make your match 100 unplayable there is no ban function to remove them 3 Discord is trash allowing blocked users to see your messages join your voice channels and overall zero restriction from people harassing you 4 Mods will do nothing even with extensive proof of harassment Have fun getting screwed over by a few low-life losers Detailed Amazing game if you can find a group Unfortunately I cannot any longer recommend this game The reason is simple the matchmaking Matchmaking is non-existent inside of the game itself instead forcing you to use their discord server Which would be fine if it was modded properly However if you have a bad encounter with a player or players the mods will do absolutely nothing and continue to allow harassment while you're posting looking for game posts Annnnd since Discord is garbage players you block can still see your messages join lobbies harass you and even reply to your looking for posts Again mods will do nothing It's rare in the community to find anyone that is actually willing to play with new players let alone teach them anything about the game Which means new players are spending a bag on a game that is essentially impossible to be played alone I have quite literally joined the beginners discord chat just to help new players learn and have fun only to listen to them get cursed at for being new Aside from that finding players takes long enough as is especially if you play at night it's just not a very vibrant community in terms of numbers anymore You'll run into some of these people over and over and over and there's nothing you can do about it A couple examples There's a player with like 3000 hours on the game but this player in particular will quite literally join and afk over and over I don't know what they're doing but they will just afk for 30 seconds every couple minutes I've politely asked the player to not join my games I've asked mods to do ANYTHING about it but they do nothing this player will join your looking for games and do the same thing every time The only possible way around it is to not even post a lobby code in which case you'll get attacked by the community for not posting a lobby code Then there's my personal favorite joining a pre-made that posts publicly in looking for but already have a full team by the time you join unknowingly I join their description-less lobby code only to instantly be cursed at in the Discord voice as well as game chat and told to leave I alt-tab to report them to the mods show screenshots of them cursing at me as well as evidence they posted no description of their lobby Nothing done by the mods Mods respond with yOu sHOuLDA jUSt lEfT as if it was my fault for joining a publicly posted looking for

Splinter Cell but you don't get to hang from balconies
awesome monster shooter team work makes the dream work my friends stopped playing this game with me after playing it once i dont know why
Schoobidy doobidy
great game
Its not for dandle
Great concept but this game moves so slow and your constantly fighting for ammo and the puzzles get to complicated They also don't make sense half the time
my biggest issue is that there is no just stealth it option so after the first horde spawning door youre out of ammo and subject to trying to melee units in mass that will range attack you with aim bot give me a way to play where im not forced to lose a half an hours worth of progress because of this
no entendi nada pero me gustan los disparitos

Potential Spoilers This game is something new yes there was 4 people coop games before but i never played such a game like GTFO Is it hard yes Is it rewarding and SO SO Satisfying Also yes But the difficulty doesn't sometimes come from the actual gameplay The bots Yes you can play alone with bots but they are so Awful they can't aim they can't think but at least they can't alert sleepers but they can shoot you and deal friendly fire and with their aim it happens So to actually get somewhere you need at least 1 guy who can communicate normally the matchmaking is fine but i would highly recommend to just join the Official GTFO Discord Server to find groups to play with Although i did say that the game is not always hard cause of the gameplay IT IS also really hard cause of gameplay Because there is also a deficit of basically everything but you know what there is not deficit of Monsters They will come and come non stop on some levels but there is a limited amount of ammo Sound Effects are on point There is not a lot of things to say about it because only way to describe it is simply amazing how it immerses you into the body of the prisoner you are playing as Lore is there but i couldn't really find a lot of it due to my play time at the moment but as i know it does exist The game needs a really good PC although if you have a a good-ish PC you can possibly optimise the game to run i have a i5 and GT 1030 I am broke so can't really buy a better PC right now and i run it on lowest settings with a 1600x900 resolution It works but in some areas with a lot of fog it can lag out a bit also it need a lot of RAM at least 16 GB which thankfully i have I don't think the game is optimised the best but it works yes i know my PC barely even meet the minimal requirements and it kinda runs but i mean that it could be much better Over all the game is 89/100 for me especially fun with friends also the stealth mechanics although simple are pretty nice I would highly recommend this to anyone who has friends and a good PC And remember you have to work together or die together
yes no possibly maybe
Since the matchmaking was added and the game was developed it is easy to recommend it now if you like stealth shooters coop games horrors and the mix of the three
This game is one of my favorites of all time but its not for everyone
goushi
This game is like Doom but less tearing things apart 10/10
Very indeed game
Less that its difficult and more than its incredibly dull AND difficult You'll spend ages playing red light green light with space zombies only to get wiped out at the end of the room Repeating a run becomes a boring slog There's potential here but I have better uses of my time
The strategic and stealth aspects of the game truly flourish in a four-person team setting making this my favorite game minus the bugs
I like cock and balls torture better
Might aswell cut your own balls off than play this torture of a game
love it play it with me oce ONLY
Immersive experience Thoughtful gameplay Highly recommended
pretty difficult but with the right people fun to play
My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on GTFO and it gets 500 likes and 250 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here
birlikte keyif alarak bir oyun ama checkpoint az fazla tekrar eden oyunlarda geriden bir sonra can
is alright
spoopy
few bugs KI is ultra stupid must control KI with commands Resources are not rare more like super ultra legendary guns kinda suck at least most of them mostly has only turrets you can choose as a gadget which all do kinda the same but some just a bit worse should be played as a team of 4 to avoid the 0 IQ Bots gives horror game vibes future styled weapons elevator to the ground is epic the first 3 times after that it gets annoying story is hidden in terminals and easy to miss Stealth doest work to well If you have a coop game quad of 4 give it a try when its for sale for like 50 otherwise you might wanna stay away
Me pase una Rundown y me dejo multiples traumas 10/10
Not very good
Fantastic game It's basically mandatory multiplayer much like L4D2 was Unlike L4D2 however this game is tough as nails and requires cooperation at every level
Honestly an amazing game to play with your friends
Good stealth game Intriguing story line
There are some bug that can break a 1,5 hour run and that can make you extremely angry but overall it is a fun experience HOWEVER it is an extremely hard game You must either be ready to trial and error hours or get a guide to be somewhat effective.or you just gonna be dead soon enough
game literally tells you to
10/10
IVE BEE HERE SINCE RUNDOWN 01 and i can say I'm sad to see this game fail it was rushed out of EA it feels half baked with so much protentional left untouched fighting the same enemies over and over GREAT where are the ones that climb on the walls aye this was actually coming to the game at one stage the enemies new type would crawl on the walls and flank you this game is just sad the matchmaking system is still half baked taking 30 min of resetting to find a game like come on guys i will not be buying your next game that is for sure
You need a full team of 4 people because the AI will get you killed over and over again Also this game wants you to be stealthy but doesn't really give you options to do it consistently We tried pretty hard to try to have fun playing this game and just couldn't make it anything other then Meh at best
un jeux qui ce renouvelle presque chaque fois des maps qui changes et un plaisir de jeux en si des fois il peut etre frustrant de ne plus avoir de balles mais c'est le jeu et un rush mal fait p Les dev on tres rapide pour les bugs au tous plus le jeux une histoire que j'aimerais plus car franchement interesante

GTFO
good game not easy make sure to plan ahead ahah
a stunning game that will consume all of your time
need to add a better revive feature got stuck on my friend trying to climb ladder or suggest adding a dragging feature all in all a good game p.s also consider adding more medkits and lockers just a thought or a medic type tool we can take along
It is a very game for sure
It made me have a mental breakdown 10/10
I am a 52 year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my son who is now 14 My son recently downloaded GTFO and in less than a week he had already played for over 20 hours This was terrible for me as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories
One of the best Challenging HC game I ever played with awesome Alien movie atmosphere most missions are about sneaking saving ammo and dying before you firgure out how succeed in certain mission but there are also some cool missions when you have defend reactor against waves of enemies Deeper you dive into complex its getting harder I just wish you could have some weapon progress so you could unlock better red dot scopes etc

b]Do Not Buy The game is coming to an end![/b b]Quoting the NME.com GTFO article Ulf Andersson We'd rather end on a high you know b If I could go back in time I would have refunded given the current lack of development and bugs that this game is infested with 10chambers should rename themselves to 10vacation given how little they put into GTFO over the past two years Compared to GSG's DRG it's a night and day difference in terms of community engagement/expectation game management and content satisfaction Currently the run down is pretty bare bones filled with repetitive objectives and poor enemy AI The maps are proc generated and you are basically experiencing the same tiles with slight scan variation The dev team could have poured additional resource and expanded on the variety of enemies scan and objective but choose to start a new game instead Given that the end is nigh GTFO is not worth your 40 it is not worth it even if it is free At the end of this trainwreck 10vacay is going back to what they do best and that is robbing people of their money setting up their next heist with a futuristic heist game similar to Payday 1 2 I personally will never purchase a 10vacay game ever again
its hard work together or pay the consequences
Let me first state I Love This Game It was with a saddened heart that I'd say No Don't buy it I don't recommend I've Been playing since its Original Steam Release in 2019 it is a very VERY difficult game or should I say WAS The Dev's original Idea was a slow stealth game that could be a shooter if Panic Moments happened As the game developed it grew and became better with its next few Rundowns"(sets of levels Then the team quit with making it hard they made ways to slow you but FLOODED it with ammo so nothing was ever challenging Now after feeding the players false hope of more challenging maps and enemies they have released that they will winding G.T.F.O down to a end to work on a new project I love this game I will play this game till its dieing days I'm sad that 10 Chambers took a game to a con and instead of enhancing a game that many players love they decided to announce that this game should End on a high note Please don't buy this game people It's literally ending
newcomers it's hard to justify purchasing this product at this point in time Simply put this game is unique interesting and compelling for a co-op experience I've met and played with fantastic individuals I wouldn't have otherwise met I found a video-essay from The Real Khepri that I feel best summarises the current direction of the game and as of writing this the game is showing signs of limited support going forward It's just about over an hour long but generally agreeable in regards to the state of the game Video reference GTFO 10 Chambers Developer Incompetence Why I'm Leaving The Community I've played since Rundown 001 or in other words been around here and there since Early Access but if you find yourself on the fence it's worth researching into it you have a wealth of reviews and takes from far more seasoned players and contributors than I
fun
Cool game very unique Runs terribly As in it crashes on loading in Crashed down to the PC itself I'd absolutely recommend this game if this gets fixed

Where is the fun
Just play the free weekend get hooked and buy the game on sale Play this with my twin and trying to play it with two other people who are semi-smart like we are Love the devs you'll choose with rundown to go through soon when the game releases or next update can't remember as I got second hand knowledge from my twin

Great shallenge and fun but fair mechanics Terrific for groups of friends after intense firefights
All the planning in the world don't help when one failed stealth encounter cause many faeces to come shooting out of my anus
This game is fun you have to cooperate with people and talk If you are better and already know what to do then you don't have to talk as often It sucks that there are not more people playing this game though The bots do what they can but nothing can replace actual human players I have been in Matchmaking for more hours than play time
it's too dark i can't see shit
jogo brilhante porem cuidado voce literalmente vai gastar 10hrs de jogo pra passar da primeira e segunda fase isso se tiver um time com a comunicacao boa se tiver jogando solo ou com 1 amigo e o lobby nao fechar meus pesames vira marmita de bicho na certa achou dark souls facil ou conseguiu zerar joga isso outro patamar GTFO Gosto de Tomar Forte no Orificio
Game is fun hard to beat not for weak o heart
This game has some of the best gunplay i've experienced in a game Definitely one of the best fps horror games of our time It's not very scary but the atmosphere and world building are done so well that it becomes very immersive and unsettling DO play with friends The AI can be a bit buggy at times 3.2.3.2.3.big guy here To sum this game up you're gonna be an hour and a half into a mission when one of your friends accidentally triggers an enemy and then everyone dies You pretty much have to play perfect Be prepared to win very infrequently but the challenge has a certain charm to it If all else get this game for its amazing gunplay lighting sound effects and world building
very gut

Dear Valve Services l watched the game trailer and thought it might be a best game to play with a partner so l decide to buy it instantly But after about 20 days I am still single so sad.I can play this game with no one I want a refund Maybe l should buy it after I found a soul partner I hope I can get my money back and use it into some more meaningful things like charity sorry to trouble you but writing the letter sincerely for my refund At last I would be appreciate if you can return my deal and my money to my steam wallet all I want to say Thank you
Best co-op shooter I've ever played Unlike other shooters the community is great my friends don't play so I always play pick-up games but we almost always have a good experience It is hardcore so it can be frustrating but there is a decent learning curve everyone helps each other to learn and when you finally clear a hard mission it is sooo satisfying Downsides there are a few bugs but nothing too bad In-game matchmaking doesn't really work but everyone uses the official discord channels to find a pick-up game which is easy and works well
Awesome game really immersive with just some small bugs regarding ai behaviour A must to play with other people although as any other co-op game the matchmaking is literally a shot in the dark Play with friends if you can and you are guaranteed to have fun The team ai isn't the best but they are manageable if you intend to play solo Overall it's a really cool game the stealth part is pretty intense
goooooooooooooooooood
The most demanding co-op game ever made The atmosphere design mechanics and gunplay are all tremendous yet terribly marred by the lack of accessibility you can't start a mission and then quit one so that you can return to it later yet these runs can take 3-4 hours apiece Because of the difficulty you're also expected to fail several times at each run This causes what could be a more accessible and enjoyable title for those who want it there is no reason such features couldn't be made optional into a kek hardcore gamerz only multiplayer experience that thereby shoots itself in the foot relentlessly I recommend it but only only if you have friends who can dedicate themselves to it for many hours
You definitely want to play with people you know It is a tense game where everyone needs to play their part It can be slow and methodical or you can end up yelling at each-other to shut off flashlights every 3 minutes Good luck
The game is fun and very hard BUT the devs dont listen and this game is jank asf Unplayable alone past the first 4 missions of any rundown
Its fun you can even do it solo👍

Plays best with a group of friends Takes a mission to really get into the game but it's great fun when you start working together on tactics and stuff Game looks great has native support for 21:9 and doesn't seem to contain too many bugs Even better now that previous rundowns are available
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA scary

I can only Recomend the Game It is quite Fun with Friends and the Tactical Aspects of it is nice if you search a Challange It can also be frustrating due to some bugs and some Crashes on Earlyer Windows Versions and PCs with low Graphic Power and the fact that it gets quite Difficult in the Higher Levels is sometimes a bit discouraging However i find it always very Rewarding to finaly succed a Run after failing once or twice and it is most often the Fun you have with your friends that carries you through any Hardship a Locked Security Door Poses

I am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 14 now My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories
you get to say cool shit like go dark go loud im dry like a real swat team but then in the next 5 seconds you forget to turn off your flashlight and alert the entire room griefing your party 10/10
misleading title
The tastiest of the tasty
SHOULD HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PLAY
awesome
Free to play weekend definitely cemented the decision to buy or not to buy this game Thanks for that After playing a few Co-op runs I have no interest in buying this game and have removed it from my Wishlist Gunplay felt like Payday 2 bullet sponge hell and a lot of back and forth through areas doing the same tasks repeatedly
Jeu a suspense excellent
Deep Rock Galactic without the funny Dwarfs
Affe bom demais
This game is not like other kinds of lawn mowing games what he needs is the cooperation of the team every blood pack ammunition package must be used to be reasonable the game has many advantages this game is not particularly good for Meng Xin but it is a good experience for people who are particularly patient and persevering
am coming
Please newbies who are thinking about buying this game learn how to play before leaving a bad review
le jeu est super difficile donc ame sensible s'absetenir Cependant chaque niveau requiert une certaine mettre en place Je ne pense pas que se jeu fasse peur je dirais qu'il est plus stressant qu'autre chose les scout par exemple Jouer avec des amis qui ne rage pas trop et accepte de perdre rends encore plus Le jeu est beau Quant au y a des petites choses a ameliorer notamment du Je trouve dommage que lorsque nous avons 1 stack de soins dans les mains le maximum est 4 items et que vous trouvez 3 pack de soins ses derniers ne s'aditionne pas
After Debating for awhile I decided to take a chance and purchase it This game is left 4 dead on streroids I enjoy the cooperative aspect Communicating with others makes for a great experience Gameplay is very solid Graphics very good If you do purchase the game make sure you use the discord The Discord is key especially if you don't have any friends to play this with The community as a whole is extremely positive and friendly I also recommend watching the beginners guide as well before you purchase Every mission is basically like a raid from destiny Overall I give this game a solid 8.5/10
Simply too hard to be much fun Tried the first couple of levels with a team on voice chat Carrying around the mission item was tedious Basically this is a multiplayer stealth game Stealth and multiplayer don't work well together The checkpoints are sparse so if you fail a section more than three times the game becomes you vs boredom as you try to do a rigid stealth process again I think this game would only be fun for a very specific group of people but everyone else with different team compositions should do something else
Esos bichos no son dulces no
I love it one of the best co-ops games me and my friends picked up Wouldn't have tried this game without the free weekend
Extremely fun and tense great gameplay loop Would NOT recommend without at least two other friends to play with The bots are bullet sponges and turrets useless in pretty much all other regards You need to dig through menus in the heat of the moment to make them do basic commands and even then they're slow and not really as helpful as another actual player Single player and two player is pretty difficult especially when more complex enemy types get throw into the mix
This game makes me think of Alien Swarm Killing Floor and Deep Rock Galactic It also has stealth mechanics and high difficulty There are a lot of complaints floating around I think they are way overblown There are definitely some issues I wish were fixed For example the netcode needs to be improved and matchmaking is rudimentary at best Overall a really fun game you just can't believe half the things people tell you about it Old rundowns are now coming back invalidating another complaint people have
Yes aliens have slong tongues and guns go brrrrrrrrr
h1][quote table tr th url tr tr th th tr tr th th tr table quote][/h1 9.2/10
Really have enjoyed playing this game with my buddies It is hard but fair since I originally played the game before check points Thanks for the work that the developers put in
Not my type of a game And the price tag is even with discounts it's OPAF
good game
Not worth more than Feels incomplete clumsy and repetitive
Unique coop shooter with fantastic sci-fi horror elements Beautiful visuals and killer sound
This game had every potential but ultimately it fails Gameplay is glitchy in that sometimes although you sneak to perfection enemies activate and attack you At other times you headshot a scout multiple times with a sniper he simply does not die If you do not finish a level you have to play it over again That coupled with the big length of each level sometimes 2+hours to finish make the game repetitive and ultimately boring Very little enemy variability Levels look and feel very repetitive There is better options out there GTFO Get the out of my PC
Mano jogo de mas o suspense e a gameplay dele nos vontade de continuar jogando de ter muito bons pra um jogo que nem 1 ano tem Simplesmente perfeito pra jogar com amigos A faz a

BESTO JUEGO atmosfera increible GOD
it is pretty scary when you don't know where the enemy is and when there is a large groupe of enemy
GTFO.is a fantastic game with graphics that are so beautiful you dont know if its fake the missions are amazing weapons i love this game still amazing
Impossible to make this garbage play without crashing constantly It also crashes every background program running on the computer somehow
I say play this only if you got friends to play with its a amazing game and love to troll with friends
chaotically based
good game but poes expensive
evet
I would recommend GTFO to anyone that has friends that could play the game with they but if you are playing the game solo the Bots are not that good and it's very hard to get through missions solo the Bots will walk in to turrets fire and if you do not know how to use the terminal the mission will take a lot longer besides that I actually really like the game
unimpressive
Quite literally one of the best co-op games on the market right now stealth and cooperation is key The AI is way better than I had initially thought but quickly on levels past the first two you WILL need player partners Probably also one of the few co-op games to actually make me shit my pants
Its fun
Elbette oyunun bir deneyimleyebildim ve oyun bir fikrim yok fakat hem oyunun hem de Steam'in iade daha fazla oynamadan bu incelemeyi Oyun bir atmosfer gibi duruyor ki oyuncu kitlesinin bir bu oyunu Fakat gelin ki atmosfer o kadar da ilgi Germesi gereken bir oyundu ama 1.5 saat boyunca gerginlik hissetmedim Bana canavar ortama pek uymuyor garip duruyor yani Daha bir mekan da o kadar ilgi O konuda da bir yola Oyunun gereksiz bir inceleme okudum tabii ki bu kadar ama biraz tahmin edebiliyorum bir bir Sunucular konusunda da bir hayal zannetmiyorum Oyunu fazla ama lobi bulma 1 Oyun sesli sohbet gibi Lobi de girebiliyorsunuz bu elemandan oyunda az denilemeyecek olarak indirimdeyken bile hak Gerici veya atmosferik olma bence
So much fun and teaches you from the first few minutes of play communication is key One of the best Team comms games I have played in a long time

Good game but have a lot of bugs
This games offers a very unique and intense gaming experience a more methodical and hardcore take on the Left4Dead/Killing Floor subgenre The visuals and atmosphere truly immerse you in this bleak uncertain world in which you crawl around this subterranean complex Combat is chaotic yet tight and satisfying All the weapons feel pretty nice and diverse My only gripe with it is that the missions take a bit too long easily reaching the 3h mark It would be nice if the current checkpoint system allowed for you to pause and leave the mission to come back to it later

Great Game
The game we needed
I've been playing this game for so little time but I can notice a ton of improvements from when I first saw this game on youtube All I can really criticize is the gamepad controls They are very lackluster for the type of game this is Some improvements are needed but other than that a FANTASTIC game
If you have friends or to much time
chaos
Never played such an intense shooter Amazing work can imagine to get a lot of hours out of it Make sure to bring friends and not speedrun it for full effect And keep going
Nope
Upd surge alarm Upd2 Upd3 8 rundown Alt
can have all the best reviews it wants tried for 3 days and couldn't even get a match going player base just isn't there like it was in the beginning of what i'e heard in it's prime
The game for what it is is completely polished it's done Difficult terrifying and well designed maps that cycle every month the perfect game to play with friends who are looking for a challenge
good game game good Expect to reset rounds over and over if you're a solo player however as randoms have a 40 chance of running into a crowd of sleepers as soon as you're all dropped off at spawn and by the time that the horde is cleared your whole team will have a combined HP of about 42 If you walk into a room and see a mass of tendrils stretching and feeling out the walls then make sure to run into them and let the feeler hug you
fun game can't go to sleep because its very fun
Amazing game to play with friends Great mechanics unique levels and enemies and minor bugs Only issue is price but otherwise 9/10
Fantastic game for a friend group to play through together However the single player/matchmaking experience significantly suffers since the game is fundamentally designed for a well-coordinated team of 4 which is pretty unfortunate for the times when you can't get a few friends to hop on and play Nevertheless it's a great game
me and my friend bond over this game XD
Got gat from bugs but game is good otherwise
dog water game that kicks the host mid match
Has a real sense of urgency crispy graphics and overall enjoyable game play
Great game requires teamwork creepy crawly goodness
Friends required
The game is fun even more so with friends But i'm giveing it a down vote because their are game breaking bug's still We were carrying the objective but had died with holding it and when we respawn at checkpoint we could not drop it no matter what we tried to jump off high and falling to get downed and quiting and rejoining to no avail we had to do a full restart even equiment would bug out like ammo and medkits could not be used and turrets could not be placed I realy hope devs adress these bugs and i might reconsider my review score
this game is so creepy can play some maps solo with or without bots or in a team recommend the GTFO Discord for this Basically you are a convict and sent into areas to do stuff but the creatures down there are determined to kill you Loads of fun
it was good
The game is okay My braincells have been reduced to ashes and now my friends and I share a single braincell as a result of this incident
I think I might stay
scary game gives you the illusion of being able to fight back if you fuck up by handing you guns do not trust it you will die
good bad matchmaking
stressful chaotic but in the hands of a proper team rewarding do join the discord or have a group of friends to communicate with you're gonna need it 7/10
Left for dead skinned as a Doom clone with no lighting Shame it costs so much because it's not worth what they charge
i love the game the sense of fear every time i turn a corner is thrilling not knowing whats on the other side of that door or realizing that you have to trigger that alarm to well GTFO would recommend 8.6/10
Yes thumbs up but there are game breaking bugs that still need to be addressed R7-C1 Reloading at checkpoint door and holding a battery that cannot be put down Teammates cannot open doors nor lockers Enemies are cool and creative rewarded for learning from your previous mistakes and a good mix of stealth and Run+Gun Understatement A.I is dumb af But fortunately you can find human teammates on the GTFO Discord channel
cave man answers me like much scary stuff kill you or you kill it no hide only teamwork DONT HAVE MIC DONT PLAY GAME will ruin it for others
this is some good shit
if you like stealth games this is a for sure buy The game is fantastically made and has a surprising amount of strategy with a good mix of actions and shooting when the time comes
it gud
Fun to play Worth it for team players and seasoned groups Not for solo players
Nice stealth action game You can bonk and shoot

love the game 3 is not the pussy boys
Utter trash The Community will tell you to get on discord and team up with vets in order to complete rundowns and honestly that's probably the only way to actually complete this garbage game Matchmaking won't help bots won't help and your friends can't save you Let me put it to you this way I haven't been able to complete a single rundown with any of my friends all of whom are very seasoned FPS players ever The game is that punishing And it's not punishing in a good way where you think Oh I have to learn something new to overcome the challenge No It's always some pointless capricious turn of events that you couldn't have possibly planned for which will then set you back an hour-and-a-half in progress One night my friends and I played the 2nd level in a rundown for SIX HOURS We simply could not beat it no matter what we did All four of us decided to quit the game after that and uninstall Because this was actually the third night where we had coordinated our schedules and made such an effort Devs don't care They're making this game for like the 800-odd freaktrain weirdos in the world who hang out on discord and grow mushrooms in aquariums under ultraviolet lamp in the recesses of their darkened bedrooms This game isn't for normal people I don't care how good the ambiance is The whole thing ends up being a bizarre exercise in self-flagellation for only the most masochistic and as such is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever experienced on Steam
scary challenging fun
I cannot drop the baby or that box
great game its like hide n seek but youve got glowsticks and youre probably not really the one seeking literally scared my pants off
The game in general just seemed highly unpolished The enemy movement and gun-play felt especially janky
yes
A group of untrained construction workers with hammers spraying cowboy foam TM on sleeping boys in the dark 10/10 would spaghetti man again
Suffer repeatedly for fun
Let's be honest The game itself is fantastic the gameplay the art the atmosphere the mystery But my main gripe with it is that its not made for someone that have a busy life Expeditions can take multiple hours to complete even on a first try and if you need to quit the game your checkpoints and progress are lost And you will fail.A LOT So if you have a lot of free time and a lot of friends that have which is getting rarer and rarer then you won't have any problems Otherwise tough prepare yourself for a lot of frustration What they could do to remedy that is simply to make it so that you don't lose progress when you need to quit the game and be able to get back to your last checkpoint if you want AT LEAST for the main story expeditions And better bots
Love the premise love the artstyle gameplay is okish though sluggish But the game is only playbale if you do it with friends Matchmaking does not work at all and relying on some shitty external software to get groups together just shows how lackluster this is If you got a crew of enough ppl to play and learn together it might be fun but otherwise just stay aways from this
hi Val
Some of the most anxiety I've ever experience playing a video game This game is intense and very challenging Definitely recommend it with friends Even at full price it's worth getting

Game bugs out when you reload into a Checkpoint at specific points Cant interact with stuff by e or you get forced to hold onto things and cant drop them It happened on multiple occasions while playing with friends

Buggy
I fucking love this game
Its one of the best survival horror games ive played but it is hard so just keep that in mind

Although still occasionally bugs out the recent updates have improved the experience overall Highly recommended to play with friends though still an absurd price tag
This shooter is more tedious and boring versus fun and scary
G T F O Get three friend OK
This is the type of game where you feel good about yourself after spending 2-3 hours learning to recognize the same artificial difficulty patterns in a stage's layout and 5 minutes on the wiki reading what directions you have to type into a terminal as a hoard is enclosing on you You can't go into a mission and expect to win because this game wants to make things as agonizingly tedious as possible 30 minute mapping runs become 2 minutes when you know what you are doing It is quite literally wasting your time to make you feel rewarded after a run The definition of artificial difficulty And you are basically forced into spending another 2 hours attempting to complete a run from the nearest checkpoint because you are close to the finish Garbage
scary
very good very scary for newcomers but the matchmaking takes too long but the game overall is great even better with friends
Good atmosphere team based shooter with nice weapons and maps
Petrifying
Zone
Too many bugs for this game Some of them are blockers For instances my friend picked up the cell and it stucked in his hand forever The puzzle design for this game is also really bad it's like pixel hunting
Updated bot behavior
You'll be hard-pressed to find a better tactical co-op FPS game it's unique and punishing with some intense challenges along the way but ultimately an extremely satisfying and rewarding game If you like killing aliens/mutants and being immersed in tactical cooperative survival horror give it a shot
la verdad que puedo decir entre y dios mio me soprendio lo bueno era yo que ustedes si tiene la plata ni se lo piensen es buenisimo lo juge solo y no saben lo que es una experiencia unica es como nose como explicarlo comprenselo

GTFO is an absolutely incredible game if you have friends
Do you like co-op shooters Are you some kind of sick masochist Do you have at least three other friends that also happen to be sick masochists Do you and said friends also happen to have an absurd amount of free time and 40 bucks to spare If you answered no to any of those questions then maybe skip this one But if you answered yes to all of them then this might be the one You know what I'm talking about That one game you think about but don't know if it even exists The one that makes you stare blank eyed at your steam library for hours only to leave you with a deep feeling of longing for something you can't put your finger on That one game that you spend your time fantasizing about while typing good games to play with friends 2022 on google but can't seem to find That game my friend might be GTFO Every system every design choice every addition and update feeds into one guiding principle Work together or die together Don't look anything up Learn Strategize Fail Struggle and know this things will go wrong relationships will be tested but you will succeed and dear reader there's no better fucking feeling than succeeding a GTFO run that you've been trying and failing for dozens of hours only to finally succeed by the skin of your teeth And then there's another feeling that comes right after the one you get when you realize it was only the third level and there are still 7 to go also for the sake of transparency the game does still have some really annoying bugs that can happen from time to time so if you're not into that you might want to skip it
Y'en a marre de ce jeu bugger de merde Les bots son bugger les missions sont bugger je voit pas l'interet si on doit se battre avec votre code fait a la rache respectez les joueurs y'en a marre C2 Cell BUG after respawn I respawn WITH 3rd Cell in HANDS FULL BUG can't do anything no switch weapon no drop nothing work the oonly thing it's to LEAVE PARTY 3rd time and wait for you friend and hope you will not get this cell in hand D2 BOTs BUG they didn't go into ALARM yeah coooool FULL BUG GAME so please GTFO
My favorite part is where your character says It's time to GTFO and you proceed to GTFO
Haven't left a review on a game in quite a while but I think GTFO deserves the attention Starting off during the Rundown 7 free weekend I was very torn on the game There were issues like hour long missions being unfinishable lots of small bugs and the gunplay felt awkward compared to a lot of other shooters However giving it another go I can confidently say this game has a lot going for it It's a very pretty and well detailed game in it's own grim way the atmosphere is absolutely unmatched there is a big emphasis on communication strategising and teamplay Took me a few tries to finish B1 with the discord folks but when it finally clicked it was infinitely satisfying to finally see that end screen like someone took a weight off my chest It's exciting it's terrifying and the sound design absolutely helps to emphasize all of that It's not quite up there with Hunt(it being effectively the golden standard for sound design in gaming but it's good enough for what the game tries to accomplish There's lots of weapons lots of tools everyone can find something they'll be comfortable with And when you think the game can't surprise you it just does It's also worth noting the networking is very VERY good There's not many games you could play with two guys from europe an aussie and an american and not even notice a single hiccup For the negatives mission objectives are still very janky Game is very inconsistent with it's objective marking system and triggers for certain things It's just something you have to get used to fog some weapons feel very underwhelming yes fog it's dreadful mission length is something not everyone will enjoy and I for certain struggle to like it They've added checkpoints with I believe this rundown which is great but you have to prepare for at least 2 hours each play session possibly uninterrupted to not annoy other people That assumes matchmaking through discord and not a premade group did I mention the fog older rundowns being effectively removed once a new one is released Would be nice to experience some of the old campaigns even without the cosmetic rewards attached to them when you're ultimately done with the current one Overall a very strong recommend Best played with pals
best hentai game
b
good luck
The game is one of the best games I've ever played Stealth gameplay is top notch as is the shooting Devs showed they were listening to their fans edited in some of their older deleted content greatly extended the play time of the game
I wasn't sold after playing for like 30 minutes the ppl are toxic and there's no tutorial also I can't read the top left mission objectives it's too small and blurry U_nEeD_tO_rEmEmBeR_cOnSoLe_CoMmAnDs opening anything is a chore I found it overly complicated the vids sell the game very differently then what it is fair warning make sure you play under 2 hours so you can get your money back like it did

NEW REVIEW All right I can say the devs did make the game way more playable now I'll analyze all the negatives back and check if they got resolved list The game isn't as buggy as last time but I didn't check the checkpoint item bug yet hoping it's not there anymore The netcode still makes enemies glitch sometimes but it's way more rare now The combat is still meh but without the enemies glitching it can be handled The stealth is way more consistent you can be sure to be heard only if the enemy is glowing or pulsing really hard if not enemies will not even hear a friendly getting bonked two meters away I still hate the stamina system There's no excuse in that one eccept understanding that some pro players were probably abusing infinite stamina to fly around list I'll analyze the neutrals too to give an updated feeling of the game list As the game is still for the hardcore players opening up the previous rundowns you can really see those are way more easier and the difficulty doesn't spike as hard as the previous rundows did The game still looks ok and the performance was ok too I guess they did fix the strutters list ORIGINAL REVIEW I'm giving the game a thumbs down just because the game quality has been dropping rundown to rundown If it wasn't for that it would have been a thumbs up to view as a meh I've been playing sporadically since rundown 4 The review has been written duing rundown 7 h1]Positives[/h1 list The game idea isn't overused Trying to make a coop game wasn't common at release date a stealth one is even more unique The atmosphere and the feeling of the locations you visit are really well made a very spooky game indeed The enemies graphical feedback is great the pieces flying away after shooting an enemy and seeing its skeleton underneath is very cool indeed Too bad you can't see it after the combat is over see negatives list h1]Negatives[/h1 list The game has been getting buggier and buggier with each rundown and the bugs don't seem to get fixed The same bugs I've found in rundown 4 are still in rundown 7 There's even some new ones like fog even the bad one not showing static lighting totally disappearing leaving maps in pitch-black darkness or story items getting bugged after a checkpoint As a session in this game can last VERY long and getting one of these bugs is game ending you probably won't feel keep playing the game The netcode is horrible even with 40ms ping you'll be able to see the monsters teleporting around In this last rundown it seems the problem is partially fixed but it keeps happening sometimes The combat even if it's inevitable it's not a stealth only game doesn't feel right and hasn't been polished at all since I've started playing There are many things that contribute to this from the guns recoil feeling raw to the aftermath of a fight being only some red puddles on the floor imagine looking at the great gibbing system after an alarm The stealth feels weird The range where you can be heard bashing an enemy seems to be inconsistent from it must have been the wind to guess the whole room will be alerted now Many features added to the game each rundown Infection fogs respawning enemies the stamina system seems to be making it boring more than hardcore see neutrals for more info list h1]Neutrals[/h1 These points can be freely ignored You can see these as subjective opinions list The game is aiming at an hardcore audience and I guess I'm not part of that Every session feels too long and dragged on having to open multiple alerted doors going slowly room to room leaving aside hazards and complex enemy placements just to take a keycard backtrack the whole thing and noticing the door you'll have to open is a class IX alert type I didn't place this in the negatives because everything listed has to be expected and it's the experience the devs want to give to the players The game is simply not for me For the graphics the game has nothing special it runs bad There's very little performance gain setting everything to low I didn't place this in the negatives because I classify my pc as low-medium for 2022 standards but still there are games looking way better with better performance than this list
Missions are way too long Way way too long It takes easily 2 hours for 1 mission especially if you dare do secondary objectives And all that progress is lost if you die

Ich habe dieses Spiel an einem regnerischen Sonntag begonnen zu spielen leider war das Wetter nicht das einzige was mir den Tag vermiest hatte Dieses Spiel besitzt ein grosses Potential allerdings sind die Missionen so etwas von und nervig dass selbst ein Schimpanze dieses besser gestaltet Ich rate jedem von diesem Spiel ab der wert auf abwechslungsreiche Missionen und gute programmierte KI legt denn beides ist hier leider nicht vorhanden Leveldesign 3/10 Waffenauswahl 5/10 Missionen 100/10 KI 2/10

Tough game need to be on discord for coordinated teamwork Repetitive
We need rundown 8
shit devs decent game
The Devs need to make it so you can disable the head bobbing HUD bobbing whatever is doing that it makes me super nauseated otherwise a fun game
Not worth the 40 dollar tag but a great game overall
yes
I threw my PC against a brick wall and ran over it with a Ford Mustang I would gladly do it again 9/10 the hordes ripped me apart like a gazelle and a pride of lions
Bad game terrible ghapics
later levels are fucked
Macht richtig bock und die ist richtig unheimlich und So solls
Rundown 7 100
Good game not worth 40 though so get it on a sale.Also too much fog

The developers are lazy af There are tons of bugs and and it will take months for them to fix because they are taking vacations Some bugs are minor but some bugs are unplayable where some players literally cannot shoot for the rest of the game Most of these bugs can be fixed easily fixed proven by how the modding community fixed a lot of them The Devs said that they are working on optimizing the game but it gets worse every rundown to the point that some people literally have 20 fps The modding community produces a lot more content than the dev as it will take another 9 months for new rundown to come out The maps that are currently available rundown 7 are boring as hell Yes those maps are hard but they are not fun to play again after you have beaten them They have proven that they can produce maps that are hard and fun at the same time but they decided to focus on other aspects of the game such as story and visual while disregarding everything else Fix game plz
nope
los ninos hongos no son buenos
Harder than anything ive ever played but fun as hell
this is more like GAFR get a fuckin refund.it seems pretty cool looks cool but way to grindy for me
i shidded my pants during the first rundown and now there is more things to make me piss as well very cool
juego de mrd
I love this game so much I wish that more people played it Sometimes the guns can feel a little clunky but that is my only complaint The atmosphere and the horror aspects are amazing
I got this game for free but it is more trash than every game you would find on roblox The gameplay is boring and the meachanics are really bad The only good thing about this game are the people that I played with the rest is just pure bs
Some of my favorite gaming moments include playing this game with my buddies the game is a stealth game that then becomes a high octane scream fest when the monsters wake up the horror elements don't feel too overbearing and the theme is good although the answer to some of the questions of lore can usually be chopped up to game mechanics rather than deep lore The Devs thought of gameplay first and lore second which is fine with me because the gameplay is good I only recommend if you have 3 Buddies or a consistent play group to play with I had a lousy experience with using the GTFO discord expectations are just hard to match with randoms its an FPS Co-op that is punishing hard and fun Watch some videos and see if it is for you if you want a FPS Co-op but not wanting as hardcore of a game I recommend something like Deep Rock Galactic over 120 hours I have ran into some bugs but for the most part most levels I haven't had any issues most bugs can be fixed by exiting the game and hopping right back in if you aren't the host if you are the host then
Good
I don't know but I feel relaxed while playing this
great cooperative spooky strategic fun
First time playing 5 hours straight with a friend 10/10 gameplay man Like a Mix of doom Alien halo and deadspace F**king incredible Even more fun with friends as the bots are a little goofy but smart enough to follow you
Nice break from all the kiddies playing call of duty similar in difficulty to ready or not or Escape from tarkov 100 recommend playing with a group tho the bots are pretty stupid
yes
Solid game
Great potential but levels are way too long and you can't save your progress mid-level Spent 2.5 hours trying to complete the second level it's only the second level so ideally it shouldn't be too hard right died at the end and had to restart from a checkpoint that was so far back I enjoy the gameplay but demanding such long hours for a single play session is just insane this early in the game
An sich ein richtig gutes Spiel ABER Nach dem Respawn kann man mit nichts mehr interagieren oder hat ein Item in der Hand welches weder benutzt noch abgelegt werden kann Mit solchen Bugs leider unspielbar
a bit difficult but I like it
End of the day its just not fun or rewarding

If you like the atmosphere of abandoned underground complexes and like slow methodical games then this is a no brainer
Intense
Yes
these raids are suppa cooool
very pog
This is a cool different twist to a FPS survival game with hard objectives and real crazy encounters and they really hit that horror atmosphere The different monsters look cool and they have a nice variety of weapons The best part of it all is it's not as simple as press E to open the door some doors you need to unlock by doing codes and using actual teamwork from all I feel like to me it's a 8.5/10
Very hard and very rewarding
Can't have sex with the scout
The game is incredibly well done great concept and executed perfectly Why the negative review then Match making It's non existent so you basically have to do it via the old way through discord and find a group of competent people I'm not that sweaty to go do that Just give me fucking match making without plebs Communication is key to this game and plying with plebs guarantees you will not get past the first 2 maps if you play in a friend group Amazing game get it you wont regret it If you play solo sadly its just not there or you to enjoy it unless you go to discord
Played only in VR with the mod Amazing Nothing can describe sheer fuckery that this game brings with 4 people in VR The lighting the music the atmosphere is pure terror 10/10
yes
I want to love this game so bad but each mission takes FAR too long If done without screwing up they're usually almost an hour which is already pretty ridiculous when you need to get 4 people together to truly take advantage of the tactical game play However if you screw up even once youll either fail the mission outright or get taken to a checkpoint that will set you back at least 20-30 minutes This leads to immense frustration and a feeling like your time isnt being respected If missions were 20-30 minutes long this would be a fantastic drop-in co-op shooter But as it is I cant recommend the headache this will give you and your friends
d
not a fan
Ye I like this game
rnt
From the main menu to the game itself the UX and UI is just awful and confusing The game just felt like someone wanted everything to be overly artistic/spooky with no function in mind
yee
love
Good game
good GAME RUNS BETTER THEN MINECRAFT
The best game you could play with others
A proper hardcore FPS focused on stealth and co-op the developers did an excellent job in terms of optimization and level design The game is really hard and unforgiving so you will die a lot But the game is as hard as your strategy is bad if you have a well-matched team your progress will be much easier But here I come to the flaw in the beauty of this game the game doesn't have matchmaking so if you don't have a lot of friends who would play it with you you probably won't get very far There is however the possibility to use the official Discord where you will find a lot of active players but without slightly advanced English you probably won't enjoy it as much because as I wrote the game is strongly based on cooperation and communication between players is a priority here So to get back to rating this game The game will serve you an atmosphere that can be cut and locations that even the Metro series can envy As for the weapons I was a bit disappointed here in a few ways some weapons have very strange recoil and reloading With some weapons the reloading is either too fast or the animation is so strange it just doesn't look very nice there are also relatively glaring errors when holding the weapon for example that the weapon levitates a few centimeters from the hand but such errors you'll notice your teammates more than your own character As far as bugs are concerned I haven't come across any in the game that would actually break the game So if you are looking for some good Co-Op action with your friends and you like the FPS genre and stealth then you really don't have to worry about this title
Ai are horribly stupid but other than that good game
Game's not for everyone but it knows it It's in a niche and it works to be the best game it can be within it and I think it's a damn good time It borders on you must hate yourself difficulty in the later stages of most of the rundowns but the atmosphere tension and feel of the moment to moment gameplay especially when coordinating with friends is just superb and scratches a certain kind of itch I only have two nitpicks 1 Look I don't care how b]hArDcOrE[/b the game is bots shouldn't cause friendly fire damage No game has it work like that and for good reason I shouldn't be punished just because the AI decided shooting through me to get to a shooter I was taking care of with a bat was the winning idea I have other criticisms of the bots like wishing you could have them hold a position etc but honestly just turning their friendly fire off will shut me up it's really the only thing I care about 2 PleAASE let us leave permanent marks on the map that we can manually clear if we want to like PAYDAY 2's preplanning My short-term memory is ass so being able to plan routes and marking items we can't carry now but might want to double back with later etc it just seems like such a slam dunk for the tactical gameplay this already pushes I'm not sure why it's not an inclusion Anyway Pick it up when it goes on sale and see if it's for you if it is you'll have a hell of a time I'd strongly suggest doing so with a band of friends though
wish i had this game for more than a few days it was the best game ive ever played other than minecraft devs do not take that lightly if anyone has a steam key my birthday is 8/11/2022 M,D,Y i highly recommend this game for anyone wanting a great survival horror game that makes you fell like you will die in a 2 seconds if you don't keep your cool GTFO 10/10
did they fix the retarded choice of double vision/blurryness on all text Or at least make it into a choice you can change in settings
GTFO sert bir hayatta kalma oyunu istisna haricinde yeni odalardaki uyur halde oluyor ses burun sessizce ve laf misali gelen bir yandan yeri ve vurmamaya olabiliyor Bir de en son yirmi dakika o gelmiyor derken itiraz etmesini ve daha bir alternatif bekiyorsunuz ama nafile tek devre kadar hayatta umut etmek de olay nedir Ne var bu Dark Umbrella laboratuvarlarda ki ben de bilmiyorum de istiyor oyun Arada bir megafondan birileri size bir ama genel olarak olan biteni terminallerden mesajlardan ve ses buluyorsunuz Ancak gidermek bekletmek olmuyor pek o geliyorsunuz zaman Ama zevkli oynayabilirsiniz
just get it it's worth
A really fun team game for a group of 2-4 players If you have less than 4 don't worry the AI aren't terrible and thankfully don't really trigger enemies Its a pretty spooky game and with its everchanging level system it has infinite re-playability Plus once you get good with a kit you build it feels really good to play
The best kind of stressful Really good mechanics and game-play
Cant sex the sleepers
oooga boooga very scary berry
Game is good Challenging survival horror coop
A game that really makes you focus in on teamwork communication and organisation Scratches that same itch that games like XCOM do When you successfully pull off those overwatch trap moments feels good Definitely need to play with other people though the bots are.not great Friends or with randoms is usually fine
Buenardo si sos masoca

Maybe like a mix between Splinter Cell and Resident Evil but 4 player It's a very satisfying time if you can bend to the will of the game The excessively long missions anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 1/2 hours and extreme patience needed along with the coordination and FPS skills required is not something for everyone but it's a super unique and interesting experience if you can handle it It's got a bit of an intense learning curve mainly concerning how far you can push your stealth prowess and how well you don't fight and maintain your resources The gun practice will almost always be panicked trial by fire The game will laugh as it drops unforeseen events in your face and it very well might make the level you've spent 2 hours learning incompletable and that's just something you have to be prepared for silly as it sounds It's one hell of a beast to tame but it's a blast
Difficult but rewarding
bu oyun gayet tut grafiklere az da olsa zor ama oynamak eylenceli ve dolduruyor ama gibi hatta botlarla bile oyun kolay yani diyorsun ki bu oyun ne ya kolay intro seviyesi 2 sn one lan AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH kolay bir oyun
Oyun herkese tavsiye ederim oyun grafikleri gayet da gayet fakat oyunu 4 oyun zor oyune bence yeterli ama olarak

Jeu bien dur dur je recommande seulement si vous aimez vous faire mal

fun game but you need friends to really have fun
Entrei achando que era e descobri que Quem Dark Souls perto disso joguei com mais dois amigos e todos terminaram o jogo a beira de um surto Recomendo
Yes
Overall wasn't a bad game But If you are not a Pro of this game then good luck If you are not the speed runner tier player then good luck They do make some adjustments for the non-Pro players still there are not much almost none eras for mistakes The first few re-runs ya ok we haven't understood the map and item locations Few more re-runs yap this is basically trolling the players

Just done glitch into a wall and itll be good time
Cool game
es un muy buen juego
left 4 dead stuck on hardcore mode with a dead space skin slapped on They traded what some may call difficulty over fun This will just make you angry Either it be the game itself or angry at yourself or your teammates
I have done nothing to progress towards the game in 69 minutes Fun Game 10/10
nice
GUTES_SPIEL
este juego es extremadamente dificil pero muy bueno las ambientaciones me encantan lo unico que no me gusta es que no es nada intuitivo si no sabes que tienes que hacer te atoras durante horas lo que si es que si o si tienes que jugarlo con 3 amigos mas si no el juego es exesivamente dificil mas de lo que ya esta jugando 4 players PD para leer las letras es muy dificil por que se ven un poco bnorrorsas si mejoraran eso estaria genial
hella fun little spooky

ta bien y
I am loving this game a lot me and my BF are playing it a lot and having a good time If I could make any sort of game suggestion for the devs it would be to be able to tell the AI to stand still or stay behind Often times they can ruin a whole sneak mission by running ahead and pointing out crates lockers and doors Just having the ability to take them in and out of the game is wonderful But Just saying Stay here would be magical
Gra dla te gre
C'est un jeu qu'il faut tryhard C'est dur et la est cool il y a un serveur officiel Discord pour jouer avec des gens qui connaissent les Maps et peuvent vous aider Le lore est incroyable mais super complexe Un des meilleur jeu co-op mais encore une fois extremement dur
there's nothing really like this game anywhere the ultimnate PVE experience match making is a bug bera but the game is brillaint
Me and all my friends bought this after days of convincing them and it was totally worth it It took us 4 hours to finish the first level and it is some of the best time I've had in gaming in a while We completely forgot the little egg thing after scanning it and didn't know we had to bring it to the extraction point so we had to go back twice causing us to be constantly laughing and on edge because there was 12 dudes waiting to fuck you every 9 seconds We all died 10/10
I enjoyed it so much and I got something to say to devs Can you release the next rundown faster It takes too long for a new rundown to release And also There should be another ways to get cosmetics except from completing rundown Those are not enough for me actually
Gra nie jasna nie intuicyjna W grze chodzimy po mapie a sama gra nie obsypuje nas podpowiedziami i bardziej proste komunikaty czasem sprzeczne z tym co mamy Czasem dostajemy komunikat aby drzwi do strefy tam powiedzmy do A4 Szkoda po drodze aby je trzeba 3 inne rzeczy nie nigdzie opisane Czekanie na ludzi do lobby aby razem tutaj do takiego czekania na pustyni deszcz No tak jakby nie i tak samo jest z w tej grze Samo strzelanie bardzo dziwnie wykonane bronie a-normalne odrzuty i sposoby odrzutu samej broni chodzi o zabicie lub tego czym to jest w grze to jest to nie przez strzelania lub bardziej ten recoil/odrzut broni Jest to o opanowania a sama gra delikatnie jest Przechodzimy powoli aby nie ale jak robimy to 15 i zaczynamy z nimi to okazuje nawet te potwory nie problemu W opisie gry horda obudzona nie do opanowania lub po prostu piekielnie i bardziej to po cichu Po czym okazuje jak kura bez i do wszystkiego i bez problemu da Gra niedopracowana bez a nudna albo w sumie nie wiem nawet czy jest bo to tak bardzo nie jasne
Very interesting horror game Need to play really well as a team especially in the lower levels
this game is like hard drugs just cant get enough
super fun co-op game
Things in the dark slap and squelch So did my college dormmates bedroom at 2 am
Graphics are great Gameplay is great The lore is great And the overall game is great Although it is extremely unforgiving as I spent almost 4 hours trying to complete one level it's still very fun
Fun game but i feel like it should be on sale more
scarier than dead by daylight
Intense encounters brutal resource management hit the ground running
Its not the best tbh for 40 I expect more quality and game modes and better multiplayer and just overall game play But this is not that so not worth the 40 price tag imo So if you really want this game you should wait till its on sale for 20 or less
Great SUPER HARD game will take u time to do things me and my friends r at 31 hours and were at the fourth stage now u should definitely buy this game if u have atleast 1 more guy willing to buy it super fun and hard
I love the game it's incredibly atmospheric the gameplay is easy to learn and hard to master and the community on discord has been very inviting and accepting of new players and forgiving of mistakes and all of this wrapped up in a very SCP-esque style of lore with and air of mystery that makes you ask.what the hell happened here how ever buyer beware this is distinctly not a casual game It's hard punishingly hard and not just from a skill sense Single missions can take multiple hours and when trying to go optionally for 100 on missions you can be on the same mission for anywhere between 2-4 hours with no way to save progress without finishing a mission to completion so if you have commitments and aren't able to put aside time for this game it's probably not for you how ever this is not a negative a review just fair warning for those times that I've sunk those hours in have been some of the most thrilling and nail biting moments of the past decade of gaming
When you previously inserted f.e battery into a generator and you died you will respawn holding that battery and you cannot drop it by any means so you can't do shit unless you restart the entire level This issue is present from the launch and is still not fixed what a joke
Serious lack of content and game breaking bugs Certain levels are unplayable No acceptable fix yet for nearly 2 months from the latest content drop Even though I love this game I still have to give it a negative
Four dudes in a dark room with a bunch of monsters that have vagina for a face something could happen We may never know But we do know is we have loose ones we have tight ones we have small and big ones And things could happen The tentacle monsters make me feel like I'm in a bad hentai My friends make me feel like I'm in a good hentai Me playing alone makes me notice how loud the clap of my ass cheeks can alert the enemies it ruined the purpose of a stealth mission The bots make me feel useless like a 3-inch penis like the one I have Trying matchmaking is like asking two dudes trying to scissor each other The Lock Melter is so silent that is like having an orgasm at an Opera These fogs makes me know how an Asian feels like and I'm Asian and already colorblinded Honest Review this game makes my parents want me and my waifu body pillow to GTFO of their basement
Too much trial and error lack of checkpoints Repetitive boring rng level layouts Uninspired story Only fun if you have a group of 4 absolutely garbage with bots or solo Get it on sale or for free
GOOD GAME
Binged Rundown 7 Only got to mission C1 in 31 hours Big struggles Good game Git gud
To preface coop games are my jam and I'm always interested in ones that have new challenges to offer As far as a coop games go the only thing about GTFO that bothers me is the uncertainty of whether or not there will be more games like it in the future It has teamwork critical thinking pacing intrigue and legitimate non-contrived difficulty It's a game that tests patience reflexes memory and strategy Weapons and equipment are all available from the beginning each designed with unique qualities and no upgrade nonsense Not that I dislike upgrading things in games but GTFO for the type of game it is gets it right by letting players try every weapon and tool for what it is meant to be without making them work up to the best version The game is effectively grind-free in every respect allowing you to find your knack very quickly and get straight to the part where you escape dungeons with your friends An actual criticism of the game is less a critique and more of a reason some people I know don't/can't play the game b]The playtime can be quite long.[/b For some people this is a reasonable deal breaker To put it into perspective When you first start playing you'll need to budget 3-4 hours to spend figuring out an entire dungeon especially if you're not coached through by a veteran On some levels you're likely to fail at the halfway point or towards the end 2-3 hours in Then you'll have to start it all over the next time you get your friends together schedules dependent You will get quicker and more efficient with a bit of playtime And that's where I understand some people have issues with getting into this game It's no EVE Online it's no Warframe it's not even as time consuming as Arma 3 but it will have long sessions especially when you first start If longer play sessions are more of a positive for you go for it If you like what you see in the trailers gameplay videos and whatnot then get it you'll like it That's the game
Great game just wish it had more variety for long-term play
This game is super hard super fun and looks amazing If you want to play a super hard game with your friends then play this One wrong step and you wake up an entire room of full of big men and small men that want to lick you Game is really fun and I 100 recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge
Fun and thrilling game Very difficult to play solo a group of friends is more or less mandatory for this game if you want to complete all the levels in a rundown You may be able to complete the easier levels with just bots but it becomes impossible in later levels where you have to coordinate terminals with another player This game does not modify the difficulty when you start a level solo it's been designed to be completed with a full group of human players You do have access to bots yet they can't sequence terminals with you They are essentially walking sentry turrets I believe this game would be more accessible to a wider audience if the difficulty scaled to the number of human players in a level As of writing this has not occurred Update This game is still difficult yet fun and I continue to come back to it with a group of friends every so often The maps can take up to an hour to complete if not more Previous rundowns will be re-released as alternate variations of what existed in the past This is great because the game is lacking variation in content bringing back these old rundowns will be great for my group of friends as it's all new to us All in all great challenging FPS with a dark foreboding atmosphere
1 hour to beat A1 Now I am 13 hours in and still haven't beaten B1 LOVE IT
Red Light Green Light in the dark with some glow sticks
good game for gamers
This Game is an Awesome mixture of skill and teamwork Most games that have teamwork in them can be beaten easily without the team part not this game This game absolutely requires teamwork in order for the average player to be successful This is because ONE mess-up has HUGE consequences and when every bullet and percent of health matter messing up is ruinous Definitely a must-play for anyone who enjoys a hard and rewarding FPS game
Fun playing with a squad Amazing game gotta have a lot of knowledge for maps The infected are pog too
Throbbers ahead 10/10
Great game terrible UI but a great game
This game's title says it all work together or die Build complimentary loadouts and develop different skills or you will die Very fun though
This game does not respect the players time It needs basic functionality such as a save system or difficulty settings
This game has a lot of potential I really hope they just take a couple months to fix all the bugs
Spooktastic
Game good Get friends
Jogo muito bom de habilidade e trabalho em equipe Esse jogo te a real de perigo onde os inimigo fortes e vcs deve saber combate-los se morte certa Infelizmente ele para um publico mais hardcore pois ele frusta muito jogadores casuais Comprei o jogo com mais 4 amigo e com 2 completas um dropou e os outros 3 que sobraram se frustam quando fracassamos uma que levou horas Entendo a deles se o jogo tivesse um modo com save point e pudesse sair de uma partida para em outro dia acredito que o publico seria maior Sem falar que parece que o jogo quer que vc fracasse algumas vezes aprender oque para fazer pois ele explica algumas coisas importantes As partidas muito longas conseguem te entreter do o fim Ele mescla stealth com combates de arrepiar os cabelos do e estou falando de musiquinha orquestrada like final boss falo de real de perigo e adrenalina Por que eu gosto desse jogo na parte do usar comandos de linux para procurar itens ou pesquisar sobre o objetivo linda muito da lore do jogo acredito que boa Enfim se vc e seus amigos gostam de jogos pode ir na que o jogo bom Agora se vc sabe se seus amigos assim melhor pensar duas vezes
This Game is one of the best Games I have played other than the fact that I would say im very like average at the game so not too good but not too shit at it i really enjoy this game i would recommend this game to any of me m8's who want very i would say tactical stealth recourse management and Co-Op a very grand game and ran very well on my old setup meaning optimization is very well done
Not that fun Better with friends though
creepy af
it is good sometimes their can be bugs but great game
like sticking your hands in a food processor EDIT 23-11-2022 devs are bringing back all past rundowns too and there's lots of new people joining the community discord
Big guy here
Echt hart P

i like this game but my friends dont so i cant play it
Full of glitches repetitive enemies and gameplay Fix the fucking melee attacks going through walls and floor because it makes the game fucking stupid Maybe less adding fucking hats and streaming and more working on the game Also love the fact devs removed the checkpoints so when you die at the end after 2 hours in mission you get to do it all again
This game is stressful AF and you are a superior human being if you can handle the mental stress this game gives you without breaking The content this game provides is astounding A great purchase for sure As my one friend said This game is hard but fun that's what she said greekphilosophy24
Good
very yum
wanna kill your time here
Stealth Horror kinda Shooter immense co-operation is needed fun as hell if you have the right team i actually bought it for a friend and had a blast
nice
yeah it's pretty cool
I have no communications skills 10/10
very many technical difficulty
Instances where the objective item will stay in a players hand after being turned in and that player is just not able to play or interact with anything else until we restart the entire mission
This game has horror sneaking shooting creepy creatures etc well worth the money the quests change every few months
The hardest thing is to get 3 more people to play the game
nice
Great game
good
epic game You need friends to play it with and it has a high skill curve If you don't have some friends that are willing to pick it up with you than the discord is a great place to go You can play with fellow players of your skill or the veteran players who are always really helpful in teaching sharing strats and skills
una completa de este juego de haberlo jugado un rato y analizarlo definitivamente me encanto la que le dieron de suspenso y mucha y el realismo en cuanto a combate y administrar las balas los botiquines es un juego en el cual tardas un rato considerable en adaptarte y no morir como yo actualmente xd que aun no se me da tan bien pero si quieres salir de los shooters de zombies o monstruos y esas cosas mas aparte experimentar un tipo de terror distinto pues definitivamente es tu juego me gusto mucho que desde un inicio te dejan bien en claro que eres otro prisionero mas y que tu vida no tiene realmente un valor importante para la gente que te a ese lugar y es algo que no se suele ver en otros juegos de esta ahora es verdad lo que se dice de la dificultad de este juego porque definitivamente es complicado y muuuuchas veces pero bien me parece que llegado a cierto punto superar las misiones aun estando solo porque los bots que puedes agregar a tu equipo cuando no estas emparejado con otros jugadores si ayudan aunque sea un poco xd que si realmente lo recomiendo y puedo decir que me gusto mucho porque entretiene y cumple con lo promete c
honestly it's just a wave shooter with extra steps game trailers make it look like a scary survival horror but all it is when i played it was stealthing around and beating to death everything with a club and occasionally waiting for a wave to end to progress to the next area
The game is pretty good WHEN IT WORKS besides that its a complete waste of space The glitches are incredible and numerous The constant bug of if your holding a objective and go through a checkpoint if you reset welp too bad that item is now stuck inside you This has been a bug for some time and the devs have done nothing to fix it thanks lads the price tag is just not worth it The AI ah yes the AI take a house plant burn it then you might have smarter AI God forbid you tell them to go up a ladder with an objective item because it just wont happen I mean it it is physically not possible And if you are going for a double kill near a bot he will instantly open fire screwing you Also AI don't interact with enemies in any way Cant trigger scouts or alert enemies Its a good idea but I would allow bots to trigger these entities if the player puts them in a bad spot I would just make the AI more cautious and maybe add some commands to help bots move Like for example a move to position button would be nice The enemies are pretty cool despite how many times we see the same enemy Like for the love of god mix it up and I don't mean with big guys shooters or scouts I mean maybe give us like 5 types of standard enemy that have different strengths and weaknesses and the weapons reflect that Examples for enemies Sure the classic enemy current deaf enemies that are extremely powerful if triggered Armored enemies that are in low numbers but are strong Add mini enemies that are harder to see and can provide a good jump scare Add more flying enemies that land periodically maybe to eat or something There just doesn't appear to be any effort going into the game at this time And the devs are adding skins instead of working on the bugs That is what you call a red flag The weapons also don't really matter There are a few with heat scopes that are pretty cool but besides that they are just guns Maybe add a grenade launcher that has only like 3 rounds Or a noob tube There are so many chances to add weapons that just aren't rifles with a scope Equipment could also be added and tweaked like maybe something like the mine layer but for some form of electric shock trap that doesn't kill but knocks out enemies for like 30 seconds That would add a weapon that could roll enemies but you run the risk of being attacked from behind or unexpectedly The perk system is fine and doesn't really need to be changed although having some more wouldn't hurt The story is alright nothing special There needs to be some variety in the missions Like maybe a vehicle section where you go on a vehicle and defend from enemies trying to get aboard This would be another opportunity to use flying enemies Maybe at the end of the drive a huge mega monster stops the vehicle dead in its tracks and the players are thrown from it and wake up to see the monster slowly moving through the dark tunnel towards them and a fight ensues There are so many interesting missions that could be worked on because the enemies are so scary and mysterious It would be smart to include almost mini cut scenes like mentioned in the vehicle idea but sadly I don't think anything like this will ever happen There is so much potential for this game but unfortunately with the current price staff and work ethic I don't see it happening any time soon What would be the best course of action for this game First the bugs need to be squashed Mainly level breaking first obviously then move on to AI related Next some depth in the levels I.E not the repetitive design present right now Next improve the AI to make it better for single player After that its really up to the designers I have a few recommendations but the best course of action is to ask the people who play the game not just 1 person Price 3/10 29.99 max Game play 5/10 when not buggy 7/10 Game play loop 4/10 Story 3/10 voice acting 10/10 amazing Enemies 6/10 An attempt to add more has been made Level design 5/10 Most levels are linear but some space the player out Fun 8/10 3/10 Game becomes way less fun because of the repetitive nature of the game Updates 3/10 Most updates are low quality Attention to detail 4/10 Single-player accessibility 2/10 This game is meant for real people so no surprise its not optimized for single-player however this is horrible AI Worth it Not at the current price wait for a sale of around 20-30 bucks but if you don't have at least 1 person to join you don't get it until its 15 or under
This game is awesome kudos to the devs for adding matchmaking and bots because my friends are to scared to play this lol
Ist cool
Very fun and challenging make sure to have friends to play with though
Top top top
men
I have no ammo half the time But the cool thing is it gets updated all the time
poggy
Each update seems to introduce features that the vast majority of the player base seems to find either frustrating respawn rooms unenjoyable stamina or takes away from the learning curve hammers now have 5x stagger and can 1 shot stun all giant enemies Let's go through some history R1 was release The game was spooky at best but it was fun R2 released a 3 months later It stepped up the game's mechanics introducing infection and environmental hazards like spitters It also introduced the E Tier levels where difficulty is at it's peak Great rundown though quite dated now R3 releases just 2 1/2 months later Referred to as baby's first R2 as it was basically just R2 but the levels were easier Massive downgrade in quality of content The rundown was out for 4 months and was so bad that it spawned the GTFO Modding community because it was so unenjoyable R4 releases and introduces optional difficult content except it's not optional and progression is actually locked behind this content so they weren't able to actually make the optional content hard like it was promised to be This update also introduced the precision system which allows different guns to deal different headshot multipliers They used this system to nerf every single gun in the game by setting all of the guns below 1.0x headshot damage Cool R5 releases and adds an enemy that can be created in quite literally 30 seconds with no interesting new content but serves as effectively a level pack as a rundown does Respawn sacks were shoehorned in to try to force a new game play mechanic that prevents backtracking The mechanic's tell is that there are cocoons on the ceiling There is no audio or visual effect tied to these to suggest that they respawn enemies and new players often think that the enemies respawning is actually a bug and not an intended feature This rundown was out for 8 months You read that correctly R6 releases and adds a stamina system that the community simply tolerates because it's impossible to enjoy and doesn't truly solve the issues that it was meant to solve It simply makes the game play slower which doesn't make it play any better The skill ceiling of melee was massively gutted in this rundown see solo gameplay of R5 vs R6 for melee comparison Sledgehammer becomes a mindless instant stunlock monster but not very great against small enemies Somehow this is backwards from what it was prior Broken checkpoint system added that bricks runs and might as well not be introduced until it's actually working properly Massive enemy position desync bug added in a hotfix massively complained about but not reverted This is important bug introduced January 27th 2022 via hotfix R7 releases as a free weekend The enemy position desync bug has not properly been acknowledged or addressed in any capacity Steam reviews plummet with free weekenders complaining about bugs most of which are actually long standing bugs and getting objective items stuck in their hands ending their run The developers finally after many months publicly address the enemy desync issue and checkpoint objective stuck bugs that make the game extraordinarily unfun to play before they go on vacation So where does this leave us The game has long since started to go down hill long ago New features added are not great often unfinished or straight up broken host migration If you couldn't tell by my hours I obviously enjoy this game a lot more than I should It might be worth mentioning that a lot of my hours are actually just me on the rundown screen with VSCode open creating custom modded content to not have to tolerate very lengthy content droughts This game has an absolutely incredible core structure but the devs seem to introduce interesting mechanics in the most unfun possible ways R7 is probably even their best rundown to date in terms of quality of content but the state of the game itself is absolutely at it's worst it's ever been since public release I want to but I can not recommend GTFO in the current state At this point I blow through their 6 months worth of content in a day or two depending on how much attention to the lore I give then exclusively mod the game for the rest of my play time
trigger discipline assholes i dont want anybody getting shot
Despite the stupid name its a very fun and intense game If you enjoy heavy and i mean HEAVY stealth/horde mechanics this is the game for you Not too many bugs devs seem to listen and update the game often
Man I wish Gasmasks were real Previous review aside my opinion has changed now after 100 hours or playtime Don't get me wrong this is still quite a cool game with a lot of potential but the issues outweigh any positive outlooks of this game severely u]But here are some of the positive aspects of the game:[/u The overall idea is cool as hell and seems to work well when nothing stands in it's way The lore is interesting and despite my love/hate relationship with it I'm still heavily invested in it Some of the people I met in matchmaking were really cool and I feel bad for not playing more often with them maybe I should've And the main weapons not the rundown specific ones feel very good most of the time and when all goes well the combat is kinda thrilling The soundtrack and ambience is fun to listen to like seriously just listen to the combat and apex combat theme But despite all of that theres a lot of issues with this game like a lot So why don't we start with the most obvious one h1 The Bugs h1 This game is such a buggy mess that I never managed to beat Rundown 7's C3 expedition because of it Just a taste of the kind of garbage I had to deal with was the game freezing mid joining a session after a different bug prevented me from interacting with anything after reloading a checkpoint there and that was just C3 b]don't get me started on the other expeditions I played[/b Actually why don't we get started on the other expeditions aswell A1 while I was hosting the checkpoint security door didn't open for the rest of the team causing them to leave B1 heard it had severe frame rate drops and I occasionally got them too B2 one of the bots got stuck in a spot between crates you specifically have to jump into which bots can't causing him to be stuck there forever B3 The fog turbine didn't repell any fog after reloading a checkpoint yeah have fun with that one C1 Sometimes the cells needed for this mission get stuck on your hands after the checkpoint preventing you from dropping it using your guns and interacting with anything in the room C2 inserting 5 cells sometimes causes the fog to disappear prematurely if it's not a bug then it's a bad design choice if all the other fog removal moments had a soundcue playing beforehand unlike there h1 The matchmaking h1 It's horrible You get stuck in queue for at least 5-10 minutes and when you do get a match most of them leave instantly causing the rest to follow suit which is weir since they waste just as much time in queue than you and forget setting any specific options such as a specific expedition language or whether you want everyone to use mic or not because then you're average time is gonna be at least 30-45 minutes Also it sometimes throws you out of your queue without explaining why which is nice Worst of it all is that the devs and the community are fully aware of this and opted for their alternative solution which is to join their discord convienently placed on the menu aswell and use the lfg function there While I never used it because why would I if they could also just fix their damn matchmaking instead it's complete bs since you're now forced to ask there wait then add people interested to your friendslist then setup a lobby invite said people and play since the copy lobby id function only works when you are in said lobby already and is also hidden in the settings once you copied it only an issue in matchmake games though funnily enough I have this theory that the matchmake is purposely made this bad to advertise their hellsite of a discord which I also heard questionable things about But that's just a personal theory h1 The Bots h1 If you don't find a game or refuse to join a discord as a horrible alternative to the matchmake you have bots On one hand they're smart as in moving into the room you're in so you can close the door if you stand close to the button standing still during pulsating sleepers even though they don't trigger sleepers at all but on the other hand they are some of the dumbest pricks when it comes to the core of the game Here's a few examples They always move in front of you causing you to shoot them in combat and blocking your line of sight in stealth They shoot in bursts leaving enemies alive sometimes that way while still depleting their ammo supply quickly like that They noclip through doors causing them to get stuck behind it unless you open the door or walk far away enough for them to trigger their noclip They revive you mid combat usually causing them to die by the sleepers themselves They randomly decide when to melee and when to shoot allthough they don't trigger sleepers in stealth when they do that h1 The connection issues h1 The connection issues in the game are also weird since everything is tied to the host That means you get horrible lag and desync without being able to tell since the game doesn't show ping or any connection issues if you get any Furthermore it can cause hits from you and enemies to be delayed rubberbanding diconnecting prematurely and my favourie sniper melee A desync issue that causes enemies to hit you from far further than they should because they coudln't keep up with the sync Even better is the fact that this issue has a simple fix the community found and yet the devs decided to use said fix as a temporary solution h1 Conclusion h1 I like this game and it has so much potential but it's in a horrible state while the devs do nothing and if they do they don't tell it on steam further aiding my theory of them trying to get more people into their discord which I also heard questionable things about while the community either is completely fine with it defending them with their last breath or they're out for blood which I totally understand now And by recent news from 10CC I dare say that GTFO's future looks really bad and wont look pretty for a while at all I mean their recent added cosmetics are cosmetics that already existed but with a camo pattern slapped onto it and that's it For a game that sells for 40 bucks in my country this is just complete bs b]TL,DR:[/b Game buggy as hell horrible matchmaking system devs don't seem to care enough you either need friends or play with unreliable bots My recomendation is to spend those 40 bucks on Deep Rock Galactic and Hidden Deep Sure Hidden Deep is 2D and singleplayer and DRG is a mining game but you will have a much more enjoyable experience with those games unless you can convince your friends to drop 40 bucks just to play this hardcore coop shooter with you Also feel free to comment any positive and negative experiences points and questions
Cada partida demora PELO MENOS 2 horas de salvar para continuar depois os modos de jogo ficando nojentos com o tempo e a quantidade de itens extremamente escassa O jogo te certas que de entender sem procurar em uma wiki do jogo falta de UX total O jogo tem uma proposta legal mas CONSEGUE ENTREGAR O falar que o jogo quando mal explicado e mal feito
bad
11 hours in and im not even sure i like the game yet This game has a very cool idea but i dont find it to be nearly as scary as the adds made it sound if you are expecting to be able to slay like l4d warhammer aliens or stalker its not like that its more of a hide and seek game where the the players mostly sneak while trying to accomplish objectives i was hoping for more gun play as well but you are mostly using melee weapons and im not a big fan of that 90 of the game is a melee and the melee dose not always work Great idea im hoping for more content and weapon play in the future
It really makes you want to GET THE FUCK OUT
Spooky Also You will need a fair bit stronger graphics card than the minimum to have a decent experience with this game
Absolutely loving this game so far My friends and I are having a blast with the game and the difficulty makes it a fun challenge Absolutely recommend this game if you can find three other people to play it with you
X 2.AI
i loved this game
i tried to hug a big striker they didn't like hugs apparently
I am a 58-year old father probably one of the oldest people playing GTFO I am a single father to my son who is now 19 My son started playing GTFO in 2018 In less than a month he had already played for over 100 hours This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube So I decided to make a Steam account to play with my son I started playing but this was my first time playing a video game since the 90's so I was quite lost I asked my son for help and together we spent hours playing GTFO I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died GTFO has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well GTFO reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories
Game just gets worse and worse after each update Devs aren't making any effort to deliver new content and when they do it's nothing really new or to be excited about you have to wait for months in order to get an update with almost nothing new perhaps a bunch of exclusive weapons sometimes a new foe or a variant for an existing enemy and one new biome for one or two maps They kept asking us to wait for 1.0 version of the game Now the game isn't in early access anymore but it still feels like it really should have stayed that way Don't waste your time money and braincells playing this
Very fun to play with friends Can be quite difficult however that just makes it more satisfying when you complete a level Few bugs that make the game pretty frustrating at times
this game is a tacticians dream It has an incredibly tense environment filled with grotesque creatures that vastly outnumber you and your squad think carefully and you might just survive
I like staring at monster asses
fUN
scout be like oooooooOOOOOOO AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA the whole facility comes at you
Great game although there are some game breaking bugs that have wasted countless hours
If you can get a squad of 4 with your friends this game is a 10/10 With the game having a limited number of levels it makes up for it by being incredibly difficult We are still a group of amateurs playing this game so the earlier levels still took us up to 2-3 hours to complete Even if you complete all the levels this game has something called the Rundown which means every few months the game updates with completely new levels and new game play The teamwork and coordination make up a lot of the game and will give you a balance of serious game play and mess around game play I have yet to play with the bots in this game nor with random people online For me setting a date to grind out a level with my friends gives me something to look forward to and the excitement when you drop into a new level is just really nice
The game is quite hard especially for new player or solo player but it is fun and not boring I suggest playing with friends
This game is scary until you have to play the same level 200 times because you don't have rich friends with pc's

Way too hard unnecessarily too hard Even though my friends used unlimited ammo one shot hack we barely managed to finish last levels

Too much game breaking bugs
if you have 3 friends that dont suffer from brainrot this game is great

Shouldn't be a stealth game
Fantastic game decent graphics fun gameplay except for carrying quest items but that's not the case on all maps All in all a solid 9/10 I would say Definitely worth it
cool
i start it up gets about halfway through the menu and crashes
10/10 would recommend
rep R7C3
What was that sound
would probably be pretty fun if I had friends that played it
VERY NICE
Haven't played with randoms but with a team of buds all working together this game is fun as hell 10/10 it keeps getting better with every update
its a good game i see alot of streamers giving this game the love it deserves and love the community i only had it for a week but had fun either way so yeah good game i recommend it highly

The game is challenging It's hard You will fail You will learn Every bullet you fire should be strategically fired because you didn't have any other option You will get better Melee kills are most of your kills Sneaking backing away from enemies that you aren't ready to engage yet and planning your kill order matters Don't waste bullets Don't waste health Use burst sentries place them in strategic choke points You will die You will try again The sound light design are intentional Listen and pay attention You can learn to see in the dark when you need to You will learn You will get better It will feel good when you finish an expedition And you'll start over on the next one
it's a unique piece of shit
The game is a unique bled of experiences you get some Left 4 Dead stealth horror a touch of dystopian sci-fi wrapped in an intriguing and visually appealing package This is a dark game make sure you have hardware that can perform well in dark spaces there are a lot of different shades of black The game also borderline requires butt buddies so if you want to lean in do so with a friends group that has the patience to do intense two hour dungeon crawls with limited resources
gud game
You propably know what GTFO meens well its the the fuck out And thats what i did
Runs Poorly with Multiplayer
Really really great atmosphere that carries into every inch of the experience especially the UI within the menus and in-game The game needs a lot more polish Still running into match-breaking repeatable bugs that completely render one of our party members useless Exploring non-objective zones in hopes of finding actually useful loot is completely a waste of time and kills any interest in actually exploring the environments away from the main-objectives This point is worsened by the fact that the game just feels a bit too unforgiving when it comes specifically to finding health kits The ratio between health-kits and glowsticks as loot is way way out of tune Which makes the game difficult only for the sake of being difficult rather than actually supporting a degree of narrative immersion Would be cool if you could find some sort of basic crafting material like scrap-metal and deposit it into a fabricator of some kind to make your own health-kits/ammo-kits etc The hit-registration on the creatures and the way they move feels really laggy Which makes trying to actually land shots on enemies a really unsatisfying venture since 50 of the time when shots actually hit an enemy their reactions are either delayed or non existent and the hit-markers on the reticle are also delayed or just don't happen Combat overall just feels still very unpolished and for a 40 charge I'd expect a lot more refinement in combat objectives being more free of bugs greater enemy variety some skill/weapon progressions that aren't purely cosmetic enemy animations and hit-registration being tighter etc etc Needs a few million dollars worth of polish
Very awesome game if you are okay with smashing your head against a wall
B1 B2 C1
awesome
I was on the fence for getting GTFO because i felt it cost too much for a co-op survival game but it won me over with its progressively challenging levels and since then its gone up in price 10 improved in performance and added new guns and levels Still abit steep for strictly co-op but undeniably a good game
es un muy buen juego pero si no tienes amigos la pasaras bastante mal idealmente la idea es jugar de a 4 amigos ya que la inteligencia artificial deja mucho que desear y se avanza muy lento las misiones pero en general es muy bueno otra cosa que no me gusta es la interfaz que si bien intenta ser futurista es solo molesto
very niucr
very spoopy very scawy no skeleton still fun
i dont know i just got here
get out leave
The game is amazing when playing with friends it sets the mood and atmosphere perfectly and you need a great teamwork in order to complete the levels It not only challenges you but your friends as well although you probably need around 2-3 hours to complete one level P.S TIP Do not wake THEM up
You no success if you no team ifykyk
its really fun
si buscan un desafio hardcore entre 4 players este es el juego
GTFO is the game for you if got friends money and a taste for horror If you answered yes to all of those in for a wild ride The cooperative gameplay is intense and way more fun when you can strategize with friends to tackle the terrifying challenges together The atmosphere is absolutely chilling and the gameplay can be punishing but part of the thrill Just make sure prepared to shell out for it because definitely want the full experience with your crew If you have the squad and the cash this game will deliver some unforgettable moments 7/10 Perfect for a night of horror with your buddies
Undroppable cell bug
FUCK*NG UNPLAYABLE TOO MANY BUGS IN RUNDOWN 7.0
spoko giera
A very thrilling and enjoyable game especially if you play with friends
Expertly paced team-based PvE Better than most other 4 man squad shooters
Work together or die together Literally the perfect motto and sums up the game perfectly
Excited until our group realized the biggest fears were the in-game bugs NOT the alien/zombies Be prepared to lose tons and tons of progress when the game ultimately bugs out This happens on the very first missions and all missions that require logic items to progress your group This needs to be fixed This game is bordering refund request levels To be released at its current price point is utterly laughable
Game as some cool mechanics and can be challenging but the bugs make it a painful experience
i hate this game
Nice
i got out
There's a reason why my suit is piss colored
This game is a panic attack endurance challenge
good game but you need 4 people

I don't know what is causing it but the game keeps crashing Finally go into a full lobby after an hour of trying and 20 minutes in I crash to desktop Not worth it for me
Tolles Game aber auch sehr herausfordernd
OK I'm getting out
Spooky
The Good Bad and Ugly a guy that is not good at a game he refunded The Good GTFO is a horror team based shooter set in a spooky science facility owned by some corrupt company that does corrupt things You are held against you will by a person know as The Warden and tasked with going down into the labs and do missions This is long after the fall of the lab has happened and now there are monsters waiting for you in the dark You can find story bits in the levels that give hints to what went done in the labs Due to the seasoned nature of the game you may need to go on YouTube to hear the previous season's story bits Without too many spoilers it is SCP/experiment/discovery gone wrong The game is challenging and will not hold your hand Ammo health etc is limited The enemies hit hard and there are many of them in areas cloaked in darkness and sometimes you due to heavy fog won't see one until it is in your face Objectives can be simple like fetching samples or complex like using a DOS terminal to enter random codes to set up an uplink You can use bots to get through this game but having real players is the only way most will ever get past the first few levels Each time you go down you will have a variety of weapons and tools to help survive the labs Tools range from sentry turrets to motion sensors Some of the best parts of the game are creeping into room and turning on and off your flashlight to see without alerting the monsters so you can stealth kill one or so you can set up for an alarm for everything to go out the window While the missions on paper are simple when you enter lab things change fast Raising poisonous fog and moving objectives are just a few issues you will face Every few months the devs add new levels and dump the old ones so don't get to comfy in your success The challenge is the most polarizing part of the game and honestly it is nice Most games are hit this button get rewards and that is kinda getting stale at least for me it is IF you have never been humbled in your life you may not get it but the this is one of the games we need but don't deserve The Bad For the current Rundown(season the devs added in a basic tutorial level and added story missions to help people go deeper into the game They even added checkpoints to help even if you can't go to them during a different play session There are bots to fill slots on the team but while I would love for them to overhaul parts for them it is still better to just find a team on discord unless you plan on just probing a level with the bots to see what is around The level A1 is very easy and will help players get into the game although I wish they had like two more A tier missions for players to have more time to get into the game As I said this game is hard and unfortunately many come to it thinking it is Left 4 Dead It is not L4D This game is not even L4D Dark Souls It is harder While I enjoy the challenge and the breath of fresh air that it brings many will try it and say the game sucks when really it is you suck and that is ok I refunded the game the first time I got it due to the difficultly and and not knowing if I could find friends to play with I ended up giving it a second chance and here I am at 30ish hours in and I will most likely do another 70 I am getting better at the game and as I get better I enjoy it more There are bugs here and there but it seems from me it is just edge case stuff or minor visual things that are one off stuff I have only experienced one thing that was game breaking and that was getting stuck in a place I was some how able to clip through so yeah couldn't die but couldn't finish the mission so it was back to the checkpoint The ugly The game is hard but not impossible While I have mostly had good times with the community I do see some issues that all skill levels will face As a note Discord is the best way to find groups to do levels New players will face tough times while more experienced players will carry them Veterans and more skilled players may end up carrying a player who has played 5 times and wants to do E1 since they did all the story missions If you get carried like this go back and run early content and even try to do secondary missions before going down a level If you don't you will just be a bot in a normal players lobby and the more skilled players will have less room to fail This just drags out the time to do levels which for those that don't know can take 45 min or 3.5 hrs I stopped trying to dive deeper for awhile due to the fact I spent most of a mission just following some pros not having a clue why we did what we did and it sucked Now I go back to that level and while I may get turned around once I know where I am I don't need to be told what just happened since I was the one that did it Also for those long time players who hate things that bring in new players no one said you have to use the check point you can just end the run and start over The Good spooky SCP levels and a rewarding challenge Bad you expect this to hold your hand like L4D and Ugly you have to put in hours to get good then it gets better a guy that is getting better at a game he refunded and is enjoying the whirlwind of an emotion that is GTFO Work together or die together
Some may like it But it was not my cup of tea Too difficult that lead to constant repeating of the same level till we get it right
One of my most enjoyed games in recent times love the dark n depressing atomsphere goes well with the hardcore gameplay The game forces teamwork to survive which i really enjoy Good graphics and sound design along with good Coop gameplay this is essential if you like coop games like payday left for dead rainbow six extraction etc its better than them all
Please fix your AI system When the bag pack dropped near the ladder the AI cannot pick it up and climb the ladder forever By the way Could you please add more checkpoints
The matchmaking is hands down the worst I've ever experienced Be prepared for hours of not finding other players even though there are thousands Friends being kicked from your lobby for no reason Your lobby being disbanded for no reason and without warning nor prompt The Devs really really need to fix this it's honestly unplayable without an already made group of friends to play with
One point before I start My experience with this game was exclusively during the free weekend You'll understand why that's important later All in all this game does very many things right but it is ruined by being much too drawn out to be enjoyable The game absolutely nails so many of it's aspects list The atmosphere is exactly how it should be You play as a bunch of expendable prisoners sent onto a suicide mission because your mission is more important than your lives You interact with the world using old-timey computer terminals using commands to find objects you're looking for and ping them to yourself and so on i](Although it makes no realistic sense why you can't use any terminal for the entirety of the level and it's just separated into these zones but that's done for game design reasons and I fully understand that someone staying back and chilling at the first terminal the team finds for the entire game might not exactly make for particularly interesting gameplay.)[/i Though it would be nice if your default HUD stayed on while working on the terminal itself so that if you're able to see what you're looking for and not have to leave the terminal for a moment because you misremembered a number or replaced an underscore for a space and such You don't have these long time players who just know the levels inside and out because GTFO has this very interesting mechanic of having a campaign open for a certain amount of time It's not short don't worry If you want to you can take your time to beat it This campaign gets swapped out afterwards completely for different missions different rewards and different story within the campaign itself So it has very high replayability if you do find it interesting You aren't very strong and your resources are limited Running and gunning through the entire game will most likely end up with you being dead very often list That being said the dealbreaking issue for me Apart from occasional bugs which were sparse if any in my playtime is that the game just tediously moves the goal posts for you too damn often i]Here I'd like to clarify the importance of my first lines in this interview While I personally do think that this goal-post moving is a typical occurrence in the game since I have only played during the free weekend I have only experienced a single one of these campaigns and there might be a chance that that was just a specific campaign where the goal posts move a lot and maybe the others don't do that so much but that's beyond what I experienced with the game Just keep in mind that it might just be a problem with the single campaign I had access to not the entire game.[/i To explain this goal-post moving issue I have You start the mission with a certain goal Get to somewhere get something etc Sometimes you know exactly where to go sometimes you need to find that out for yourself through the use of the terminals I mentioned earlier You make your merry way over there having fun and then you get to a roadblock of some kind which requires you to trek to some other location either god knows where or the location you passed quite a while ago The slow movement speed of the characters doesn't help this but you make your way over there the path is once again blocked by an alarmed door which triggers a horde for the duration of the unlocking You push through the horde with very minor scrapes but a good chunk of your ammo is gone You do what you were supposed to but you figure you need to replenish ammo/health on the team so you try to find an ammo box Well as luck would have it there are ammo-boxes available On the other side of the map somewhere You trek there expending more ammo getting bruised up more so you repeat this process to find some health That health is in the zone you passed on your way here 3 zones ago But now fully healed up fully ammo'd up you get back to the roadblock of your main objective and you pass through You head on only for you to come up to a door which requires a specific key which is somewhere at the start of the level Needless to say while playing this game whenever I got to where I was supposed to be and the game just pushed the goalpost I had somewhere else I wasn't like Ok let's go carefully now but I groaned at the tedious trekking that awaited me with no way to bypass it This gameplay design doesn't feel like you're moving on in the level It feels like you're going through a game and you hit a You must be level X to enter this area go complete sidequests to level up which completely breaks the deal for me especially at it's price tag At 40 euros full price with 32 euros on sale I would expect to have fun with the game not pain through tedious sidequests for half an hour before I can move on with a single level b][url Concept of Evil Curator page[/url][/b

Troppi maledetti bug che ti obbligano a ricominciare la rundown da capo soprattutto ai checkpoint si blocca non puoi cambiare armi e niente Stramaledetto risolvete sti problemi
Let them snooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooze
gulugulugulugulugulugulugulugulu reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
The game was made by a bunch of bumbling fools who dont know what fun is the game is bullshit difficult and the checkpoints are placed in the dumbest areas ever If you die have fun getting back that 3 hours of progress on one single mission idiot
Best game ever
Sida en el pie derecho
Hard game uhuhuhu
five star prison
Dark Gritty no difficulty settings you will struggle suffer ragequit even.but you will be back for more
13 GB for a game that looks like this is honestly unseen fun game w very high skill ceiling but VERY buggy and matchmaking is pretty much discord server only i had to restart the game because i got softlocked from looking at a computer screen half the time the people you queue with leave instantly leave as soon as the game starts leave halfway through the game maps can last around an hour or more and if one person leaves happens very often everyone else does too losing you hours of progress this can be solved by joining their discord server and joining vc groups of 4 but thats not my cup of tea unmatched immersion ive never seen in any other game
I don't recommend this game for a variety of reasons even though I initially enjoyed it on first taste These reasons have been brewing over the 15 or so hours i've tried of this game The difficulty ironically enough was the funnest part The worst parts were everything else around it So be prepared for a rant Let's first go into my expectations when I bought this game on early access This was done by some of the folks from the Payday 2 crowd which is still VERY MUCH alive today and having a fair amount of difficulty in and of itself for different reasons The reason why I mention this It's to push home that these are supposed to be VETERANS of the PvE scene people at the top of their game These aren't just your average indie devs with their first outing ever or still understanding their footing These are experienced developers that partly got this game sold on their accolades and prior achievements So I'm not gonna cut these supposed veterans of the PVE scene any fucking slack Let's get whatever positives I can muster out of the way Visuals are good sure Voice acting decent World/Setting Nifty Dare I say something I've long wanted from the Co-Op space a gritty sci-fi horror that feels grungy and tactile And that's about it Let's just cut to the chase the game still feels like it's early access streamer-bait and 10 chamber's policy on previous rundowns especially lore content in said rundowns has proven destructive to both the longevity of the game and my goodwill toward it due to the lack of any proper substitute be it by variety or quantity of missions It comes off as insidious borderline scam material that still hasn't shaken itself up in any meaningful game changing way since I bought it in early access that only now feels forced out the door to capitalize on E3 or whatever it goes by now gamefest or whatever hype So now let's elaborate 1 Matchmaking and lack of any proper server browser or any player-friendly feature For starters Matchmaking is still fucking garbage no joining a Discord isn't an excuse for it or a good substitute At the end of the day you're still hoping that someone will actually want to match with you so it's just adding one extra fucking step to the process that afaik NO other game requires Being hardcore isn't an excuse Insurgency Sandstorm and other hardcore shooters don't fuckin require this especially for their PVE modes so GTFO acting as if they're special rubs me the wrong way VERY much So if they're adding matchmaking they shouldn't just slap it on like petulant children and not work to improve it or make it functional in any meaningful decent way The fact that I can host a lobby and the people I have on can RANDOMLY desync with no way to rejoin EVEN with a penalty to our run and/or needing host consent is fuckin dumb to me This game is RELEASED and it's missing a basic feature that many other PVE games some that can be just as hard with much MUCH more features see DRG L4D modding or just sheer gunplay Insurgency Sandstorm is fucking stupid to me Y'know what we needed MORE than checkpoints the chance to drop-in mid-match even with the caveats of host-consent and match-reset y'know ANYTHING to make waiting in a lobby less slow boring and painful especially when they hop in wait then leave again Or they hop in you set bots for 1 empty player slot then they leave cuz no bots forgetting that the bots have better fucking aim than they do at least in my experience and can be commanded to put their sentries and to STAY ON YOUR ASS unlike the same teammates that bitch about them It's fucking embarassing that for a Co-Op PVE game my best experience was when me and one very nice random were stuck alone waitign so when we kicked off with 2 bots it was actually the best run we ever did Hell here's an idea free of charge rip off L4D Have it be that if a player joins late they essentially take the place and kit of a bot That way people can drop in and don't come in overpowered since they're fresh They have to work with what they've got and the host should still have the option to lock people out once a match has started or to make it possible that once players join they can rejoin without needing to jump through Discord hoops 2 Visual Variety in Setting or lack thereof Additionally the lack of any meaningful SETTING CHANGE is fucking disgraceful at this point Why do I say this Because adding a couple of trees here and there won't change the fact that you're stuck in a pitch black hole When DRG can make LITERAL holes in the ground more colorful and interesting you know there's an issue Does that mean it needs to be as whacky and colorful Obviously no but when there's no real attention to variety in lighting or just scenery it just makes you ignore all the hard work that goes into the visuals of these areas let alone the level design beyond just the functional themselves Take Resident Evil for example especially one like 8 8 is entirely in one snow ridden location but even then there are distinct tones to each area lighting and color palletes and aesthetics that fit the area Why we can't juggle the green tree zones with greenhouses idk with industrial and residential areas of this underground complex maybe some bright white laboratories that catch us off guard with how bright they are YOU KNOW ACTUAL VISUAL VARIETY It ain't hard I literally just shat these out while writing Something is better nothing 10 chambers and no new masks and bland half-assed color palette swaps don't substitute mission variety as in modifiers to make each run unique and/or quanity 3 Alarm Doors and boredom So let's address another elephant in the room The Alarm Mechanics It hasn't changed since early access and I doubt in any meaningful imaginative way since some of the earliest Rundowns It basically goes like this everyone stand in circle Now everyone stand in little circles Oh this time circle move but everyone still must stand inside For the first few 10-20 minutes of a mission it's fine It breaks up the pace After HOURS of it No This needs variety or something to mix things up Maybe specific players are required in the circle or no players stand in the circle or you lose progress or only a certain amount of players in circles there's so much imagination that go into this simple game mechanic that I'm astonished that whoever is responsible for these hasn't implemented the most basic grade-school level variety in what is essentially a very forced boring alarm sequence that while fun at first long overstays its welcome through the amount of times you must repeat it over and over and over to the point where the most variety each alarm door has is we're gonna fuck you with more enemies this wave lol Not bad in and of itself but it SEVERELY hurts the longevity of this mechanic to anyone that isn't just looking for raw difficulty 4 Expectations the sequel So let's make it clear This game at one point sold itself on being the lovechild and free-from-Overkill PVE project by former Payday 2 devs and with the involvement of Simon Viklund whose masterpieces littered the Payday 2 game files like the fuckin bullet casings after an Class 3 Alarm Door And what came of it on release The same game essentially as Early Access with content actively being TAKEN from the player to manipulate them into a sense of FOMO Simon Viklund's score slowly degrading more and more since even Rundown 1 or the pre-alpha into forgettable noise that one can just mute and pretend doesn't exist and any notion of this game being extended via the community axed via the treatment of GTFO Modding and the stupid refusal to allow people to play earlier rundowns Needless to say I feel scammed since THIS is what the finished product is I should've refunded
The concept is cool but the execution is 2/5 stars
Discord simulator Gameplay is terrible
fun
Si
I really enjoy the fair difficulty in this game The need for stealth for beginners can slowly turn into efficient room clearing The terror of the scans can be satisfying after its cleared
work together or shit your pants trying
It's a spook It's a scare
This is one of the best Co-Op game on Steam Work together or die together
this is that good shit
game was hard like really hard still fun none the less
Incredibly fun game heavily reliant on teamwork communication and cooperation Expect to not be able to see 30 feet in front of you 9.1 Meters if your country hasn't been to the moon A decent variety of weapons and tools as well as 4 different melee weapons with different advantages and drawbacks with the same logic applying to the guns This game has a heavy oppressing atmosphere that feels smothering at almost all times because of the prevalence of tight spaces and even open spaces are tightened up by low visibility and fog which is only pierced by your tiny flashlight with low range If you like feeling trapped and outnumbered by an animalistic foe that overwhelm and destroy you like a swarm of antibodies this is your game Enemies are reminiscent of The Last of Us and Resident Evil being a horde of horrifically disfigured former humans that come in a variety of shapes and sizes even varying in their form of locomotion These are enemies that lie dormant in a sleep-like state are are sensitive to light movement and sound in the environment around them This is a game that makes you feel like you are just barely scraping by constantly scavenging for health kits and ammo/tool resupply kits When you find them you find yourself checking the status of your teammates to see if what you've found can be better allocated for the sake of the team rather than yourself If you've got 3 friends with decent PC's you should pick this game up NOTES You must have a decent PC to run this game well Atmospheric effects and other assets in the game will eat up your RAM and VRAM i have to run this game on nearly minimum graphics settings which is still beautiful to maintain 80 FPS in 2K resolution If you don't have friends or nobody is available the bots are very polished because they don't alert enemies by proximity physical contact or potentially the sound of their gunshots
keeps screaming in my ear when i start game and now i have chronic tinnitus
Do not play this game if you Dislike hard games Do not have friends Otherwise have fun
cool game and hard
barely loaded too many bugs to even play the concept is cool and all but i wouldn't recommend this
The game is quite challenging even on the lowest difficulty It seems that the combat events are scripted rather rigidly meaning that if you can learn the patterns from a few failures you can improve The introductory video/graphics are unnecessarily loud and disturbing It is clear they are trying to set the tone for horror but for me it is just annoying and tedious
On the plus side it's atmospheric and creates tension On the down side this game leaves far too much for the player to work out for himself As a result instead of being fun it creates a feeling of baffled frustration Overall I'm not prepared to work as hard as this game demands in order to wring some enjoyment out of it and probably won't play it again
One of the most difficult games that has my team actually coming back to play it again and again sponsored or not It's got a few bugs here and there but none that have terribly hindered the experience Expect much anger and more satisfaction 8/10 Good game
Mulitplayer only no single player mode
8/10
Yes I am feeling a light to decent 8 on this one
If u want a casual experience GTFO
this game is better to play with friends but you can play by yourself with bots 10/10
be a sweaty gamer
GTFO is the best co-op shooter I have ever played A mix of challenge horror and comradery that is unrivaled Please do yourself a favor and pick up this game
PLEASE GOD WHY
viu
If been craving an FPS that tests your critical thinking and mechanical skills then GTFO might just be the perfect hidden gem to satiate that ravenous
good
Coop games are interesting a group of friends could be doing almost anything and be having fun so a lot of the genre can fall into the background noise category of the game just being an excuse to hang out with your friends Its very rare for a Coop game to have the dedication and depth to fully explore and utilise the people on screen When youre playing GTFO youre playing GTFO Almost all attention is dedicated to whats happening on screen and it requires each players focus in order for you to succeed The missions can be hard claustrophobic and hectic and having to adapt to mistakes is very satisfying I genuinely dont remember the last time I saw a group of 4 people afraid of a group of video game enemies probably Killing Floor 1 The games expensive but its well worth setting aside an evening to play with some friends
p gud
genuinely tense at times and very immersive
dm
Holy shit man Really Really No way to leave in the middle of an over an hour mission to return later That's just great design positively wonderful The fog levels oh So perfect I love having my nice GPU doing NOTHING for enjoyment because lazy mechanic is lazy Oh and the checkpoints Oh they're great This is a good game For masochists and those with infinite free time Don't buy
Cool concept
10 1000
I hear it I hear it all too well
This is not at all a scarier Left 4 Dead You literally crouch walk everywhere during a match to not spook the monsters When you do start engaging you run out of ammo in several waves Too bad I tried to get a refund past the 2 week period
haha hammer go b0nk
its fun BUT you should be able to upgrade/customize the weapons wouldve made it 10x better and its almost impossible with 2 people and still quite difficult even with 3
All the good things said about this game are true but it's borderline unplayable because the matchmaking is and has been complete garbage The fact that you have to utilize a third party service discord to have some sort of matchmaking success is asinine You should be able to drop in and play not sit around the discord chat for an hour and hope 3 other people want to play the same level its rundown 7 at the time of this review and there has been zero fixes for this issue No server browser nothing I want to like this game and not have to watch YT videos of it because I can't even match up with people to play it
asd

Good luck and happy diving
This is Payday 2 with some minor changes You actually need to have competent teammates replace infinite dumb enemies with comparatively fewer enemies who will stomp you into oblivion if you make a mistake and 0 humor Although I think this game inspired Elden Ring's fall damage distance You accidentally stepped on a pebble Fall damage when you return to solid ground This has gotten better with updates it used to be if you skipped a stair you took damage Not a staircase a stair Serious note If you have a group 2-4 strong that are airtight when working together this game is a ton of fun If you don't it's a panic simulator and a damned good one at that I tend to give games crap in reviews but it means I love them Unless it's garbage but this isn't garbage Fans of the Tarkov/Hunt The Showdown/The Cycle multiplayer team dynamics would enjoy this Hard game is hard but hard game is a GOOD hard game
G irls T hat F ucking O vulate
Nice
For the top 1 of players out there with elite skills this is a good game It s an emersive and atmospheric beauty that combines strategy puzzles and combat in a brilliant way However its a few notches above me and my mates skill level enough to make it barely unplayable The stats are that only like 0.97 of players complete a rundown and 99 of missions will end in failure Besides that the AI for the squad is problematic I had a group of 3 buddies to play with so we filled the last slot with the computer but dam was he stupid He couldn't go up ladders and would be stuck on always carrying the objective so he couldn't move He would often get stuck in place so we'd have to restart the mission since you cant pass through doors without him Overall a fun game with an interesting story and beautiful atmosphere but just too dam punishing and buggy to make it worth it for us
good game
From a place of someone who wants to play this game more I don't have time or patience to crouch walk melee and study every level over an hour and half to fail at the end to redo a long checkpoint I've beaten every souls game but those games reward you for studying going back to farm getting better gear etc I do generally play rpgs but I'd love if there was SOMETHING worth beating these levels for It's just yay you did it next level Would love to be able to choose to be more risky and gun more since the gun sounds are incredible but I have enough ammo to deal with one security door then nothing
It's unplayable with the bot
funny game
I got the f*ck out
Loved it
fps fps
innovating
nice
I would actually recommend this game if you have people to play with even though I have 1.4 hours in the game I only played a single 15 minute game the rest was sitting in matchmaking The single game that I was able to play I wasn't able to become immersed or explore because the teammate that I had wanted to speed run the level

One of the most rewarding and difficult coop games i have ever played It's one of the best coop games in the sense that you actually have to cooperate heavily with your team in order to win Communication is key i don't see how it's possible to get through the tougher stages with randoms in your team You can die very quickly and you have very low resources to share between the team so you need to communicate with who needs what what tools to use at the right time where to position what guns to use etc The game is dripping with atmosphere it's intense scary and thrilling without having the need to rely on cheap jumpscares It's scary in the sense of resource management and not knowing whats around the next corner or behind the next door you need to open Only negative personally is you need to have a dedicated group that has hours of free time to spare because the levels can be hours long and you can't pick up where you left off in the next session which i do think they should add considering there are actual checkpoints in the missions themselves Overall a must play if you have a 4 man squad that are looking for a new coop game to play together
Amazing
GOOTOOFOOOOO
fye

EDIT I'm still salty about how much buggy stuff is in the game and how often you encounter it but i've continued to play it and I suppose that says something I really want to be able to recommend this game to people I do I've bought several copies for friends I've tried to hype it up i've got hundreds of hours of play time on this game I love it but my patience is wearing thin I would not recommend buying this game It's broken There are legitimate issues old issues issues that have been around for more than a year which break the game while you are playing it The state-management for the levels will literally brick your game prevent people from rejoining spawn hordes of enemies on top of you prevent you from dropping items you can't equip any items and loads more I'm sick of playing for an hour or two and then having to quit because the game is literally broken and preventing us from continuing Way too many game-breaking issues for the 40 price tag
This game is brutally difficult and unforgiving You'll die a lot and find out who your real friends are I havent suffered like this in a while 10/10 game
Please step into the Bioscan
this game makes my testicles larger and my seafoam cum go further
I would advise to play with friends since the game is almost impossible solo/duo and the matchmaking never works Game makes me nostalgic of alien swarm pretty fun and hardcore
Super Good game really recommend it One note for the devs we have found a bug regarding the quest items for example in B1 the suit case item duplicated as well as the baby So one of the members of the team was stuck with the baby and myself with the suit case Hope you find it helpfull

Yeah what a game Unless you're a solo only anti-social/shy gamer you should already have this game in you're library Make sure you focus on the fact that this is an extremely difficult and challenging game at all times and you'll sail through easy peasy

Played one level for 14 hours slamming our heads against the wall 10/10 clearing was a whole body experience
Fun Game

h1]7 10 Phenomenal"[/h1 h3]"A Great Game That Shoots Itself In the Foot A Lot"[/h3 A TL;DR is provided below h3]Why GTFO is Awesome[/h3 I'm going to start by saying GTFO is awesome It's quickly become one of my favorites to play Co-operative games are a growing rarity Having a game dependent on teamwork hasn't come around in a while and GTFO is a kind of game I've looked for a really long time It's something that has been a huge delight to play where the majority of the game is working together to solve problems and learning for yourself A lot of games almost patronize you in a sense by having objective markers task trackers catering mechanics just generally games that make you feel like your experience is being catered for the sake to ensure you're having fun GTFO doesn't do any of that Each mission opens up with a very broad and expressive goal that you need to learn how to solve Problems show themselves and you make the decisions on how to solve them And the HORROR Horror elements have become pretty dependent on crutch methods jump-scares low lighting environmental ambiance and GTFO does a lot of unique approaches The game isn't meant to scare you but it is meant to have a feeling of pressure and stress as you play A horde is a huge threat that will almost certainly destroy you if you don't prepare for it So when a horde comes with your pants down you know you've got a 20 chance of surviving it But those odds are enough to make you feel like you can make it It relies so much on your own decisions and not scripted methods that the fear really is always unexpected Making a game punishingly difficult is a great design choice as well When it comes to building a games learning curve I always feel like easy to learn difficult to master is always the best way to go In that sense even losing provides something as you learn something new that you can use to approach a problem that you had The difficulty makes challenges you come across even more worth it and the teamwork emphasis feel more valued h3]Why GTFO is Not Awesome[/h3 There is a reason why Co-operative games are not very popular or profitable and that's because it depends on other people to really make them work GTFO is a great game that Shoots itself in the foot way too much The game I wouldn't say is exactly popular Not enough to really make it work Because if you are buying this game by yourself it is not going to work out I bought this game with a couple of my friends and it's great When we actually can play Aligning schedules isn't easy for playing a game and especially since most GTFO matches go for 1-2 hours long each it can be incredibly discouraging to wait so long to play together only for the rest of the night to become borderline inoperable because the game can take so much out of you And if you are looking to find new people to play with that can be a mixed bag as well The matchmaking puts you through a lot of filters that when having to match you with other players that have the same filters becomes next to impossible to find ways to fulfill all the other spots I like how the game encourages the use of Discord but the only issue I've had with that are those on Discord are those who are incredibly experienced with the game and don't have as much tolerance for new players I've had some good experiences with Discord players but they've been rare It's a game that is very divisive for those that will buy it and a 40 price tag can really make people question their decision for buying it h3]What to Expect in GTFO[/h3 This game should be treated like a rogulike in the sense of that you shouldn't really ever go into a run expecting to win Go as far as you can and have fun in the experience This game is a horror and strategy game first There are guns and bad guys but shooting the bad guys is usually a bad idea The game is long and is hard If you really want to commit to it it is going to take a lot of your time Find friends If you are going to buy the game at least buy it with one other person If you are going to play the game with AI teammates use the command wheel a lot At that point the game almost feels like an RTS h3]What Could Make GTFO Better[/h3 Many things that people can say to make the game better will completely destroy it's core values The game needs teamplay it's difficulty and it's length to be it's unique identity so how can you make the game a better experience Keeping these in mind I'd offer things like these A Practice Mode Horde Mode A simple 1-4 player mode where the players can experiment and work with the guns in the game to learn their functionality and the shooting mechanics while also preparing for Alarmed doors It should essentially just be an alarmed door situation that never ends and sees how long the players can last Improved AI and comms wheel If you are going to play the game solo this needs to be improved The AI in the game is very unintelligent and could use a lot more polish As well as this give the player more commands to give to their teammates use bioscan use terminal to find medipacks ammo tool refill Hold position Use ammo sparingly follow me closely check resources AI tells you if they need health/ammo/tools etc Adjusted Matchmaking This can be a bit of a problem since the game does have a story that you are expected to follow but I'd rather see a matchmaking system that pairs players up only by language and voice chat preferences and the squad votes on which expedition to run More weapon varieties Many of the weapons are extremely similar to each other and borderline reskins that are very unjustly balanced Some are the only usable ones others are completely useless I'd like to see primary weapons be weaker but more dependable and the secondaries stronger but more dependent on a niche situation An improved mini-map The map feels blotchy and provides little to no information Pings are not very informative and don't last very long Most marked items on the map don't have much explanation which just makes it feel cluttered and confusing Less visual clutter Major combat situations completely dull out any strategic intent and just become shootfests It's extremely hard to tell anything of what is happening when you're grouped up with your team It feels a little like a bullet hell going both ways Add another purchase option in the store that has someone purchase the game for themselves with 3 extra keys for who they want to party with Maybe price it at about 120 so you at least feel like you get some discount It certainly feels better than having to go to a key distributor or waiting for a sale that gives a similar discount Enemy clarity The functions and weapons of the enemies are very hard to dodge and it feels like a game of chance instead of knowing how each one functions How the game is expecting you to approach combat encounters isn't made clear Improve the game quality for new players I'd recommend adding 2-3 expeditions as a Prologue to which are a little easier than the main rundown that provide information on the story of the game and learn mechanics without making the player constantly lose in order to make them understand As of right now the game feels designed only to those who have played previous rundowns h1]TL;DR[/h1 GTFO is an amazing and creative game with a ton of potential It's a great game to play with friends and enjoy some time together It's unforgiving and brutal but you learn a lot about it from each failure which motivates you in it's own way However the game is drug down by it's necessity for co-operative play and finding a moment where you actually can is rare If you intend on buying this game buy it with your friends knowing you actually can The game is a pretty hefty commitment to play
Yes hard asf tho and hard to stay encouraged
BEST GAME 2021-22 EVER
It is a blast get this game if you like horror coops
gioco della vita se sei una pussy non giocare
canelote
GTFO
Match making is poopoo and the game is dying imo it should still be in Early access and the devs are going to be leaving the project soon
40 and your playing with nothing but bugs in this game you'll shoot at the creatures and its like the bullets won't even register until after 5 seconds that your bullets had hit Giving them enough time to do a whole lot of damage to you Another issue I have with this game is the fact that there is a bug that will prevent you from the map loading up You'll be falling into complete darkness for about 5 minutes then it will force itself to start up This bug seems to be getting worse because that only used to happen to me every once a match or so Now it is everytime I try to play the game Like I mean shit you're asking for 40 dollars but I'm here to tell you that it is not worth the money At all This game should a free to play due to the amount of bugs in this game I'll change my review once you guys decide you fix your game
Shhhhhhh Sleepers
Fuarkkkkennnn not behhhhhddd
10 screaming scouts out of 10
great game but requires a ridiculous amount of team work you need four people who have mics very difficult but the challenge is fun
i hate this game
Like the team base also communication needed to excel on certain levels of the game
The best first person shooter if COD zombies was a horror game then this is it
im suffering this was bought for me as a gift and i wanna kill myself everytime i play 100/10
Muy dificil si tu team es dislexico
i have never been more stressed out in my life
Lot of bugs
TOO MANY BUGS
Shit game buggy af the only hard thing is trying to not get hit through walls Fix the damn game

Franchement mais mes amis puent
Un FPS de terror el cual te mantiene constantemente en oscuras zonas llenas de peligros aberrantes mientras mas abajo viajes mas aumenta la dificultad diferentes tipos de herramientas y armas para lidiar con los enemigos que te esperan la es primordial en tu equipo en cada momento Pruebalo ya que el reto para sobrevivir en cada zona esta totalmente garantizado Y no falta de dolor de mangos que te este juego porque cada etapa sea un suplicio para poder terminarla WORK TOGETHER OR DIE TOGETHER
Sneaky was optional they said
There is no more say just play
Really a good game hope the developers will focus on new game content and fixing the bugs
hbhzubhu
It truly is one of the best co-op fps and it tests out just how good teamwork that your team is able to do It is simple to understand the game's mechanics and everything but it is hard to do it even just doing really good and doing some mistakes by the half or at the end could cost the whole game Finishing the each levels just feels amazing after all the tries it is very rewarding feeling Being able to find match or create lobby on the game's discord server was so much simple and easy Few things that this game needs is being able to play the previous rundowns and more contents like new guns and customizations would be very nice other than that it is almost perfect game it requires dedication teamwork and a lot of spare time because you could possibly spending at least 2 hours to 4,5 hours on one level which is crazy as it sounds
pain
An amazing horror game with intense situations It forces you to work together with your teammates in order to survive The visuals are amazing and the gameplay is fantastic even the ambience and soundtrack is on point an all around 10/10 game that I would highly recommend for someone looking for a horror FPS with awesome graphics and outstanding team driven gameplay
Lo que dijo GatitaOtaku toda la razon un admin el pibe
It's fun but you need friends to play The official discord is hit or miss for finding good teammates and not a great place to learn the game If you have friends to play with and you like action horror games you should give it a go
Absolutely fantastic game that I don't get to play as much as I'd want to but can easily recommend Can be pretty tense spooky or funny when you mess up and have 30 enemies rushing your team Highly recommended if you like a mix of stealthy and loud tactical gameplay with player teamwork
I am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single farther to my Son who is 14 now My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories
really buggy Stuck on a mission and can't get passed it because it wont let me pick up stuff Couldn't even revive teamates
Incredibly satisfying to clear a level with a full blind group Took three nights and several attempts to clear C1 but had a blast running it and learning new strategies The game has come a long way since the last time I played it The checkpoint system is definitely something I appreciate especially with the longer floors
I have to write a comment so this is it
de 4 horas pude jugar 30min porq a un amigo no le carga el juego vrga cosa q entendereia si el tuviera una pc chota pero le corre el elden asiq
very good game Best when playing with a full roster tho
game lied i have not been able to get the fuck out please send help
the price is right with all the content added still need friends
A la seconde j'ai ce jeu j'ai compris le titre ce n'est pas d'une mission c'est du jeu redevenir humain que vous avant de jouer
pretty good unique and fun
Stealth Shooter Resource Management Terror This game is tough but once you start understanding the mechanics of the game it becomes even more enjoyable Missions are a constant balance of Do we want to stealth this room and save some ammo or Do we have enough ammo to kill these big mutants and save some time sometimes you don't have a choice but to make some noise You're able to play missions with bots which is a deeply appreciated feature but the experience is best played with other people
IM SCARED TO PLAY ALONE T_T
die together with randoms or die together with friends
Need friends to play and even then it is still boring af
buen juego
something for the family 4man coop something for the goths scawwy just gud
fun when your friend actualy wants to play it T_T
pure pain
I love this game I do and that's the only reason it's getting a positive review but it has a long way to go before a proper release The shooting is satisfying the levels are interesting the lore is awesome and the overall atmosphere is pretty alright but some glaring issues that break immersion for me are as follows 1 Perhaps some kind of engine limitation but typically gunshot sounds will immediately awake enemies within a 40 metre radius this rule gets throw out the window if there are 2 doors between you and what you are shooting at however even if you miss no matter how close they are as long as there are 2 open doors between you and the room you shoot into they are deaf to it 2 Melee is clunky as hell don't be fooled by the animations the damage from your weapon is applied to where the centre of your screen is aiming when the animation completes NOT where the weapon actually lands this can lead to situations where it looks like you stabbed an enemy in the head but your screen centre was JUST off the head hit-box and they will not die 3 Bugs.bugs bugs bugs and more bugs sometimes checkpoints break the game making objectives unable to be completed if you restart a level with toxic fog without closing the game or leaving the lobby the fog will be gone when the level restarts 100 of the time and it has been this way for years Sometimes guns are unable to be reloaded or fired for seemingly no reason although this is quite a lot rarer than the others 4 This is not a single player game actually it is to an extent You will be able to play a fair bit if not most of a rundown on your own however if you are a casual gamer then no this will not be easy if at all possible for you it takes many many hours to learn and master the mechanics in a way that allows you to bully your way through levels on your own but it will not be easy and certain objectives and doors will be far FAR easier to open with a full team
I heard late about GTFO but after I saw some artwork and I read something about the story I was very excited The Game in the beginning seems hard but after meeting some fellow player and keeping an eye on their tactics it is challenging and very atmospheric I love playing it also knowing that I will only end few missions My only problem is the matchmaking I'm not too much into discord But without it finding other players which will keep fighting on your side to the end can be very frustrating I love the graphic-design and also the coop elements Having a good team working together and sharing supplies is essential An excellent game which will hopefully stay with us very long
One of the best shooter games I've played in a long time It's very difficult but with the right team you can get through it and I really enjoy that
Lo recomiendo mucho para vivirsela con amigos esta re piola Desde que pusieron los bots se hizo mas piola el juego porque ni pinta jugar solo aunque sean medio autistas Lo malo del juego es que antes podia jugar al juego todo en alto y ahora con suerte llego a 60Fps pero bueno es lo de menos MENTIRA NO PUEDO JUGAR BIEN
Do not purchase this game because the developers don't deserve the support for their shotty work First the devs of this game finally listened to the community and re-released old levels Sounds good right but this was after a large amount of pressure and they would instantly ban people on the discord for mentioning how to play older levels But hey at least they finally cave but this brings me to my next point The old levels are still very buggy The first levels they ever released for this game came out more than a 2 years ago and they still have game breaking bugs in them They didn't bother polishing the old levels or fixing anything They just put out the old trash The devs don't deserve your support and your money
very scary very challenging
horrorfying and full of teamwork works well with friends needs more clothes options and some more machine guns
much scare
Fun game that keeps getting love from the creators You can still play this with one person and havee fun but it shines the most with friends
Scary and hard Just like the X rated stuff I like to see
1 Pack 2 3
They tell you this for players who value a serious challenge BUT what they actually mean is is that the game does NOT value your time While it is fun the fact that is it has no save mechanic and the levels can last over 2 hours I cant recommend this Not everyone has this much free time all at once much less coordinating 4 people to have the same There are bots with commands and I think a matchmaking system now but what is the point if I dont have the time to do the entire run in one sitting like the game demands The game desyncs for me and another friend of mine after roughly the 30-45min mark Sometimes the game starts desynced Doors not opening invisible players watching everything happen up to a minuet ago very weird Then you have to leave and come back which doesnt fix everything Its really frustrating when the animations on the sleepers get desynced Also dont hold a battery durring a checkpoint or you wont be able to drop it and your entire run is killed Mods dont allow progress of any kind so even if you wanted fix various things like lighting colors giving resource packs to your friends but it gives it to you instead or the inability to ping sleepers then you give up all forms of progression The devs seem to not want their game modded which makes an already difficult no saves allowed and buggy game that much harder I want to play the way I want to play so long as it only affects my private group not how the devs envisioned me playing
10/10 Rage Quit Simulator
Le jeu est bien par contre le gars qui a les de chute il faudrai lui faire revoir son code car t'as 1 chance sur 2 de tomber de 2M ou tu te prends 10 de ou bien osef tu tombe mais t'as rien La grosse du gars qui code avec le cul mis a part le jeu en vaut la chandelle
this game hates you
L4D
They made enemies that tongue-punch your fart-box 11/10
gARBAGE glad I only paid 21 not anywhere near worth 40 has tons of bugs like getting power boxes getting stuck in your hand even after going back to checkpoints sleepers walking through closed doors it's broken as hell
Very good game
h1 b 8.5/10 RUBBER CHICKENS b h1 This game contains some of the most intense moments I have experienced while playing a co-op game In one playthrough we spent around 30 minutes sneaking around some of the toughest enemies perfecting our approach and snagging the objective Only for the entire run to end when one person bumped into the back of one enemy sending the whole room after us immediately making us quit for the night Incredible
Unless you have 3 friends that are willing to play every Rundown with you this is a hard pass Hard to find randoms and when you do they are mostly a ridiculous chore to deal with You'll find 2 main types of players and a third subtype The first type will run around activating everything then die and waste all of your time and patience time and again until you give up and requeue Occasionally you'll find the sweaty tryhard type this one's interesting and refreshing They'll boss your around and make the game feel like work only for free You better cling to these motherfuckers tho since they're your only chance at finally seeing a new level in this infinite loop of boredom There's a third kind that's the premade duo or trio They will consider you their filler bot sub and treat you accordingly They will constantly make private jokes As the game progresses you will find them to be either the aforementioned suicidal noob or sweaty types just with a touch of creepy internet sadism At this point most of my in-game hours have passed while unsuccessfully trying to matchmake or searching in Discord spoiler Sad disclaimer this game only makes sense if you have 3 good friends who already own it and are committed to it strike I repeatedly failed to sweet-talk mine into it since they all found it to look repetitive and boring Maybe it could have been fun after all strike spoiler
Du mieux mais requiert toujours un fix pour le lobby Beaucoup de de synchro entre joueurs et des parties qui ne se lancent que si l'un quitte pendant le chargement Des tourelles avoir reco la partie Des mais un peu plus de la qu'avant
This game is beyond fantastic Mostly It's a shooter that's actually unique with a clear vision behind it slowly and tensely sneaking through monsters in a massive facility scavenging for scarce resources to stay alive hectic action and gunfights well designed missions with different objectives and goals and teamwork being required to make it out alive It is extremely brutal and unforgiving which means there is a very high skill ceiling and demands you learn how to play or die Guns are varied and feel great as does bonking enemies with melee weapons The art direction and atmosphere are stellar sound design and lighting are some of the best in the business and the graphics are incredible for the relatively small dev team However it has some problems Mainly bugs It's honestly embarrassing how often you'll encounter both unfixed long-standing and new bugs when playing Plenty are minor but many others can either heavily impact the game or just make it impossible to progress in your mission They aren't at Bethesda levels but it's really not great It also has connection issues especially for guests in a lobby Cosmetics are unlocked randomly as well and they are taken from a pool of potential items that is larger than the number of total unlocks you get Because of this you are randomly locked out of some of the cosmetics with no control over what you do and don't get which is beyond annoying Seriously game stop giving me more helmets and colors I have like 15 of each and only 2 torsos both of which are ugly as hell Weapon and tool balance isn't perfect either Beyond that there is also no replay value beyond improving at the game and helping other players complete levels There is no progression system challenges or anything else to encourage you to continue playing This could be a good thing depending on who you are especially since it allows players with less skill or time to still complete everything in a Rundown season without having to worry about additional content and replaying missions Also because close teamwork it can be very frustrating if you can't find competent teammates and keep failing because of them Finally it is very difficult to get into this game for new players since it's so disgustingly hard and punishing even with the newly added tutorial level The community for the game is generally very good though which is good to help those new players out and show them the ropes That's also great because a team is needed to do much in the game and the official Discord is all but required in finding said teams Despite the problems the game is excellent overall Very few things feel better and are more fun than steadily learning and mastering the game and each level and overcoming them as a team through communication and skill This is some good shit
JUEGO QLO WENO RECOMENDA3 PERO JUEGUEN CON AMIGOS LOS DEMAS SON MUY CRI CRI

The immersion is great and makes the game seem scarier than it really is and the emphasis on teamwork is reminiscent of LFD They just need more enemy types but so far I am enjoying it Highly recommend
Actual Game itself is decent for what little I played but you have almost 0 chance of getting a match without the useing the worlds most small pp website discord
i got out
Match system is old-school host-guest type so be prepared for extremely laggy session if you gonna play with friends over seas Tried my best for 2 hours but couldn't fix it Refund got refused
A little daunting at fists but when you learn how to actually play and get through rooms without loosing all your time and tools its really fun bots are hard to play with because controlling them in is limited and finding games to finish the levels you want to is hard due to a lack of players but hopefully that gets fixed over time also it needs to be said if you buy the game you own all there is in the game with a simple progression system and that is a major win in today's industry
i am in tears as we speak
this game needs to be optimized i meet and have better than the minimum requirements they are not accurate this game used to be great and as the updates came optimization got worse and worse i love everything else about this game please optimize more
Great game Well balanced and never gets old
10 5 20 40 9 30 2 6.5
Hours of pain and suffering
Very hard but fun i just wish i could see whats going on more then 2 of my time in the game
spoiler
almost perfect just matchmaking is a litle long but if you have discord its good also its best to play with headset
Great Game Great Community Absolutely no micro-transactions or shop Since there is no PvP and everything is PvE there is no aspect of TOXIC factor in this game The only negative i have about this game is the lack of dedicated servers so the only way to make sure you dont lag is to find people who are from your region from discord There isnt much in terms of progression other than unlocking bunch of cosmetic items the entire experience lies in experiencing the atmosphere and what it has to offer
game fun but no money
I still cant beat a single level after 9hour into the game lmao
nice atmospheric game and coop is strongly recommended even though you can also play with up to 3 bots instead.as a beginner you probably won't get far with them though it's a little sad that i only joined now at Rundown 7 and the previous ones are not available anymore as they get removed when a new one releases but i hope at some point they bring them back to also enjoy the older content maybe after a rework if necessary mechanic wise
b Introduction b When the game clicks with friends it works very well When you're playing alone with bots or with an uncoordinated team it sucks There is a ton of potential in this title but it is ruined by a development philosophy that makes it very hard for developers to add in new meaningful content A lot of these points will most likely be fixed from their roadmap which will obviously bump up my rating But the very slow development speed makes it hard to keep playing this one long-term h1 Review Score 6/10 7/10 with friends)[/h1 u Pros u list The atmosphere is absolutely fantastic The game does an incredible job with its graphics and usage of lighting You truly feel claustrophobic and you are not alone in the dark It feels very oppressive which is what you want out of a sci-fi horror game It's one of the strongest aspects of this game Sound design on guns turrets voices monsters and etc all sound very solid and meaty Every gun sounds punchy and monsters make distinctive echoes The music during combat sounds pretty great It adds a lot of tension and adrenaline starts to rush into your veins However I am little disappointed in the variety of music overall Although there is a lot of weird sound volume consistency that breaks immersion often for stealth sections The use of environmental hazards(except infection mechanic is very well done There were many times where going through a thick fog was this terrifying Especially when you see one right in front of you Going through every room feels like a puzzle to solve How you approach each room is up to you but fast and decisive thinking will be key to winning many rooms Very co-op heavy it rewards teamwork and coordination Very good planning with your mates to handle all the situation You need someone on motion-tracker duty you need someone on turret and defensive duty you need someone who is good with stealth kills and etc When the team is firing on all cylinders you feel like a cohesive unit The terminal are incredible immersive tool used very well The terminals allow for free keyboard usage The game will help you on how to use the right commands but when you are proficient in using them you feel like that hacker member of your group It may seem like a weird thing to compliment but rarely do I see co-op games ever do this and this game utilises it well into the overall game-play flow A good blend of Stealth and High-alert game-play Stealth is very important in majority of the room encounters but when you see a door with an alert warning on it you start going into planning mode However in later stages they throw way too many alert doors with so little ammo health in-between to work with list u Cons u list There is no gear progression or anything related to it Other than cosmetic progression which is okay but there is no weapon customisation either Temporary boosters are nice to have to help even the odds a bit but there is not much sense of accomplishment other than you beat the hard level You may argue that not all games need a progression system but all the points listed below gives it a reason as to why this game needs one as soon as possible In the road map they don't seem to actively working on implementing this at all There really isn't much for you to latch onto for long-term play here The game-play difficulty on later floors feel more like steep curves than gradual increases Because there isn't any sort of ways for your character to progress to keep up to new challenges thrown at you you honestly feel like weak from start to finish While you can argue that is part of experience it's not really fun when I explain the other game-play issues I have with this game Gun-play combat generally feels awful Guns never feel like they have any realistic accuracy to them hip-fire is mess and the recoil on scope is so high There isn't a way to customise cross-hairs or even remove them Muzzle flashes are so cranked up and exaggerated because of the lighting that I feel like I will have an epilepsy attack after unloading a clip Reload animations are lacking any depth to them which lowers the personality of many of the guns Guns that have high power like snipers or revolvers and guns with high starting ammo are always picked more often The game's decision to not give you 100 ammo is an interesting idea if it was done as a modifier in certain floors but not as the norm It poorly balances many of the guns to which one does more damage and has the most ammo efficiency rather than letting the gun shine through with their own niche Melee combat has never felt awful to execute enemies have inconsistent gore and hit boxes making it confusing on where their bodies was hit All of the enemies have fast mid to long range hard-to-read attacks that takes chunk of your health It feels very cheap and more frustrating than challenging or fun Severe lack of enemy types and design variety All of them pretty much look the same While they may act different or look bigger(smaller Their overall design is much to be desired There needs to be more stronger distinction for each type and bring new ones to the table After awhile they just feel samey and can get visually boring fast The infection mechanic is probably the most unlikable game-play mechanic There is a very limited way of lowering or removing it It builds up way too fast and a lot of ways to get in many of the later floors It severely punishes you for simply touching anything related to it It exponentially increases the difficulty without adding any meaningful game-play experience There really should be med stations where you can at least cleanse this infection but have limitations to it like one per person only Or have it so med packs cure a small portion of infection like 5-10 per use Or simply put a hard cap for infection levels like up to 50 Some tools feel far more powerful and useful than others I have played this solo and with friends a lot and gotten far in many of the levels Also I have seen other people play on Youtube and I rarely see people use Lock Melters or Long-range Flashlights C-Foam launchers or C-Foam grenades are TOO good to not have and Glow sticks are so useful and abundant Fog Repellents feel like they don't last long enough for it be used often unless forced on certain maps(infection fog strike]Lastly the removal of older content whenever a newer one is added This design philosophy makes it harder for the game to actually grow in terms of content Instead of improving and adding on top of current content they just outright remove it entirely strike So what you played in Alpha and what you play right now has been the same amount of content The environments still look similar enemies are still the same mechanics are pretty much the same and etc This creates a false sense of development in the game's life cycle Once you finished at least majority of the levels there really isn't any reason to come back to them So veteran players will run out of content to play for several months until the next rundown Disclaimer I am happy that old rundowns are coming back Just wish they add in new content in-between them as the game hasn't had any actual new content for years now But credit is due that it was a highly requested by the community list h1]Recommendation:[/h1 Full Price Not really wait for a sale On Sale Yes but only if you have a friend to play with Peer Pressure Yes the game will test your group's willingness to adapt to any situation
Fog is the most dumb part of the game you pretty much cant see anything and you have limited amount of defoggers It makes the game not even fun when you cant even see 1 inch in front of you went from good game to bad with the fog

Awesome Game
There's a checkpoint bug very easy to reproduce by accident that forces you to wipe your entire hard earned progress you've made in the current mission in this ruthless game which has been around for over half a year Unacceptable
God the matchmaking is atrocious really like this game and recommend playing it on the free weekends to try it out Lower levels are very punishing when your team fails and you out 1 hour and your left with 2/4 players guess it would be more fun with friends C shout out to the euro bros such good friendly team mates
lag
Too hardcore for solo players Finding objects in a map full of fog is the most annoying thing I've done

Meh
This Game is so fricking amazing 10/10 3 Sooo cool and really unique
This is a difficult game to recommend What it wants to do it does great but that is certainly not for everyone If you're looking for a really difficult and unforgiving 4p coop shooter with time limited maps and content then this game is for you PROS Immersive atmosphere Overcoming the challenging gameplay and finishing hard missions feels great The matchmaking on Discord works surprisingly well Good community as far as I experienced it CONS You go into maps blind so you have to pretty much trial and error your way through them Nothing is explained I guess this can be a PRO too Lackluster shooting Unforgiving difficulty if you die or make a mistake let's say you have less ammo or health than you need toward the end of a mission then you have to restart the whole thing There are checkpoints on maps but you can't continue from a checkpoint after you quit the game or leave the lobby Missions are way way too long There are lots of players when a rundown is released but as people finish them the population drops which kind of limits the people you can find who are willing to play Time limited content which you don't have access to anymore officially The story seemed interesting from the very few crumbs I got from the game but when I have to read a wiki to even understand the basics of where the fuck I am then I'll just won't bother with it
Truly a masterpiece that blends horror and fps so well Revolutionary
fighting uglies slinging bullets hacking locks yelling at teammates yes i recommend
Great with 3 friends I love the teamwork required and the oppressive atmosphere Tough as nails though expect to die a LOT
Awesome tactical horror shooter
fun game with friends we just suck but still fun
PROS Great atmosphere Satisfying to figure out a run Good mini-games/puzzles CONS Incredibly punishing and can get extremely boring when you figure out all you have to do is melee the entire game Runs take far too long with very little to no checkpoints Things start to look samey very quickly Gunplay doesn't feel good Unrewarding gameplay Not enough mini-games/puzzles All the enemy types pretty much have the same models If you play four players you end up choose the best equipment and weapons then never choose any others It feels like you can't play the game without 4 players Not enough weapons Not enough equipment not enough enemy types
ppl infected with hepatitis try to infect u thru forced sex
amazing game
After changing my psu my random reset/crash is totally gone game running smooth and gameplay was really good
Pros Amazing Atmosphere Great Sound Design Great Weapon Design Stunning Visuals Horror Elements Very Difficult Always On Edge Cons Very Long Mission Length No Player Scaling Not Solo Friendly Very Punishing Few Checkpoints Very Frustrating Overall I Think its a solid 8/10 the atmosphere the game creates with its flawless visuals and sound design makes for a really immersive experience on top of the cut throat difficulty creates a constant sense of unease around every corner The gun play and movement is very satisfying and intuitive and same can be said about the UI and HUD very sleek and thematic The enemy design is quite varied with many different types of monsters you need to either stealth or fight your way through But sometimes the difficulty can lead to frustration as sometimes over 30m of progress could be lost over tiny mistakes or mishaps and having to either redo the entire 2 hour long mission or get sent back to a checkpoint very far from where you are Additionally the game basically requires 3-4 real players either friends or strangers just to make the game relatively doable because of the fact that the bots that replace players are very uncooperative and because of the lack of difficulty scaling it can make solo or duo players get really frustrated with the extreme burden of handing the mission by themselves because the bots don't pull their own weight But other than some upsetting difficulty choices the game is still a really enjoyable time preferably with 3 to 4 friends and the game almost never fails to provide players with a sense of danger and intrigue as they venture deeper into the game
genuinely so fun
sound the alarm its fun
3 words Scary Shooter Fun
Great multiplayer action definitely better with four who know WTF they are doing Great action throughout

UPDATE 2024 The Devs have listened and made this game more fun but still challenging Keep up the good work I played this game for a solid 8 hours and at this point I cannot recommend it Positives are that the game is playable has great graphics gripping sounds and successfully creates an eerie and scary environment To really enjoy this game you need a squad of four people The reason why I do not recommend this game at this time is because the missions take too long are very boring and the intense combat and lack of ammunition are excellent but ultimately fall short of expectations The missions are super difficult which creates a challenge but also too long which sucks the fun out of the whole experience My recommendations are allow up to six people to play together make the missions shorter add some variety like maybe protect the VIP and a survival shelter mode This game has so much potential but is just missing the target and falling short of being a good game With a little work I can see the game becoming great
Matchmaking can be a bit iffy takes long to find a match the developer Discord helps a lot so you can find matches fairly fast The odd bug still present sometimes not often door opens for everyone else but not me seems ping dependent team wipe back to checkpoint and holding items cannot drop and must leave rejoin but not too often say 5-6 times in the 40 hours so far Be aware that this game ranges from hard to extremely difficult but all in all very very worth it Addictive and worth my money If you like easy and want to be able to play solo I suggest not looking here If you like a challenge and teamwork with that oh so sweet relief of that extraction scan at the end come join us Runs fine at 60fps on an RTX3060+Ryzen5600 at 2K at mixed medium/high but 4K on this is too much So not extremely demanding but not potato pc's either Visuals are very good but not groundbreaking(8.5/10 they fit the game nicely and make the fog and flashlights come alive 700 hours in Old rundowns being re-released Played through R1 R2 R3 and am now finishing up R4 Expected R1 to be hard after R7 but it was done in a day R3 in 2 days R2 was quite hard R4 is kicking my ass Conclusion Difficulty varies quite a bit between rundowns Ran into more bugs R7C3 being unable to rejoin more items not being able to be dropped unable to interact with anything giving resources to anyone including yourself unable to open doors etc this is more in R4 than others in around 40 or so runs solved by rejoining Another thing I noticed is the sound If you hear a sleeper left right behind the surround sound does a really good job of giving direction but not of elevation So you may think a sleeper is right behind or to the side when in reality it is way higher or lower This is the same on headphones and the PA surround setup I have so I do not think it is my system specifically also others have difficulty telling elevation On the developer Discord I suggested fixing this either DTS:X pathtraced sound or other smaller alterations to the sound engine whatever works but not sure they can do it will do it are planning it or ignoring it This is not massive or game breaking but seems like an oversight that should not be here for a game that aside from the bug here and there is so well set up Objectives are varied enough between rundowns same for enemies shadows shadow scouts tank immortal tank moms etc Gameplay is still the same fun as when I started very addictive I would still recommend despite the flaws
very tense
Updated review after 250 hours play and the decision of the devs to release all older content with some alteration changes This game is a unique hardcore coop dungeon crawler FPS with large amount of content for hundreds of hours of gameplay To better understand how large and complex are maps and game please look at the Rundown 4 maps This game have many good features for a good cooperation game built in chat voice chat commands compass drawing on a map unexplored maps optional rooms and objectives option for stealth or shooting friendly fire There are many different in part procedurally generated and designed large maps randomized resources placement and monsters randomized places of objective items Levels are lined up in order from easiest to hardest difficulty from Tier A to Tier E so there is many difficulties to choose Gameplay consist of around 70 stealth searching for resources items exploring covered map and 30 of action shooting running Some levels are non stop action but its around 2-3 maps out of 10 maps Both stealth and action can be very intense and difficult When you become better at stealth it gets faster and more action There is no leveling experience unlockable items microtransactions etc Everything is unlocked After completing a level you can only receive as a reward random cosmetic clothing item By doing levels you can collect and use later artifact boosters which increase small percentage different stats of weapon etc While many others coop games are linear here instead you have many Sandbox elements randomness and huge maps forcing people to communicate about where to go and what to do because mission objective might say to get to specific zone number or find specific items and it is up to you how you get there and how do you search for them Beautiful grapchics sounds atmosphere and effects and details like different cough sounds when infected Great difficulty and cooperation in different aspects Very good performance game using Unity engine I like very much different flashlights and unexpected teleports This game is so hardcore that in one mission it took around 1 hour 30 min to get to the mission choosing hub only to find out that now I also need to find a key to activate main mission or secondary The worst thing about the game is low amount of players and bad not working properly in game matchmaking and people not using it If you want to find players you will have to use Discord official GTFO channel This game is not for solo players or playing with bots because no scaling and it was designed for 4 players If you want to try it then try with other people first What could be done to improve the game Add server browser in game matchmaking add checkpoints or save to older Rundowns Add additional bot commands like Stay here and defend Add statistics history for level completion add more minibosses in new Rundowns PS In addition there is a modding community with hundreds of extra maps
This game is very good but there's cons Pros 1 Work together or die together this game is the definition of teamwork you can't play with randoms without voice chat and win you need friends and you need to work together to mange resources for everyone and don't get greedy and if someone dies EVERYONE DIES 2-Gameplay gameplay is fun with weapons that are different for every player and there play style it has some realistic in it like you need to reload the weapon manually instead of auto-reloading CONS 1-difficulty after 11 hours we are still in B1 this game is so fucking hard it's not like the fun kind of hard it's just too goddamn hard i am not a journalist player that complains about difficulty every 10 seconds but this game is the kind of game that needs a difficulty option to balance the game it's so sad because the game is so fun to play with friends for me i just want a game that is balanced and fun with friends and this is the game but it's not balanced at all i think this is the point of the game no ammo so much damage just fuck you player for now i recommend this game because i think we need to git gud
gonna keep this short i loved the game when played as it should havent had this much fun in a long time Now matchmaking sucks REALLY REALLY sucks it ruins it filling a squad may take hours sometimes ill be back when they fix matchmaking for sure
It's fun with friends it relies on a lot of Oh Frak moments Limited Ammo every mission is a stealth mission Everything you shoot used to be a person Overall Review Play with friends meet horrible ends
Love it
does not have enough revolvers
gud
hao wan
game is going on a less interesting way despite the new contents level design new monster design stealth and scan type could have been better a lot of bugs havent gotten fix checkpoint is a mistake and very buggy still a very fun and challenging coop game though i prefer previous rundowns
PEAK
Cara o jogo pra quem gosta de jogo esse aqui certamente o melhor E ainda por cima a comunidade maravilhosa geral ajuda quem precisa Se souber falar em melhor ainda
OVERALL not a terrible game The difficulty of the game isnt terrible if you have 3 friends that are capable the concept is really cool and I do love the tiny bit of story I was able to experience feels alot more of scary anticipation game rather than a shooter due to the dark ambiance and smashing of doors sleeping enemies and random moans and groans from those enemies I do like the changing missions and multiple cosmetics that are all free and workable towards during the missions limited guns and special tools due kinda of suck but on the flip side there all are relatively unique If you have three or even two friends to play this game with it will be a great game with alot of cooperation and determination could easily beat this game and achieve any goal with the levels changing every so often the repeatability is great and the free cosmetics are a bonus ontop If you have one or no friends who play this game then you out of luck you can play with randoms on their discord although the experience isnt the same as playing with a friend at the start wouldn't recommend this game if your a solo
Not fun very hard and repetitive
buen juego
So when i played this game for free it was fun Even better with other people and also i only played one level it was fun But over all i would rate it a 10/10 If i were you id buy the game its cool
GOOD
If you can get a group of people to play with this game really starts to shine The teamplay the enemies the low ammo grind it all comes together to make it feel like a true cinematic experience that you're in control of The sound design is also fantastic and really sets the tone for each time you drop into a level I haven't tried the bots filling a team at all so I can't really speak on that
h1]I absolutely adore this game and every aspect of it's gameplay.[/h1 It's a hardcore co-op shooter aimed for people who like to push themselves to their limits the game achieves that goal with ease as it makes you savor every last bit of resources you get and forces you to all work as a coordinated team It's a serious game and has very little room for silly and funny shenanigans though some may happen at times While all of the above are good I cannot bare to play this game sometimes and it drives players off due to the unreal amount of bugs it has I cannot compare it to Fallout god no but it gets close The number of times that we've gotten softlocked unable to pick up items e.t.c are more than I can count h1]A list of bugs that I have encountered:[/h1 Getting stuck carrying an item aka getting softlocked e.g Power Cell Fog Turbine Becoming completely invincible after getting hit by an enemy Falling through the map after getting hit by a certain enemy resulting in a softlock Becoming completely and permanently blinded after getting hit by a certain enemy Becoming immune to projectiles Having infinite consumables Getting stuck between game objects resulting in a softlock Randomly getting kicked to the main menu with no warning ending the run Enemies randomly waking up through walls or not waking up randomly Hitboxes being quirky Back hitboxes depend on your position not the angle of the shot resulting in many scenarios where the hits don't count as the enemy's back and often are quite buggy A lot of client side shenanigans such as the host having a major advantage when it comes to dodging No matter the distance from the host anyone who is connected to them can be hit through walls with melee attacks and from further away Enemies tend to teleport around and even run inside walls in some occasions Random crashes tend to happen a lot and people lose their boosters due to that The game does not save your boosters Checkpoints often cause things to bug out and desync people from the host often resulting in people being downed in inaccessible rooms upon respawning resulting in scouts touching them and waking them up sometimes Sometimes the Respawn From Checkpoint button doesn't even exist though it may appear later if you give it time which is often the case Sometimes people take random fall damage when walking down the stairs Excluding host Mines sometimes explode when the enemies collision boxes phase through the door Enemies can absorb C-Foam through the door resulting in some issues when you're trying to re-apply c-foam during an alarm The ally A.I tends to not be too co-operative For some reason they have FRIENDLY FIRE ENABLED They tend to not go inside scans or follow you through doors they sometimes phase through said doors to follow you which is great but wouldn't be needed if they followed you into rooms instead of staying outside and having to go through extra steps to fight with the A.I during high stress situations They are of little to no help when it comes to stealthing You cannot command them to kill a specific enemy and you cannot tell them to synchronize in order to kill a big guy all together No HDR support Sometimes you get credit for objectives you haven't completed All of these bugs are far from uncommon And while the positive ones are funny but rare the negative ones have led to hours of our lives wasted due to one thing gone wrong in the spaghetti code that this game is I love this game so much and the only thing that holds it back is the amount of bugs that it has Sure it can use some quality of life features like having a checkpoint at the start so you don't have to go through the loading sequence again or saves on checkpoints at least temporarily until the issues above are fixed but other than that the game would not even need checkpoints if it weren't for all the potential bugs that can happen I will absolutely change my review by the time these bugs are fixed but for now on RUNDOWN 7.0 Despite an update AFTER it's full release you can hardly call it more than a Beta Good luck Update Still buggy but PREVIOUS RUNDOWNS COMING BACK LET'S GO
i want to cry
It's pretty spooky lyk
A jouer en groupe Difficile mais progressif demande bonne com
Very cool game but highly recommend to play it with friends
This game is just Deep Rock Galactic if it was designed to waste your time and spit in your eye for wanting to play it I got it with 5 friends some liked it others didn't Those who liked it don't play it casually anymore and have moved on to other games Do not buy this game unless you have no less than 3 friends who want to buy it and coordinate with common advice given on the forums but that is no excuse for bad game design because this game does no scale for anything less than 4 players which is just incredibly lazy on the part of 10 Chambers Every single part of this game is designed to be tedious and frustrating and I never got the feeling of playing a hardcore experience In 10 hours of play time I can honestly say that I have a hard time remembering having fun at any point from the game itself The most memorable and fun things were glitches when the game was not acting the way it was supposed to If you want a 4 player experience there are much better options than this one The most common obstacle in the game play loop is stand in a circle to fill up a progress bar while you are set upon by hordes of melee and ranged enemies and cannot move Also your skin is made of paper and if you miss a single head shot you are a scrub and you need to reset because you just f*cked your resource management Also enemies don't always die after their head explodes because go f*ck yourself and don't play our game Sincerely 10 Chambers Only buy this game knowing well aware of what you are getting into and bring a full crew of people who are just as willing as yourself to learn the ins and outs of the game otherwise you will literally never win It is honestly a genius business tactic to grift 4 people into buying a game that takes more than 2 hours to learn how to play to get around Steam's 2 hour refund window Regardless if that was the dev's intention or not that's my impression On second thought don't but this game at all
Game definitely not worth 30 buck in my opinions Just play during the free to play weekend with the bois
Well i have played this for 32h Only with bots cuz i dont have friends to play with sadge but I still enjoyed it Graphic gameplay environment horror feel atmosphere a lot of weapons story sound fast loading difficulty High damage from falling even from small ramp long missions that you need to complete in one take What i would like to see in game skill tree with level upping weapon customization no skins but attachments scope muzzle grip tec
The game puts you in such a tension that you start to act paranoid at the slightest sound 90 of the time you think you have to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible Stress and tension are well reflected with the atmosphere and sound design FPS mechanics are satisfying and you really need to do some resource management Run-and-kill gameplay doesn't work here Also the community is very welcoming towards new players
Sweaty spaghetti best spaghetti
Amazing game
It's a hard game but you are encouraged to play it's really beautiful
when the squad says not shoot shoot
Most of my friends have long since given up and I don't blame them one bit The game is sadistically hard at times Runs can take hours even without wiping One wrong move can cost you dearly you can do everything right and still lose Sometimes the RNG Gods decide you only need Chem Lights instead of ammo or tool refill kits With all that said it has that same feeling of immense reward in overcoming all of that similar to Elden Ring and Dark Souls and finishing the run Doing what felt was impossible just hours prior is a better rush than most games will ever give My best advice is that you absolutely NEED to use the official Discord to find people to play with Unless you have 3 friends who are committed to playing with you you will not get far in the rundowns without utilizing the official Discord The Bots are borderline useless unless you become an absolute Chad micromanaging them and using the built in matchmaking system is arguably worse because at least the Bots don't constantly aggro and screw things up It doesn't matter if 3 of you are Navy Fucking Seals if your 4th guy is a idiot it will completely ruin the game 11/10
its tight
Prisoners kill bumpy people
Been there done that back in Left 4 dead Matter of fact L4D is probably better cause you could at least get through the level and it was fun And L4D had PVP so you could change it up a bit unlike this game If only this was a Aliens game and the dev's had a bit more imagination This would of been game of the year But sadly it's none of those things Just another game with desperate developers trying to grasp at your wallet And trying to hold onto their current player base with cheap lazy unique helmets TL;DR move along this is not the game you're looking for
Let them snooze
i actually came everytime a monster attacked me

I don't have much time in the game and its super fun A great fps horror game but I have one complaint The first online match I played was me and one other person I don't remember the name of and they had cheats so they didn't run out of anything and could not die so they ran through shooting everything and did not help complete the mission The game is fun but my first experience online was with a cheater This of course isn't the issue everyone runs into and at the end of the day no other matches have been like that Highly recommend
Great and unique game

Gierka dojebana ale trzeba git ekipke
No difficulty scaling when playing with less than 4 Overly long missions with too few save points Repetitive with a lot of the mastery just coming from memorizing the encounters Very steep difficulty when playing with a heterogenous group and forget about playing without voice chat and very disciplined coordination Most of that stuff is harder than destiny raids Yeah yeah I know just git gud but honestly I'm not sure I can convince people to stick with it long enough for that because we're not having fun
weno
Lo jugamos con mi primo Y interesante La manera en que se instalo fue muy buena Pero mejor fue cuando se desinstalo.(Aburrido
Good
pretty good
love the Potintal
the dark souls of payday
This game is rlly good The best game I've ever played I recommend it if you have 2 or 3 friends to play it and a night to spend hours playing it
the game is very glitchy and matchmaking doesnt work very well
Beat the first level in one hour Beat the second level in twelve hours
First off the game is very fun challenging and overall a blast to play WHEN YOU HAVE A TEAM While matchmaking is a good thing to have for this game most people dont use mics you never get a full team and people leave constantly The matchmaking system also crashes a bunch or will only match you with 1 or 2 people even though they are different people every time Some work needs to be done on this system Outside of that issue I love the game Weapons feel reasonable not over-powered but not useless Environment makes the game challenging some areas dark enough to hide enemies Overall it takes a degree of skill and teamwwork to complete a level Just make sure you have a team that communicates

O Jogo em si muito bom que parece que falta algo ainda pouca gente no server
Yeet
game's fun too antisocial to ask the discord for lfg though and matchmaking kinda sucks lol but I did complete A1 with a random and 2 bots and it was fun as hell big recommend with people who have friends that are willing to drop 30-40 on a game for everyone
bought it with friends and they all refunded after one match/10 great game
Very challenging but very rewarding AI partners make the game playable to an extent they ARE bots so don't expect too much but is definitely the best when played with people Bit of a learning curve until you get the hang of things
boom kapow
Sombis
It's just boring No interesting progression no interesting mechanics
if you really hate yourself this is the game for you
ganske bauls
I liked this game because me my friend Allen just completed the first area it was so fun I don't feel like writing right now lol
Fun as hell with friends who want to dedicate 2-4 hour blocks of time with you for a mission It takes a little while to get into a groove with this game Much about this game will try your patience but combat is great and missions give you a real sense of accomplishment when you complete them This game will grow on many of you but it's not for everyone If learning by dying is not your cup of tea this game will probably piss you off One bit of warning It's got game-breaking glitches such as save-state problems at checkpoints that prevent you from using the E use key which requires a mission restart to fix that potentially costs you hours of playtime and momentum It also has run-breaking animation glitches when certain enemies interact with you For a game that is punishing by design it really sucks to have such significant glitches show up from time to time
absolute blast small download for what it is is absolutly fun its hard and acutualy requires team work but theres no need to rush in it like most games it acutally incoruges you to take your time i highly recomend it sorry for bad spelling
Boring mechanics and not really that scary either Save your pennies and try it on a free weekend
From the serious lack of singleplayer support only might be worth it if on 50 or bigger sale

This gives me a sort of dead space vibe and i love it for the atmosphere they put into eat level design
the game play is honestly a 10/10 but this game is filled with an overwhelming amount of bugs to not call itself an early access title the bugs in this game completely ruin your game play experience or not even allow you to play the game I would sometimes be in a level spending hours just for the game to force kick you to the main menu level selection screen and when you re-enter the level you got kicked from the game makes you restart from scrap I think everything else in this game is fine but the bugs and constant loss of progress makes me dread playing this game as i hate losing irl time because the game decides to break halfway through a level or just flat out kick you and not save your progress ultimately i have gotten dozens of hours from this game and will probably continue to play but even though i enjoy playing this game it still warrants a negative review because these game breaking bugs and glitches have been in the game for multiple rundowns and are still as prevalent and completely ruin your game play experience
how to play
yokai likes males
absolute hell but addictive like meth
best game I ever played rich story and amazing character development Amazing characters and perfect soundtrack 100 worth your time and money K.Y.S
not worth
This game is hard and the only way to approach this game is brute force no stealth etc and that too wasn't that enjoyable when I played with 2 of my friends Also there wasn't a lot of variety in zombie types and they were mostly just melee or ranged with with little to no unique characteristics
Ich liebe dieses Spiel aber es ist leider sehr schwer Zum Okumbi immer von wo die Monster kommen und kann sie dann ohne Schusswaffe Meine Munition sofort alle ohne Okumbi Wir sind leider zu schlecht die zweite Mission aber die erste haben wir geschafft und das Neugeborene Baby Yoda gerettet Ich mag am liebsten die Schleimipistole die den Boden klebrig macht Die Monster bleiben da drin einfach und Kali oder Nekubi dann draufhauen Leider labert so ein Mann im Hintergrund und verlangt von uns irgendwelche Sachen zu besorgen die wir eh nicht finden Ich bin auch schon die Treppe runtergefallen und in ein gelandet weil die Maps so und sind Es macht trotzdem
This shit is even harder than my boner
Be prepared to use Discord to find people to play with otherwise a solid gaming experience Not for the faint of heart
Muy muy bueno
Creepy but cool
CONS Networking and Optimization Problems Enemies can hit around corners host crashes spawn problems players and objects falling through floors resource boxes facing the other way Bots alerting enemies just to name a few Previous Campaigns Rundowns are erased every season making it impossible to learn more about the lore in game New Campaigns Are Similar to Previous Ones and feels like a simple reshuffle of the map tiles After Finishing A Campaign There is No Replay-ability such as challenges or modifiers 40 May be pricey for those looking to play a lot similar to L4D style games like Vermintide 2 No Future Mod Support I've learned of some troubling behavior from the developers towards the community I've personally never experienced them but I suggest doing your research and watching some reviews online or reading how people feel about the game in the forums so you can come up with your own conclusions Personally there are too many red flags for me especially the censorship problems They don't even want you to talk about modding requests in the steam forums since it affects the image and sales of the game It's a shame since I was very excited about this game when it was first announced I've waited for years to try it with friends due to having a old GPU but now that I have tried it I sadly cannot recommend it I do hope it changes for the better PROS Pretty Graphics sound and atmosphere
For a game this committed to punishing every mistake and demanding a huge amount of time to clear a single level it is unacceptably buggy Just wasted hours and three boosters trying to clear the final stretch of R7C1 with a friend and two bots after a glitch prevented me from interacting with anything except un-sealed lockers and door controls effectively reducing me to deadweight while bots carrying objectives repeatedly got stuck on ladders and stole ammunition ultimately leaving me completely dry and costing us the run We could've tried again but we'd already wiped twice and it was 3 AM so we had to call it a loss Risking an investment to increase your chances of success makes sense when you lose that investment to your own mistakes not the game screwing you over The bots are bad as well The game is playable with less than four people technically but it's substantially harder considering the bots are stupid even when they aren't glitching out on ladders They lag behind they snatch items out from under you and use them at the worst times they're inaccurate and use weapons incorrectly wasting ammunition and even though they can't be detected by sleepers during stealth they will routinely get in front of you and stand on a sleeper you're trying to execute with a melee hit often forcing you to waste the opportunity or teamkill an ally If the bots are so awful that they make an already hard game vastly harder for a party of two players why bother including them Why let people believe that the game can reasonably played without a full party of four There's a mild players are obviously better caution on the store page but that suggests the bots are passable not saboteurs They might be passable in an easier game but GTFO is incredibly demanding and that difficulty makes their flaws not just unavoidable but turns them into a serious problem The bugginess and incredibly stupid bots are compounded by a deeper issue by the game's nature you can only play the most recent levels released as older rundowns are removed from the game when a new rundown launches locking you out of older content that's had more time to be fixed This kind of design is problematic beyond just escaping bugs though If you have an old level you like if there's an easier mission from a previous rundown you know by heart and want to use to farm for boosters to prep for harder missions deeper in the current rundown that's gone whenever a major update drops and despite the game's continuing attempts to bring in new players with things like the recent free weekend it seems content to leave them clueless when it comes down to a story that seems interesting but I have no context for This at its core is a good game The stealth is great it looks and sounds amazing the auditory and visual design are both incredibly evocative and it feels great to win against overwhelming odds so my friend and I will probably keep playing after what happened today But it sure did sour the experience considering we could have spent that time doing literally anything else instead of having it wasted by an inadequately tested release Not to mention that knowing any content I like will inevitably be swallowed by the content treadmill dampens what motivation I have to get further invested
Challenging game that involves planning rather than just straight gunning Very fun with a squad of close friends
Wer big discount EDIT Only 30 discounts and I feel I must ask again Wer big discount
still stuck on B1 at 8 hours but its pretty good i think
failed first mission 2x
Tis slow-paced and strategic yet a blast if you've got a squad to play with Difficulty increases rapidly though
great fun very difficult

Okay maybe it's alright
more fun if you have friends to play with
Personally I just love having naked mutations lurking in the darkness pulsating in their trances and reacting with paranormal phenomena as a weapon at the notice of my presence
It hurts to play highly recommend
Great fun with a group of friends Hardcore and a bit spooky
There's always that one guy who goes full LEROYYYY JEEEEENKIIIIINS
i got the fuck out

Very great game recommend playing with people you can talk to strategic playing and patience dont recommend this to people who dont like spending along time in a game
It might be for you but its not for me
Looking for a spooky night in with the boys and just got a dumb shooter lol
It's a very good game if you are into pain without receiving any pleasure in-return Worth the penny with the amount of time you can put into a single rundown But man oh fkn man you can really hate your friends and scream around at 2am I only dislike with how a lot of bugs there is in the game Such as launching into the pod/game by yourself despite having your team still in the menu One of the game breaking bug is that if you happen to have an item picked up during a checkpoint upon dying you'll respawn at the checkpoint without being able to drop said item
i love cursing at my friends and gaslighting them
lanjiao game so hard ply
Fun as long as you have a premade team
Incredibly immersive gameplay model ties in seamlessly with business model run by the devs for the game ie the Rundowns being reset bringing more varied content in quick spans of time due to behind-the-scenes techniques used to achieve this which even work with the story Few bugs here and there but I can tell the devs are highly dedicated Thrilling gameplay and incredible potential for future development Needs more people playing it
geiles spiel
If you have a group of friends to play this then i recommend buying this since its scary and its really fun 10/10
Can anyone link me hybrid or scout porn tq
it is a fun game
Fun quick-ish skirmish shooter with exploring aspects a dark theme and doesn't feel like a typical zombie game It can get difficult but it's not too difficult I love a challenge so to me the difficulty feel pretty good
lots of fun some bugs but an overall fantastic game
gd
one of a kind semi-proceederal generated worlds full of dark horror world building story telling and an amazing mutiplayer survival game all wrapped into one this is GTFO if you have 3 other friends Buy this game you wont regret it 9/10 would play agian and agian and agian
Better with friends as the bots can be buggy at times but overall a great thriller shooter
recomendo
game good
Had to replay B1 almost 20 times almost cried the 18th time this game is easy 10/10
Good game but get your WeMod ready first
The multiplayer doesn't work
still just as good as when i started playing especially when they added hel gun and scattergun and hel rifle and
The graphics lacking looks like an older game but the idea of it is very fun Especially with a teammate you can coordinate with
This game is really easy and fun for new players pls buy this game and play with me I have no friends uwu
The gameplay and graphics are outdated The mechanics are clunky and the graphics are from 2007
im too adhd for this shit
iz gud game
Horribly slow matchmaking and braindead AI teammates Game directly encourages players to use discord to find people to play with Personally I don't like use discord so finding a team is nearly impossible The gameplay is shallow It feels like its just one very long and drawn out MMO fetch quest The horde shooter part of the game also fails to deliver as the hordes are mainly small groups of ranged enemies that harass and shred through your health from a distance Setting seems nice In summary not worth the 40 price tag I recommend buying when it goes on sale over 50 off or just aquire the game through Other means
NOPE
just remove the pc hacking code bs as it is dumb as f at least make a guide on how to the dam commands as they game sure as hell don't tell you i mean you can get there in the end after sat at the pc for a good amount of time but here is endless waves of bad guys and you have to input some crap but we will not tell you how to do it guess il never be able to do them levels as you should not have to google how to play a game
GTFO 15-25
There are different tastes but it's fun However one thing that is regrettable is that I wish I could officially play the previous rundown
game braking bugs ruins this game to the point it is unplayable However it does not change the fact that I love this game
spent 5 hours in one level just for someone to go afk at the end and not be able to finish 10/10 game though
ok
Super janky in a lot of ways matchmaking systems are a mess and the bots need a lot of work and sometimes encounters can feel frustrating or unfair after 20 hours consistently killing scouts is still a mystery to me the quickness/distance at which the grunts start tonguing you from afar is infuriating but the core loop is just so damn compelling Think of this game as MMO raiding where clearing a rundown requires repeated attempts ongoing progression and LONG play sessions better set aside at least 2-3 hours to clear early 7.0 rundown expeditions But the sense of accomplishment is pretty impressive Hopefully the devs keep doing free weekends to get more people playing
I like the game although your internet has to be very good if your playing co-op its very sensitive me and my friends get randomly kicked from the game or glitch out doors not opening when another player opens it enemies are still alive even after getting killed by another player I suggest playing co-op on a LAN party
Game good
nice
On me On
would run from tentacles again 10/10
This game breaks so often it makes me cry Still pretty fun tho
It was rough getting it to where it is now but this is probably my favorite survival horror game It's dark its constantly nerve racking the combat is intense and everything fills you with a sense of dread 10/10
feels like playing 5 unity game with random assets slapped together Incredibly overpriced for what this game has to offer
much very good
they are 2 rooms away from your current location and rapidly approaching panic
they need to G(TF)O to the polls
fe
this game makes me blink
love the game for what it is as a whole
While not as polished as say Left 4 Dead 2 GTFO innovates on the cooperative first person shooter in ways no other game does and consistently delivers compelling objective based gameplay with nuanced stealth and exploration mechanics layered seamlessly on top of an air tight survival horror shooter As of right now it is excellent but with more polish it could easily be a masterpiece
Im disappointed and i didnt spend money Gunplay feels off guns feel like they are sliding across the screen rather then having recoil ammo is always lacking which can be good depends on the game and your playstyle but 4 player stealth will never work Unless you specify design the game around that which they havent This forces u to always shoot in a survival horror"in a map that dont contain little to no ammo which drains you more and more after every fight yes you can explore All the previous statements together with the fact that a mission is one hour long with maybe one checkpoint makes this the most frustrating game ive played in a while In my opinion a much better investment is to just get L4D2 and if you think its too easy play on expert versus I can't really put the words to why i dislike the GTFO as much i do but gameplay feels off and not balanced at all Stupid stealth mechanics the overall fact that the devs cant pick between action or horror and unnecessarily punishing four player coop Includes checkpoints and messing up stealth ruins the game Difficulty can make a game fun but every single death i suffered personally never felt fair as if the game was just No time for you die All these points together with the fact that they went the COD Zombies Tranzit route of filling the map with annoying smoke to cover up their messy graphics and say the game is immersive But all that falls apart when the game suffers from so many flaws like the gunplay Stealth and bs it doesnt work Overall i was severely dissapointed game demo that i played and its design if thats guns lore monsters it didnt matter because every single part had something that i disliked and i found to be poorly designed Dont follow the media and stay clear of this game Im not a game designer but you are seriously going say that the best monster design that you could come up with is naked tentacle head monsters
SEHR GUT UN SHON
Barely any players online even during free weekend There were very apparent bugs I came across despite being full release Great concept but unfun
wHy dO tHe BuLlEtS CurVe
better than Rainbow 6 extraction
This is very fun with friends but the AI tends to be trigger happy and far too aggressive to warrant playing alone Go in expecting a stealth horror game with some decent gun-play as last resort option when shit hits the fan and you will have a good time
GTFO is definitely a difficult game to play Tight teamwork and strategies are a must if you want to survive the monsters that lurk within the Rundown But even then it's an extremely fun experience whether on your own or in a team I'm excited to see just how much the game expands as the Rundowns keep getting bigger and more dangerous
h1 Chapter1 objective BGM Sleeper tryhard horror jump scare sleeper
Great light horror full action pact game with great use of refreshing the map pool with guns once evrey 15 weeks
The gameplay was vaguely exciting at first I like the aesthetic of the game all until you actually start playing it It starts to get very generic very fast On top of that I had a game-breaking bug in my very first mission and couldn't progress I did this on a free weekend but any other time and I probably would've refunded this Pretty disappointed
Needs carry win

Great game but keep in mind it will be difficult missions are long and you definitely want 3 other people to play with It has bots but they are awful

hard asf but fun with friends
good
pretty freaking cool
UI

gun go bang and sleeper go squish
Barely works net code is abysmal terrible fall damage Half of my time played is trying to get the game work online Sucks big balls
really good game got a lot of ambiance and good game play would hope to see a bigger game play update some things still seem quite buggy
super hard but super atmospheric for those who enjoy being fucked this is the game for u
i would say that the game is fun but in 5 hours of playing I have found more random broken bugs than seems worth it
I can't play this game It gives me absolutely awful motion sickness The way the menu parallax/ghosting works is horrible and has no consideration for people with motion sickness issues I'm sitting here typing this trying not to vomit after playing it Seems like a cool premise but the menu presentation is a dealbreaker for me I wouldn't normally fuss about menus but causing me to get that bad of motion sickness that fast is insane
cant sex monster
Gaem is hard but fun
Gud game to play with a squad of 4 if you have friends to play with
GTFO is sweaty I feel like that's common knowledge The game doesn't pretend to be something it's not and its pretty difficult The slogan of Work together or Die together is spot on the money If your team doesn't cooperate with you everyone does their job you will die That being said Pros Is hard Combat pretty good Several Rundowns or seasons updates A horror survival that's still scary with a gun in your hands Fairly priced Cons Is harrdd Game sucks solo there's discord server to counteract that proceed with caution Still glitchy from time to time My biggest takeaway currently is that it has it's ups and downs like any game However GTFO has a pretty decent balance going on here Paired with the difficulty of the game if thats your cup of tea it's absolutely worth trying out Fair warning though its a game with a very high skill cap and a very slow learning curve You can't just pick it up so to speak But The community is happy to get new players and show them the ropes Lord knows we were all lost and confused at some point too
its alright
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME This is not a joke a meme or any form of Humour I Got this game for the sale i had a lot of fun with my friends playing it we had lots of fun in the atmosphere and the stealth HOWEVER After a restart bug where the objective Egg you need to carry a device from deployment to a objective and use it at the end of a level Duplicates itself we had a bit of a laugh that we had 2 of them but we attempted to move on the with mission with a little extra handicap as the member of our team was unable to drop it so it was 3 of us playing a 4 player mission At one point i had to reload my gun go figure you need to reload in a shooter and as i did the game froze For about 2 min i could talk on Discord with my team still but then that froze up and then the system froze Thought nothing of it bad coding right UNDERSTATEMENT After i had to hard OFF my PC to make the freeze stop My computer went into a BSOD Loop on Boot and windows REFUSED to start with a BSOD stating that the Registry was corrupt NOT HAPPY So i went on a mission to recover it and the nightmare got SO much worse this happened at 1 AM I Was trying to recover it till 9 am when i finally had to sleep when i woke up I Attempted to recover with windows CD Windows recovery drive Recover with previous ISO recover with command prompt SFC Scannow DISM Online Cleanup-Image ScanHealth chkskd there was more but i cant remember them all even attempted a HIVE recover with the registry all failed After i woke up and spent close to 4 more hours trying to Slave the drive and access it and THAT FAILED i was livid and then busted out the Linux using Ubuntu to try and slave into it to try and fix/recover it failed i finally succumbed to Format but then Formatting failed i tried to Install Ubuntu over it and let it format Failed I tried to delete the partitions and rebuild them FAILED only to then find out the drive is locked in Read Only I grabbed software so.so meany to try and unlock it Failed at this time it was around 3 PM Angry is not even close to describe my rage at the time so at that point i gave up and rushed to the PC store and had to buy a new NVME M.2 WD Black and now i'm telling you seriously in all my years never has anything like this happened this game is awesome fun and had Mountains of potential but after this experience I'm telling you this is the most risky software in all of steam It may not mess everyone's HDD's up but i'm telling you it Bricked mine If you INSIST on playing this game i recommend make backups but as i found out they might not work as i had backups and they failed PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK
if you have friend this is how u loose them 10/10
I find this game really really hard to recommend In many ways I think it's brilliant but in so many others it just doesn't feel good For instance the matchmaking in the game itself is poor and you'll find it difficult to match with well anybody This of course is not too horrible considering you can find people to play with by using their discord but that's not exactly easy or convenient However my biggest gripe with the game is just how commitment is involved in every run Once you go in you either beat the mission or go back to the menu and start from the beginning There's checkpoints but that's only for while you're playing the mission You cannot start back up from them I just don't have the time to spend a continous hour or more playing a single level and I highly doubt most other people do too The easy way around this is to just lookup guides on the level or whatnot but I think that takes away from most of the fun I enjoy theory crafting how a team should be put together or what our next goal will have to be Other than my own personal time restraints I think the game is cool and I do recommend it There's fun to be had going in with a group of friends and trying to figure everything out for the first time or challenging yourself to beat a level in a certain way or under a certain time limit It's a good game held back by how much commitment is needed for a level
This is a really cool game with friends yes
xd
10/10 Glowsticks
Love the game Incredible fun with friends
is dope
Great game that is actually difficult unless you're coordinated and fun The horror aspects could be ramped up a bit but the tension and anxiety of losing tons of progress from messing up really gets you on your nerves and it's a great play in short bursts but I can see it getting repetitive if you're not with the right people
Glowsticks
yes
Stress incarnate
this shit is scary but fun best to have a full squad with mics
1 2 3
holy shit this game is fun def worth cheaper on cdk btw
this game is amazing you really have to work as a team Great game
Zombie coming and booming my team D
This would be fun if the bugs weren't game breaking
I'm really glad I finally decided to purchase this game It's a very unique and fun way to do a co-op shooter It has a mix of stealth and action gameplay with a strong focus on tactics and teamwork The gameplay itself is very satisfying and has a great mix of weapons tools and items The game is very difficult and resources are scarce If you prefer more casual shooters or want an adjustable difficulty this is not your game Despite the difficulty the bots are surprisingly good and can be commanded I haven't had much trouble finishing missions with them I'm only scratching the surface and loving it so far Overall I would highly recommend this game
Matchmaking seems totally broken Tried to play with my brother and we couldn't even get in the same lobby Not worth the effort
Can be difficult but the challenge is fun
You bonk people
I WANT to like this game so much but it is SO hard to find a group via matchmaking The Only reason I'm making this at Recomended is because I'd actually like to see more people buy and join this game There Are glitches rare game crashes and graphic issues Sometimes But what game doesn't these days The game itself is a Lot of fun with a decent concept The main issue is the missions are Very long checkpoints aren't generous all things considered and it's hard to find people I've sat in matchmaking queue for 10 minutes Occasionally it'll just boot me out Occasionally it'll drop me from matchmaking entirely and force me to requeue Sometimes we'll start a match with 4 people and land with 3 after waiting through a slog of a loadscreen that fttftffft's in your ear Sometimes a friend will leave the game in lobby and it'll randomly put me in with somebody else Most of the time we can play 25 minutes of a level and lose and somebody will leave At that point it's hard for 3 people to continue and bots are just short of useless Or I don't know how to use them properly I Want to like this game It's Fun it's new it's fairly engaging it doesn't hold your hand it's stealth based with shooting it's coop It's just the Right level of spook But where are the players
It's left for dead but way slower and methodical it's not for everyone
good game
very scary and very fps beginner friendly

Finally pulled the trigger and got the game Very difficult but a lot of fun You can join the official discord and find a group to play with easily I've heard that game crashes are a big problem I haven't had my game crash yet However my buddy had to play in like 5 minute increments because his game kept crashing problem seems to be resolved now If you like difficult games that require a lot of teamwork and coordination I think this game is worth trying
1-2
SCARY AND HARD BUT GOOD
Good game guys I I need to go hug my wife for a while That's how my friends and I felt after finishing the first mission back in Early Access To say it was tense wouldn't really be doing it justice It was harrowing at times Now that it's all grown up and sold as a complete game I'm happy to say that not much has changed and what was changed has made the game better The addition of bots ensures you're never missing essential firepower or simply a mule to carry ammunition and health Communication has improved greatly The difficulty curve while still steep has been refined so that you're not instantly overwhelmed Earning minor buff artifacts cosmetics and the like through gameplay is welcome and allows for greater character customisation At its heart it's a co-op stealth game and the underground complex you delve into is a good mix of environments from dark cave systems to harshly lit high tech security checkpoints and laboratories You're sent in to complete some sort of objective which could be retrieving or delivering a maguffin finding data or whatever The levels are large split into sections and divided by security doors Your map only fills in as you explore so finding your objective can take time as you use computer terminals to ping specific items or locations and choose one route over another based on how many enemies you'll have to get past On that note in most rooms you'll find Sleepers Once human but transformed into grotesque monsters with far too many teeth in all the wrong places Real body horror stuff If you're quiet don't move while they fidget in their sleep and don't shine your torch at them you can sneak up and take most of them out without a struggle Often you'll need each group member target a separate Sleeper and organise a stealth kill on the count of three to ensure no witnesses It is inevitable that you won't be able to stealth kill them all Maybe they're too close together maybe someone hit their target too early or too late maybe a security door triggers an alarm maybe it's just dumb bad luck but sooner or later a Sleeper WILL sound the alarm and for a few incredibly tense minutes it becomes a horror survival co-op shooter as a horde of John Carpenter style fleshy abominations descend on the group scuttling disturbingly on all fours or Naruto-running at you to bite chunks off A good team will immediately close up check their lines of fire deploy sentry turrets and prioritise targets Eventually the horde peters out and you can lick your wounds take a breather and go back to the stealth game But even if you all survive without a scratch you've used up precious ammunition and the next time it happens you won't have enough bullets for all the Sleepers and it's going to be rough Most times when you complete your objective you have to make it back to extraction with the whole complex on alert and an endless horde of Sleepers chasing you and you will very much regret having spent your bullets unwisely Get to extraction and you're pulled out of the complex You unlock the next level of the complex and you can have a brief rest before you're sent in again The way the encounters are spread out is really well done The tension builds up beautifully before a big release in a frantic firefight before building up again Mistakes early on are rarely lethal but the cost in ammunition and health will definitely pressure further in The enemy design is inspired albeit thoroughly upsetting Many Sleepers retain just enough in the way of human features to remind you what they were but the rest of them is abhorrent and disgusting There is a story which mostly develops naturally as you go through the missions There's plenty of extra lore hidden in computers around each level if you want to read it but it's not forced on you The labs the security the enemies the directions on the walls and the rare but informative voices on the intercom they all hint at dreadful unethical experiments and mad science that went horribly wrong Storytelling is mostly show don't tell and it suits a game like this perfectly It's bloody hard It's frightening You'll jump and swear a lot and you may get your friends killed But while it's tough it's also fair and with a little teamwork and a half decent aim you can get through If you have friends to play it with I can't recommend it enough Solo Mmmmmaybe not so much Although the bots aren't useless at all playing solo does mean you miss out on the satisfaction of teamwork and planning and the helpless laughter and screaming when the plan falls apart and you're all devoured by something with more teeth in its head than the lot of you combined Fabulous spoops and frantic gunfights heartily recommend
Has potential but so much feels forced in this game to make it more difficult and less fun than it needs to be
Pretty dang fun with friends Unfortunately not really that scary but that's kinda hard to do with a multiplayer game anyway It's suspenseful and when you figure stuff out without the game telling you how to you feel smart Very cool
After reconsidering my previous review I have decided to recommend this game but with caveats and some decent changes TL;DR Devs have rescinded on previous stances that overall make the game better and I have decided that my hopes for this game outweigh the bugs and desync FPS Stealth horde shooter with limited resources and very difficult content Great game unless you don't like insane difficulty The Jist Chamber12 is creating truly a unique FPS experience A stealth horde shooter with limited resources and a very hands-off objective system The missions in rundowns start easy and then get difficult with a D The joy of this game is in being able to complete all the D and E missions as well as their Prisoner Efficiency objs Beating this game with a well-juiced team that you trust is insanely satisfying Despite the bugs and the other issues I keep coming back each rundown because this game is just that promising Cons Bugs that were present at early access launch are still present and have had not fixes as well as some newer bugs The biotracker red dots checkpoint fuckery in general occasional bad enemy hitboxes fall damage when running down stairs melee reticles bigging even when at range and others Desync is a major issue sniper melee teleporting terminal ghost resources upon reconnect map fog of war reset on reconnect sometimes resetting to default ammo on reconnect earlier mentioned hitbox issues and others Supposedly devs are on record saying they can't fix it but that is not enough of an excuse in my opinion Even if it is not in your skill set if you are a game dev you have an obligation to provide a stable multiplayer If you don't know how to fix desync someone else does The devs introduce systems that hurt intermediate players while not actually challenging solo players Stamina is just honestly a load of horseshit This game is almost friend-mandatory Matchmaking and bots sucks tbh Discord is thankfully pretty large for finding groups Pros Devs have lessened their iron fist stance on mods They allow to some extent but they don't have a hard-on for shutting them down now Devs have rescinded their previous stance on gone-forever rundowns In my opinion this is for the better If you want to do some Unnus Annus/FOMO shit in a video game it is not going to go well Revisiting the previous content allows for more people to play and stay interested That simple Guns feel great The story is pretty interesting once you filter through the logs on terminals and stuff Decent gun balance for the most part Cosmetics are a nice touch Weapon skins could be cool The adrenaline from scout killing The mission format and how you have to get intel on each mission and make simple or complex plans me and the bois out at 2am looking for BEANS

GTFO GTFO es una experiencia con una densa un survival horror donde su principal atractivo es el modo cooperativo y es donde encuentro tal vez el primer problema este juego se disfruta al 100 si juegas con amigos es una pesadilla jugar solo pero no imposible Jugabilidad este juego incita y premia el sigilo y la la de enemigos dormidos exceptuando secciones donde van a llegar hordas de estos la muchas de armas no silenciadas que tienes que depender de armas cuerpo a cuerpo la de veces aparte que los suministros son escasos las misiones cambian de objetivo cada temporada un problema que veo es que una de juego puede llegar a durar 30 minutos lo cual lo vuelve una experiencia algo pesada 7/10 La esta bien realizada la verdad si logra atraparte las animaciones los y la propia oscura del juego los enemigos tienen su lado pero esto no quita que es un shooter 10/10 En resumen este juego se disfruta puramente en cooperativo se premia el sigilo porque los recursos son escasos la dificultad es elevada y las sesiones de juego son largas pero la atmosfera y tension del juego lo valen completamente si no tienes ningun problema con los puntos mencionados bienvenido seas prisionero 8/10 un juego que puede no ser para todos pero si quieres una experiencia cooperativa es un must have
made me poo poo my pant
If you like a intense game then this is it This game has me at the edge of my seat when ever I have to wait for a alarm to disarm but dam is it fun I like the fact that if i join or if randoms join me i like that fact that the game can still go south me personally I like it when i have to struggle with game
GOOD THE G IN GTFO STANDS FOR GOOD THE T UHHH STANDS FOR TRANS RIGHTS AND THE F STANDS FOR FUN AND THE O STAND FOR OOOOOORE MINECRAFT ORE WHICH IS GOOD TO HAVE
It's not for everyone and you need people to play with but it's a great unique experience
10 10
This game is buggy as fuck
Haven't slept since 10/10
Best 40 I've ever spent
its a game where smacking a sleeping monster's butt can mean life and death it also allows for you to get exercise for your heart without even leaving your room
Game is fun with friends its better if your the friend who is too dumb to learn and keep waking the sleepers D
Good
very epic very gamer
The reviews stating that coop is mandatory are false and are not up to date I finished tier A1 on my second attempt and tier B1 on my first attempt just with bots The game IS easier now in general and also the newly added AI are more capable than many players probably are with only a few instances of micromanagement required In fact they don't make critical mistakes immediately obey your decisions and always support eachother with high cohesion I imagine the game could even be easier with AI depending on your comrades At least in the first two stages They saved me from damage and possibly death multiple times directly They make minor mistakes such as being unable to follow moving security scans which I think slowed our override speed but i'm unsure leaving some items behind and being unable to open doors to get to you close doors behind them They also cannot synchronise stealth kill but instead scramble at an alerted enemy with melee But I did well anyway it seems I had a lot of fun too However all this being said playing with friends was more fun and like dropping down two more difficulty settings as the enemies no longer target you as highest priority But it's worth it and you can progress in single player that's the point of this review as it's what stopped me buying it years ago when the game had less of a difficulty curve
sledgehammer
This game is great All you need to do is get three friends together and
its fun to play with freinds or mess around
Buen juego pero la fase C1 es infumable
It make me go poo poo
I really want to recommend this game but I won't even bother talking about the mechanics There's simply too many bugs dysfunctional matchmaking and it just sours the whole experience The core gameplay is enjoyable but multiplayer stealth is difficult If anyone messes up everyone is punished and because there's 4 of you there's 4x the chances for a mistake The shooting is good enough but more often than not enemies teleport lag and jitter standing up in a single frame due to stagger animations attacking you before their model has finished climbing up a ladder The game has been out for a long time and yet I've encountered 20 serious bugs that completely ruined the experience Enemies randomly waking up in stealth invisible doors visible doors that are not there for my teammates These issues are apparent and constantly complained about by the community yet the developers do not seem to recognize or admit that they exist offering no help on their Discord although they make it seem like they do Edit A harsh review but looking at it later I still agree with it Many issues I encountered have been in the game for far too long It's fun But as usual it needs work I'm sure the devs are doing their best But man bugs in a long hardcore game like this SUCKS
they are coming
This game requires cooperation time and patience I recommend you look up a guide while you're playing as GTFO has a Failing in order to learn mentality The key to winning is to know everything you can about what your weapons and tools can do which the game doesn't tell you directly This game is not for everyone but the time and effort you put into the levels makes them all the more gratifying to complete
Fuck nate all my homies hate nate
It's a game of red light green light stealth with the occasional break for wave defense at a door Graphics are great and it is has a nice atmosphere but I wouldn't call the stealth mechanics challenging or innovative just incredibly tedious Enemies all look the same with maybe 5 different types that all share the same basic model with some tweaks and scaling Biggest detractor though is how incredibly long the levels are It can take over two hours to finish a level at times on a perfect run without even accomplishing the secondary objectives There are checkpoints but they are few and far between and you cannot save and pick up another day If you could just save your game I would be far more inclined to play but coordinating 4 adults with jobs and lives to dedicate the time this game really needs to accomplish anything really is not worth the effort
What a Game Good to Freak Out It needs Teamplay to really achieve something otherwise your done
game is fun
Strengths 1 The gun mechanics offer a satisfying experience with a commendable level of realism in handling firearms However players are advised to ration their ammunition judiciously for set-piece confrontations rather than indulging in frivolous shooting with the game's array of conventional weaponry imbued with futuristic elements 2 Diversifying the gameplay are a variety of gadgets and deployable assets reminiscent of iconic features seen in classics like Aliens These additions not only add flair but also provide strategic depth and invaluable assistance during gameplay 3 Immersion is further heightened by the game's stellar sound design particularly notable in the atmospheric corridors where players are enveloped in an unsettling symphony of eerie cries and ominous noises emanating from lurking adversaries Weaknesses 1 Despite the inclusion of AI companions the true essence of enjoyment lies in coordinating with a well-organized team utilizing communication tools Given the game's multiplayer focus solo play may lack the same level of satisfaction 2 The core gameplay loop risks monotony particularly evident when players find themselves navigating levels with scarce resources due to unfavorable circumstances This repetitive nature can detract from the overall experience 3 While customization options are available they remain limited in scope and would benefit from further refinement and expansion to provide players with more meaningful choices
I crashes on drop Cant even play it
If you like difficult co-op games with many heart racing moments and careful planning you'll love this Worth full price but get on sale if you are unsure
h1 WA GTFO h1
Easiest 3 levels of my life
gudddddddddd
if a horror game remained a horror game even after giving you automatic firearms
super mega good
I wasted at least 4.5 hours only to die at extraction on the 2nd mission This game is brutal as advertised
the fog is annoying
fasza
Rundown 7 Dauda P.S D2 AWOL(Rundown 7 ANAL
I love my team but I hate fog
This has to be one of the most intense games I've ever played in my life I was used to tarkov but this This is a complete new level of hardcore where total coordination is key and a shooting everything isn't gonna solve anything
GTFO is difficult stressful and hectic at times but it makes you feel good when a group comes together and makes a plan that gets executed well Sure there may be bumps in the road that make you slow down and lose progress but the satisfaction of beating it is immense and definitely worth the effort For reference I am bumps in the road
I shatted and wee-wee'd my pants playing this more times than grade 8 playing SlenderMan at 3am challenge
Super fun and high quality
Came back to this after a long time and its way better now with matchmaking and checkpoints 9/10
k
Very spooky shooty gam very fun with friends
Great game Lots of fun with Friends Alarm doors Pain
THIS GAME IS BULLSHIT
Quite good Hard but good Definitely recommend having a group to play with Bots are OK but make sure you tell them what to do They won't just be intelligent and autonomous besides shooting things
DON'T BUY THIS GAME Its just a hardcore pve game 3/4 hits your downed sneak around constantly to conserve ammo because you never have enough The Loot is not loot Its just ammo/med/tool packs Haven't seen any gun customization You try to beat levels to unlock more levels I don't see a point to this game I wish I could refund I bought this on a whim Now I am left with regret Oh BTW this game is riddled with game breaking bugs Half the time we would get stuck or have to reload Its awful
this game is literally if annie and the art gallery was good
I have no friends
At the time of writing this I've only played it for a small bit but I can safely say that this game is fantastic and a perfect co-op experience for anyone looking to get a fright I've never played a game with such a unique horror environment and a very hard one at that GTFO isn't an easy game at all and it takes a lot of learning most of that done through trial and error If you feel like this is for you then please get this game you won't regret it Do keep in mind that some levels can take up to 3 or more hours
good game
the few hours of playtime made me feel HEHE and i went WEEEEEEE towards enemy
Fun game but the asking price to have a full party is ridiculous considering the relatively limited content and how the game is significantly worse if you can't round up four players
Really fun with friends and you can ez meet new people I wish it was little cheaper
i opened a door
honestly although it takes quiet a bit of time its actually very fun to play
My friends won't play cuz they some big ahhh bussies Game is pretty cool and fun if u got friends to play with that is 10/10 fr fr
Expected some horror co-op kind of game and all I got was repetitive missions not to mention my overall experience was ruined by gamebreaking glitch which made me unable to do anything so whole fun from co-op turned into plain feeling of being left out It might be good but I definitely dont recommend it its much worse than I expected it
Great game but match making is broken Fix co-op matchmaking I can't play with friends AND randoms
really fun
Dos dos
muy buen juego para pasartelo con amigos los primeros dos intentos super divertidos pero cuando pierdes en la misma orda again and again ya deprime ajhsjas menos mal que hay un monton de mapas y misiones
every mission feels samey gets old pretty fast
No Achievements pleading_face
Fantastic game all around great atmosphere great sound design really interesting and scary world and well made designs of level characters enemies and concepts alike all complimented by its unique story telling and menu/UI that never pulls you away from its world and immersion Truly a well made horror themed science fiction co op game with a great emphasis on teamwork and patience Only small thing to say which is not really a big deal at all because i'm sure the devs will eventually expand on this would be the lore With a such an interesting world now released in full and out of early access the lore hidden behind GTFO's static riddled and incredibly Aliens esque darkness dripping with a unparalleled and rich atmosphere that seems to strike a chord of something between dead space metro and blade runner is something that can't be ignored Every piece of unspoken and spoken dialogue be from the incredibly mysterious Warden to the prisoners who with personalities and traits that are equally as mysterious are incredibly well crafted and realised all parts of the lore begged to be expanded on This is a universe i would personally love to see books movies and comics books made of if the devs wanted it that is I honestly think 10 chambers made something great here and it will continue to be great in the ever foreseeable future God willing Easy 9.5 out of 10 for me with the exception being wishing the lore be expanded on more
90 of the negative reviews are related to skill issues people who don't want to learn the game or people who don't like a challenge Don't be discouraged by them this is a great game if you have the patience to learn strategies and understand the mechanics If you don't want to play solo the official discord is a great way to LFG with great players who are willing to teach the game
a game that was certainly one of the games ever made
Super bugged Every attempts at second mission ended up in the game bugging out
If you like playing red-light green-light this is the game for you
Don't make games if you don't know how to make games
THE SERVER IS RIDICULOUSLY AWFUL WANNA PUKE INTO YOUR VAGINA WHY IS THIS PIECE OF SHIT CAN BE SOLD IN THIS HIGH PRICE

Good concept I really enjoyed try harding it However it has been suffering from optimization iddues lately and bug hunting is not really dev's priority
good
UI is confusing and unable to even get to the playing it Confusing on what to do initially in game Reading does help to progress within the game Took way too long to figure everything out Apparently there is a tutorial but unable to find initially Would recommend to just play something else as it's not worth at the moment for 40 Even on the sale there is better games to play
I want this game to be good so bad I really do The whole concept is awesome but there's glaring issues that prevent it from being enjoyable My friends and I have simply just had enough of its shit TL/DR Difficulty is arbitrarily hard and the game has annoying bugs that really build up to create a not-so-fun environment and when shit goes wrong it is very discouraging to continue Some of the major bugs having been here since launch b]Here's a few Problems[/b list Unable to pick up items or the package after a situation happens death checkpoint reload etc Unable to do anything after a situation death checkpoint reload etc Enemies being able to attack you through walls melee or ranged Full-charge melee sometimes not killing the lesser creatures Yes the very first ones you encounter Alarm doors legitimately being too difficult unless you're prepared in a very exact fashion RNGesus fucking hates you Have fun finding only 1-use Ammo Packs in levels after A1 list My biggest problem with everything here is the difficulty Being swarmed is fine it's exhilarating but when the lesser creatures do lots of damage i]and[/i move quickly you're whole squad goes down quick If you're last man standing there's almost no chance to recover unless you manage to pull off some epic pro-gamer kite So lessen the speed or lessen the damage Then high-level alerts will actually be enjoyable because you'll be able to survive Playing perfectly starting with each character having an optimized loadout not using any ammo as much as possible collecting necessary tools like ammo packs and tool refill packs setting up a defensible position none of it does jack shit Sometimes you'll survive most of the time you will die And that's not fun It needs to be at least a 50/50 chance at the big moments I know the game is supposed to be difficult but it's annoyingly hard
spooky and pain with or without friends bots are extra guns and nothing else which makes me sad
uyy nos rompieron el orto
Unless you have another 134 bucks to dish out to buy for 3 other friends I would not recommend this game playing solo is cancer
so they finally stopped rotating content out i was one of the people requesting this change for a good wile but i guess it took them needing to keep players around before they finally did the change since you really only had sweats play this game all running meta loadouts and speed running a slow paced stealth game lol unfortunately this game still has some big flaws and i dont even mean the bugs this game is not only still in alpha but its very much disappointing the longer you play you basically have to come into missions with prior knowledge of whats to come so you can best prepare weapons for the levels since not every gun is going to help you depending on how the mission is set up for the nay Sayers you could enjoy using a sniper that does high damage then find out the majority of the stage is covered in fog so thick you cant see but maybe 5-8 feet past your face making said weapon pointless unless you wanna be a cod quickscoper the other big issue this game suffers is the guns wile the gunplay is actually rather top notch feeling very nice to shooting and aim with the overall performance is a joke to which the sweats will stand by as if its perfect and needs to changes and that anyone who says otherwise is just bad you have no gunrange to test weapons and are only able to see the numbers of weapon stats on a wiki so you get a very vague description of how guns work and alot of them just feel like you are shooting plastic beebees at aliens trying to chomp you to bits the missions started off very copy past then we started to get more variation and new tasks you have to do which does make it feel very unique per rundown but ultimately it falls short because of its dogwater combat the game also sports the biggest oxymoron i have ever seen in a game that wants you to be stealthy and conserve your very very limited ammo you have weapons that have a soul purpose is to stun no they are not shock darts or concussion frag rounds no they dont always knock foes over its just a low damage gun that will give you very brief pauses in enemy movement but mind you its never a few enemys you will get hoards of foes and its just so bloody annoying its a 3/10 game in my honest and disappointed opinion
Stop standing in front of me when im shooting
Don't get me wrong I love this game for the difficulty and gameplay but there are some glaring problems that need to be fixed before I call it a good game Weird animation stuttering when online Terrible matchmaking No kicking function should require 3/4 or 2/3 votes Mission items disappearing bug Unable to drop items bug Bugs aren't always terrible but if they prevent you from completing missions such as the last 2 points you're disingenuous to your games's difficulty and punishment design model Until this game's mission ending bugs are fixed this game in my eyes is a poorly programmed mess
Im so fucking bad Lmao
o_o
This game is incredibly boring Sold as a cooperative horror shooter this game fails to do any of what it tries to do well The stealth mechanics consist of just pressing crouch and turning off a flashlight mindblowing gameplay Then it decides to force a wave of enemies on you disregarding all of the stealth you have done up to that point You're forced into a tiny circle while waves of enemies come at you while you try and not shoot your friends It's amazing how the gun is a peashooter against the normal mob enemies but can two shot your friend who accidentally stepped in front of you Not to mention the frame rate issues that plague the game even on the lowest settings as it seems to be optimized terribly If you find enjoyment in this game good for you However this game is not my cup of tea and is absolutely terrible when compared to games like Deep Rock Galactic Remnant from the Ashes Left 4 Dead etc
just play deep rock galactic instead your wallet and brain will thank u
no
D
For everyone THIS game is the best co-op game out there i will say i been playing sense beta every run down amazes me this game is so hard to win but its a hard in a good way where if you lose you wont get mad because you want to complete the level I recommend this 10/10 I advise you join the discord and join the looking for group channels instead of match making because no one really match makes everyone joins off the channels in the discord
Don't let his spaghetti touch you
yaaaaaaaaaaaayyy
We had a game breaking bug which caused mission items to disappear after respawning at a checkpoint and made progressing in the level impossible Happened twice in a row and made us waste almost 3 hours
Fun Gameplay in theory but gamebreaking Bugs around Checkpoints We died and spawned with old Quest objectives that couldn't be discarded and rendering one player useless or the main objective just despawned after reloading a checkpoint This happened multiple times in the second level
super fun and good to play with mic on it is harder but fun also it is good with discord
Tried to like it but it was way too slow The concept is cool but the bots are bad and it was hard trying to find human players
bring back all the rundowns!1 REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
hr][/hr
This game makes me want cry
soon
spooky aaaaa monster spit out of crotch we are HUGE
If this can support VR it will be more impressive and if I can note some player in black list and never match with them it will be great Since some player are really awful not skill but personality
Good atmosphere but the game is a buggy mess
its like among us
After 2 hours of this game I got the f*ck out spoiler]of the house.[/spoiler
Good game 10/10
I wish the game is significantly cheaper so I can buy it
I played this game when it was free for the weekend It was a really good experience where you can get scared in the most non-horrifying parts just because it's dark play it with your lights off home alone for a really really impacting experience or just play this to have fun
Awesome coop with friends
really fun game plenty of jump scares for sure only issue i really have is how dumb the bots are when playing alone
play with friends if you dont have friends find people in the discord or if your competent in your gaming then play with bots the game is fun and fairly challenging as you get deeper into the rundowns
Get The Fuck
3 1.5 9/10
been looking forward to play the game but its basically unplayable with controller the input lag just makes any controller input just do nothing or stutter(a lot m&kb doesnt have any input lag so most people probably arent even affected nice graphics from what little ive seen tho
More of you nerds need to buy this game Let me lead with this You cannot go back and play old seasons They're gone Forever Edit 08-03-2023 You may now play previous run downs Are you still here Okay cool Buy the game Do you like four player cooperative shooter games Do you like mystery and suspense Horror elements This game's got it all Deep lore lovecraftian horrors beyond your wildest imagination substandard equipment and a baby This is as close to being a real mom as I'll ever get and that's fine because this one's got explosions and tentacle monsters and a foam gun that can seal doors shut Did I mention it's hard The tagline says something about working together or dying together and they mean No one of us is as incompetent as all of us together Grab some boyz load it up have a good time When you're done go to the fan wiki go to youtube dive into the gtfo deep lore and be pleased Don't have any boys Join the dev's discord they've got an LFG channel and you'll have a squad ready or not to gtfo in no time flat This game isn't dead either I'm writing this at 3:35 in the morning and there are 2200 active operators standing by to mess stuff up but the grinder always requires more meat so buy the game nerd

Great Coop Game with friends Works great on Linux
among us is better than GTFO
when the devs cant do the simplest thing like stacking items and they need moders to make the game playable you can imagine how this game is gonna be
when you smell the zaza
sus
awh jeez
Invo
game is good
Great job
it's a game where you shoot
GTFO is an amazing horror shooter with a hard team work style its great
Game was ass Why did i die in one to two hits
It's pretty fun
Hands down the best tactic horror and shooter game there Super comp and communication between teammates is a must If your friends are easy to anger then i should tell you you are going to lose some friends playing this because at the stupidest and i mean THE STUPIDEST mistake will probably make you lose the mission or leave you with low hp and no ammo and you'll get pissed because of that stupid mistake But hey awesome game overall 9/10
Its meh
THIS SHIT IS SO MUCH FUN i AM HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME PLAYING WITH MY DUDES HARD BUT STILL FUCKING SO FUN
ta piola
Bom pra krl
If you are trying to play coop^games with friends then don't buy this because its give cancers I lost all my friends bc of this plz
Get the fuck out of this game worst shit possible that i ever played in this generation
BEST GAME G4Y
Git gud or GTFO
Hardcore and fun are not synonymous Keep that in mind unless you are just that dedicated to a game you haven't even played yet
Good
IS GOOD GAME
Pretty good AI teammates never listen so I recommend getting friends to help Game play is great and scary at some points Overall 9/10
not impressed gameplay is boring the main menu and settings are probably the worst ive ever seen in a video game if your looking for the next best thing then unfortunately this isnt it D

good times with good friends thank you

It has been a very long time since I have had such an immersive and cooperative experience in a game Whether you have a pre-made team of four or find people in the LFG channels of the GTFO discord everyone knows that there is no other way to win than working as a team The game is terrifying and beautiful always setting the tone for the grim work ahead I have never had so much fun struggling this hard at some of these missions
Intro is way to god damn loud
its a fun game its the mach making that's the problem
good
its really fun with freiends
Crap
Trudna ale gra Bez dobrej ekipy gra jeszcze trudniejsza koordynacja i synchroniczne w tej grze a bardzo jest na botach i randomach z internetu Drugim istotnym elementem jest klimat przywodzi na Aliena czy Dead Space albo dopiero ILL Atmosfera jest i doskonale pasuje do rozgrywki tej gry jest jej stosunek ceny do Moim zdaniem tej grze kilka dodatkowych tu i albo ceny o kilka dyszek
if u have friends to play with get them into GTFO and you'll have one of the most fun experiences ever absolute masterpiece and definitely the best coop game around and one of the best ever
extremely boring
GTFO more like get the fortnite online ahha I have dementia I don't have toes 29/23459/9234
Really well designed game which rewards tactical teamwork and careful attention to surroundings Really best experienced with 4 people over voicecomms Fantastic moments of high tension interspersed with investigative/exploratory sections and narrative beats Very highly recommended
Stealth is an option then again so is dying So you know.11/10 math sucks
Pretty terrible all things considered Doesn't help that the mouse sensitivity is locked to 0.01 and 1.00 like most unity games because the developer was too lazy to create their own wrapper for mouse movement or better yet modify a 1.00 to a 2.00 for a higher ceiling cap
its like rat trap but youre the rat
10 sleepers out of 10
I was really excited to try out this game Sadly my expectations went down really fast as soon as me and my friends experienced issues already in the lobby We were forced to re-do lobbies multiple times because we ran into many issues such as game not wanting to start for whatever reason people being invisible in the lobby not being able to see each other's gear and/or not being able to see others being ready After wasting over 20 minutes to try and get the lobby to work we got another issue with infinite loading screen which lead us to abandon the mission and go back to square one
si quieres jugar con tus amigos o hacer unos nuevos
game is very buggy you wont make it past the second level at all in the current stage of this game
Very Very good Even better with friends
Meh
Its too bad i'm too poor to buy this game it would worth its price even if its not on sale Very good game i recommend to everyone with money in their pocket D
Very difficult didn't manage to complete all missions last rundown Wish me luck
h1 You are gonna love this game if you can If you enjoy pain and having a team of a bats bashing in the head of.those things I recommend it Although the game itself seems scary to pick up you have a community of people teaching you tricks just for showing up in the discord My mistake is not playing this game a year ago when I bought it and now that I met some amazing chill people I want to suffer more just because they make this game so much more fun and meaningful when they teach you a trick that makes it a bit more easier If you want you and your friends to get better at teamwork but the won't listen try this game then they are gonna find out rather quickly that their is no I in TEAM This game alone makes me smile just for the fact that it made me want to learn more about it and try to master the gameplay even if I'm under the immense amount of pressure of failure with the scout's scream making me deaf
lets just do one level it will prob take 20 minutes
300-500 4
Its fun and hard and you should play with friends or cope
good to play with friend,but not suggest play with pub
This game is the most original co-op horror survival game I've played to date The atmosphere is tense the story and acting are strong and the game play are complex without having an intimidating learning curve I highly recommend it
What if The Matrix sucked even worse
it's aight
The scariest horror game ever so fucken scary i dont even wanna play This shit gives me nightmares man Its also pretty fun with friends if no friends to alleviate the fear do not play
I've only been able to complete three levels
CBT is preferable to this game no cap
Great mix of horror sci-fi themes satisfyingly challenging and very well-executed cooperation made simple via the official Discord

fix the bugs its not stable The game is full of bugs that sometimes stops you from finishing the main missions Has potential but full of bugs Definitely not worth the full price
good
O Jogo excelente o medo e a ansiedade que quando tem que andar na com o perigo dos monstros te ouvirem e/ou ver a lanterna maravilhoso no momento tem muitos players e dificilmente vai achar partida com as fases iniciais

A poorly designed boring game that sees you walking through dull corridors looking for things in the dark occasionally bonking an enemy on the back of the head then standing near a door at predetermined defense points which make you play simon says Not actually deep or complex more an exercise in monotony It has good atmosphere that's about it Go get chased by a tank in left 4 dead you'll have a more apt experience than this
aside from a few bugs I've had to restart matches I think its an amazing game definitely high difficulty
friends wont stay still for 5 seconds
Juego infravalorado es hermoso
Bishop is a useless fucking dumpster truck who has no parents or friends which is why he's a convict He decided he was going to join the sleepers and fucking friendly fire the team Very fun game can reccomend
stressful
Disclaimer I simply only played as little of this game as I have because this game isn't worth another minute Why should I play this when I can play Deep Rock and get an objectively superior experience This isn't your typical run and gun shooter True there this instead is your typical Military Stealth Shooter that is neither challenging nor good If I want good stealth I will unironically play Alpha Protocol Dishonored or the Thief series/The Dark Project This game is not that it lacks the depth in design that such a game requires If I want a challenging shooter I'll play Warzone DRG Unreal Tournament or Doom Eternal/2016 Slow Gameplay and low play power does not create challenge or any depth in gameplay it instead creates frustration as you replay the level because your AI is dumber than a coma patient and for a game that loves summoning every enemy in every part of the unlocked level there sure is literally no ammo in most levels The solo experience is completely laughable it might as well not even be available but we all know how much of a mistake that would be the game might end up being Mixed instead of Very Positive Cons idk about sharing the Pros fix these and I'll re-review the game Literally way too dark flashlight is pathetically ineffective make the flashlight 3x more effective real flashlights that are weaker would illuminate more you want to pretend to be tryhard realistic you can start there Character movement needs to be 20-40 higher Ammo needs to be 15-30 more plentiful either higher Storage maximums or more plentiful ammo packs Literally hire somebody to make better AI because whoever made them is a complete joke at it UT's Novice difficulty does its job better than this pitiful excuse for AI If you aren't going to do any of the above then atleast give solo playthroughs a save system unlimited saving this isn't They Are Billions as a Stealth FPS game this is sleeping on nails as a stealth FPS game You can tell a developer doesn't know what they're doing when they put Game Journo ratings in their banner art Your art style is crap higher texture resolution does not create a prettier game it creates a game that's harder to read and a game that is genuinely uglier in every way shape and form This game is another basic and typical example of developers thinking that Next-gen graphics is the way forward Here's a spoiler The point of a game is gameplay and your gameplay is simply terrible a 1-man team could do a better game if they just went with retro aesthetics
there's fair hard and there's bad hard this is bad hard
Holy shit The only newest game that just makes my body tremble the graphic bot dynamics weapons and so many features The game set very high standard for other competitors In my opinion Best game for year 2022 it should be a example how to make modern times games with similar idea 100/10 No shit you need to play this with friends then you get 200/10 Gl other games
goddamn it bishop
Great game and community Very scary vibe sometimes but not the alone scary Would recommend
so basically you kill 1 or 2 zombies in stealth mode and then have to defend a door for like 5-10 minutes boring as hell
Me and my friends have straight up not been able to start a game it either just didn't even let us start the game some players were seen Not Ready despite being Ready some players were straight up not even in the lobby for someone even though they were and even if by some miracle we managed to actually get to the intro cutscene of the mission it would load forever and we'd descent in our elevators forever I recently returned to this game after not playing for a long time because my friends wanted to play during the Free Weekend and we just straight up were not able to do so It genuinely was never this bad in the Early Access I don't even know what even happened Currently it is quite literally unplayable we have not been able to do anything for like an hour before we decided to just quit This is unacceptable
Even though game allows 2-player lobbies we were not able to beat first level in 2 hours Quite experienced players with good aim didn't rush or do anything stupid Feels like game requires more than 2 people to beat levels
the absolute worst implementation of a matchmaking service ever Only for people who repeat the same bullshit but expect a different result Please GTFO of the industry if you still can't figure out how to do in game matchmaking and not just linking people to a discord

I really enjoy this game I love the style the atmosphere the art and the gameplay It's a pretty challenging game that requires a decent level of coordination which is also to it's detriment kinda You need to play and communicate with other players to be successful in the later levels There are bots and they're serviceable for earlier levels but the game plays best when with other people You can search and end up in a public lobby with other people but this usually never ends well in my experience If you can get 3 friends to play with consistently then I highly recommend this game My biggest issue with the game is netcode mainly with hit detection It can just feel really unresponsive at times and makes it pretty hard to hit enemies At first I thought it was due to me mostly playing with friends from the US and a lack of lag compensation however it still felt really unresponsive on my own host I'm not sure if there's a weird bloom effect or really slow projectile speed or if I just can't aim properly TL;DR game good
Beste Co-p Spiel aller Zeiten Schwierig und fesselt das Team Nur zu empfehlen
Ist Nice doch doch wenn man allein spielt und so
One of the most immersive horror games I've played in years Everything about this game encourages you to work together as a team or shit will go wrong Hell even if you do work together every expedition is still a frantic nightmare run to extraction Best with friends but the official discord is great for matchmaking and who knows You might find a trusty crew of prisone I mean friends you can rely on
godt nok
Pretty good
me and me homies have fallen into a random hole in the floor where some weird guy whose bent over shot yellow stuff from his pepe on me so anyways im having the time of my life
I love it when i'm quietly sneaking through a room full of horrendous monstrosities and a bullet just whizzes past my head as my teammates close the door behind me
Poo little bit in pant Game good 11/10
very fun
Overall interesting game but for my own experience I can't recommend reasons being Constant frame drops settings reset every time I manage to fix the frame drops load time taking upwards of 10 minutes and once I got the settings fixed every time I fired my gun well there went my frames again and then enemies having jank animations this is the ONLY game out of my library that I've ever had issues running on a new rig BUT friends I played with said they weren't having these issues so I have no f***ing clue what this game's issue is TL;DR Too buggy to enjoy
h1]Review[/h1 Let me preface this game It has the game play and objective elements from i]Left 4 Dead[/i and i]Payday 2[/i While being set in a sci-fi horror setting that of Valve's dead game i]Alien Swarm[/i If you have played any of these games then you know what to expect from this game This game is difficult and uncompromising in it's approach to the co-operative survival horror shooter You are not the main hero of the story You are a flimsy meat bag that has a functioning brain If you have played the likes of i]Dark Souls[/i i]Super Meat Boy[/i or dare I say i League of Legends[/i you are a masochist like the rest of us who get joy from our misery from subjecting ourselves to such suffering Or you play those games because you enjoy the challenge and the success that comes from overcoming it If you are a newbie to this game you fill find much difficulty trying to get into it Again it is a hard game There is no easy mode Only your willpower to overcome the substantial failures that arise from your attempts 8/10 I recommend this game After playing the same mission for 4 hours and uninstalling the game I conclude I do not have the stress management capacity to play through another mission Story url here url Too long to put in review h1 Observations h1 1 You are dumped into a facility with 4 other individuals to accomplish mission objectives You start the mission off with your handy melee weapon 2 guns and a tool All of which can be chosen at the game lobby When you are dropped into the mission your gun weapons and tools yes your tools have a ammo counter start with 50 ammunition meaning you are already down b]HALF[/b of your total ammo Ammunition Tool Ammunition Kits and Health Packs can be found scattered around the mission but they are sparse Meaning you will have to either play smart or aim your shots well Combined with the fact as you progress through the mission enemies will swarm your location relentlessly whittling down what little resources you have at your disposal if any 2 There are 2 ways to approach missions First option is always the most optimal In which you sneak throughout the facility to silently take club enemies in the head and complete the objectives If you fail stealth than your second defaults to loud Where you now have to deal with every enemy in the vicinity now swarming you Loud should be a last resort as aforementioned you have very little ammo Furthermore your characters are made of tissue paper One hit from a small enemy won't hurt as much But multiple hits from a swarm of enemies will delete your health bar 3 The environment in this game is completely hostile to you Nothing in the environment is safe for the players navigating the facility Everything is dark so that you can hardly see anything clearly Foliage will obstruct vision of where you want to aim The lighting in the environment makes it so you will not see jack in this game Worsening this factor is that some missions have fog that completely obscures vision That can only be cleared with a disposable item that you find scattered throughout the facility Also there's toxic variant of the fog so you can't stay in area for too long lest you wish to suffocate a slow death 3a This game's maps are b]DENSE[/b It may not seem that big when you look at the in-game map but when you navigate through the facility it makes you wish the map is smaller 4 The enemies in this game aren't the stupid ones where they stand still while you shoot at them No They will duck dive weave and reposition themselves to get a better shot at hitting you They will even actively retreat if you get their health low enough so that they can engage from afar Where you have to expend ammunition to hit them from distance or close in to melee distance where their buddies are Enemies in this game also have some form of ranged attack meaning you are not safe from any distance 5 Mission are very long 2 hours if you everything is going smoothly 4-6 hours if crap hits the fan Heck even 8 hours if you are committed to completing the mission when things go FUBAR As you will be dying over and over again to finish the mission There are checkpoints to alleviate some of this burden but even with checkpoints you will still have to retread your steps from the point you have failed That means if you were at Point 2Z in the mission but died you have to start back on 2A h1 Mission Observations h1 b]Mission R7A1 A good start[/b This mission is a great introduction for newbies to the game It is still hard but manageable You can screw up stealth and get away with going loud But your are still subjected to the game's survival horror elements b Mission R7B1 The Viet Cong Jungles b There is a reason while this level is called the Viet Cong Jungles The level has so much green foliage you are literally in a jungle Except it's inside of a facility You won't be able to spot enemies that are hiding in the green until it is too late Lots of enemies will be swarming in this mission if you wake them up You also won't have enough ammo to survive going loud The only other BS on this mission is that at the near end of it you have to escort a payload while enemies swarm your location At that point your already low on ammo Small tip remember to look up b Mission R7B2 I can't see jack b This mission has SO MUCH FOG You are in a cave level that has fog obscuring everything There are items scattered throughout the level to clear it but my god just so much fog Doesn't help when you are getting swarmed and the fog decides to come back Not helping is that this level is HUGE Not dense but HUGE Bio tracker and thermal sight weapons are a must if you want to see anything One other funs of this level You will have to defend a player that is typing stuff on a terminal while getting swarmed Real easy when you are low on ammo b Mission R7B3 Screw this game I'm out b This mission has toxic fog You won't see anything and you will slowly die from it HUGE level as well This is the mission that made me snap Honorable mentions Dr.Haxor Guide shot caller sentry placements and resident turbine holder Shensai Mezhaik Wave clearers sentries and trappers FireMan me Bioscanner/tagger sniper the stupid shots somehow don't hit the head when aiming at the head intel support It was an honor playing with you inmates b]Mission R7C1 I cant see jack But I must scream[/b Another Foggy level but this time inside of a science facility Heavy emphasis on stealth this level Again HUGE level This mission has you running around the facility to get power cells But here is the fun part You have to move forward with the power cells while swarms of enemies come at you from behind Those power cells are what enables you to complete the objective That isn't even the worse of it The enemies don't stop spawning So you have to move further down the facility lugging along the power cells as slowly your ammo count goes to 0 FUN
If you dont hear screaming every 2 minutes i say youre playing this game wrong
server sucks,too lagg
Very difficult tutorial didn't help so much it's like my teacher teach me A and the exam was B but it's fun unlike my youth
Tried this game during Free Weekend This game is great co-op survival games it really makes the Co-Op an integral part of this game Avoid buying this game if you don't have at least two friends to play with since the price is kinda expensive too No Micro-transactions Those secondary objectives throughout the game are only for achievements and cosmetics This game is full with bugs you will feel this game should not be released to the public yet Some of the bugs are major enough we can't continue the main objective The developer should focus on fixing these game-breaking bugs first before they release it This game is not for casual audience They said extreme co-op not without reason This game is really really difficult even playing with 3 players and a bot is just not enough Also expect around 3 hours or more for most of the later maps with very few checkpoints Because of this don't expect a refund once you complete one map
Tried it in the free weekend The horror level is okay but I haven't seen it all Quite repetitive gameplay and dumb bots make this game feel unpolished It's playable with one bot but not with any more than that They just walk into line of fire This game feels like it has huge potential I might change this review later
It just gets repetitive and boring pretty fast The guns aren't that interesting A lot of the game is just walking around trying to find the correct door or having to query shit on the terminals I wish this game was just faster overall
shiver me timbers
i started to cry
Okay what can I say about Get the fuck out Well first of all this game is generally amazing and extreme fun to play with friends The mechanics the build up and the epic intense battles are all amazing and very enjoyable even if you die most of the time The fact that you have to sneak around from sleeper to sleeper trying to kill each one without waking them up still dumbfounds me But there are some things not a lot but some things that decreases how good the game is as well as how popular the game is The main thing is you can basically not play without 4 people otherwise it will take about 30 40 attempts to complete For example me and my friend were stuck on the SECOND mission for about well i don't know 11 HOURS and FINALLY finished it This is because no offense gtfo dev's your AI BOTS ARE GARRRBAGGEE Please fix them One of them literally took 3 attempts to glue the fu**ing wall and then couldn't because they ran out Anyways that's basically it Overall I still recommend this game even after all of the frustration because it somehow was still enjoyable FIX THE BOTS THO
ok
g get t the f furries o out
Very patient game fun communicating with friends The creatures doge bullets accurately as players in call of duty multiplayer Its hard to avoid getting hit by their projectile
good poop
boring and boring
h1 h1 u
I hate it I love it So addicting like Alien Swarm The gear doesn't get better but the mobs get harder Have a good squad with good comms and it's so fun
Hello there is a battery bug on the check point on the level C1(R7 When we die and respawn it puts a battery in our hands that is bugged and we cant place it down at all This has happened everytime we try to run the level please fix it Then Ill change my rating We have wasted so much time with bug
GTFO is the definitive stealth team-based PvE experience The gameplay loop consists of sneaking up on unawares monsters stabbing them in the head/back then having all hell break loose when you screw it up If you like carefully and methodically picking apart uncertain and delicate combat scenarios while actively communicating with your friends this is the game for you If you enjoy watching all hell break loose when your pal Timmy accidentally misses that one monster in the shadows directly to his left this is also the game for you If you like fast paced run and gun slaughter simulators this is not the game for you If you can't deal with someone else's mistake costing you 10-20 minutes of progress this is not the game for you GTFO is tense slow demanding and damn good at what it does If you want a team game that legitimately makes you play with your team and not just in the same lobby as them pick this up
love the concept the environment and the gameplay but progression is extremely lacking the game is VAGUE very vague it sends you into a simple find and extract mission but its far FAAAR more complicated than that in short the game forces you to do a simple task that its very vague but consumes HOURS(3-4 hours average per level to figure out and theres absolutely no rewards at the end of wasting all your time you get these perks and cosmetic clothing but the cloths is honestly the same and the perks is lacking and only last one mission so in essence you waste 3-4 hours of your life playing a single level to grab a few containers in exchange of cosmetics and perks that honestly doesnt even matter there has to be more of a reward to convince players to continue playing
we die alot
yes
good game
Free weekend experience only Really interesting gameplay and cooperative gameplay but.lacks RPG elements get olds quick and doesn't really award you for going through missions Great game tho
demo
Games great don't play if you can't conduct yourself in a group though
Experiencia HARDCORE en toda la de la palabra Si eres PRO puedes pasar cualquier nivel solo Pero para el usuario promedio solo la mitad de los niveles de la zona 1 y 2 se pueden jugar solo y con gran dificultad Algunos niveles requieren al menos 1 jugador Y los niveles de D y E frecuentemente de un grupo de 4 personas en buena
Dificil e chato mas try hard
Play Deep Rock Galactic instead
its so good
this game make me bust a co op nut
It was fun for the first hour and got old pretty fast I get the idea of it being hardcore and not casual but it takes it somewhat too far in some aspects Missions are pretty long and that's if you don't die Once you die things go down hill fast once you start doing the same checkpoint three times over Bots are generally responsive to commands but don't count on them to save your ass Typing into the terminals is a very big part of each mission and it requires you to type exact commands with your actual keyboard This is a novel idea that gets really repetitive and is such a pain Bots also can't help with these terminals A copy and paste feature would help soooo much TL;DR If you can muster up a good squad of three other masochists this can be a great game for a bit and by a bit I mean once you die enough on the same monotonous mission you'll pack it up Still props for many novel ideas and a great horror environment The free weekend just didn't sell me
hard and triple A graphics/feel
idk never played it
idk i never played it
lo recomiendo mucho si tenes amigos que les gusten esta clase de juegos destaco lo del sigilo porque a mi me encanta los juegos de sigilo y combinado con terror y accion lo hacen un juegazo lastima que yo lo juegue solo 2 horas porque no tenia con quien jugarlo y aparte era para probar si tendria dinero lo compraria
No aim assist for controllers making combat a complete pain in the ass to hit anything You have to grab the keyboard and type stuff when you find terminals in the game WFT is this crap I do enough of that in real life i dont want to type in-game So i have to play with the lights on so i can see my keys and type what the game tells me to type What an absolute horrible design decision Its like someone thought quicktime events was an amazing thing and decided to expand on the idea and make you type out entire commands into in-game terminals to locate objectives I cannot stress how dumb this is dude
It's like cock and ball torture without the cock and balls
Muito foda so que o marco nao quer jogar com a rapaziada ai fodeu o role apenas dor
Played on Free weekends Great refreshing co-op survival games I wouldn't buy it if you don't have friends since the price is kinda expensive too No MTX progression between secondary objectives are only for achievements and hats(cosmetics There's literally bug everywhere gun bugs checkpoints bugs that made us fail objective 3 times The dev should focusing on fixing this game-breaking bugs first before they released it Not for casual audience,since the difficulty and the lack of tutorials is there
tenha raiva do passado muito menos medo do futuro mas tenha bastante ao seu presente para entender a frase precisa ter re-jogado ele sim re-jogado assim entendera essa frase
yes
Good Game
i'm re-reviewing GTFO for the free weekend the game ran smoothly on my computer as expected and this time i found a group to play with using the discord to give a detailed review we'll have to do a rundown on a level when you start the game you are treated to an opening cutscene that resemble a computer booting up then a mysterious entity known as the warden talks about a prisoner being assigned to a team of other prisoners then you are prompted to inject a cortex interface into the prisoner your characters skull last time i played i wondered where the title screen was this is the title point one GTFO is immersive it is also tense then you connect to the rundown the rundown is the way GTFO updates or replaces in a way each new rundown contains new objectives enemies missions weapons and the new rundown replaces the old one which is deleted forever this is unique and would probably only work for GTFO so interesting idea the missions of each rundown involve you and your team of prisoner going down into an abandoned complex to do an objective like collect items while down there you can find DOS terminals that you can type phrases in to find said objectives the complex is divided into zones and subzones subzone doors can be opened or closed freely and can be blocked with C-Foam launcher but security zone doors cannot be closed and require a scan by the warden to open some security doors will be attached to an alarm that you need to deactivate with additional scans while others are connected to checkpoints to save your game you will have to find supplies because you are going to run out each prisoners loadout consists of a gun a special gun a tool like the aforementioned C-Foam or sentries and a meelee and most importantly don't wake up the sleepers the stealth is easy stay low flashlights off when enemies move stand still charge meelee kills instantly from stealth but if you're in combat like from an alarm then you're going to need to use guns and there are worse things than sleepers down there once your done with the objective GTFO it is hard and tense i like it so if you like it then you should buy it on sale it's a good horror game with fine teamplay and at least one slegdehammer sure there are better games this one is on my backlog but as of rundown 8s release it is on it's lowest sale yet so if you have the cash and you're interested grab it now before it's too late 8/10 by the way the previous rundowns weren't permanently deleted because they have returned in the form of ALT rundowns original rundowns updated with new enemies guns and story too so before you buy i recommend playing the free weekend and starting from R1A1 post tutorial bring friends or don't
hard
One of the best tactical horror shooters i've ever played
O jogo muit papo pouco tiro e o menu me deixou com
The Price tag for this game is WAY to high 180 CAD/$140 USD for 4 people to play this game that is meant to be played cooperatively I also don't see playing this with anyone other than your friends to be enjoyable especially if those players decide not to use their mic The difficulty in this game is not knowing whats gonna happen next so if you've already played a level you know what to expect and what kind of encounters your gonna run into making the next time you do it extremely easy this truly a single play through game At Half the current price would be a better price tag me and my friends decided we weren't gonna buy until its like 15 at the most
Enjoyable Gameplay Think L4D with more teamwork Puzzles
if you don't bonk you ain't goin home why are we still here just to suffer
Fun game
help help help help
good game
GTFO stands for Get Three Friends Ohmygod-whatsthis-helpme-no-not-this-way-aaaaa
Jogo maneiro mas to sem grana pra comprar
The good The feeling on shooting the guns is amazing Very well optimized it runs super smooth The bad The game is hard but not for the fun reasons Low ammo for the kind of recoil that the guns has The characters are super slow and 4 hits of a minion kills you The door mechanics are almost useless because the mobs breaks them with no effort Score 3.5/10

good game UI is awesome
its good
good
An absolute masterpiece You won't get anywhere without a good communication and a good team This game heavily encourages you think strategically with your mates and make a good call quickly when things go down
Work together Or Die together is the term hugely used in GTFO hencewhy it is a cooperative horror shooter an interesting take on a genre such as this its an overall fun game to play with friends which i dont have but has a decent solo team to go with as taking role as a leader commanding your squadmates to put down deployables BUT it has some faults such as removing content from previous rundowns and other bits and pieces im not so clear on
very interesting and challenging
Game gud game scary all bad reviews are from people who are too impatient and dumb
Very intense gameplay The game gets better if you play with 3 premates bishopsucks
Also ich finde die Verteilung von Knicklichtern in diesem Game definitiv zu wenig Man die Spawnrate von dene ruhig auf 95 aller Kisten und Aber sonst ein mega gutes und auch endlich mal schweres game wo man eben wirklich koordination braucht und man sich 3x muss ob man von seiner Schusswaffe Gebrauch macht oder nicht eher doch auf die Nahkampfwaffe Switcht Lediglich die Bots sind etwas neben der Spur Ps Nach dem ersten Spielen in diesem Game habe ich nun eine Phobie Knicklichtern entwickelt
very good game
daha zevkli bir oyun oyun co-op oyunlara daha zor bir oyun kaynak ve ekip ani durum gerekiyor gergin dorukta var
Good game if you play it the right way slow methodical and saving ammo for when you really need it NOT recommended if you like running and gunning or dislike playing tactically
games ok but with friends its epic and untill the next free weekend
I hate the fog tho
This is the stupidest robot I've ever seen If I close the door the robot will run outside I want to assassinate the monster He's standing in front of me Pick up supplies at will and squander them at will It's a nightmare for a game where supplies are scarce When I want a robot to pick up supplies it just doesn't pick them up I've tried many times Some node robots won't go in by themselves I have to stand in a very dangerous position
GTFO GTFO 10 200 5 C2 C3 Get The F#ck Out
UI is great but the gameplay is lackluster Backtracking and getting lost in a maze of concrete wasn't my cup of tea and the gunplay was weak Also the flashlight is complete garbage may as well make my character blind
The game itself is hard enough but I have to play it along with shitty checkpoint bug almost every stage with carry objective don't buy this game now Dev should have focus on fixing the bug before release the major patch
Just got f*cked by 3 invincible tentacles and failed a 3 hour misson 10/10 would reccomend
My day be so fine then boom teammate trips a scout
too boring
this is not left 4 dead in space this is aliens
The only scary thing about this game was trying to explain to non linux users how to use console commands I was hoping for multiplayer splinter cell sneaking around just felt inconsistent and clunky especially with a bot on your team Experience might be better with 4 human players Multiple times we would be trying to sneak into a room and the bot would Leroy Jenkins and start firing on enemies that had not yet been aggroed and this was annoying and made me not want to play without 4 human players The game mechanic of the alarmed doors was lame too and felt incongruous with the other stealth parts of the game You sneak around this whole time but then you open a door and an infinite number of enemies charge in at you and you're forced to stand and fight while the door unlocks As best i could tell you have to stand in designated security areas to get the door unlocked while killing off the infinite stream of enemies then when the door opens GTFO inside the new area trying to not aggro passive enemies and then hide in a corner until things calm down It just wasn't scary or particularly fun to me The creature design was creepy controls were intuitive voice acting was decent
Good and very challenging would play more
pain
Constant lags disconnecting teammates and stupidly long loadings And a wtf not working matchmaking the best game
Spoko ma klimacik czasu zajmuje i troche klimat spoko jeszcze ze znajomymi
ve bok gibi hissi bok gibi Grafikleri bok gibi Uzak durun
no friends
very fun when you can convince your friend to play with you
get three friend
Nothing like spending 8 hours of my life clearing a single level I would do it again
oyunu kadar bitmeseydi iyiydi
Un juego que va a hacer que si no juegas con amigos y te tocan unos guiris con 0 de IQ detestes y si juegas con amigos o reforzar vuestra amistad o liaros a navajazos con toda la tranquilidad del mundo Un juego solo aptos para usuarios con las suficientes neuronas y tejido cerebral en la sesera que les haga pensar como superar cada nivel como racionar vuestros suministros y como no liarla en los pasos para no tener que hacer un restart Si te gustan los retos los juegos de pensar shooters y muy injustos hay bichos que tienen aimbot entonces vente y prueba el juego Si hay cosas que no me gustan pues hay algunos fallos con los enemigos pues hay veces que te detectan aunque no te muevas o matas a uno que lejos y alerta a toda la sala aunque no haga ruido pero bueno son cosas que a veces alegran el gameplay y no hace que sea tan repetitivo

Strategic shooter/horror That's how I would describe it Antithesis to a run and gun Though sometimes you literally will have to run and gun A slight learning curve but you can take your time and progress at your own rate I recommend joining the GTFO discord so you can play with others They're usually happy to guide you if you're new Hardly any toxic people at all

What a free weekend and what a shame This is yet another story of a mid-budget western game An atmospheric if stereotypical game with a wealth of bold refreshing ideas that considerably challenges your patience resourcefulness split second decision-making ability to hit fast targets and of course cooperate And it is yet another game that is completely ruined by its workmanship I never had hoped for coming across such a variety of bugs and flaws in a weekend Combined with the crashes this is especially painful in a supposedly hardcore game with rather time-consuming runs where each individual crash or mechanic not working properly costs you upwards of 30 minutes The game may have made up for the lack of quality time ratio with its strengths but for me the last nail in the coffin was the community which you basically need to play You either get matched up with clueless dimwits who act like it's just another dumb zombie game or possibly well-meaning veterans who nevertheless end up acting like patronizing douchebags as they nag you into not doing much of anything and do everything instead of you just so that the mission goes smoothly Many of the problem are probably solvable for some people After all this game is by design not for everyone so it might work for you My thumbs are regrettably down
pretty fun

the game is great when you have friends to play with its challenging and sometimes scary but not really my friends and i bought it and have had alot of fun making tactics to survive like the game says work together or die together
yes game good can be scary mostly unnerving good atmosphere looks great and good difficulty
hr][/hr list list or hr][/hr
Very fun and difficult it's like they took the best parts of Rainbow Six Extraction and Back 4 Blood and meshed it all together Will get hours of enjoyment out of this game
i love it it was pretty bad for the first couple years but its great now
Please make it free
Buenisimo todo
This game will be very hard if you don't have a competent player to play with
the smartest horror game that makes you use you brain and still be scared
Used it on free weekend almost passed lvl 2 died to no ammo Every enemy has what feels like a hit-scan tongue attack projectiles curve to hit you For certain doors you are forced to stay in one spot and wait till a bar fills up all while holding off against the attacks mentioned above Enemies on an alarmed door infinitely spawn until alarm is turned off Shotgun will say you have 50 ammo and you would have 10 shells left total Doesn't seem feasible in the long run maybe i'm just bad
I'm conflicted with this game on one side it's cool having a pseudo stealth-action game that encourages stealth more than loud and on the other side this game can be one of the most frustrating things to play as you are basically starved of resources and forced into loud sections basically making it incredibly difficult to simply complete a single mission
Was a pretty decent game till it did this last update and patch Now its a struggle to get it to load and if it does Everything lags and you get 1 frame a second
i pissed
Problem if i load into a match when i'm not host of the game it tends to leave dead monster after images standing in place still glowing then sometimes the doors look close but my teammates can go through it but i cant till it opens up for me 2 minutes later and sometimes i cant put down my gun sentry Solution so i thought it was a problem with my ram which it was so i had brought 16 GB of ram now currently having 24 GB i now have no more problems and can run my game perfect
this is easily the shittest game i have ever played in my entire life however the monsters twerked on the floor and i would see their ass cheeks ripple on the floor it turned me on and i had a cheeky wank was alright despite the game being shite
Great game to play with friends I only had it for the free weekend but still very fun
love it
ya i relly like this game
If you enjoy wasting all of your time and any poor friends that you can convince to spend two to three hours on one mission that is poor game mapping this is your game tired of shooting they have a solution for you finding ammunition is like finding your future wife at an anime convention also note there is no tutorial you just have to know the game and a bit of basic coding

Legal mas bugou 3 vezes nas 3 vezes que eu tentei jogar microsoft
its a fun game its just hard Thats it
I enjoyed playing this game even though it makes no sense and I have no clue what i'm doing The major pit fall of this game is it NON-popularity and high queue times and most importantly u YOU NEED 4 PLAYERS WITH 100 TEAM WORK u This is a 4-player CO-OP game that will require all players to put in 100 effort because if one person leaves your squad you're left to play that whole level 1 person down Overall good game but you really need a solid group of 4 players that can spend 2hrs to truly enjoy the game With that being said game is a good 6.5/10 I would recommend hopefully it become more popular Max the dog USMC CPL Don't Tread on me
Matchmaking balancing the overall difficulty and the random players make this game tough to recommend enjoy Cool idea but it doesn't come together
LPTM QUE DIFICIIIIL
Meh Nothing special
be me ask friends to play they say no play by yourself cry
The premise and gameplay of GTFO are quite enjoyable particularly if you have friends you can play with Games with a hardcore premise and need for tactical coordination always fall apart with Pick-up groups/matchmaking so if you aren't ready to buy four copies or have three friends also willing to buy it then don't bother in the first place But why the big thumbs down At the time of posting this having played during the free weekend that just passed the game is too damn buggy to enjoy We had a player spawn in holding a duplicate the package with no ability to pick up the real one nor drop the dup We eventually surmised they should drop out then back in only to introduce other issues with how the game tracks checkpoints By our last attempt at loading the checkpoint another player had spawned in dead came to life amid enemies then rubberbanded to their actual start position This was the last straw for our group attempting to play the game but it was certainly not the first bug we encountered I play a lot of buggy games and they're just fine I play a lot of hardcore games and they're just fine But you cannot have a hardcore game that's this buggy Punishing the players for what is simply design/development errors is a fast way to drive away players So I'll try again next time there's a free weekend if there's been a patch or two between now and then But for now this wouldn't even be worth 10USD let alone 40
Get a team together but yes i recommend this game to hardcore gamer that like teamwork type of games you will need a lot of it can be frustrating at sometimes and may make you hate life sometimes but it is always fun and challenging especially if you are a proficient prisoner
Tried at the free weekend on 6/22/2022 gud
fun with friends
it's fun
Had an eye on this since it came out Thanks for free weekend Game is roughly what I figured It remains unpurchased 1 Decidedly un-casual We knew this Not really a problem in itself but just doesn't fit w my typical tastes at the moment I'd definitely play it but how much I'm not sure 2 Is it still locked in to the dev-chosen rundowns If not well that was bad PR from the start and now it's turned into misinformation If so well I don't really like that model Period I guess It allows them to do nifty things like make sure everyone is playing easy levels when it's Free Weekend But I still like to at least have the ability to play on my terms and I'm just one of those would-be customers who will forever be sore about not having the ability to customize hosting Ironically I'm not a set up server w douchey mods person at all I tend toward the vanilla experience at an appropriately challenging skill level w QoL-type mods if any But it's just a matter of principle I need configurability Not to mention the game-as-a-service model is always suspect to begin with I'm not familiar with the end-of-lifecycle discussion Will they open all the levels Will the game just end Too much to care about when I have other fun games to play It's these topics which merit the Thumbs Down Sry Fun game but I can't recommend per se 3 Given the above and how it translates to the overall utility and thus value of the product for me I need a decent sale 50 discount to ante
this is too good wtf
nor fun neither scary and expensive for a 12GB game

This game was really special and I had a lot of fun with it but personally spending 120 USD for an experience you might get maybe 30 hours if not more out of Doesn't seem worth it to me You're essentially going to have to pay that if you get it on sale at this time if you want to really enjoy this game Trying to play with random people is not ideal as there is a learning curve and if even one or two people step out of line your whole team will lose Random match making is not very good and as a result the game suffers from it If you don't mind collectively spending 120 bucks on your gaming experience then I say go for it Personally I'd rather just play left 4 dead for the 100th time Thanks for your time though If you do get this I hope you have fun because I sure did When I wasn't getting buttfked due to my teammates incompetence and rage-quitting xD
This game feels like a combo of Left 4 Dead and DOOM Love this game has great potential and is just all out really awesome
Awesome scary adventures difficult
I would say thins game is a payday2 meets left4dead Alot of sneaking around hard and challenging horde mode You have to rely on stealth your team and you better have a mic Die together or survive together
hermoso
Das Spiel ist sehr schwer Ja das Gameplay ist hart und ohne vorherige Absprache mit den Teamkollegen kaum zu schaffen Dabei folgt es einem recht einfachen Prinzip Mehr Zeug Gefahr Darum macht es wenig Sinn die verwinkelten und ansprechend gestalteten Levels zu erkunden Die beste hat man wenig mit dem Bewegungsscanner bekannt aus den Alien-Filmen Mit diesem kann man Gegner durch und Mikrofon ist Pflicht Die anderen Drei den mitnehmen dann ist der Durchgang ein Klacks Am nervigsten war jedoch die Zusammenstellung des Teams Gerade wenn man mit einem Freund und zwei Randoms spielen Am Free Weekend sah das so aus Ich starte die Spielersuche warte bis zwei Randoms beitreten und lade dann einen Freund ein Ein dritter Random wird so lange ausgesessen bis ein Slot frei wird verlassen zwei Randoms die Lobby wird die Spielersuche mit einer neuen Lobby wieder gestartet Denn sobald einer eurer Steamfreunde die Lobby betritt wird die automatische Spielersuche ausgesetzt Ein Klick auf den verlockenden Spielersuche"-Button euch die aktuelle Lobby verlassen und eine Neue Die Story Ihr einen neugeborenen Mitgefangenen aus Das ist das HCU-Ding Den Preis von empfinde ich das Gebotene und die geforderten Mindestanforderungen zu hoch Dennoch empfehle ich das Spiel weiter um die Free Weekend"-Aktion zu
very fun indeed
GTFO is a Horror shooter with a lot of stealth elements or a stealth game with shooting elements no clue how to classify it It's possible to play solo with bots yet even the devs discourage that as the game especially during later levels relies heavily on cooperation with other sentient players It's a very tough but fun game until the point where you get stuck repeating the same section 316 times because you're low on supplies and you have to do everything frame-perfect or you'll get fucked over The gunplay is pretty good but sometimes due to desync your shots feel like they should've hit yet they don't The terminal is a nice idea might seem somewhat intimidating at first but it's easy to grasp and it's a very crucial tool that will aid you on your missions All in all you should buy this IF you have 3 other dedicated friends who are willing to play with you AND if it's on sale because I feel like the price tag is a bit too high tl;dr Fun but tough shooter/stealth game Not recommended for solo players recommended for people who can gather an organised group You should get it on sale
The game CAN be fun but mostly i think im just confused frustrated and feeling robbed by the fact i can only ever get one friend at a time to play with me basically destroying any hope of being able to complete 3/4's of the rundown I also dont think i like that the only tangible progression in the game is cosmetics so short of consumable boosts there is no way to improve your chances of beating a mission other than maybe reading a 6 paragraph strategy guide all so you can finish a 3 hour endeavor and net yourself a pair boots If you have 3 friends who also buy the game then maybe its worth it but im just giving it a thumbs up for the visuals and sound design
game hard but its cool
the game is difficult to run considering the graphics and general pace I would recommend this if deep rock galactic didn't exist most of my games had to be abandoned due to me facing unfixable bugs where I got stuck with things in my hand or where the game just simply wouldn't start 10 mins stuck in the loading animation its not a bad game but the bugs and performance can cause disturbances and bring games if you're alone Play this only if you have friends and are okay with restarting from checkpoint because of the bugs because no one else is gonna wait for you
very good game
This game will not be kind or forgiving to you It will not hold your hand or lead you along and just let you win Sometimes this game will straight up beat you It is a challenging game to be sure If you are not looking for a challenging experience do not but GTFO The game is an absolute blast but unless you play by its rules you will fail Pros Sound Design Weapon Variety Enemy Variety Gunplay Focus on teamwork and communication Can be played Solo with bots Almost always feels fair while still very challenging Cons FPS drops at times Ping system needs updating Not often but every once in a while the game will crash Especially bad when you're an hour into a level Overall Buy if it piques your interest be cautious about how difficult the game will be Score W/O Friends 7/10 W Friends 9/10
Great atmosphere Been a long way from early access weapon and enemy has been more balanced and more enjoyable to play
Perfect combo of horror and fps
melhor jogo da atualidade
fun
Gra ma klimat
still love it
i love daddy Simon Viklund thanks for your work sir
Genuinely the best horror co-op game you can find on the market right now along with the constant updates It Is the best game for Its genre
Decent game but on a sale is way too overpriced for it much better games are much cheaper
Really good game gave me depression
Team shoot argue get lost and die
Its an awesome terrifying game The graphics are amazing and you really feel immersed when you have a group of 4 people all working together on one rundown My only gripe is that it takes a while to complete one rundown if you fail often You have to set aside quite a bit of time to play this game but it's still a masterpiece
I recently tried this game with a few friends while it was on free weekend and let me tell you a game verry similar to the likes of Left 4 dead but unlike the many clones L4D has had over the years this spin is definitely the most unique and well made I absolutely love the gameplay and the teamwork you have to pull of to be able to succeed because most levels running and gunning is seldom an option as ammo is scarce and verry limited and enemies deal massive damage to players which makes it verry challenging but thats a part of the apeal to this game I saw quite a few reviews complaining it is not verry beginner friendly and i do not think it should be However the biggest downside to this game if you dont want to include bots in your team is the matchmaking as most times i ran into players who did not quite care for stealth or that did not have a microphone enabled or at all which is a really big component to the game overall so i recommend you pickup the game with atleast 3 other friends but its still worth buying without friends loved it

Everytime I play this game I feel like I'm in an episode of LOVE DEATH ROBOTS Definitely worth it if played with friends if you have any
pretty good
bons e jogabilidade dificuldade elevada
Great game team work required
10/10 deaths near the same door because your friends and you are stupid
Game has way too many bugs even if in latest update same bugs occur audio cutting off sleepers walking through closed doors and random crashes at the start of the run dont buy this game yet until all bugs are completely fixed and play tested for both low end PC's to gaming production PC's
Game is too punishing to play noneo fo my friends wish to play it anymore sent into a shitstorm with no ammo or supplies it just isnt fun
cool mais dur
Tbh this is a good game but I feel like theres some things that could be Improved from big things like the annoyingly slow Stealth to the small things like the hitmarkers sometimes I can't tell when I've hit an enemy or not But the ONE thing I hate the most about this game is the BOT AI the amount of times we've got noticed by a sleeper because the BOT just randomly shoots the enemy Instead of being stealthy is ALARMINGLY high they should make a command to make Bots silent/stealth I'm hoping this game gets the recognition it deserves cuz If done right this is a really fun game to play with friends Thank You 10 Chambers for giving us a chance to play your game more game devs should to this IMHO because it gives gamers a good sense of a game before they buy it

This game was decent at the beginning then our fantastic developers decided to put a lazy response to make the game harder by adding shadow enemies you can barely see them with flashlight the fog makes is very annoying and sometimes gives you AIDS as well no joking infection Keep it up with the game guys
that monster need to nerf he have auto aim never miss D

Oh yes
please play with me none of my friends do
Played this over the free weekend Definitely a wonderful game for those who enjoy a cooperative challenge Hits all the checkboxes for those who like to define team roles and work tactically Tough game but very fun Would recommend and definitely considering buying it
This game sucks
From my short time with the game I would recommend but only just and more as a means of hopefully sparking more from this game I've been hyped to play this since the reveal years ago and it doesn't hold up to that hype or vibe It's a i]good[/i game but nothing more Although I feel like it's something of an already dying or dead game since the matchmaking is barren and having to go through a Discord to LFG is a tedious obtuse process to me Likewise solo play leaves a lot to be desired I'm getting Space Hulk Deathwing vibes of barren matchmaking and music-less menus I feel like the main thing holding it back aside from the sub-par means of playing with others is the lack of any progression system i]and[/i no true story to speak of Piecing together lore from text logs does not make for a story especially in a game that isn't designed for solo play where you'd necessarily have time to read said logs The movement and inertia could also feel better for a hardcore and atmospheric horror-based game I will finish with some positives however Weapons are truly fun to use varied and inventive as are the tools Melee exists I guess The atmosphere vibe and aesthetic is on-point some great SCP vibes and it really makes me long for more story and explanation Graphics and related settings for options are fantastic minus the obnoxious fog that just ruins certain sections Enemies are inventive and great horror fuel Sound design is good I would prefer more ambient and foodstep sound though taking a page from Tarkov's book would work WONDERS for GTFO considering how terrifying and tense audio can be in EFT I hope the devs give it some more love it's nearly there
This game has a lot of issues and I don't want to waste brain power typing why

first time i played it i shat my pants but it was fun the game not the shitting of the pants
Truly fun to see a horror coop shooter game I enjoyed this game alot during free weekend Play with decent teammates and you might get a chance for a success Know your enemies mechanics and weapons to use that suits your style
Honestly this game is great But the lack of updates devs who don't comminicate with the community well and tons of bugs which some are going to be fixed in like 6 months or more are the biggest problem in this game
Great Athmosphere
I really love a lot about this game and there's a lot to like guns fun co-op with randoms customization tone and atmosphere etc but there's also bad stuff that will HOPEFULLY get fixed some time soon like 1-2 weeks But while stuff like bugs and technical issues might get fixed eventually the biggest reason why I currently don't think GTFO is worth the buck is that each new season rundown that lasts approx 3 months replaces the old one The content of these rundowns includes 10 levels as in maps lore story weapons cosmetics and probably something more So with each new season the old stuff gets replaced by the new one and then it goes on and on and on Instead of having access to something like 70 levels and 7 seasons worth of exclusive content I can only have access to the current one While the levels themselves are really fun to play I can't help but feel like that after replaying at least each one of them one or two times I will drop the game for quite a long time which could be alleviated by me being able to replay the old stuff to keep things fresh DRG does something similar with its maps which are called biomes but instead of outright removing them in order to condense the playerbase they've introduced a biome rotation that lasts for around 30 real life minutes So yeah once vaulting is gone or there's atleast a clear intention from the devs to stop removing old content I'd say this is an amazing game On the brightside the game weighs like 12 gigs because of the vaulting ps while i like the difficulty and im ok with the defaul one introducing difficulty settings would also make it a lot more accessible granted some horror comes from you being very vulnerable but hey
controller support controller support controller support PLEASE controller support controller support controller support

Should you buy it If you have a dedicated group yes Also recommend buying it on sale TLDR Graphics audio and gameplay are good and provide a immersive experience Game runs well 1440p on a 2070 ryzen 5 3600 The game itself fun and challenging wouldn't say there's a grind The story through the rundowns I've experience has been good however previous rundowns and subsequently the ability to experience the story are just deleted for the sake of providing new content Game has few bugs in my experience but they can be debilitating or game breaking You can see why this is an issue when added with matchmaking where you can be put in a lobby with someone unaware of the workarounds to prevent these bugs
Great game kinda sad that it wasn't free permanent for thoose who claimed it
realistic coop
i need friends
My friend made me get this game it's ok
3-5
I fucking love this game I'm pissed I haven't discovered it until now 6/2022 Played the free weekend and bought immediately after trying it I am absolutely terrible right now but get better with every run Can't put it down
fun game shit my pants tho
i just got it for free then i have to pay it
If you play with friends 10/10 If you play solo or don't have a mic 2/10
10/10 stellar matchmaking very efficient friends and I were definitely able to play in the same lobby before two of them gave up and left
good
a game of true terror and PAIN
the game was fun and really awesome i do like the game
Good game but takes a surprising amount of juice to run imo
Maravilhoso mas tenho com quem jogar
Played during the free play weekend Gotta say looks like its lacking in content surprised its not a free to play with some type of boost packs and outfit packs of some sort But its alright
Well it's a good game but if you got to be a good server or very2 lag to play And one thing if u want to completed nice and clean with your trusted friend dont pub and dont forget TURN OFF THE LIGHT and HIT THEM WITH MELE
very spooky
It's nice and it's HARD As hell
Rise was amazing As a FW player I enjoyed the experience Personally I'll wait for the next sale but it's definitely a good pick if you can afford it
Hard but fun Sad that I have no friends to play it with tho
Un gringo me ha insultado

All around a great game Not a lot of stuff to do after you beat the levels it seems but I don't know I've been having my friend guide me as we beat the levels together but i love the game play but sadly im playing on free weekend and cant buy the game I like the games recoil and sleeping mechanic makes the game feel more alive not really scary to me but scares the shit out of my 300 hour friend so it stays scary the game updates in rundowns where it deletes the levels it had and shoves in new ones i like and dislike this i don't like how it removes assets that they took time to make and throws it away and levels that could've been fun are now gone BUT this makes it a bit exclusive and some people like that 3.7/5
Can you make the monitor pinging mechanic any more complicated Had to beat the first mission without any pings just walking trough a maze Please And talk about annoying as hell breathing when starting the descent Talk about poorly made tutorial that doesnt explain items like Lock Melters
good
The game is very difficult so it is fun but the biggest difficulty is the bug that prevents the player from clearing the level bug Sometimes my friends and I will greatly increase the difficulty of the game because we cannot use the E key to interact with items We have tried many times and our friends fell to the ground outside an iron gate of c1 This iron gate is one-way Can only be opened from the outside me and other friends are inside the door closes automatically The game is fun but there are too many bugs
fun game

great game
Ci ho sicuramente giocato poco ma lo trovo inutile Inutilmente punitivo Match-making lento Grafica di bassissimo livello Sopravvalutato nelle dinamiche di confronto con i nemici Sopravvalutato nella componente horror Difficile capire cosa fare anche se aprire porte e poco altro Uno dei peggiori giochi che mi capitato di provare negli ultimi tempi I miei sono giudizi personali ma valuterei acquisto solo se inferiore a 10 euro
it's hard Well yes imagine that in the first Rundown there were no checkpoints now they are and they were added in the 6 Rundown so every time you lose before Rundown 6 you will start over again and again until you understand how the game works because it has no tutorial This game is not just about random shooting it's about communication team play and stealth even chaos sometimes all combined But this game gives me satisfaction every time I get further in to the levels because they take about an hour or more for you to finish a mission the levels get harder and harder as you advance more For me this game has a solid 10/10 for the satisfaction and fun it offered and I will not forget how many friends I made from this game the community is quite friendly If you are looking for a challenge for you and you re friends what are you waiting for buy GTFO trust me maybe you will rage so hard that you will brake something if you are not patient or carefule enough GLHF
Everything you want in a co-op survival tactical objective-based shooter
de ok pagar nao muito bug
have fun restarting all the time
GTFO has potential but at the moment it plays like an Early Access title still early in development Environments feel barren and static and provide no real reason to explore Gameplay becomes repetitive quickly and does not do enough to break up the monotony of stealth-clearing room after room of identical enemies But the worst problem is just how long a single mission can take to beat especially the first time and especially if the team gets wiped out and has to replay a large chunk of the map again We spent close to 3 hours playing B2 for the first time trying to do the secondary objective only to wipe and lose over an hour of progress At that point we had to give up because it was two in the morning and there was no way we were going to finish the mission before daybreak The way I see it at the very least there should be a way to save progress at a checkpoint so that a mission can be picked up later but shorter missions would make the game a lot more fun in the long run There is nothing fun about trying to allocate a three hour window among four people to play a game together only to lose all progress when someone has to GTFO to real life
bno aunque tiene algunos bugs que arruinan la experiencia lo pongan gratis otrabe eso o que hagan ofertas que no sean solo del 20 ndbsmndbs
Cool game you see the love that the devs have for their game while playing it
I'm not bad my friends just incompetent
only problem I have is alot of they players play on matchmaking that is for english only and don't speak english
Didnt Like how you dont have access to old levels but they are HARD this is not a game that you grind this is a game that you beat at least some of and then take a break for a few months to recharge and then there are new levels It is very difficult but very fun
good
It's fun
i like
hela good
es juego es un juegaso para jugar en equipo es muy genial por que solo esta muy pero muy dificil

Goodness I love most of this time I like the slow considered game play I like using the terminal and finding your way through to your destination None of this helps though because I hate the security scan door locks The security scan requires all the players to stand in a circle Ok group check got it The circle moves you end up running through the level trying to find the next scan to stop the alarm to stop the enemies spawning in It doesn't tell you where the scans will be until the process has started and only shows you the next scan point I can see why it's there it's a moment of panic that isn't anybody's fault A moment to show skill under pressure and a break in the slowly building tension And it's shit I hate it It's a forced failure with no alternative paths They could just put in an active enemy patrol to weather They could put in an alarm trap that sets off a similiar node to node rush to turn it off I could accept it for example if it was an alarm that went off until you rebooted the power entered a pin etc No this is just a circle being projected from who knows where to open that door you must go through It's absolute rubbish
Very Fun Much Good played during free weekend
AWESOME AS HELL
GTFO means before the three friends ok in the THE FXXK OFF
Good shooty shoot game with lots of aliens and very spooky levels it's honestly a fun game but be warned it's made to be really challenging and you really gotta be on your toes some of the later rundowns become less about being challenging and more about artificial difficulty to an extent with some of their gimmicks but they can still be fun teamwork becomes basically mandatory in some rundowns but running through with a team of friends is definitely quite fun and i enjoy it alot i would only recommend this game if you are prepared to be frustrated with some levels and you enjoy challenging games
piola le falta pulir algunas cosas si no tenes amigos la vas a pasar mal en la vida tmb
Se siente muy bien cooperar con amigos para pasar los niveles
mt foda pena q n tenho dinheiro
left for dead alien isolation good time
Received during the free weekend campaign Within my first 10 minutes of playing I was reminded of Phasmophobia but with guns Teamwork communication and the p a n i c during a hunt which in this case is a defense Very challenging but doable Get your ride-or-die friends to play this game together
It's really fun especially if you have a 4 man If not join the GTFO discord I've played like 10 games with different people from all over and have yet to have a bad time Your time in game might vary but expect to be in game for about 2 hours on a hard level you can't really pause but after you clear an area you can go do something irl if your team is ok with it so it's not like you're calling for mom on the walkie talkie to come hold the bucket under your ass while you play Watch some videos of gameplay don't be that guy with the flashlight on Edit 300 hours in all my friends have it and we play on the weekends Great buy and i'm not even halfway through the game
Really good game with awesome teamwork and horror atmosphere it's a lot of fun
hard apenas hard
Pros c*m gun Cons None there's a c*m gun
GTFO is an amazing cooperative game that will test you and your friend's gaming and communication skills Average session time is pretty long however 1 level can range from 45-60 min to complete succesfully sometimes more if it's your first time through it and you die in the process
Played for the free weekend with some friends and definitely enjoyed the time I had with it It is an unforgiving game that definitely required teamwork/communication to really do well The Menu isn't the greatest and I felt it was tricky to get a private game going without randoms joining in That might have been because of my lack of understanding of the UI but I didn't see the option to start a private match so we just had to get everyone to join quickly The gun play feels good the visuals are nice enemies create suspense and it seems pretty well optimized I have it locked at 120fps highest settings 1440p with a 3070ti and 5600x and only had some frame drops during the initial drop Besides that it was pinned at the framerate limit I set Overall there is a decent chance I will buy the game Especially if my friends do I will be looking at prices when the summer sale hits
get ready for a very hard game
This game makes me want to take a walk outside
So far a game with lots of potential My friends and I had a Blast playing this GOOD JOB
You will never clear a mission unless you mastered it and you can't master a mission until you've played every section over and over as you inevitably die to the new things you haven't seen yet Having to move through 5-10 minutes of content you already cleared just to get a chance to apply what you learned from the last failure is an insult to the player's time patience and memory There's a very clear reason Souls games put a checkpoint right outside the boss door instead of at the start of the section Of course since you've been forced to master the mission your first run-through there is no reason to play that mission ever again as there is nothing new to see or any skills to improve on Oh and you need four players with equally low-valued personal time or you won't be doing anything with this game
Phenomenal game keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout playing it monsters are well done and definitely makes you think outside of the box of how to hold back hordes Would absolutely recommend
GTFO is definitely not advertised correctly It's a stealth game nowhere near as action-packed as the trailers make it seem I played for 10 hours with 3 friends and we managed to do 2 levels and a tutorial in that time So each map takes around 4-5 hours The reason for that is that the game uses a stripped down version of the payday 2 stealth missions The gameplay can be described as traffic light stealth 1 Find enemy 2 Wait for enemy to look away 3 Crawl towards enemy in dark 4 Stop when enemy looks up 5 Continue when they look away repeat until you are at enemy 6 Charge melee weapon and headshot the enemy When you aren't crouch-walking around the entire map with your torch off I found a few glitches Near the end of the first map our party reloaded at a checkpoint and one friend couldn't interact with anything and could only shoot We managed to finish the level but then I had a similar glitch halfway through the second map where I couldn't drop a box I was carrying and so couldn't do anything at all including shoot enemies so we had to restart the map It could have been the servers at the time but I found the game to be laggy and enemies would frequently teleport around and hit you with ranged projectiles through objects The enemies are already bullet sponges so this made actual combat pretty annoying more than engaging The full price tag is absolutely not worth it because I felt like i'd already seen most of what the game has to offer after 10 hours Payday 2 is and has over 300 hours of content
the game has pretty good details
Muy bueno para jugar con amigos en cooperativo dificultad extrema jugar en equipo es fundamental para sobrevivir ideando estrategias y redistribuyendo recursos Muy buenos buena jugabilidad me gusto mucho lo recomiendo
very good horror fps
very confusing but very fun
About If you enjoyed R6 Seige or Dying Light GTFO is sure to please There is a strong teamwork element as this is meant for 4 player coop and you will need to communicate and work together to GTFO of each level The gameplay and guns are really well done and there is some melee involved if you want to save ammo and be stealthy There are a variety of monsters you will encounter in the depths The difficulty can be immersive and you must pay attention to the team's resource management to survive Comments Concerns Suggestions Matchmaking can be hit or miss You can fill in the team with bots which work ok and you can give them orders but for the best experience I recommend finding a group on discord server or dragging your friends in The terminals can be cumbersome They don't take too long to learn but I feel the accessibility can detract from the gameplay When your resources are depleted sometimes you have to use a terminal to list items to find out what is available that hasn't been looted then query them to find what zone they are in go back to the zone then ping them from that zone It can be a little time consuming Given that hordes will often approach from narrow passages friendly fire can be very annoying but it can be mitigated with good prep and planning before sounding an alarm It takes a while to experiment with the different loadouts so it would be nice if you could swap your weapon loadout during a mission
I do like this game and i might buy it after the free weekend
Intense atmosphere really chill community very challenging but fun gameplay lots of teamwork required Doesn't hold you by the hand there is a quick tutorial which you can play which I only noticed after beating a few missions which is at the top of the mission board The tutorial is pretty short and shows you most of the important stuff Has a few bugs here and there missions take a very long time to finish often longest one I've played so far took 4 hours Difficulty scaling based on how many players are in a lobby does not exist therefore if one person leaves you're most likely screwed Still one of my favorite games so far but I do wish certain missions could be a bit shorter and not 4 hours long lol
Bon jeu mais c cher wsh
Really fun with friends hardcore but fun Everything takes planning etc i love the game
IF the game is too hard GTFO
so cool
buen juego lo juge los dias de fin de semana 3 que alguien me regale el juego XDD
Best free weekend of my life Got to smack a big boi's butt undetected for 30 seconds straight and got eaten by tentacle dogs 10/10
No
me gusto el juego
Such an amazing game
This game certainly doesn't feel finished and unless you have yourself a solid group of 4 friends it's not a great experience Definitely not worth the price tag Glad there was a free weekend to test it so I didn't waste the money
consigo convencer meus amigos a jogar
boy i sure do love not being able to see more than 3 inches away from me
its pain but a good pain
A good game that made my heart beat fast
Boring mobs sometimes glitch useless glowing sticks inside lockers waste of time
Unapologetically difficult one of the few games where I've found myself simply unable to clear content due to difficulty Bots work on early sectors if you prefer solo play on higher difficulty sectors they become too cumbersome to effectively use due to fast paced objectives like error/endless alarms essentially making 4 man co-op mandatory Other players can always be found easily in the public Discord server though It's a great time really makes you think and communicate one of my favourite games to play with friends whenever we have a couple hours to burn
Scary as shit
DONT PLAY WHILE HIGH ITS TOO FUNNY BUT YOUR FRIENDS ARE GONNA HATE YOU
Good game Needs more unlocks(weapons
no ammo
10 10
Even though i probably wont buy this game unless it becomes cheaper the free weekend was a great experience and i really enjoyed it The gun play isn't bad the enemies are terrifying and my character needs to go to a psychiatric ward and not an underground facility with an incalculable amount of bumpy butted monsters Even though i got 2 hours of play time there were many laughs and many brown stains too I would seriously recommend buying it to try it yourself unless you want to keep clean clothes throughout your play through
Got this game on free weekend because I was really interested in is as I've watched tons of videos on it But every time I would go down in the intro the game would crash I tried reinstalling my drivers and turning down the graphics settings but it still didn't work I hope it'll work next time I get a chance to play it
This game is actually really cool However it is so brutal and unforgiving it has me and my friend not wanting to play it We spent 4 hours on A1 Unit 23 and cannot get the neonate to the final resting place There are scant med packs for the amount of enemies expected to be killed Granted we were playing with two bots so it may be different with 4 humans I will say the bots really pull through They pretty much immediately revive you and direct you to loot as soon as you enter a new area When they go down though you're screwed
Aesthetically The game is great and intriguing Actually playing it not a great experience TL;DR MILKY WHITE FOG LEVELS BAD 2 HOURS TO CLEAR 1 MISSION SECONDARY OBJECTIVE WAS MANDATORY TO GET KEY FOR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU SHOULD OFFER PEOPLE NEW TO THE EXPERIENCE you should try to sucker them in and THEN sucker punch them with this b]SHIT[/b spoiler I played the game for the first time during a free weekend The tutorial was alright I'm familiar with terminal command line interfaces u]so no issue there[/u I did the first mission with bots commands helped so I didn't need to carry the objective I got a friend to play with me since I WAS enjoying the game Yeah I used the gun with the thermal scope but there should probably be some CLEARLY visible suggestion prompt if its the players first time with the MILKY FOG WALLS you can barely see Nope I'm done spoiler Don't buy it
a melhor parte desse jogo quando exclui ele
me cague en los pantalones recomendades
I love every aspect of this game The visuals the gameplay the horror atmosphere the coop aspect Except matchmaking It is so damn hard to find a match beyond the first two levels And after repeating several bouts of attempting to queue up and getting a full team.one guy leaves and then the system disconnects you from the lobby and tries you transfer you into another one Lastly and perhaps most importantly the b]devs are massive d*ckheads towards modders.[/b
god
spooky
uio
Extremely good atmosphere but messy UI pings indicators from players that are much too dim and lots of unavoidable fights for a scifi shooter that tries to constantly emphasize how you should be stealthy Buggy AI that can't seem to decide when they want to set off the monsters or go running down the hall to follow a command and magically fail to alert a single enemy they clumsily bump up against Gun opportunities are plenty ammo is not They got that right but a lack of options practical playstyles objective variety and for some reason all types of enemies that like to fire homing projectiles of varies types while scampering around without making a sound so suddenly all your party is dead because no one realized 6 of the buggers were just having a party less than a a meter behind you makes this game more frustrating than anything else Once the enjoyment of the aesthetic dies down you realize it needs a LOT of polish to a degree that should be inexcusable so long after its release date
fun with friends
lo tengo en mi biblioteca pero no me deja jugarlo
I played it now while it was free weekend The game is fun has an eerie vibe It's not too dark of a game as it may seem I enjoyed it a lot but there is some things that are very annoying and makes me not want to play There is not many or even any checkpoints in the game I played for hours around 6 h and only 2 checkpoints We didn't even finish it because we've been playing for so long Also it is stupid to me personally that every time you exit from a run you have to restart entirely once you make the lobby again I think for each person their lobby should stay saved On my last run only thing I kept getting in loot boxes was strong flashlights no heals or ammo That should be fixed especially since 4 people need healing and ammo at the same time Some monsters need to be fixed a bit they just won't die even when we used all of our ammo on it stabbed it 10 times with melee Crawling ones should be changed we could not differentiate between dead and still alive ones Friendly fire is definitely not something for this game We're not sure if it can be turned off if it can that's our fault then if not then it should be removed It was already hard enough to see and kill monsters as it is But overall I would recommend With a few changes bug fixes and updates the game will be perfection Definitely a game for live streaming
Dont play this game if you have any anxiety issues The sound ambiance lighting everything just builds a constant pressure that something is around the corner everywhere at all times To the point of jumping around and shooting at an ammo box that your team just opened
poggers
I NEEEED disinfection
I NEED disinfection
Tried it out over the free weekend if you like stealth horror and teamwork games it will challenge every one of those work together or die together
In my little experience playing it the game is a very brutal mix of action shooter and what I like to call Shut up and be serious gameplay It honestly blends both pretty well making it so that there are downsides to running and gunning everything by limiting your mobility via locked doors or enemies cutting off escape routes I feel like the game does the horror action genre very well and deserves a lot of praise for it but I would personally wait for a sale simply because of how multiplayer heavy the game is and how it would require around a hundred dollars to try and get a full crew of friends onboard but still it is a very good and unique experience that is certainly welcome in this day and age
ughhhhh maybe
Do not get it if you do not have at least 3 other people willing to play with you for a extended amount of time Most of the fun you get is in coordinating with your team to overcome the level and playing with randoms who don't use their microphones is a sure way to lose even the first level because they'll fuck up everything including the stuff that was explained in the tutorial
good but somethings could be smoothed out
h1 h1 three friends the fuck
Es un juego Tiene interesantes pero sencillas de entender Lo que hace complejo este juego es en cuanto a la con tu equipo se refiere Si se quiere pasar las misiones se tiene que trabajar en equipo no hay otra alternativa La y los paquetes de son limitados que para ahorrar la mayor cantidad de para los momentos se debe eliminar a los enemigos de forma silenciosa Me ha parecido un juego entretenido y muy fresco incluso siendo un shooter Este nivel de cooperativo solamente no lo visto ni en los zombies de BO3 recomiendo jugarlo con amigos con los bots no es tan entretenido y se pierde gran parte de la experiencia Por otro lado coordinarte con gente que no conoces resultar siendo algo frustrante El lema del juego no por que si Work together or die together
Its so much fun and it feels so real I could feel my heart pounding and I was overcome with adrenaline The weapon options are great and the monsters are awesome and its simply amazing
rely phun tu pley wit frends
Great atmosphere and fun if you have a full team to play with Things can fall apart easily if you're not being cautious If you like alternating between slow stealth and high action this is a good game for you I feel like the rate at which resources run out is a bit overkill but it might be because my friends and I were inexperienced Overall I'd say its a good game to buy on decent sale but not at full price
The action trailers don't promise as much as the release and premiere ones This is an horror game with gunplay but not with big emphasis on it as games like Resident Evil 4 and 5 and Dead Space 3 Even with the great gunplay scavenging and stealth are integral part of the experience in this sense if you don't use them you're going to fail misserably This isn't a Left 4 Dead with more atmosphere this is kind of Helldivers in higher difficulties but with FPS horror and a Dark Souls trait NO.HAND.HOLDING This game is totally unforgiving for casuals lone tryhards or just anyone that is trigger happy You have to be efficient and kill and fight only when neccesary When what this game promises works it works great but you'll need patience A good team helps a lot and it can be the meat of the experience With the bots you'll get a taste with their competence at least for early levels Game accesibility has been compromised in good and dubious design decisions to shape this unforgiving experience that I can't but respect The joy I had when I completed my first expedition was a feeling that I hand't got in so much time And the tension created by the tense moments of this game were also special I honestly can't think of much more polishing this game needs the concept is so good but it's hard to bring it to work with so many people trying to play this like a Cowaduddy or a L4D Maybe more checkpoints or the ping command actually marking the items in the map since you can use this command effectively only in the right room I get why they designed it like this but I disagree with the response that little streamline would help to not slog the experience Matchmaking worked for me very well but I don't know if it was because of the free weekend I'm inclined to think so
played free week you must be at least the minimum age for consenting to personal data collection under the law in your jurisdiction that right there is a hard no on recomending this game which is a shame because the game isint too bad but if your okay with having big brother watching your back then heres what the game has to offer mandatory stealth if you dont stealth you will burn through the small ammo your given at the start especialy at alarm chekcpoints its not bad as the stealth bits are fun bonking the bad guys over the head and hearing them pop but melee combat is not good though The guns are satisfying and have a nice punch too them Most of the small fries are a bit too tanky even when using guns they also have a long reach which again youll have to use guns more often only melee sleeping enemies Some of the guns are very impractical because of how small the ammo pool is for them Bots are decent and fun to play with if you want to play offline Sadly there is no campaign which is a shame because this game has alot of atmosphere and great setting suggestions get rid of the 3rd party eula data mining bs and ill give this a positive review add more characters we need a robo char some more dudes and ofcourse some female prisoners add more guns buff weapons dont nerf them if some weapons are overpowered buff the others to be on the same benchmark this is a pve game ffs its not like the sleepers are going to complain smg needs 80 extra bullets other guns could also use an increase in ammo pool even when your trying to conserve ammo the hardest saving them only for checkpoints you will sometimes just run out remove scouts bs invicnibility frame and fix its wonky hitbox cant count how many times me and my freinds used spears or sledgehammers charged and aimed for head only for it to live become invincible and alert the horde have a new mode called gtfo where you are chased by chasers that are slow but tanky instead of normal go down and access terminals you just run to extraction parkouring jumping and dealing with ocasional sleepers this game needs alot of optimization i had to tweak settings to get at least 50 frames but in certain areas it drops to 30 or 20 add a dificulty settings filthy casuals like me dont like when the game is automatically on hardest dificulty also make the difficulty settings like in gears of war 2 where players can choose for themselves what diff they want to play on instead of bieng forced to suffer by host i would have had more suggestions but until that 3rd party spyware eula is removed i aint sayin no more
2 2
trash
Truly the best co-op shooter out there
Suggestion for developers Do PvP for us You have a great setting atmosphere physics and graphics But the gameplay is boring Add multiplayer and sales will trample Completely different level
I played 10 hours during the recent free weekend it was my first time playing the game though I had seen some gameplay previously The game is alright for casual play I think you really need to be a huge fan of the stealth"/tactical style gameplay to really enjoy this in the long-run I put stealth in quotes because it's less proper stealth more of just crouch sneaking up to aliens with your flashlight off to coordinate melee attacks between teammates this is like a solid 85 of the gameplay loop The times when you can't be sneaky have to use your guns you can be a bit tactical and set up turrets or reinforce doors but that's really it in terms of tactics Beyond that its just standard shoot to kill everything that moves I didn't like that the enemies automatically know exactly where you are if a team mate that isn't even near you alerts the enemies Not only is it not immersive but takes the fun out of the game Also the heartbeat mechanic in enemies gets old after a while especially when there are multiple of them close to each other doing the heartbeat thing one after another move a foot then stop then move another foot stop again If you have friends I'd recommend give this game a shot either during another free period or within the 2-hr refund window I would not recommend buying this game without having played it first with your friend group since that's the most fun you're going to have
git
funny stealth game where you die a lot 10/10
Great game I think should be free to play maybe have special skins to buy items weapons etc instead of buying the game because matchmaking it is too hard to find players past C1 level that was my experience during free to play weekend Game has some bugs matching making players stuck at stairs constant players disconnecting either on purpose or crashing I think most just left the match trying to prevent other players from advancing but overall it's something different which is nice it's playable just seems like the rewards is lacking and player base I wish there were more weapons and weapon customization silencers etc maybe free roaming but that would be a massive expansion The AI use turrets or tactical gear etc which is rough I think even if there was pre placement of turrets/gear like door 1 of map 1 bot 2 places turret in spot 2 since the player would be player 1 to prevent confusion then uses foam gun in spot 2 etc and bot 3 in spot 3 to prevent any compatibility problems that would be better than AI not using the turrets/gear maybe have a memory bit activate the pre program after a key is found within a certain range of a door so bot 1 uses foam gun in pre assigned bot 1 spot once key is found etc I'd like to see this type of atmosphere game applied in a open world base building game that would be amazing I'd like to see different difficulty levels too at times it seems way too rough and the rewards just isn't there there's no weapons to unlock kind of disappointing I played just for the story Overall though it looks great lacks rewards for completing grueling levels player base nags alot disconnects etc to advance you have learn to cope with AI Expecting players to cooperate in the game and finish something is pretty much impossible out of maybe the 50 matches I've had there were maybe 15 matches where players didn't argue rage quit over anything from loadouts to whining about aggroing whatever to people turning on their teams at the end of a level just to troll found progress is much easier with bots than players
Good game Although raises my laptop temperature to near supernova levels
plan is a good one until the first shot is Mark Brouker
Demasiado shooter demasiado cooperativo y demasiado extremo pal mi gusto
playing as Hackett game gave everyone in my squad Hackett's hood except for me I got one worse looking gas mask 10/10 even the cosmetics have it out for me In all seriousness This is a 4 person co-op game This is not like the Left for Dead games or the Vermintide games This game is about teamplay The focus is not how accurate you can shoot or how much DPS you can get out it is about how your group of 4 people can create and execute your own plans under stress to beat difficult odds This game is hard on purpose and it is handcrafted to that goal You will fail missions You will give up on levels You will spend hours and multiple attempts grinding at the same levels until you finally get through it Some levels you may not get through I have completed at least 60-80 of the levels in the rundowns I participated in with 3 person teams Some levels we could not complete without that fourth person If you rely on bots you will have problems The solution to those problems is not to fix the AI it's to replace it with another human If you do not have 4 people you must be willing to find people to fill or the game won't be worth it On that note if you rely on matchmaking you are again handicapping yourself Voice communication and familiarity with each others play-styles are almost necessary to complete some levels
very good static game I love the fact you can play offline with bots to understand the flow of the game and theres no tutorial to babysit you through the process If you like thinking and learning on your own or with friends then i'd highly recommend this game to you This game is all about PVE and everyone has a specific role to play Loot must be shared amongst you and your teammates to ensure your own survival
I had the chance to try this game for a limited time during the GTFO Free Weekend June 16-20 2022 The game starts up in an excellent way thrilling dark secrets in a secret lab infested with nightmarish creatures So a perfect enviromental design Also there's an interesting selection of weapons and tools But the main issues I have about this game is about the game mechanics especially regarding the alarmed doors While venturing through the halls of this underground lab you will find multiple locked doors that you need to open and by doing so you will trigger an endless horde of enemies that will constantly attack you until you shut off the alarm The process so disable the alarm is what I really can't understand because some red circles will appear on the floor and you and your team mates are supposed to follow the circles and remain inside them I would have prefered something more meaningful like ALARM Door malfunction reset door status at the nearest terminal or find the security override switch something that can have more sense and that doesn't feel like a forced minigame that disrupts the flow of the game Defending a team mate while he's using a terminal to shut off the alarm or while he's trying to hack the security or operate in a control room to me it feels much better than playing a king of the hill minigame Another complain I have is why do we start with halved reserve ammunition RNG is already a pain when during a mission most of the lockers contain only glowsticks and lock melters One last thing that I can mention is that some doors can be opened but once you do they cannot be closed anymore It's such a pity because I think it's a game with great potential but it's ruined with poor game mechanics that aim to cripple the player and they feel like a forced imposition that come from outside the game
buen juego de accion mmo rpg no lineal buena calidad grafica y audiovisual con maxima calidad disparos buen juego 9/10 casi de 10 de 10 como el pou aunque el pou es perfeccion 10 de 10
really fun but a bit over priced
dauda and hackett are my best friends 10/10
Not for casual Player
This game is difficult You're required to match with 3 other players often varying language abilities to navigate through a level that may take 45mins minimum w/o deaths Upon dying you go back to checkpoints that send you far back from where you died so a single level may take 90minutes That is if the other 3 players you match with can be arsed continuing and don't DC WHO HAS TIME FOR THIS Stage B1 is a bitch I believe this is a common issue within the community as you can play the map/level very well to still be out of ammo/hp at the last door and fail You only need to look at reviews and youtube content to see.There is something fundamentally wrong with this level Either offer more resources or increase the checkpoint count I can imagine the game becoming very repetitive with the open doors security alarms repetition Having not progressed further than the B stages due to only playing 7 hours on a free weekend I can only hope that the game offers more diversity in levels The UI has received a lot of grief but I really like it It's super immersive but could do with a tutorial/walkthrough instead of just being left alone with it to figure it all out alone I dont think I will buy this game although I was originally excited to try it
What does gtfo mean
It smells like garbage
Co-op stealth shooters are not very common and the moments when this game is good are incredibly satisfying However much more frequently the randomness of enemies and supplies frequently leads to a frustrating spike in difficulty and overall the game feels both light on content and somewhat under-polished Recommend waiting for a significant amount more development or skipping altogether
Disclaimer Played during the free weekend I love the setting I love the audio I love the presentation However I'm not sold on the concept They were selling the game with heavy emphasis on tactical decision making with your party Utilizing stealth heavily and picking your engagements Well in the rundown we played The encounters were forced with locked alarm doors All that resource management they spoke of in terms of health ammo etc kind of goes out the window when you cannot actually manage those things In the end it's just Payday again but with no ammo and the police are aim bot zombie/monster things The fun was mitigated by an insanely high difficulty curve for newer players with little feedback as to where or how we went wrong We don't have an infinite amount of time to repeat the same stage over and over again until we get it right In short list They didn't hold true to their design concepts so far as I can tell They do not respect time limitations for their players Feedback as to what went wrong was poor No difficulty options You cannot step up to the challenge It's just sink or swim New player b]unfriendly[/b list Edits Spelling and clarity
pongalo gratis de una vez me envicie lo amo
It is fun but if an AI is carrying something god forbid they get to a ladder they will be infinitely stuck on that ladder dropping the item climbing the ladder a bit then going back for the item and picking it up to repeat again
It's a good horror survival game with a pretty interesting backstory if not quite vague but I feel like there could be more to it Open doors defend shoot move loot items type shit on a console I know it's combat-focused but something to break the cycle of just doing these things over and over would be good Having said that I had a load of fun with 3 other friends so it's probably worth it if you can get a team going
Joguei do Fim de semana e foi O jogo muito e jogando com o bot de auxilio o Bot atrapalha mesmo com comando de ir silenciosamente ele ativa os bichos Uma Bosta esse jogo
Fun tactical teamplay
Is good but lots of glowing aliens are expected

Make it freeee
Yes I played it during the F2P weekend probably will wait for it to go on sale for less before buying My advice with a lot of other co op horde shooters is DONT PLAY WITH BOTS play it with terrified friends or randoms with mics
The real horror of this game is not the monsters or the atmosphere its knowing your progress resetting after each re-try Very easy game to lose track of time with
Git Good scrubs GTFO Dark Souls with teammates
Free weekend player amazing game will buy next time my poor ass has some money community seems to take it serious and the tactical gameplay is both scary slow paced and just amazing The guns feel heavy as hell I love clicking my lamp just because it's so dark and it's a gamble wether I'll mess up or not Can not recomend enough However I do have a few complaints 1 Why would you delete the previous run downs Keep them in the game I wanna see those too and I believa lot of other people would appreciate legacy rundowns as well 2 Price is a little oof for poor people like me That's all
Ciekawa gra koncept coopowego horroru jest ciekawy jednak gra na system progresji oraz problemy z odpowiednim dobieraniem graczy oraz wyrzucaniem z lobby nie jest warta swojej ceny
lots of fun with friends difficult and hardcore Would be perfect if the price was lower 30 or 25 euros 40 is quite ridiculous in my opinion given that it can feel unpolished at times but overall amazing horror tension terror Love it
Great gritty graphics Good gun handle each gun has its own capabilities and style The melee weapons feel powerful when used correctly and the amount of teamwork required feels like a great refresher for such a deep game there is an element of building out your character and it has a different approach than most Great game definitely recommend I played over the free weekend and will be purchasing it now for sure
Just started and loving the idea of it Lets see if this game follows through
21 43
Free Weekend Review 6/16/2022 6/20/2022 public free weekend campaign While it might look like a horror game with all the visual design mechanics-wise it's a stealth survival co-op squad game There's no scares or tension just atmosphere at best if you're looking for a spooky game It wasn't what I expected with the announcement trailers thinking it was a Left 4 Dead type of combat Instead it is much more methodical Scavenge and clear rooms of enemies while trying to make the least amount of mistakes between defensive gate checkpoints It does give you checkpoints to restart your run at the same health and ammo state you've reach the checkpoints at The defense capture points and enemy spawns are randomized each run as well are the key phrases you need to type into the consoles It seems to deter speedruns and skipping parts of a mission for a run Quality of Life options of searching for VoIP players in game lobby should be adapted in more games E.G flag yourself as no mic or search for players who only uses mic It is best played with actual players instead of the bots as the AI can only accomplish so much E.G the bots can't do a timed sneak attack with you so you won't be able to stealth takedown that takes more than 1 hit alone with bots Bots are also reckless with rescuing downed teammates at the cost of them getting incapacitated as well One down player can mean all your Bots are going down instantly trying to save them
buen juego
GTFO is more of a horror game in the classic Resident Evil sense in that most of its horror comes from dread moments of extreme tension and dwindling supplies rather than straight up making you jump out of your seat I find this works well for a tense fps game but I still would like to see a bit more of the latter at some point I want to hide from some giant unimaginable horror roaming the corridors 8/10 game amazing with friends absolute hell with bots
He probat la i segurament imprescindible jugar amb amics o que la teva esquadra la completin jugaros reals i no bots Juagant amb bots al teu equip se't impossible Molt necessari una bona amb l'equip
Do you have 3 other friends you wanted to cut ties with You have come to the right place Best when played with other random masochist 10/10 better than banging your head onto a wall
ive never enjoyed the satisfaction of blowing up big people's head with a sniper more than in this game
I literally cannot complete the 2nd level Based
My friends and I paid to get PTSD 10/10
nice fog of war game
I played this during a free to play weekend and I only played the first 3 missions To start this game is VERY HARD It is not a shooter It is a stealth game you have to play slow and be smart A lot of this game's difficulty comes from the scarcity of resources and checkpoints I would love if there were more checkpoints Losing 30 minutes of progress because I died to some monster that snuck up behind me and one tapped me Because I was low can be frustrating
fun game
All you need to know FPS made in Unity hr Jokes aside some points from me The BAD press and hold to apply any menu setting is ridiculous gunplay isn't fun I doesn't feel it HUD is still small for me despite setting 120 The GOOD tension is in the air there is atmosphere there are terminals so I can type shell commands not only on my Linux PC 21:9 monitor support hr TLDR meh I'm too old for this sheet
Just get friends lol
Security scan game mechanic doesn't make any sense Why move around Enemies run through players Game lags when enemies appear Good idea not good done
i cant even get back in it after the event
Trash
Hard but interesting and good game
3 4 horror survival 9/10 10/10
b A Fun and Thrilling tactical cooperative PvE that blends stealth darkness and horror as you delve deeper into the unknown b A 4-player PvE cooperative game that sends you deep in the underground with minimal to no information of what you're about to face in the dark Teamwork and coordination is a necessity to survive in this game The game also offers an option to play alone Though the game is best played with a group solo play is another experience as it demands you to be more careful in both managing and navigating in the dark as there's no back-up to revive you when you're down There is also an option to add bots to your roster which you can fully command to do certain tasks depending on the mission you take Stealth is another important aspect that I really liked in GTFO You start in every mission with half of every ammo and tool in your inventory With limited amount of supplies you are obliged to search for resources to better equip yourself in accomplishing the mission at hand However the level is engulfed in darkness that conceals hostile entities lurking in each area This is where the element of stealth comes to play sneaking up behind enemies and eliminate them as you thoroughly navigate the area for supplies Tread carefully though enemies can be alerted in many ways and you'll be overrun by a horde of hostiles in no time Despite the tactical aspect of the game it leans more unto the horror genre The clever method of using darkness to conceal hostile entities reminds me of a particular feeling I usually find in most horror experiences The feeling of suspense and uncertainty of what lurks within the area urges you to b GTFO b u PERSONAL NOTE 6/20/2022 At the Time of Review I was able to play this game through STEAM's Free Weekend u Aside from the unlockable cosmetics and boosters that have limited amount of uses before disappearing completely my only complaint is that there's isn't much progression and unlockables available in the game I really feel tired after searching each area thoroughly for boosters only for it to disappear after 1 use I honestly got bored after 4 hours of playing the game Investing my time in finishing a mission feels empty without a sense of accomplishment I really wish the game provides more content and progression like skills weapon mods upgrades etc in the future

its ok gunplay isnt fun and enemies feel annoying to fight if you want a better coop shooter get deep rock galactic
pretty fun but it doesn't seem very stable idk maybe i'm just bad
lo juegue como prueba gratuita es un buen juego solo 2 cosas malas que le veo es que si no sabes ingles no le a lo de los comandos y la otra es que con amigos es mas divertido xD pero igual se disfruta la experiencia tanto en solo como con randoms pero como dije este juego es mejor con amigos lo recomiendo cuando este en oferta que valga la pena y no lo compres para que lo juegues 1 o 2 horas como mucho en concluir campratelo en oferta tiene buenos creo que tambien tiene lore pero como estaba en ingles no le xD igual nose si hay una para ponerlo en pero igual ya va ha cavar la semana de prueba seme hase un juego no tan de comprender otra cosa este juego no es humilde asi que con el windows xp no te lo correra asi que utilisa ge force te ayudara pero bueno alto spam y eso que ni me paga en fin ta weno XD
Des missions pas et un peut longue ne pas se et bien communiquer sont les clefs du
fun but buggy and gets frustrating if fail many times game would be good if cheaper not worth at current price
Juegaso No es un simple shooter Es un juego cooperativo en donde tenes que ahorrar las balas usar tacticas y sobre todo aprovechar el sigilo La verdad que cada vez que juego mas me gusta Ideal para divertirse con amigos
these a fun game with friends
i like
Intresting game very tactical gotta use voice an work in a team
spooky

La gracia del juego es jugarlo con otros 3 amigos pero mis amigos no tienen plata para comprarlo y el unico que si tiene es un hdp tarado inutil que no entiende que se puede apagar la linterna PABLO HDP ENTIENDE QUE HAY QUE HACER SILENCIO Recomendado 10/10
Me leyendo las que jugando al juego 10/10 recomendado
There is no horror Its not scary and is a little boring The gunplay is bad and the AI is very spazzy Also my game crashes every single time i join the first time Overall did not have fun
Pretty fun with friends
this is sick but my friends rage quit lol
10/10 pistol kinda
great for a late night game

Pros of this game Soundtrack Gameplay Hud Game story Atmosphere Cons stupid teammates
free weekend is over so i gtfo
Great game have been playing since the start and the Devs have done a great job developing and growing how this game works Really fun
Die ist super es ist anstrengend aber es macht sehr viel Es ist schon eine Herausforderung
giga koks
JUEGAZO
Didn't have any connectivity issues
not worth for me this game to easy
This Game will only make you depressed Not recommended
this game is too hard
Let me start by saying I love this game Ive owned it since it first went into early access with Rundown 1 Its such a great coop game to smash with 3 friends ive seen people compare it to L4D and it really isnt that at all However there are some issues I have that lead me to NOT recommend this game Firstly is the adamant stance on how they are handling the rundowns As of the time of writing we are in rundown 7 All 6 prior rundowns are currently NOT playable through official means more on that later and there are no plans at least as of right now to facilitate that This means you are unable to experience the amazing lore that the game has to offer outside of watching on youtube or reading wiki pages this is a real disappointment and something that you can see on the steam discussion forums a lot especially now with the free weekend going on Topic after topic of why should I spend more than 10 on this game when they are constantly removing content and honestly I do kinda agree Secondly the modding community for this game is shunned COMPLETELY 10 Chambers want you to experience exactly what they are offering in the game when you boot it up and nothing more There is a link to the modding discord in the rules of the GTFO steam forums and I believe there is one in the rules channel on the official discord but even mentioning that mods exist will see your posts deleted and warnings issued Its absolutely wild to me that they would do something like this especially when YOU CAN PLAY ALL OF THE PRIOR RUNDOWNS BY MODDING THEM BACK IN Whats the point in refusing the enable them officially and then stop people talking about mods when one of the biggest gripes people have is not being able to play them This is completely ignoring the handfuls of QoL mods on offer as well as FULLY CUSTOM RUNDOWNS with fan made maps weapons and enemies All of this WITHOUT official modding tools These modders should be CELEBRATED by 10chambers yet they want nothing to do with them and actively sweep them under the rug Baffling decision
spoiler strike spoiler
Have tried it during free weekend now I wish I hadn't because now I want to buy it Funny and scary nough said I don't care about broken matchmaking and other stuff since me and my friends know how to manage a game group since we're not noobs Funny scary and tactical thats all you need to know
Had the game for free week-ends played all 3 days Here what i think The Ups The game got alot of playtime Gun play is nicely done The ambience can become real intense and The graphics Run Smoothly The con Matchmaking is completly bugged and that what the huge turn off for me and getting a match sometime mean waiting 30-45 mins just to get people that leave after one try There is some sound issues and some minor gameplay issues like being unable to use items until you reload checkpoints And for the dev i would realy suggest to stop doing the reset of all level guns every big update You should just stack the previous campaign as acts to get a huge game plus adding actual reward for completing mission non-cosmetic and more gameplay oriented Another add on would be a skill tree with various classes Adding difficulty slider for each mission that could increase spawn rate detection rate in resume if you got 3 more friends you are all set to go but playin with randoms kill the whole experience Would wait till on 50 sale
It still has some bugs to work out Some of them are game enders Stuff like crashing.then when you load back in it duplicates the objective item and you can't drop the duplicate So that being said I did have fun over the free weekend and I think it is worth the sale price
fun with friends
Cya on the next free weekend
T in T alarm stands for Trauma
Not enough content for free weekend
Game keeps crashing i have a 3060ti
Ta bueno si lo juegas con amigops
From what I tried on the free weekend I loved the game Unfortunately I cannot get my friends to spend 120 total on this game even though they had a great experience as well apart from the multiple game breaking bugs we encountered because we are broke Edit We ain't broke no more Game is very cool and very hard I would recommend it Probably you will not be able to complete everything but still I liked everything this game has to offer and I will continue to play It time and time again
Fun game amazing atmosphere and tension hardcore CO OP Wish I had the game Pls somebody Also this game for some reason absolutely loves to crash on me during the drop pod phase/start of the mission but when I finally manage to get past that I find GTFO to be a very Enjoyable Experience
Spiel ist nur eine bestimmte Hardcore-Klientel die auf u]Stealth[/u und u]Melee[/u steht Vier menschliche Spieler und ein gut funktionierendes Team sind b]Mindestvorraussetzung[/b Die Gegnermenge skaliert nicht mit der Anzahl der Spieler Versucht es gar nicht erst zu zweit oder zu dritt zu spielen Keine zur Anpassung des Schwierigkeitgrads Die chronische Munitionsknappheit zwingt einen zu der immer gleichen Spielweise Man ja Loot-Mechaniken einbauen die Spieler welche mehr Zeit in das Durchsuchen der investieren wollen mit mehr Supplies belohnen Eventuell man ja mehrere Komponenten sammeln und z.B zu Munition Aber nein man ist gezwungen zu schleichen und die Gegner mit der Nahkampfwaffe auszuschalten um viel Munition die unvermeidbaren Alarmphasen zu konservieren Ich nicht immer auf die Munitionsanzeige blicken ich will auch mal ordentlich auf die ankommenden Wellen losballern so etwas nennt man liebe Developer offensichtliche und Bugs z.B spawnt jemand am Checkpoint mit einem Missionsgegestand in der Hand den er nicht mit E ablegen kann die Option ist da er legt ihn jedoch nicht ab ein Rejoin in die Session behebt den Bug jedoch nur bis der Checkpoint wieder geladen werden muss
pretty sure the game is p2p so if the host disconnects so does the whole lobby can't complete a game with this issue
Absolutely fantastic
muito da hora
Why did I not get this a looong time ago Played during the free weekend bought it now even though I'm broke as
Mailman sim with the bois
Played 2 times after 10 matchmakings creepy but halas not fun skip
cant see shit because OLED display but fun game
me when the sleepers
Foremost the concept of this game is unparalleled There are so many games out there attempting to be a successor to Left 4 Dead and this game has a legitimate claim to that throne The futuristic dystopian setting combined with the guns playermodels equipment etc is eye candy to anyone who enjoys that sort of RPG aspect You play the role of a mentally broken prisoner forced to dive into creature-infested facilities and you damn well feel that role There is a near perfect balance of stealth and action the horror elements are a phenomenal addition and the hardcore aspect makes your individual actions truly matter Strangely this game doesn't really get old either Each level feels new and fresh and with the constant addition of Rundowns sets of chronological difficulty increasing levels the replayability is phenomenal But nothing is ever really that simple The game is plagued with so many bugs and core issues I am writing this review after playing it during the free weekend and although I initially enjoyed the game it became hellish pretty fast I ended up playing the second level like 6 times due to various problems A game crash a hard-locking bug causing me to perpetually carry a collection case or most prominently incompetent teammates Before I get into that I must say that matchmaking is buggy enough on its own I spent over half an hour joining and hosting various bugged lobbies at one point which really shouldn't be an issue this far into the game's lifespan My biggest issue tho is that the game operates on this principle that I can matchmake for a level with randoms-but again nothing is really that simple Like 9/10 times it is IMPOSSIBLE to complete any of the harder levels with randoms My friends and I don't play games like we used to so playing cohesively with a group of friends is out of the window for me and I must resort to matchmaking or Discord more on that l8er if I want to play the game Anybody in a similar predicament will find themselves playing with a Chinese dude who hardly speaks English he was very nice though I still love him someone who doesn't use voicechat despite toggling the All Players Must Use Voice matchmaking option an asshat who activates alarms and scouts for no reason or people without any semblance of cognitive function or critical thinking skills Oh and you can't kick people at all neither votekick nor host kicking It is HELL The only way around this is to visit the Discord server but even then it isn't much different from matchmaking People who actually bother to go into the Discord are more likely to be more dedicated and intent on completing missions but very marginally You are still grouping up with unknown humans unless you spend time socializing on Discord-and I'd rather die than be caught mingling with Discord dwellers I really REALLY wanted to love this game trust me The setting gunplay/combat mission structure aesthetics etc are all some of the best I have ever experienced in my entire life The teamplay and hardcore aspect is great and certainly necessary for this game but if the devs think for a second that the current matchmaking system is sufficient for it they are delusional I have no idea of what an ideal alternative would be other than playing with friends but I do know that this game isn't worth 40 to me If you have 2 or 3 friends that aren't garbage at video games y'all should get it If not maybe wait for a sale or find another reason to justify buying it
May be fun with friends but as a solo player it's rather dull and tedious
8 100-150
questo gioco come torino
very fun just the moving loading screen can make some people lag out
stealthy game with high risk like this is stupid fun End up chaotic and destroying friendship is surely but that's the fun part
takie sobie
chyba polecam
good with friends/frenemies
Cannot recommend Problem is I wasn't even able to finish even one match over the weekend due to connection and stability issues Don't understand how this game is out of early access as this was also the problem long time ago
I played it on the free weekend not my cup of tea it feels unfinished and clunky
this game is very nice just why in the world would i pay or on sale to play it it seems a lot for the content represented and yes its a very unique experience i actually had never spent 4 hours in a row trying to finish a level with total strangers but still i wouldnt pay more than maximum for this game
total garbage and a waste of time
This game can play solo but if you have a full party This game has a lot more fun
until next free weekend fellas
Nice
fuck
First time reviewing a game here Played this during the free weekend Been wanting to get this game however am not so well skilled in FPS but the premise of this game drawn me in Definitely a recommend when you have a solid 4 stack to play with Will buy this game when I do have the team
W game

z promocji w GTFO podczas darmowego weekendu Pierwszy kontakt z odczucie negatywne Nie wiadomo co i jak i szybko ginie Po pierwszej nieudanej grze spokojniej i z nam poziomy A1 i B1 na C1 ale chyba za na nasze Gra pomimo pierwszego niekorzystnego kiedy da jej potrafi ze na ciekawe smaczki Dobry kooperacyjny FPS gdzie trzeba czasem pewne sytuacje akcje i nawzajem patent z terminalami wyszukiwaniem informacji itp Trzeba zasobami bo nie ma ich nadto amunicji i cicho w gra daje z pokonywania wyszukiwania i znajdywania Klimat Obcego i Space Hulka wysoki poziom z sukcesem kolejnych ekspedycji Gra jest chwilami monotonna ale to celowy zabieg podczas szukania kluczy itp ale tylko na pierwszych mapach jest takie Kiedy zaczyna akcja z po otwarciu drzwi zabezpieczonych alarmem a nie przygotowani na odparcie fali obcych szybko z powrotem do lobby jeden po drugim to gra jest taka mroczna tajemnicza i nie prowadzeni za Po tych kilku godzinach grania osobom w grach FPS Gdyby prostsza i amunicja nie problemu kolejnym zmodyfikowanym DOOMem a tak jest innym Oryginalna gra Po darmowym weekendzie nie dopiero rodzaje obcych i ich zachowania taktyki Jest fun Trening czyni mistrza

stinky baby pees and it's very painful
It is a good game it just need regional separation and better matchmaking Playing with over 200 ping with people you cant understand it a little hard
2/10
Why do i have to type in ACTUAL WORDS into the terminal to get pings for the objectives As a poor person living in a hut without a keyboard i find this highly offensive and it feels like a mockery of my situation Also the zombies instead of eating you like decent taxpaying zombies they just lick you until you succumb to their licking fetishes Plus the bots are always better than the humans u get in matchmaking which seems offensive to me as a human Decent game 7.2/10
HOW IN THE WORLD did this game came out of early access without even a TUTORIAL LMFAO I'm glad I didn't bought it Thanks for the free weekend at least now I know I wont be getting this game until I know for sure it's a complete game and not a half baked school project
Git gud
1060 fps 5-10
VERY FUCKING HARD GAME
Coordinate or die
It was fun for the free weekend but needs alot of free time to play levels
I'd give this game a thumbs up but the overall experience is really mixed so I chose not to Atmosphere and the concept visual design are great music compliments it very well but the level difficulty design is somewhat questionable most of the time Take D2 from Rundown 7.0 for example the section where you have to hold off endless wave the enemy on a bridge you can either encounter fair amount of regular mobs mix with the bigger one or all of them are invisible AND bigger ones depends on the RNG either intentional or not the checkpoint system are great but the location of them are really strange depends on which expedition you are playing the first one on A1 is really werid because there's barely any challenge in the first section but they give you one there for some reason yet on C1 there are areas which clearly needed one after unavoidable long fight but they only have one before the last section and you still have a long way to go before you get there This game is definitely challenging and requires teamwork as they advertised and I have no problem with that Unfortunately the difficulty often feels unfair The enemies can hit you through walls and the feedback of getting hit is close to non existence aside from the aim punch you get when receiving damage as there's no damage indicator or audio cue your character does make sound when getting hit but not always Overall I get that they want the game to be punishing and all and I totally dig but it's also important to not make it feel cheap and just for the sake of being punishing As for the price it's not worth it in my opinion 25~28 should be the normal price tag then consider buying AFTER the discount Edit Just when me and my friends are about to reach the last part of D2 and we were really really close beating it the game decided to give us the checkpoint bug they haven't fixed since Rundown 6.0 and we had to give up DEFINITELY not worth the price
It is cool but very hardcore there's no easy mode on this one so don't go in trying to skate your way through Become good
It's an amazing game even without friends I love how bits and pieces of the story is sprinkled throughout gameplay instead of full on cutscenes and it makes it feel like you really are playing the character that's given to you I personally feel it's a great game and you don't even need a crazy pc to play just a half decent one It's graphics are gorgeous and gameplay tension filled 9/10
death is fun
very fun game with friends
hacket is my femboy
Very HARD very GOOD
best but very hard for only one
I've tried 2 matches had desync issues 3 times 2 time the game just didn't recover for over 5 minutes so just closed it out after the second one I just dropped all interests for the game cause this should be a hardcore survival game the game just syncing out without recovering ESPECIALLY in combat is a huge no Game itself might be fun but I just couldn't be bothered to keep retrying the same mission hoping this time I can actually finish it without having to close the game out and losing all progress that I've made There should be a fallback to at least let me solo the mission or swap the host that actually works cause apparently it is implemented and most definitely an option to rejoin a run recently left
I played on the free weekend Really wouldn't recommend this game all you do is stealth that gets harder And it's better played with a group of friends than absolute randoms They are weird and mute

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place Ingredients 1 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 1/2 cup white sugar 3 1/2 cup brown sugar 4 1/4 cup water 5 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6 1 pinch salt 7 5 apples peeled cored and sliced 8 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions 1 Preheat oven to 425 degrees F 220 degrees C 2 Combine butter white sugar brown sugar water cinnamon and salt in a saucepan over medium heat Bring to a boil remove from heat and set aside 3 Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate Place bottom crust in pie plate pour in apple slices 4 Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle Cut into 8 1-inch wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal 5 Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie coating the lattice and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust 6 Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes Reduce heat to 350 degrees F 175 degrees C and bake until the crust is golden brown the caramel on the top crust is set and the apple filling is bubbling 35 to 40 more minutes Allow to cool completely before slicing
An visually flawless title with fantastic sound design Stupidly grindy often lack-luster and repetitive game play At times it can feel like more of a extremely well thought out aesthetically captivating and needlessly frustrating puzzle game rather than an immersive FPS Not for me
I have no friends so this game isn't very fun
Poor optimisation so I can't even play the game does give away the quality in just having a somewhat inhuman scream everytime you start the game so I would expect a bad jump-scare game and a small look through the discussions just show the game seem to suffer from a small player-base needing almost insane amounts of memory in the computer and it seems to be top-down If you dislike the game just go away kind of mentality where hardcore seems to mean very different things for different people
4-5 25
I was able to try out this game during free weekend I really wanted to like this game because it has such amazing sci-fi artistic vision The cage drop sequence UI weapons and character models are so fantastically done with tribute to games like Dead Space Alien Isolation etc I loved everything aesthetically about the game The gameplay is tight and intense I was able to get together a group of 3 to play and we were on the edge of our seats the whole time It truly felt like we were in this together and trying to survive However the game is very punishing We died multiple times mostly because we kept running out of ammo The checkpoints lock in your ammo count among other things Therfore even when we died we reset to the last checkpoint where we had no ammo The only thing we can do was reset the entire mission over again which is quite repetitive The gunplay felt fine to me It's definitely not as sharp as say a Call of Duty shooter but it gets the job done for the most part The UI does need some work because it was very hard to find out our objectives as a team However there was a standout feature in the UI I love the map feature where we can draw on it to direct the team I thought that was very innovative There are a few bugs One of which was game breaking during my first run through I deployed a turret and could no longer pick it back up I could also no longer pick up items or revive teammates since that command was glitched out Even resetting checkpoints did not fix the problem so ultimately we had to quit the run Overall this is a game you probably don't want to play with randoms It requires very intimate teamwork where you spend a lot of time together Compound that with the constant death runs and I can easily see a team member being frustrated and lashing out at another player Players can also disconnect for what ever reason If that happens the run is completely ruined and everyone has wasted their time I hope they add in saved checkpoints where you can come back at a later date The runs get really long and not everyone has enough time to sit through a multi-hour long run without taking a break especially for a full team of 4
I got to play the game for free during the free weekend and there's a lot I really like about the game I love how immersive the game can be and I love the horror/sci-fi atmosphere I love the mystery of the whole scenario On the graphics side everything looks great I have two major gripes with the game that will probably prevent me from actually purchasing the game 1 The game is just way too difficult Even when using stealth conserving ammo and working together with people by the end of a mission everyone had 20 life and basically no ammo And so we'd come to the final alarm door and wipe And without health/ammo packs we just couldn't progress past the horde 2 Glitches/Design issues We ran into a number of glitches that would just outright kill 2 hour runs And how is there a multiplayer game in 2022 where you can't matchmake with your friends in the party Idk It's a good game but flawed

I really like the immersion you get when it comes to remaining stealthy conserving ammo and teamwork I disliked the most was the matchmaking process and/or the inability to add a fourth player while in game Overall though 9/10 in my book I recommended the game to a friend
Brilliant game brilliant graphics must-play
beaucoup de jeux le surnom de vomitron mais celui ci tout en plus injouable avec des crash innombrables et sans aucun log ni error code bien entendu
Am Scared
Cant even launch the first mission
fun game but very hard its a game best played with a full team
ok
the game is fun and hard but i think the game should be cheaper to create a decent player base because the game requires teamplay
FREE WEEKEND I played a game or two but it's obvious that matchmaking is kind of broken Long que times aren't a good thing in a game that focuses solely on multiplayer The game was very confusing for me as tho what wasour objective and why are we doing it Obviously we failed seeing as I was grouped with people who were playing the free weekend too Good graphics and foam gun else than that I've seen no positives
its great game community players are cooperative and encouraging new players to work together but for what its worth still waiting more discount to actually buys it

The immersion is out of this world The setting is gritty and uncomfortable as you constantly feel that something's gonna jump out of the shadows to rip your head off Gameplay is hard as hell which also contributes to the immersion If the prisoners aren't working as a team no one will go very far This game is the definition of intense

Amazing Heavy SCP vibes from this game wish they'd lean into it harder The game is a great foundation for SCP-like missions and I'm praying for a big DLC or a new direction from GTFO 2 if that's ever made 10/10 can't get my friends to play it
Amazing game but it's clearly lacking some stuff if it would have been in pre-release i would have probably bought it after the free trial because it would have been shown that they were aware about some issues
This game is hard like my d!ck but I can handle it
It's pretty good
Played it when it was free weekend really enjoyed this game puzzle,FPS with a mix of horror Had a buggy moment but still love it
ABSOLUTLY WONDERFUL GAME BEST PLAYED WITH MATES even though played the free weekend defently worth a buy
joa das spiel ist schon ganz ooookay vom gameplay her aber wie mit einem lvl system den charakter und vielleicht ein paar upgrades waffen und werkzeuge ich bitte euch wir sind im jahr 2022 und man kann in diesem game nicht einmal irgendwas craften oder verbessern 10 Euro ichs kaufen und bei sehr sehr seeeeeeeeeeehr guter laune evtl auch noch 15 Euro
can i play this game forever after free weekend
7/10 P.S
Pretty exhilarating but heavily team-dependent You'd be hard-pressed to be matched with a team that's patient and not prone to rage-quit which would make you feel like a waste of time However if you do find a reliable team with hours to spare It's amazing This has been one of the most fulfilling games I've played in a long time Hope the VR mod works with Rundown 7 soon
Ta mejor que los del Vanguard
Game can be fun given you're playing with a full squad of four players This game is about stealthily navigating levels to reach the objective and get out The game involves inputting a lot of commands in a terminal to find resources and hints I liked this idea at first but it quickly becomes tedious It almost necessary to do this since ammunition is hard to find AND you are forced to fight at certain security doors so going full stealth is not an option Having to scavenge the level for ammo health and utility ammo often had me lost despite having a 2D map To me there is also no sense of progression All weapons and gear seem to be unlocked from the start The deeper a player goes down in the dungeons the harder it gets But what a player has achieved after having progressed a couple of levels was hard to tell for me This makes the game feel quite repetitive I'd also like to see some difficulty balancing if there isn't already Playing this game with bots makes it way harder than if you were playing the game with four players You have to manage their ammo and health but the UI for this is terrible I'd recommend at least three human players but keep in mind that the matchmaking system does not seem to work very well What the game does well is the way you can command bots to perform certain actions The atmosphere is dark and scary-ish and the enemy types are well designed But unfortunately the issues mentioned above need to be ironed out first before I can give a thumbs up

GTFO is a hard game to recommend not because its quality which is stellar but because the target demographic may simply not include you This is a hardcore team-based cooperative stealth shooter with simple but intensive resource management Do not expect L4D expect a game more in the vein of SWAT with a dash of survival horror Movements have to be precise mistakes are costly and can easily end a run at worst but at best you might recover without wasting any resources which is incredibly skill-rewarding What do I mean with this last part Think back to any classic survival horror game The Resident Evil 2 remake for instance you can just run pass zombies or clear the room to loot and explore at your leisure You can take down Tyrant with a KNIFE and save yourself an entire chapter worth of ammo grenades and health to spend later GTFO has this same ethos for resources measure the threats calculate your risks plan accordingly and decide what is worth for you and your team right now because the fights are plenty and your bullets are few
I have never won a match and I have almost 10 hours Update Finally won It's extremely satisfying
Please send help
I want to die now
this game makes me want to cry The second level makes me want to nail my balls to a cross and set it on fire fuck this game
The sights for the guns make it harder to see enemies Pretty game though
big ass guy so strong
Good game
Personal Opinion I dont think it's that good
G G G G G G Bug
Didn't know if I would like it thanks to the free weekend I'm buying it for sure Extremely hardcore you need to be aware of your surroundings 100 of the time because 1 mistake can fuck you up Even if it doesn't kill you on the moment it will make the rest of the level way harder If you like hardcore games and you have 3 friends that do aswell this one is definitely for you Would recommend 100
wow im so bad at this game 10/10
wow i suck at this game
Its a good game when you are 4 people playing together and using voice chat But it suffers when someone drops out since no bot takes over or people can drop in to fill the party If you aren't lucky enough to matchmake with people who actually use the in-game voice chat The difficulty is quite balanced and the music is really good along with the voice acting Also the game could do well with a better drawn map
great design good graphics creepy survival horror 4P co-op great to play at night with the lights off what's not to like well for starters the game is set to a very high difficulty I enjoy a challenge but the team is constantly out of ammo constantly about to die and getting aimbotted by creatures around corners and through door frames brush fog anything for that reason this game is PAINFULLY ruthless and has a learning curve that will frustrate more players than it will bring in There are also some weapons and tools that are just not very good so there is probably still some balancing needed Finally the bugs In 5 hours of play encountered some game breaking bugs that really made me mad more than any design choice NO REG melee hits in a game where stealth matters doors being closed for half the team while the rest can progress and people not seeing certains things Those are bad bugs that shouldve been patched before a free weekend If you want to play this game regularly that is something you'll have to deal with I was really excited to try this game but they lost a sale instead of gaining one I really hope the game can be improved and maybe next year I'll give this one another chance For now PASS
ok so i found like 20 bugs most of what are game stopping critical stuff if anybody dc's it will lag you to death possibly make it so u cant open stuff for the rest of the mission if anybody other than the host touches the suit case of bio whatever in lvl 2 you pass the door and die you have a good chance that you will spawn with it in your hands and cant drop or use it thus cannot fight work doors or do anything must restart level the BIGGEST flaw is people treat this like back for blood or fortnight including my own friends if you rush at all you WILL fail if you go the wrong way FAIL 2nd biggest flaw NO brightness control you donno me you donno my monitor i play on a laptop its SO dark i cannot see a thing even with a flashlight on sometimes STOP trying to force players to play your way let them have some controls good game idea good game poorly done to many bugs hardly worth 5 dollars let alone 30 fix bugs that game stop allow drop in drop out let players fix brightness in case to bright to dark for a certain machine dont force ppl to use the computers neat idea but ppl hate it so far refuse to use slightly more ammo not much but slightly if i take 1 wrong door i fail mission period that sucks if its the last part of level i WANT to love this game i like how things move i like how monsters are never same spot keeps it fresh love that i like how lighting and weapons work tho some are useless as hell such as combat turret shotgun things i hate computer lighting being forced to be so dark i cant see anything in a light room never ending monster on door all aplayer has to do to f you over is wait for you to pull leaver then step out of circle and bam u got game over not enough weapon choice snipers are totally useless and 0 silencer mob can detect me from across map so head shots are pointless other bugs boxes turned wrong way locks cannot be broken cabinet smashed into wall wrong way cant be opened items cant be used.(aka cannot use xyz item on lock even if you have lock burner if host lags or dc forced game reset regardless of progress or why mobs dying standing up look alive but are dead may last whole game thus you waste ammo on a mob that died 20 min ago doors wont open even after security scan doors wont open when pushed button door wont close period must have all 4 people to leave level if anybody dc or is downed on the wrong area forced game over rather than 3 winning i cloud go on i would need more time with game and i doubt devs are gonna give me a copy to bug hunt so great game if bugs are fixed and player feedback taken other wise not worth 5 dollars let alone 30-50 it will be on steam 3 dollars sale in 2 weeks fix bugs this could be a classic also warn players before buying this is NOT FORTNIGHT or BACK FOR BLOOD sneaking is a must you go gun ho you die lastly you should have a seizure control switch i myself am not only legally blind but i have seizures and the sudden blinking lights could be a issue change in color or how foten they blink is enough slower better for us folk quick blinking lights can force a seizure on a person white is the worst while red is more safe look into that and get more audience all in all good job dev team the beta was good

stoopid game
I like the game but however the levels seem very long and intense Resources can sometimes be so few and between my friends and I sometimes have to make a decision to restart the level to see if we'll have better odds and this is with us using stealth where we can and using resources sparingly So I'll only really suggest this game if you have the patience and determination to complete the levels You'll also need a group of friends who'll have the same patience and determination as you and then you guys need to work together as a team If you want to solo the levels with bots good luck seriously It's basically up to chance if you get the right supplies for playing solo and if your bots do the right things for that to work Btw the bots aren't even bad to say it is really just small things that can mess things up Also if you want to play solo you'll need prior map knowledge of the levels like what is you're objective the map layout and where the enemies are ganna spawn for alarm doors and what type of enemies spawn generally and ect But that's what I have to say about the difficulty of the game There is some other things this game also offers like cosmetics but you'll need to complete levels for the first time to get a cosmetic The devs make new levels for the player base to play every now and again with new cosmetics So if you fully complete a rundown you can come back when they drop a new rundown with new stuff to do I also want to add that this game has probably the best feeling when you complete a level The euphoria you get for completing the levels can be the saving grace of this game seriously the excitement you get for finishing a level in this game is the best thing Why do I say that because you don't have to play it again Unless you haven't completed the secondary objectives which are basically pain in the ass not fun missions in levels then that becomes a you problem In overall this game is really good with friends bad for solo It is a huge time sink like some levels can take hours out of your day Bots are relatively good but not good enough Resources at too few and in-between that it makes it frustrating I'll suggest trying the game out when it is on a free weekend because the beginning levels of the rundown are the easiest levels

This game is easy but my friends made it hard
It's a mediocre game at best The game does the visuals/atmosphere right but the gameplay is lacking or is just not fun A thanks to the developers that I could try out this game for free Here's some mentions on what I don't like about this game The UI is confusing and overdone but can be overcomed after playing a while Weapons felt weak especially the assault rifles and the SMGs The game is very punishing Failing a run will reset the whole progress The voice lines from the campaign can't be skipped Game's heavily relies on teamwork so if a player doesn't choose to cooperate the game will get very difficult Some latency issues or rubber-banding Lots of exploration required ammo/health thus more time is spent on each run
Absolute banger I've played a lot of FPS and this is already super high on my favourites The game looks great and has enemies that I'm ashamed to admit I'm a little scared of If you like good sound design in your horror games this ones for you You need to pick the right tool for the job or else you will simply fail The level of immersion is stunning even just the menu transition to gameplay is very innovative and I tip my hat to the devs for this fact Things to keep in mind this game isn't for everyone and is extremely hard often taking sometimes days of retrying the same level to complete it with the help of friends you can't change difficulty to my knowledge DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME TO WIN Play it for the gameplay horror and intense co-op or else you will get upset although it does feel reeeeally good when you beat a hard level I recommend playing with other people for the best experience since this is the most emphasised co-operation I've seen in a long time Worth every dollar
hehe
Already played last time and it was indeed hard and dark but now with the new update it increase the difficulty darker atmosphere new environment and new melee weapons Communication is a MUST
long
Tried this at launch and again 3 years later and it still has the same problems it did originally Buggy as hell doesn't scale with party size so you need a team of 4 other wise it is brutal and the UI is still garbage to use Man i should have refunded it
Prefiero meter mis bolas en un balde con acido antes que volver a jugar esta basura con Mister Alduin
If you want a shooter where you are in charge and can kill everything with ease stay away from this game This game will test you push you to your limits and possibly even break you The best part is in the end you are still hungry for more Think halo flood but harder imo Ammo health and tools are scarce and if you start shooting it goes quickly Have been playing for only 5 hours at this point and what have i completed the tutorial mission and the first rundown mission out of 10 with 3 failed attempts on the 2nd mission Going back for that 4th attempt Also join the GTFO discord Play with randoms if your friends are too much of babies to give it a go many people all over looking for groups
honestly pretty sick levels
Similar vibes of repetition to Left 4 Dead series definitely do love this game for it's challenging stealth and balance between high and low moments with a semi-high skill ceiling Limited resources to definitely make you think critically about every bullet you fire and every time you heal or restock and providing alternate challenging routes to restock
uh this game is dumb uh.this game is def not dipped in butter and it doesnt I REPEAT DOESNT SLAP
I was always somewhat interested in the game but after playing it I have to pass with my friend group Its a niche game which isnt a bad thing but its a tedious type of niche A few moments are fun and the rest of the stealth gameplay is just boring and buggy Three friends and I tried the game together and although it was fun at first it quickly became boring and frustrating A difficult game that is frustrating can be good if the gameplay and atmosphere is worth it The atmosphere is quite nice but the gameplay is such a mixed bag Consistently we were doing everything right and the ai would just.not work Stealth being a major element of gameplay is great but only if it works and consistently it didnt It was great to have a free weekend to try because at least I know for sure It is not worth it for me As I have no desire to go forward with the game I wont even bother ranting about the Rundowns being temporary content Which at least makes sense as the small playerbase would make grouping for specific older content near impossible
Ah yes Doom but if Doomguy was geriatric
Es una pija no se lo compren ni 3 horas jugando con el retrasado de mi amigo Mister-Manco y es un hace el juego injugable de lo que ya es por si solo
es una pija desperdicio de tiempo y encima malisimos
Stylistic game but falls short on the gameplay loop It feels like they tried to go for a similar gameplay mechanic as the last of us but in first person and with coop Ran into two game-breaking bugs in the 2nd level where one room was pitch black and a player could see through walls The second bug was that another player was stuck holding a case after respawning and could not drop it even though the case was already used
Tried on a free weekend I started it up barely managed to overlook the first menus looking like a badly made 90s html page and then they started making the menu move in addition to the mouse whenever you move the mouse It was at the moment my menus started running from my cursor I uninstalled the game
one of the most unique team based experiences ive ever played amazing game find 3 friends and force them to play this with you
NICE
juegazo
I literally have no idea what was going on lmao most confusing game ever made Literally got lost in the main menu LOL even the 3 other dudes in my lobby said the same thing Only positive is the visuals game looks amazing but overall was so confused what I just played The game literally does nothing to teach new players what to do Legit throw in buggy background voice overs with no goal in mind and you get the most odd experience ever
Thank god it was a free to play weekend Not my type of game If you like killing zombie-like creatures with a 4 man squad this one is for you
oh well bye xd
Spooky/10
0/10 cant play with friends without setting your secondary language to somewhere in china
Ya really paying 40 yet alone 30 when on sale Glad it was free because I would of asked for a refund after playing the game before the return time expires Buggy as hell with the loot and enemies Would not recommend 0/10 I would rather play the less buggy game yet still really buggy RB6 extraction
yes good game yes had a glitch where i respond at the checkpoint with a brief case bu still good game
Trash absolute garbage
SHUT THE FUCK UP WHEN THEY'RE LITERALLY 3 FEET AWAY FROM US OKAY

I played during the free weekend but I can say for sure that I will buy this game when I have the money Edit I have since been gifted the game but I would have bought it eventually update I Hate this game
ok
amaing
This Game IS SO F**KING Good It Is very intense although it has a optimization problem you will get stutters from time to time BUT Other than that Its great has great game play in every aspect personally The game runs Good on High/Ultra my pc componets are the following RTX3050Ti ryzen 7 5800h 16 gb ram now as for the stutter problem it could be on my end cause i dont have this game on a ssd but idk
Es un excelente titulo acabo de probarlo en el fin de semana gratis y es 100 seguro que lo comprare me parece muy adictiva su mecanica de sigilo y comunicacion con los companeros
Had fun this game is most defitnetly worth some of your time
Very good cooperative game The mix of action and stealth is really good especially when you're all relying on each other However I would recommend playing with people you know as it is probably not good with uncoordinated randoms
Great stealth shooter with good dev that updates often
This game feels like a techdemo everything is beautiful and amazing to look at but unfortunately has the depth of a kiddy pool The multiplayer system is just terrible joining mid game is too cringe apparently so if you have a lag spike on the last stretch of the mission and disconnect then say cheers to your run your friends will have to finish it alone Guns are lacking it feels like they have no impact its like every gun shoots like a nail gun the melee is jank sometimes you can be on a guy about to stealth kill and the melee weapon with long range misses the dude im infront of When the game is about killing atleast make the killing fun They had huge potential with the consoles as the finding of keycards and rooms were fun just again it was as deep as a puddle there wasnt much besides one or two things to use it for which really just made using them a downside to the run Im glad the free weekend came I wont be recommending this under any circumstance as its over the top price doesnt fit the under performing and boring game 3/10 On a good day
Es un juego para jugar con un team o solo es muy jugar con desconocidos porque no sabes si solo van a andar troleando o andan en modo rambo porque el juego es aun teniendo experiencia 10/10
so imagine it's a free weekend and you and your friends want to play a seemingly good game we wasted 3 hours trying to play 1 level we dropped in the abyss more than actual game play fix your online please
This is a good title I think that those among us who are interested in good games will consider it
MUITO BOM ESSE JOGO FOI O QUE EU ESPERAVA
very hard
a good game but very hard
A so-so game with some interesting elements but an awful overall pacing and the world's most annoying offset kerned HUD and text 1993 called and it wants it's shitty Amiga subtitling gear back so it can repair it Gunplay was so-so melee is TERRIBLE and movement just OK Stay away 12/2023 2nd free weekend update tried it again Still rather tame/lame/uninteresting Menus are still awful Stealth is kinda MEH Gunplay as well Movement still odd and kinda stilted Overall nothing about this stands out to me Does nothing well but other than the menus I hate it's completely mediocre in every way While it's Nice to see a product from a new studio but Stay away FAR away
game sucks ball man it keep fucking crash on me and i mad
suffering
Encountered a known game breaking bug in the first 2 hours on free weekend Reloading a checkpoint while holding a mission item causes the item to get permanently stuck in your hands Have to disconnect have host set slot to bot only change back rejoin Matchmaking is buggy and only semi-functional Trying to matchmake with a party breaks up the party more often than not Not a great look
This game offers it's own unique variety of bugs me and my friends has plenty to explore and each got to experience our own unique fault
O jogo legal mas muito mal otimizado vale a pena comprar Trava em tudo compraria se estivesse por 10 pila decepcionante e vergonhosa hypei meus amigos para nada 3/10
Tem uma muito bacana as skins interessantes e o Lore parece ser interessante Esquema funciona certo ponto quando um alarme toca e tudo vai pro Todos os mobs tancam muito tiro tem muito mob as armas tem um spread absurdo e tem uma escassez tremenda de fecha Ao falhar tu volta no ultimo checkpoint que pode ter sido de MUITO tempo o da fase jogando pelo menos uns 30/40min do seu tempo no lixo Jogar com os amigos funciona melhor mas tentei jogar umas com bots e esse jogo tem os bots mais imbecis da dos jogos para um jogo majoritariamente stealth onde tu literalmente tem que ficar parado os bots arrumam uma correria ou um tiroteio o tempo todo mesmo tu tentando dar comando para eles ficarem parados
I hope you have friends because the bots are so bad they will sabotage your missions Which means I now have to somehow convince others to buy set time in their schedules just to get a chance to play this game This alone is reason enough to not recommend this game But when I finally got that chance it's clear the game clearly doesn't want anyone to enjoy it The game doesn't give you enough ammo to handle it's situations The game sets the players up for failure But maybe I'm thinking this all wrong Maybe the intended vision of this game is it's trying to be such a difficult game that it actually transcends into Dark Souls Maybe the real game is you are supposed to only melee everything Really bold of the developers to make an experimental shooter that it evolves into a completely different genre Wait it's not Could of fooled me Without any u]DIFFICULTY OPTIONS[/u just like dark souls I'm only left with my interpretation of this game could be It's a shame really I enjoy Dark Souls But this game has serious problems and if the developers want to save it they really need to be listening to feed back Because this nonsense of forcing difficulty is complete and total garbage
Cool game Reminds me of John Carpenter's the Thing which I just saw in the theatre today on the 40th anniversary tour It's a sneaker/shooter kinda like hunt where it really pays to be quiet I am playing the FTP weekend have not bought it yet Not sure what the goal is but reading about the developers and how much they do for this community is great I support them wil pick this up soon BTW the discord rocks
its aight
Good game but buggy It should scale the amount of enemies and difficulty to the number players playing Also FIX THE BUGS WITH THE MAIN OBJECTIVES BEFORE EYE BLINKING I got stuck with the neonate on the second mission and couldn't drop it Why is that still there but small things are being added/fixed Needs a bit of polishing with the combat and overall gameplay
Has potential but too buggy in it's current state and matchmaking isn't any better either In it's current condition 20 max
funni mine go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Slow fetch quest simulator
no entendi ni una poronga
i stab a creature in the but five stars
i would highly recomend this game to people that like stealth and teamwork based games i will go ahead and say though that youll want to form a group with all mics
Played during the free weekend game seems basically unplayable Me and friends tried repeatedly for over an hour to get into a game together We either had some members unable to see each other in the room and couldn't hit join had people crashing during drop had us all get to the bottom of the drop and just sit in pods unable to get out We have managed twice to get anyone out of pods Both times it was only some players as others sat in the pods trapped watching others walk around
Unplayable literally Missing people in the lobby Infinite fall in the pod 2 out of the 3 people allowed in the game weren't allowed to leave the pod Never got to play it so take it with a grain of salt A good way to lose money if you actually buy it Hope you didn't
Tried to play with 4 friends we never once could load in to the game
Fucking awful playing with randoms
Muy buen juego pero hacen falta mas jugadores urgentemente
10 de 10 shoter estrategico juega solo y disparas y quedas como webon
GTFO pros fast game with modern day graphics with easy controls that moves from location A to B to C and so on cons alot of difficult battles difficult missions/objectives lack of instructions at ingame computer terminals difficult use of ingame computer terminals lack of directions lack of instructions for missions/objectives character handicap gameplay some gameplay forcing players to turn off flashlights overpowered enemy AI some gameplay bugs difficult gameplay good game Personal Suggested Purchase Price Free To Play Free Weekend 6-16-2022 to 6-20-2022
Its a good game but way to hard for average players Checkpoints help but are basically meaningless if just 1 more player on ur 4 man team is uncooperative This was my basic experience over the free weekend FIRST mission took about 6 tries to finish 2nd mission After about 8 tries i gave up I was blessed enough to get into one group with 4 working cooperative teammates Sunday 6/19 After about 2 HOURS in-game on the SAME mission we finally made it past the alert gate we were struggling with on only to realize there was still a final push to finish the map We're all on 20 health most of us out of ammo and no tools to help us We wipe in the last quarter of the final push and one of our guys has to leave The difficulty does not scale after the game has started Im not sure if it scales at all im pretty sure its always set to 4 players Needless to say our 2 and a half hour commitment was rewarded with nothing and left a sour taste in all our mouths The shooting mechanics atmosphere and most everything else is great But the amount of commitment and level of difficulty just cant allow me to recommend this game Which is a shame because i been dying to play it since it was announced and im sorely disappointed Unless you plan on learning every mechanic dumping hundreds of hours and devoting yourself to finding a faithful group of 4 players to play this game with your not going to get the most out of it Its a lil too hardcore even for a hardcore game Good luck
Frustratingly hard punishing checkpoints and way too much padding
fun
Falta um tutorial capaz de ensinar os jogadores a respeito das de cada loadout pq a maioria dos jogadores fica perdido achando que isso um shooter
Tried the demo and had tons of fun I'd recommend playing with buddies but you don't have to to have fun or win Playing with no mics isn't too bad either As for how well it runs I got pretty stable 90ish fps on my RTX 3050 laptop after messing around in settings Still looks great on low mid settings
Jogo pra jogar com coleguinhas mas se preparem que vcs morrer mas num pouco Vai morrer muuuiiito Em algumas partes o jogo mal otimazado e tem uns bugs mas legal ver que os devs abandoram o jogo e continuam atualizando e corrigindo ele
Maybe worth with friends at 25 off If matchmaking I'd recommend waiting for a deeper sale 60 as you won't progress much with randoms Comments Can't proceed with mission if there's an AFK wasting the next N mins replaying the mission Missions seemed to take 30m Initial tutorial mission should have to be passed before allowing matchmaking 8h gametime on trial weekend only pubs
When you consider the size of the development team you can understand there might exist a few bugs here and there some glaring and painful some so small you might not realize it is in fact a bug HOWEVER the amount of time effort and sheer polish this game has more than makes up for any small flaws it may have Considering for 40 USD they have created a game for us to play that they CONTINUOUSLY redesign update and drop full change content drops is absolutely batshit I've recommended this game to so many of my friends and family members I feel like I understand what spokespeople feel like but this game is a labor of love and I believe it's worth it
amazing
Watched some youtubers play this game looked cool so i got it forgot no friends and partial deaf xD so made it a little difficult after soloing the first 2 sections and 2 new keyboards shelved the game for a bit after downloading again let me say the changes are amazing the level designs are incredible the bots are a great addition for people like me still hold my breath a bit when i see the mobs grow red in the distance lol 10/10 game i love it slightly repetitive some bugs where a locker spawns backwards that has the key you need to progress but again would totally buy this game again
A FPS first person shooter horror game It requires a mix of stealth and tactical attacking If you shoot at every enemy you will run out of ammo and be doomed by the end found that out the hard way You can work with other players through text chat voice chat or in-game sound bytes It was fun and challenging and they tried some different game mechanics than other games For example ammo isn't just lying around but instead is like an item you carry with you to use to refill yourself Some were interesting twists others like having to carry around ammo were a turn off
Most of your time in this game will be spent waiting in lobby once you do get in hope to god you have competent teammates who did the tutorial at least if not prepare for dumb fights then team wipes if they haven't DC'ed as soon as game starts not to mention half the time they don't speak english if you can get a good team after 2 hours of waiting the game is super fun but overall the amount of waiting it takes to have that fun isn't worth it
This is not a good game unfortunately I had been somewhat interested in trying it out for a year or more now and decided to try it out on the free weekend From what I've seen it's unpolished and riddled with tiresome game design decisions The main aspect of this game is going through doors The ratio of doors to not doors is one of the greatest of any game you will ever play Half the doors require you as well as every member of your team to stand in a small circle and wait before it opens Just waiting for the sake of waiting It's tedious and not fun especially after you've done it several times within just a few minutes of playing Once you get to get to a combat section you'll notice it feels like early alpha gameplay on a bad connection The enemies move stuttery as all hell If you're not host I don't know how any self respecting dev could release a game in this state I'm sure the game COULD be some fun under specific circumstances like being host playing with friends and researching game mechanics and lore before you play But no one should have to do all that to have a decent experience If you think you might like it then I would say try it during this free weekend but I wouldn't bother otherwise
Great game but they're seriously not kidding when they say team work is required Strong coordination and focus are absolutely required In short not a casual co-op shooter The gameplay is meant to be taken very seriously Best endorsement I can give is memorability This game hard but each mission and the struggles you face terrifying monsters resource management etc are absurdly memorable compared to other similar co op games where you usually just mow your way through waves of paper thin enemy mobs A mission might take 3 hours and a lot of blood sweat and tears but you sure as hell won't forget the challenge and surviving it as a team will feel like a real accomplishment
Honestly is a very good game.You will get good gaming experience with a good team that's guaranteed a banger and an awesome one Can be found in Discord Aside from that it's a very solid game Super recommended to try at free weekend or 2 hrs free game refund period window
FUCK THE FOG
Over complicated menus invitation system until you learn to navigate them Really bad AI for your teammates enemies shoot through walls Gameplay is quickly repetitive Not worth it in my opinion
Game is very boring you lose some hours searching for the scarce resources you are lucky if the bot doesnt catch them The map is a maze you need to care to dont get lost Enemies are too strong for the amount of ammo that is given and you reach the final fight with everything low if you dont spare very much The initial and multiplayer screen is very confuse
Underground Six Flags is whole nother experience It's like Mcdonald's Sprite level of a new experience first it's like Ahhhh what a nice time to be alive to 10/10 has a little bit of suffering for everyone
Had this game on my wishlist since 2019 Finally had a good chance to convince my friends to pick it up due to the free weekend as well as try it myself I have to say that this game does not disappoint if you are looking for a high-intensity tactical shooter Missions require a team of players to be stealthy and think critically as they explore the dark corners of the maps they are thrown into Limited ammo and health packs make avoiding combat if possible a must and encounters with enemies become even more intense If you like a shooter game that actually requires using brain power then this is for you
too hard and seamus doesn't like the game
Don't listen to recent negative reviews as they are likely from free weekend children who get pressed over the fact they have to use their brain This is an incredibly fun teamwork based game with good gunplay puzzles etc Basically as long as you're not a dumbass 10 year old you will likely enjoy the game I haven't done any online play but with a group of close friends this game is a banger 10/10 would play again
one of the games of all time morbius is scarier than this
Enemies hurt you too much like 2 or 3 hits to kill you you have to reload manually when your magazine is empty Needs quality of life tweaks like these to be more enjoyable/playable Too hard as is not fun
Scary good
A relatively good game that can be hard to get into
I played this game during the free weekend And I can not find this game attractive enough to purcahse even though I enjoy horror survival hardcore difficult realistic shooter game Pros 1 I love the enviorment of the game the graphics ans aesthetic is top tier 2 The character design sounds and lore is also fantastic 3 The coop element and team work tasks are some creative and cool Con 1 This game isn't as realistic as it should be 2 The guns in the game just any guns reminds me of Rainbow Six guns during it's days where the recoil is fucking ridiculous and the bullet goes too slow yet flies where ever they want to go The gun play is the BIGGEST turn off in the game The game requires you to conserve ammo in limited resources environment but the hitbox and guns are insufferable Oh did I mention that sometimes hip fire is more accurate than ADS Also regardless of the gun play the weapon zoom doesn't make sense you be have a red dot but the ADS zoom be like 4x And we are talking about this in a DARK CQB environments where you will spend hours in Literally Battlefield 2042 has better gun play than this CYBERPUNK HAS BETTER GUN PLAY These devs need to learn from Ready Or Not or other Coop realistic shooter for better gunplay 3 The level depends on how you play will gradually take longer and longer so if you going somewhere you have to leave which will not save your progress and you have to start all over after you come back 4 For a coop multiplayer team work game it doesn't have servers or match making which doesn't make sense So if you are solo and have no friends like me it's not gotta be fun 5 From what I have heard the devs also doesn't give a fuck about the game 6 Most levels are harder but similar to the one you just played gets repetitive sometimes ALL AND AFTER I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE GUN PLAY AND HOW UN FUN IT IS AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT FOR A MULTIPLAYER GAME THREES NO MATCHMAKER YET IT COST A LOT WOULD NO RECOMMEND UNLESS A HUGE DISCOUNT OR FREE WEEKEND
DON'T MOVE DON'T MOVE DON'T MOVE CLOSE THE FUCKING FLASHLIGHT NO I DIDN'T MOVE OK GO QUIETLY Repeat many time when we saw the monster
this game is very cool only thing id like to have is the option for party sizes a mode for solo runs as well as trios and duos this way you can jump in with just 1 friend and then others can join you later when they are available pugs aren't always the best
Game offers zero tutorial for new comers So basically run away like a headless chicken
this is so much fun
if you have a good group of 4 to play with then this game is worth
Es bastante entretenido tiene buena atmosfera y de mapa gore solido llega a ser intenso en muchas ocaciones y eso es genial pero.pero.AHAAAAaaaaaa que flojera que zzzzzzzz es buscar los objetos que te piden para la mision puedes escribir comandos tipo JavaScript para encontrarlos y en realidad es bastante interesante esa mecanica pero hay ocaciones en las que no puedes hacerlo y estas por tu cuenta y tardas minimo dos lunas en encontrar el item
I played this game with a bunch of potatoes worst time i ever had 6 hours couldnt even get past B1 and theres no community
Encountered a game breaking bug within 5 minutes at a checkpoint where the item you were meant to take to Zone 49 duplicated with one being on the floor and the other stuck in a players hand In order to drop the one stuck in your hands the other player had to pickup the other one meaning you had to solo the entire floor Annoying screaming dialogue repeatedly played every single time we respawned there and the audio was just some dude choking and screaming continuously Pretty funny considering this game has been on my Number 1 spot on the steam wishlist since the trailer dropped
honestly a 12yo can drop from higher heights than these characters and still not take damage 13/10 would never play again p.s half the guns barley have ammo
Good teammates are a legal requirement
no way with this price policy not worth it as other online fps wait a bit and get it free
I played this game and I wanted a refund then I realized this game was free weekend and they actually expected me to buy this shit show of a game on sale for 30 usually its 40 I think at this point I want my time back and this game is not similar to dead by daylight at all and it's not similar to counter strike other than the fact that it is boring as shit ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
idk
Could barely play over an hour as the game is extremely lackluster You often get lost looking for a random objective get stuck behind doors because the game is unpolished and extremely buggy The ammo economy is broken heals are rare and during this free weekend I had several teammates RQ because the game runs stale after just over 10 mins This should be an early beta at best and hope they do take the constructive criticism and improve as I genuinely had intentions to buy this game but ultimately very glad I did not
I spent most of my time matchmaking then I finally found a match but everyone left immediately GTFO servers are sadly just terrible
Played on free weekend with three friends Game was fun It is less about horror and more about surviving with limited supplies Sneak as much as possible Ultimately I am glad I didn't spend money on it but I didn't hate it
interesting concept good gameplay loop but theres just quite a bit of retention mechanics lacking and prevents most people from coming back to the game the cosmetics are pretty stupid considering you cant see them 99.9 of the time anyway how about badges to showcase experience instead it feels like the game took its whole lets make the player suffer shtick a little too seriously I understand the appeal of the time gated rundowns with its current features for more hardcore gamers but im sure the numbers its pulling isnt enough to consistently release new content for them what about a casual fast queue dont get me started on the worst matchmaking system ive ever seen random level mode where players can drop in to matches already underway if someone leaves or an endless mode think cybergrind from ultrakill idk just some thoughts love the aesthetic and the lore of this game tho

I went into this game knowing NOTHING but I love this game
eek
I played during the free weekend and I know my review says no but let me say this game IS A lot of fun The reason I say no is the bugs If you replay from a checkpoint after failing the game is irrevocably broken from that point on and you cannot progress If the bugs weren't as constant I'd recommend this game wholeheartedly In the instance that broke my friend group our objective duplicated and one player is bound to carrying the ghost objective while the real one remained duplicated in the level Even when dropping the objective into the final objective trigger area only spawned a third instance of the objective We ended up having two players completely locked out of the fight one carrying the ghost object and one carrying the real final objective Two players being useless in the final stand was unplayable and the entire level itself on our restart life was the same busted doors broken objective scan markers etc as our pre-restart life which this impossible holdout even harder The game is consistently wonderful and a good bout of fun with friends which makes the fact that it breaks due to bugs even more disappointing If game breaking bugs are lessened so as to not happen after every single checkpoint restart then immediately buy this game Until then you'll dedicate an hour plus to each round only to be locked out of the end due to the bugs
10/10

good time
great game 0 bugs the dropping cut scene never freezes you can always see your party members in the lobby people are never invisible to each other you can always drop collection cases 11/10 would never play again
claramente tem em dead space mas isso significa que o jogo similar com aquela franquia o principal defeito desse game que me irritou bastante foi o excesso de HUD sei que algumas delas tem como desativar as que mais me irritam tem como desativar a principal qualidade do game os desafios de fazer os objetivos no game em coop e terminar sem morrer pois o game facil e obviamente o ponto mais forte desse jogo mas isso o suficiente para me prender ao jogo achei os inimigos muito existem ataques surpresas ou desafios ligados ao desconhecimento do que o inimigo pode ou pode fazer igual tinha em dead space os inimigos fortes de longe ou tem ataque fisico de proximidade ou tanks e por ai vai chega a ter nada demais do que vc vai encontrar em qualquer jogo saturado de tiro com assets de RPG eu recomendo nem mesmo com e para a minha pessoa nem de pois eu achei GTFO demais edit ler muitas seja de que negativou por ser ruim no game ou de positivas dizendo ser algo muito frustante para jogadores experientes e tal mas o game com o tempo fica mais facil seja com amigos ou com jogadores vi analizes dizendo ser hardcoriiii o que verdade diferente de mim que acho que o game quase pega na sua igual os jogos da ubisoft pois tem HUD pra CRL e ainda tem muitos bugs
fun game
Not for casual gamers Requires at least two other friends to play and coordinate with Very hard and unforgiving game but also very satisfying when you manage to beat a level
Extremely meh game Boring gameplay Go play Left 4 Dead or Back 4 Blood instead
GET THE FUCK OUT
it was fun but if you cant get 4 people to play bots are so bad its unplayable not gonna buy after the free weekend trial
tl;dr 6/10 game could be better could be worse It's fun but brutal and you're basically forced to play it slow and stealthy.There are some bugs and I can only recommend this at a steep discount or if you're a masochist Pros Co-op Challenging Levels are pretty big It's mostly fun to play when it's working Graphics and sounds are decent enough It runs smooth as butter once the level is loaded This game actually encourages players to use stealth and share limited resources with each other The bots are fairly competent except for when they stay on the other side of a door you want to close would be nice if there was a hold position command Cons Bugs that can make levels unplayable Second worst menu design I've ever seen Could use some more variety in enemies Actually way more stealth than I'm interested in Mediocre character designs and customization Level design gets boring after a bit too many reused assets Having to walk around and follow a moving bioscan is fucking BS In the future we completely forgot how to make good flashlights also bullets now move slow for some reason Maybe I developed ADHD or something but almost 40 hours in and I haven't seen any plot development all I know is the playable characters are sent underground against their will Launching the game is a disaster it takes too long and I have to alt-tab every time bad fps between level transitions friend wasted an hour troubleshooting just to get the game to stop crashing on launch No way to save progress mid-level to return where you left off later you have to finish it in one sitting or start all over again later it takes my friend and I 2-3 hours to finish one level and some checkpoints are so far that we don't care and call it quits because it would take too much time to get back to where we were Weapons aren't very effective most of them aren't accurate enough the sniper rifle would be good but it only lets you carry 12 rounds which makes it not worth carrying IMO you can't play this game like Left 4 Dead and go around guns blazing if you do you'll find yourself empty and dead pretty quick To add to that last one it kinda sucks that there's no night vision because staring into so much darkness is straining my eyes only two guns in the game have thermal optics and I'd rather have them on something else because neither of them are good
end of the campaign was crazy the warden took us out finally and we saw the ruined earth n shit Finally we're free We managed to GTFO

I got Eye A.I.D.S from the main menu
I got to try this game out for the free weekend with my friends and unfortunately we ran into a pretty annoying bug on mission B1 with the duplication of the objective item that we needed to carry throughout the whole mission Aside from the bug that had us take 4 hours longer than we would have needed to in order to complete the mission there were a lot of other issues with UI functionality that we had that ultimately turned us away from trying to progress any further Ping system that doesn't allow you to ping any given location other than main focal points Objectives don't give any direction or clue to lead players to head in the general direction to progress leaving it very obscure and contradicts the exploration because the game is zero visibility to begin with Items have no indication that they are items to collect until you are one centimeter away until you realize that the coloration of boxes is supposed to indicate that Except that the color choices still blend in with the game This is especially frustrating because of the way main objective items are presented You have no idea what you are looking for until you've searched every cavity of a dark and hardly visible room(good luck if there's fog in there These were only a couple situations that collectively made the game kind of intolerable to attempt going any further No disrespect to the Developers but bugs especially should not be overlooked even after a game has been fully released that is a red flag to a lot of consumers I was highly considering purchasing this game until we tried it As of right now I cannot advocate buying this game as it is
It's a fun game with friends to play with but unfortunately I don't really have any friends to play with I give it a 7 as a fun game
gud
haha hell
Game of door
It's Deathwing but Stealth and not 40K Honestly it's a fun game if you have friends to play it with are patient and know what you're getting into and expect nothing else Like the first sentence says this feels very similar to Warhammer 40K Deathwing with the tactical ideas of map exploration high situational awareness and pretty highly limited resources There's a bit of pre-mission preparation with selecting weapon and tool loadout as well as customizing you character's appearance Now let's get more specific PROS Sound Design Amazing The guns sound appropriate and the enemies sound absolutely disGUSTING Audio cues from enemies is key for being stealthy General Visual Design Pretty damn good The weapons all look somewhat science fiction-y while still looking like they could exist within the near future Enemy design is very well done imagine TLoU's clickers but more nasty alien tar worm than just fungus General Idea You're a prisoner of some kind doing god knows what kind of dangerous stuff for The Warden The enemies you face are blind but can sense you through light and movement somehow and can usually be one-hit with melee When they move a bit and start glowing stop moving and get your flashlight off them If they detect you you now most likely have the rest of the enemies within the vicinity coming for you now too because nearly every enemy is both a Witch from L4D and a car alarm from L4D too I guess Simple idea that gets pretty tense in certain situations COULD LOVE OR HATE Level Design The areas you traverse are massive with a lot of exploration seeming maze-like It can be easy to get lost or not know where to go If you like exploring tense underground facilities perfect If not then uhhhhh sorry bud But this plays into the next thing General Gameplay Drop in with somewhat low starting resources find area or thing find resources along the way to keep surviving get out Usually having to find a terminal to locate an item get to the area the item is in then go on a scavenger hunt for it The objective menu will tell you what area the required thing is in or what area to go to in order to find a terminal to ping said item but it will not tell you how to get there Level navigation is purely contextual i.e signs in the area and on doors Gotta get to Area 49 Look for a door to see if it tells you it will lead to there You do have an automap that fills out as you explore but it also doesn't tell you all that much unfortunately I personally like the exploration and uncertainty of where exactly to go but I can understand I'm not every gamer and not every gamer is me Stealth As stated earlier every enemy in this acts as both a witch and a car alarm They don't like flashlights they don't like noise and they don't like when you move too close to them The bulk of the enemies you face will be static occasionally moving around in place and glowing This is when they're trying to detect what's around them If you move around near them when this is happening they'll start moving more violently and sound like someone shaking whole milk in a massive tub Immediately stop moving and they'll calm down Then get within melee range charge up an attack all the way then profit But be careful when doing this with other enemies within detection range If they're glowing they can sense you kill their friend and start going crazy There are some enemy types that try to detect you by different means but this is the bulk of them and I don't want to say too much here Again this is a thing that I like cause I enjoy being forced to be patient as I move through the area but I know it's not everyone's cup of tea The HUD Both the HUD and the terminals in game remind me of a time before Windows 95 Or a factory that hasn't updated their computer systems to anything later than Windows 95 trust me they exist It's very reminiscent of the industrial look of many 80's-90's sci-fi settings the only thing this needs is more chunky CRT monitors I love this general aesthetic but have heard so many people openly hate it so do with this info as you will Resources Again this game drops you into a mission with usually 50 ammo You'll have to search the map for more ammo medkits extra tools like gadgets to deal with certain locks so you don't have to hack them maybe a better flashlight c-foam grenades that act as entry denial tools or to slow down enemy movement etc The planning in GTFO is less of a pre-mission plan and more of an at-the-moment assessment of current team supplies Other games may have difficulty settings to adjust starting resources and enemy damage/health this does not I'm not gonna look at this and just say git good but just know what you're getting in to Atmosphere DO YOU LIKE FOG AND NOT SEEING MORE THAN 20 FEET AHEAD I'm gonna go ahead and say this your basic flashlight sucks pure buttz and it's all you have when carrying objective items or have your melee/tool/consumable equipped Most if not all guns have a much stronger flashlight and there are stronger flashlights that you can find but you'll be spending most of your time either with your melee weapon out or carrying an objective item I like the idea of it because it adds to tension but I'm still gonna be complaining about it the whole time CONS Friendly AI It's uhhhhhh Not smart It's a bit like L4D2's AI with some changes some good some bad The good is that they can use certain tools pretty sure just the enemy scanner at the moment and consumables The bad is that if you're playing with bots you're managing their resources as well as your own They thankfully have decent aim and try to stick with melee until shit hits the fan but the resource management kinda outweighs that Unlocks As far as I can tell the only things you really unlock are character cosmetics in the long run You CAN find artifacts throughout each mission and finding enough will grant you boosters to use in later missions that can give you buffs and such But aside from that there's really nothing there UNKNOWNS Matchmaking I tend to either play solo or just with people I know so I did not test matchmaking I know it is something brought up by most other reviews so sorry I can't help there Bugs/Glitches I haven't experienced any in my play time as of yet but that could change at any moment I'm assuming I could experience them if I actively tried to find them or if I played more with others but my introverted ass doesn't like dealing with strangers most of the time Final Thoughts GTFO is a very atmospheric bordering horror FPS Communication strict resource management and situational awareness are a must I hate saying this but it's rather souls-like in the idea that within a tense and difficult setting patience and knowing your surroundings and the enemy will take you to the end I would definitely recommend it but don't be expecting L4D levels or horde shooter It's more like the bastard lovechild of Vermintide and older Rainbow 6 games I can't recommend if all you want is happy fast runny-gunny-head-explodey and a massive suite of unlockables Give it a shot when it's on sale play the tutorial and the first mission and see what you think from there Just uhhhh close the door behind you stay low and flashlights off plz
it's fine
Best enjoyed with a group of friends who love a challenge but don't get bent out of shape too easily Simple mistakes have huge fallout in this game and that's the point The harder levels may take dozens of hours or more to complete The first rundown I played R5 my team failed one of the longest levels ON the extraction circle basically the finish line and had to start from scratch It was frustrating as hell but it made our eventual victory feel even more rewarding With the introduction of checkpoints the levels can now be completed a bit quicker since each wipe doesn't send you all the way back to spawn This doesn't mean the levels aren't still incredibly difficult though This game is also obviously scary at first but after you know what to expect that aspect starts to fade In terms of the gameplay itself you can expect a combination of shooting stealth and strategy You can't just open fire into every room or you'll run out of ammo You can't sneak past every enemy The game gives you a melee weapon two guns and a specialized tool and while you might be able to get through the first few levels without giving much thought to what you're bringing into it you'll find yourself stuck if you never learn how to be flexible and work with your team My personal suggestion if you're playing with friends is not to look up a guide before you go in Part of what gives this game its charm in my opinion is the way it surprises you One of my favorite moments from the first rundown I played was when my team plugged in five batteries each of which we'd had to overcome some challenge to acquire into their corresponding generators We were practically highfiving each other figuring we were done with the level Then the lights cut out an alarm began to sound and we realized we hadn't set up any defenses We hadn't imagined the game would throw ANOTHER thing at us Cue a mad scramble and our subsequent deaths as enemies surrounded us but weren't exactly upset about it That feeling of oh hell what do we do now was exactly what we'd bought the game for It's these sorts of experiences that gradually teach you to trust nothing while you're down in the complex They teach you to analyze every new situation and new enemy carefully before you act Hold on to that feeling of dread and excitement as long as you can and save the guide watching for if you really get stuck And for those wondering if you can play this solo or with a group of less than four friends yes My group for most of R5 was a trio But the game doesn't scale so you're putting yourself at a disadvantage if you drop in with fewer than four They've added bots which are good enough that you can clear the harder levels with them if you know what you're doing but the best experience is certainly with a group of real people I'd recommend checking out the GTFO discord to find a team if you don't have one Good luck down there fellow prisoner
Excelente juego muy buen ambiente y muy entretenido ideal para jugar con amigos
Gameplay is boring and repetitive Areas all look the same Combat is especially bland with enemies that dance around you impossible to predict and avoid I get you're supposed to avoid combat but in alarm sequences it's extremely punishing It doesn't feel like my fault when taking damage instead it's largely frustrating and unintuitive Hence I don't feel compelled to experiment with learning enemy patterns or engaging at all in order to learn more effectively Only positive thing I can say is that the atmosphere is mostly well executed with interesting visibility mechanics like clearing the fog
It's very challenging at times but I love the game regardless
any baby speedrun
Scary as hell
Are you joking This game should GTFO the Steam store It's always mind boggling when a dying game goes free for a weekend to try and garner more buyers when the game is so unbelievably BAD and poorly made It's boring poorly designed the HUD is thrown together with no care or attention It's like these developers had no idea what they were doing They clearly care so little about presentation and just want easy sales It's for nerds that like games like STALKER and Elder Scrolls 3 Morrowind games that are boring to normal well-adjusted people but to these autists they see mounds of gold It's a good thing these types of morons exist for developers like the GTFO team to take advantage of by making a product like this heap of diarrhea If you think you like this game evaluate your flawed opinion and ask yourself if you fall into the spectrum of autism then you will know whether your opinion matters And oh yeah I almost forgot to mention the game uses 9 GB memory yeah figure that one out It looks like a PlayStation 2 game Get real this is a bad joke Red Dead 2 shits all over this game Play something good
Really trash garbage game Poorly optimized Slow loading plenty of crashes on startup laggy I can see why it's got a free weekend small player base and they're suffering Easy fix Make the game good retards lool Boring walking simulator enemies are uninspired rip offs and gore is gratuitously mediocre no effort at all When killing enemies it doesn't feel rewarding or satisfying and the blood looks like lava shooting out The characters are boring and the hacking is the most tedious annoying part of the game The bots AI is pathetic and awful Definitely a top 5 worst game in the last year I played I remember seeing this game years ago and thinking it was a cool idea and could be a lot of fun and intense Where's the intensity More importantly where's the fun Tries too hard and falls painfully short This is something neckbeards would get boners at even after having played this poopy diaper mess of a game I can see it now bunch of diehard slobs defending this cesspool of a game knowing how awful it is not willing to accept the countless flaws that make up the game The devs deserve brain cancer for this one Overpriced finally just now got the biggest sale the game has ever seen at the time of this review for 30 This game is 10 max honestly should stay free A minimal effort game set on being a cash grab Get bent

Looks great Stability issues(several of us had several crashes Quite repetitive Overall it's a decent game but we decided there wasn't enough there to justify the price Even on offer the price seems to be too much for the experience You'll have a more fun and stable experience playing Killing Floor 2
Way too hard
Yarrak gibi oyun Mermi yok
Tried It in free weekend with couple of Friends and i have to admint that i am really unsatisfied by the product Do not think It mistakely that i hadn't liked the game It Is really cool the environment Is dark and creepy exactly as It should be The tension Is High and every wrong step Is a possible slash of guillouttine on your Beck Also the hordes are really Amazing and the Monster are dirty and unformed as you are in a Nightmare BUT I hated the system of allarms that constantly breaks and rules the rythm of the game Should se talk Also about the enemies attacks Stringer missiles Totally out of mind they follow the target and hardly miss the shot I predict different times the to survive Just looking the Life of the members and the difficulty level of the allarms The Scan after and allarme Door start you Will find yourself to pose for scanning and personally i do not understand for what Most of times the location are in damned holes or in middle of nothing when you have to stato still while hordes of whatever they are coming to taste your flesh Also some Door can Just be opened without be avaible to be closed again I cannot Imagine a futuristico engineer Say i Ve created a special Door that can be opened Only if you are scanner in specifico position or i Ve created a complex system to unlock this Door but i forgot a close Burton well i Guess It Is not necessary Anyway my vote Is negative expecially because i had different expectation for this game And i don t want anyone Will Say i hadn't warned about this and that Peace
Bugs bugs bugs bugs artificial difficulty bad resource drops to make the artificial difficulty worse it's just a bad game overall and Rundown 7 is even worse
I cannot recommend GTFO Tried it for the free weekend with a friend They downloaded first and said WTF is this UI and it took them a few minutes to figure out how to use it while I finished downloading When I finally booted up to see the UI of the game I just had the same reaction The menu UI is literally like an overworld map that I have to drag around to find different things to click on Luckily I did not have to do much searching because my friend found the invite button so I could skip dredging through the menu The loadout area was fine but the menu UI of going all over the place when I moved my mouse was annoying but I will have to say the selection of weapons and tools I thought was good However that is about the only good thing I found enjoyable The actual core game is buggy ran into performance issues and the game is artificially hard because of a few factors First factor is limited resources This would be fine if it wasn't for one other factor The guns feel horrible to use I can aim down perfectly at an enemy and get no hit marker which tells me nothing hit The only reason I know that is when I used a shotgun I got to see the critical hit marker and small hit markers All of the guns feel worthless and never seem to go where I was aiming Even point blank on the large enemy I counted my shots and saw that only half my shots hit them but the shots spread so wide The accuracy of the weapons is worse than World of Tanks KV2 shooting on the move This added with the way enemies move needing to land crits to conserve ammo or the weakest enemies soak 4 of the high damage shots being hit causes you to lose more accuracy and ranged enemies being able to shooting homing shots that curve around corners and cover makes the whole game artificially hard The last thing two factors are hit boxes being inconsistent and difficulty seeing stuff half the time The hit boxes of enemies were very inconsistent especially with the scout I would aim with the melee get within range line up till the game told me I would hit the weakpoint and then let a fully charge attack hit Half the time the enemy would die The other half the enemy would just start the scream animation and suddenly the thing has a ton of health even after repeatedly attack the weakpoint As for not being able to see anything The flashlight is different for each weapon which means the range of the weapon does impact the range of the flashlight Which means the short range weapons get horrible flashlights This mixed with the slight fog/mist made using the flashlight either blinding so you cant see or the flashlight doesn't have enough power so you cant see

Been playing this since rundown 6 and to be honest it has one of the worst communities I've seen that doesn't accept any suggestions to improve the game the devs focus too much on hardcore over solid gameplay and all of this shows on the number of players hence why they made the free weekend Good potential but pretty frustrating and dissapointing not worth it
This game makes me wish that fart I'm holding in is a massive shit Laying my toilet to waste with an absolute nuke of a turd would be more enjoyable than this
Could be fun with friends For solo play there are better options
the stealth is very choppy and boring and the game got boring after 2 hours get it on sale if you even care about the game
hit game
good game but since this game is based off teamwork heavily we need to share information but many players are being a bitch and not using their mics even though the lobby says they must use mics
There's been a long way I've been following this game unsure looking forward to trying it out someday And finally as someone who's into the genre I say Meh
I liked the concept of a kind of raiding inside of an area with friends It sounds cool on the outside but the inside is not as good I wished the combat didn't consist of big tentacles being thrown at you and instead melee combat and maybe some long-range like the heat-seeking monsters Stealth is literally a no-go if you wanted to get a stealth hit your better off charging at them with walking speed than crouching up cause they have a detection circle rather than just seeing whats in front of them Having turrets is nice until you put them down and as monsters are running up the turrets shoot you instead of the monster leaving you at 20 hp for the entire run because medkits are almost extinct along with the combat of non-dodgeable tentacles being thrown at you along with headshots almost never working you pop their head off and somehow they are still alive willing to throw more tentacles at you Good concept bad execution
muy bueno aunque algunos bugs en la sala de emparejamiento
very nice game and challenging to do by yourself better with friends
really wholesome game with cute characters and an very sweet storyline
PVE
This game is great but if you want to play with friends you better have 3 other friends willing to buy and play with you I would still recommend waiting for it to go on sale right now its 40 when not on sale
I have no idea how this game has so many positive scores Its like DOOM if you were supposed to stand in one spot when you fought enemies and then walk around opening doors for ten minutes between encounters Aside from the atrocious gameplay it's as optimized as a Rube Goldberg machine and has one of the worst UI's I've ever seen with everything in awful font with no style or color just repetitive text everywhere making anything hard to find or notice text is way too small to where I can't even read it on normal resolutions and you have to hold the mouse for every single thing No voice acting for player characters yet really excessively long and obnoxious voice lines for objectives that never get to the point Essentially its a loop of 10 minutes navigating awful UIs 10 minutes standing in front of doors and then 10 seconds of holding mouse click in the enemy's direction In the very little time I played this game I could not wait to GTFO and play something else

Played during free weekend game is fun but after putting 2 hours into B1 TWICE we got the same game breaking bug that completely locked one of our team from changing items/picking things up If a player was holding the neonate and went down when the team respawned at the checkpoint the player who had the neonate now had the collection case and it made them completely useless Atmosphere is great gameplay can be a bit slow at times and checkpoints are a bit too far from each other
Time for this game to GTFO my HDD In a word it's boring The maps aren't interesting things you can interact with are severely limited everything is slowed by hold to interact mechanics for the most menial of tasks including dropping things you carry that prevent you from attacking but are required to progress It's a neat idea but it takes so long to get into that it's just not fun
We call the big boys Ronalds
Teamwork based pretty fun and quite challenging
boring
Holy shit the atmosphere of this game is amazing and the stealth feels perfect
Juego ql excelente mejor que el bodrio del Alien Fireteam y B4blood ideal para jugarlo con amigos y su squad vieja confiable Ya que jugarlo alone es mas fome que la ctm juegazo

O jogo bom a dos e LEFT 4 DEAD com uma muito mais detalhada que se ressaltar aqui a elevada dificuldade do game fazendo com que seja jogar em fechado e principalmente estas pessoas estejam muito bem sintonizadas o que vai fazer total entre odiar ou amar o game A dificuldade como eu disse faz amar ou odiar o jogo pois requer muitas diferentes e muita sintonia com o seu time o fato de as fases terem uma certa aleatoriedade na dos inimigos e itens faz com que sempre tenha que se adaptar ao momento seja com os seus gadgets ou De toda forma um game que vale muito a pena a garantida e com toda certeza prepare-se para passar bastante raiva morrendo diversas e diversas vezes por fase e dar muitas risadas se divertindo com os amigos Deve ser escolha nas madrugadas de game com os amigos RECOMENDO
This is a much slower shooting experience this is more about stealth and resource conservation than it is running and gunning
bugs after respawn like cant pick up or no quest item or bugged quest item on character
Jest stary jest do wyjebania
It was a bad sign when we had to figure out the menu and how to invite a group together The gunplay is absolutely off the flashlight feels terrible with this low rangish stuff and with the weird movement of the enemies its just a hard turnoff We had to literally run close to the ranged mobs because we did not fucking see them The game is not hard because its actually a hard game youre just low on ammo the enemies move weird and you miss more and the ranged enemies have homing projectiles The puzzles and commands are fun for the first 2 times then its just meh good concept which becomes very repetitive

Summary Good with at least 2 other friends and expensive as a result The basis of the game is really quite good It's punishing and doesn't offer many ways for you to alleviate that difficulty Everyone plays the same maps with the same equipment and gets roughly the same experience RNG is a factor but not a huge one When you finally conquer a level after hours of learning the layout and gimmicks and tools at your disposal you i]really[/i feel like you as a player have improved The core gameplay loop was fun the level design ranges from questionable to rather good however some of the gimmicks like thick fog with no items to deal with it entirely detract from the experience Problem with the game is that the bots are shit the matchmaking is shit and if you don't have friends PLURAL you're not going to have fun I also found the learning material in the game was insufficient and wikis and forums where the only place to get a good understanding of the mechanics It's also rather expensive Understandable for the amount of work clearly put in but still pushes it out of the range of many especially since you need friends tripling the price for newcomers
Played on free weekend I only played one level by myself with three bots Not a bad game though my frames skipped occasionally but I like to play FPS games with my controller and this game requires some work with a keyboard to complete objectives so it's not to my taste If you don't mind bouncing between mouse/keyboard and controller or just play mouse and keyboard you might enjoy it
Super sympa Enfin un Left 4 Dead plus technique Franchement yes
shittiest matchmaking i ever saw in video game never works always breaks team 2h finding game 5 min of some moron thingking its cowadooty blasting everything i would say something about game but i couldnt even enjoy it
Should be called STFU

I've been eyeing this for a while now hoping it goes on sale for a good price Free weekend came up and it fell short It's decent enough if you have enough players to play with you I tried playing with bots and it makes the game go by much slower in my experience tbf but doable Plot doesn't really reveal itself quick enough to grasp my attention It feels as if you are merely playing scenarios in each round

This game needs more players This and l4d2 are legends in this genre Truly unbeatable

10/10
I really wanna like this game but I just can't I think the idea is good and the gameplay can be actually fun but most of the time it is ruined by simple things like bugs or lagging Pros Hardcore requires teamwork and communication Great horror atmosphere reminds me of dead space series Cons Bugs Me and my friend had to restart b1 cause the mission item got bugged we tried rejoining swapping bots etc Another one was where according to my teammates I became invisible and they had to rejoin to see me again No dedicated servers I got a pretty good PC and internet but my friend was still saying that the game I hosted was lagging a lot making stealth and hacking locks and doors a pain Having dedicated servers would avoid this issue Matchmaking While the game has matchmaking to me it seemed like it only works for joining games that did not start yet and if a guy leaves then you will not get a new one Unless you post a code on discord for people to join you What year is it 2003 Come on Checkpoints If there is one thing I hate in games then it is repetition The game is hard there are no difficulty options which is fine by me But the fact that you can go on for an hour clear multiple rooms and not encounter a checkpoint is beyond me Tl;dr the game is on sale for 30 euros and honestly the most I would pay atm would be 20 The game has just too many issues for the price
Im pretty sure it has no player base which is why matchmaking with ppl for a game takes ages uninstalled
the absolute state of this game just bugs on top of bugs free weekend was awfully bad game is beautiful but full of bugs would not recommend until these are fixed
Until the next free weekend boys
team play or die
this game is like weeeeeeeeeew and ur like weeeeeeeew and then then yea then the game is like AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH and then your like ah and then the enemies are like enemies and then u go shoot they go boom they exist and u exist so u shoot them so they can un-exist and u can still exist while ur team exist and u get the objective that also exist then u escort the existing objective with your existing team while fighting existing enemies while carrying the existing objective to an existing end point then u take that existing objective then u hold the E then u Do the thing And then u go and leave the end that sums up the first mission
it good
Multiplayer is Unplayable
Disclaimer this review was written during the free weekend on 6/17/22 The game may have changed since then and whenever you're reading this For your purchase price you get An atmospheric mission-based survival horror shooter A variety of weapons and utility items to help you survive your plunge into the abyss Twisted monsters that can and will destroy you in moments if you aren't prepared Limited resources and gut-clenching stealth sections that instill tenseness into every action Wide maps that allow for multiple approaches to an objective Tight corridors and low ceilings that induce claustrophobia Punishing difficulty that rewards quiet methodical teamwork Appropriately chunky SFX And a way for you and three other people to feel like a tight-knit squad as you take down a mission like professionals Resources are incredibly limited and forces the game into an intense famine state that's unlike most survival horror games There are four of you and only so many pickups so you will learn very quickly to conserve your equipment in order to get through a mission Sections where you have to type actual console commands are very hit-and-miss depending on if the person at the console b]knows how to spell.[/b The game requires precise spelling you're typing computer code after all and disables your HUD during these moments so if you never passed English or coding class you might find some frustration here Certain situations may require backtracking and/or scavenging to proceed such as when I had to bypass a room filled with monsters I eventually found a door on the other end of a catwalk suspended over the horde but it had a lock on it and I had to sneak around for about ten minutes to find a lock melter in another area of the map as you cannot hold more than one gear item at a time This may or may not appeal to you as part of the survival aspect of the game Due to the mechanics and perhaps your teammates a single match can easily take up to an hour or more Playing on your own is not recommended as the bot AI is decidedly not intelligent glitches out and bots will not hesitate to use every single pickup in every single room as you go through it You also have to command the bots to use their own gear and they will not help you attack sleeping enemies unless you wake them up Furthermore their ability to handle enemies is atrocious as experienced by when I had to lug an escort target across an entire map by myself during an endless horde Players can also be less than intelligent depending on who you queue with so as with many multiplayer games your experience may vary One wrong move can and will lose you the game Once a season of this game is over the levels within it are permanently scrapped in favor of new ones This isn't a good idea from a marketing standpoint as the game's replayability plummets if you're getting rid of levels so often I'd have preferred keeping the old ones and releasing new seasons of levels for free to expand upon what lore there is in this game Voice chat is absolutely necessary for the best experience which is not good for those without microphones The text chat alternative is unintrusive but to the degree where if you aren't actively monitoring the bottom left side of your screen you won't see anyone typing In-game automated voice commands while a good idea are difficult to execute I had a fair amount of fun here but I can see that the gameplay is heavily in favor of full parties and as I don't really enjoy playing with other people this hurt my experience The bots allow you to play by yourself but there's the tradeoff of them making the gameplay more of a chore than anything else so I didn't really have the chance to truly enjoy the missions However I can see the draw to this game and if I had a full competent team of people with me I'd be able to say that this is a very fun title so it definitely gets a pass from me although I really think that the dev should reconsider permanently removing one season's content after the next shows up That's something Bungie pulled with Destiny 2 and that move ripped their entire playerbase off of about sixty dollars worth of DLC content when they did it That kind of business model isn't the best in my humble opinion
Un juego desafiante y entretenido el ambiente es tenso y los graficos som muy buenos Definitivamente un juego que jugar
A Magnificent brilliant brutal and fun FPS horror masterpiece Love doing Solo runs Not recommended for Solo though unless you know what you're doing.Use Bots Friends or Public lobbies to play for a less harder experience
bons jogo em equipe
This game does look like it could be fun but it is not optimised at all and I can barely play due to it My RAM meets recommended and my GPU and CPU are just barely under recommended therefor I should be able to run most if not all graphic settings at medium Turns out I can't even run them at Low I'm luckily if the game doesn't crash at the beginning cut scene I've never seen a game crash on a cut scene as thats when your FPS is usually the highest If I don't crash i'll most likely crash soon later you'd expect this may happen when opening a new area or fighting enemies but no This game is almost completely unplayable with close to the recommend settings with Low graphic settings so im not sure why the Minimum and Recommended specs are so low if the game can't run them

how about you GTFO my hard drive
Played during a free weekend The graphic looks better than average but doesn't feel right lots of details animation effects but it's also very static and repetitive Well it's way nicer than your average Unity game but you can feel the developers are struggling with it Gameplay concept is great but execution is filled with basic gamebreaking bugs which cause you to loose all your hard earned consummables Difficulty progression is way too steep by adding too many new chalenges between maps This is just good to increase frustration with no added value Game wants to encourage teamplay and replay the same level from 8 hours until you can beat it Yet there's no statistics to show your progression and highlights shoot precision friendlyfire given/taken enemy damage given/taken distance walked map progression etc Overall it feels like an alpha for an early access of a 20 game definitely not a 6 month old released game at 40
I find the guns and shooting them to be lackluster The enemies are annoying more than they are threatening and the hitboxes are strange Only play if you have four people Even 1 AI was screwing over our runs
good but guns suck and checkpoints are too far apart
bueno,la dificultad es una joya para jugar con amigos sino es casi imposible
big terminjal bad but pretty cool tho
4 hits to die if youre lucky but usually 1-2 hits since youll be running on 20hp guns but no ammo ever if you try to aim for head to conserve ammo the enemies jump around and spit from behind corners if they hit you your aim goes all over the place it could be a nice game if it was easier on new players me and my group booted up the game got into some lab trying to revive baby and got wiped every 15mins got boring really fast would strongly benefit from same difficulty settings as deep rock galaxy offers for newbies to run at easy and learn the game and as players get more advanced up the diff as they please
it is a great game tbh but this game has simple bugs that legit make the game unplayable lmaooooooo its only my first day playing this game and a few hours in we I have already seen 4 bugs that have made the game unplayable for me or a team mate in 4 dif matches like what the fuckkkk I can see why they have free weekends lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooo dip:repoop:shit fun game I guess as long as you do not get a bug that makes one of your team mates useless since he cant use his guns or anything at all expect carry a box or the baby or what ever it is that u have to carry lmao lol
0/10
Jeu cool mais faut faire attention ceux qui quittent en pleine game et les mate cons
amazing horror game
Habe das Spiel mit Freunden am Free Weekend gezockt und bin froh dass es diese immer Mal wieder bei verschiedenen Spielen gibt Hier hat es leider gezeigt dass GTFO sein Geld mich und meine Freunde nicht Wert ist Leider sieht in den Leveln einfach jede Ecke gleich aus was nicht nur die Orientierung die Karte ist leider keine wirklich Hilfe sondern auch schnell langweilt sind die Komplexe so verschachteln dass man sich fragt wie hier mal normale Menschen gearbeitet haben sollen und diese unsinnigen Security-Checks gemacht haben Gegner-Vielfalt ist quasi nicht vorhanden wie sich dann in Gameplay-Videos von Sektoren hat Die Monster die es gibt sind dann auch leider wenig beeindruckend und wirken eh immer nur wie Fleischhaufen Das Spiel deutet eine interessante Lore an aber es bleibt so viel im Dunkeln dass man nicht so wirklich drin eintauchen kann Richtiges Grusel-Feeling kommt auch nicht auf wenig Licht und nen bisl den Nebelwerfer an werfen reichen leider nicht aus
Good but you really need 4 players Can't rely on bots
ctrl 2-3 2-3 6
Played it while free for a weekend I'm grateful for this opportunity so I know not to buy it Never have I got motion sick or a migraine while playing this one was the first for me I am not a common shooter gamer I had to repeat the tutorial multiple times multiple reasons In the tutorial you have to do a lot of things which are not necessary mostly useless and the important information are maybe somewhere hidden in the bad designed HUD Using commands in an computer seems to be more awkward and user unfriendly in this distopian future as it would be right now in our time in real life Atmosphere is good not terrifying but ok leveldesign ok visual nice to see Flashlight can not shine more than 4 meters and in some points works the first few meters not but the remaining distance up to a wall
nudne
i like it but cant convince friends to get sadly
Started with a bug after 10 minutes that forced us to restart
Fajna gra skradasz i dzidujesz od mame Mateusza
not easy
took me and 3 others 7 hours to complete level B1
Played the free weekend Hesitant to buy it if doing random matchmaking 2 matches went sideways due to no comms and people trying to shoot everything in sight It is really fun and atmospheric though I'm sure it's great with 3 other friends
Saglam co-op oyun 4 olarak ve Ilerlerken sleepers savasarak dolanarak de yerde duran bu renkte veya oluyorlar Cogunlukla parlayarak eger o anda ve sure uykuya dovus tane olay oluyorsunuz Eger olurlarsa ve duruma buyuk var onlar ustunuze yolluyorlar cabuk olmaz alarm alanlardan yandan da sleepers surusuyle basa zaman zaman kullanarak turuncu kutulardan cephane hack alet vb yol ustunde veya dovus vurunca mu de ya hack 3 sey veya kutulardan unuttum hackleme de Oyunu PC'm GeForce'den 30'ar ama yere kadar deger ona ama ya bedava ya da uygun/ucuz duserse ben 3 gunluk bedava haftasonundan de oyunlar
Its just not very good super immersive i want to like it However getting a group to play is next to impossible people drop out at the slightest you didn't follow all my commands Removal of older levels makes it not worth the price its at A developer can't keep making new levels forever and still turn a profit One day there will be only one rundown to do unless it gets turned into an F2P or MMO where money is made off microtransactions
GTFO is not all that gunplay feels weird ammo is nonexistent enemies feel bullet sponge'y maybe i played it wrong idk didn't dig it
It was fun for the first level Gameplay quickly becomes repetitive Other issues we had were some wonky bot AIs respawn bugs and lack of settings tweaking To elaborate on each bots constantly strafed in front of me getting us both killed We respawned and the objective item failed to appear on the map as well as my partner was unable to interact with objects anymore At that point the mission was unplayable In addition respawn ammo amount is inconsistent from spawn to spawn which is TERRIBLE design choice Finally my monitor is set to do digital art and my screen and game appeared much darker than my partner's to the point that I could see nothing whatsoever This is the only game I've ever had that issue but there are no in-game settings that can let me change the game gamma so I would have to change my whole monitor's settings I understand that darkness is a big part of the game but it was borderline unplayable to me at points I couldn't tell if I was by a wall or not Plus it's non competetive PVE there's no reason to keep me from changing those settings Overall great fun concept for a game There are just some design choices that have such a large impact on the gameplay that we are choosing not to purchase after the free weekend is over
Overpriced In-game map and level design are designed to confused and disorient you Have to be played with other players as there are mission with time limit 15 seconds window in far distances Matchmaking is not good Bots can only be a bodyguard and mule
its bad game
if ur into 5 fps gaming then this game is for u 2001 game runs better than this also wtf another mid zombie shooter
The game is fun but has very little replayability i think random generation of objectives and how they are performed would provide more variety it also has a very steep difficulty curve you can easily finish A1 alone or with a friend but once you go B1 it becomes very reliant on ammo conservation choosing your fights and cooperation between 4 people 2 isn't really enough anymore Playing with randoms doesn't really work although there's voip we can't play this game by ourselves me and a friend got 2 people through matchmaking one of them was communicative coordinated progression with us but then the 4th element decided to play rogue and tried cleaning all rooms we entered failed miserably and made us waste our ammo The game is very fun for the first playthrough of each level IF you have 3 other friends to play with It's tense and keeps you on edge so on that regard the game succeeded the loop they created is good and i had fun it just lacks variety throught random generation of levels or something
Joguei no Free Weekend pra me frustrar tendo bugs todo final de fase conseguindo terminar e sem ter como voltar pro checkpoint obrigando a refazer tudo 4 vezes
Was exited to try it out while it's free cause i had my eye on it for a while but frequent glitches and seemingly missed potential in the consoles all over the place as well as random hold the line sequences after trying to sneek past every little thing spending ages standing still so sleepers don't wake up get boring fast For a free trial it waas an alright experience as long as it lasted but I doubt I'm gonna buy it in it's current state
Very addictive game Especially the 4 co-op feature is so fun to play even with players you don`t know With friends it is even more pleasant and fun
Dont expect an easy game but with the right people its a fun challange Only thing missing is an overall progress something that's making it worth playing in a longer term
Too many bugs lag blocked screens players don't join so that you have to wait a lot and be patient One of the most bugged game I have ever played in 20 years
I downloaded this game on the free weekend to see if it was worth buying and thank god I didn't buy it First experience playing this game was terrible The levels go by so slow there so many useless security scans slide feature is completely useless useless items and shit everything is just slow You spend 15 minutes finding out what to do countless security scans only to fight 4 or 5 people This game is just pushing me away in every single aspect
Its a good game if you have friend or ppl to play with not for solo the BOTS sucks
It's been 6 months since release matchmaking is broken and there's no in-game server browser nor is one planned from what I can tell The core gameplay loop is fun but if your game is heavily focused on online multiplayer please make sure people can actually play together Relying on a hacked together solution hosted on a third-party service Discord for what should be a core component of your game is incredibly alienating to players do not buy this game because there are missions that take around 3 hours and if you think you can take them solo omg you dont stand a chance and because matchmaking dont work and obviously wont this game is a good joke of a hardcore broken game not hardcore survival
The game is hard but if you have friends to play with it can be harder
i like the gtfo agme when you gtfo

Si te gustan los shooter como L4D2 o B4B este juego no es para ti siempre te falta municion y nunca la encuentras facilmente los botiquines no curan nada los enemigos estan desbalanceados te parten el culo sin tener balas y puedes gastarte todas las balas en los comunes porque esquivan todo y aguantan muchas balas la dificultad del principio es demasiada no imagino como sera en dificultad maxima la interfaz es complicada y deja mucho que desear el tener que mantener el boton para todo lo que quieres elegir en el menu principal Es unico en su estilo de jugabilidad ya que no se centra en matar oleadas de monstruos si no mas bien en la comunicacion y un equipo que pueda pasar las etapas intentando no desperdiciar ni una sola bala puede llegar a ser entretenido pero requiere mucho tiempo tomarle el gusto con la dificultad de esa manera llega a ser aburrido por el hecho de que lo que debes hacer se vuelve demasiado repetitivo se acerca mas a ser un simulador que un juego como cualquier otro por otro lado te ponen en los zapatos de un personaje del cual no tienes ningun contexto aun cuando tienes los dialogos subtitulados en no te enteras nunca de que esta pasando
Do Not BUY if you don't have people willing put in the time to play with you Missions can be long esp for new players expect to spend 2-3 hours per mission on harder missions Not worth 30 I would only pay 10-$15 for this
1.5 upd Great game 1.5 hours went through the mission with three of us and a bot so that at the end the bot could not get to the scanning point periodically crashes when loading crooked hitboxes monotonous gameplay I advise buying more than 10 sorry for the time spent three times overcooked feces
500
I'm not sure how I feel about monsters having buttholes and bending over but I'm liking it
5 10
Disappointing e specially knowing I was waiting for this ever since I saw the trailers and gameplay for it Cons Baby gets stuck in some surfaces and you are forced to suicide Frame drops on any pc No consistency in headshot damage If someone sneezes on you it stops your action Fill function in the console does not work Checkpoints are so far back that it kills the joy in playing Overpriced me and my friends could only see themselves buying this game for 10 euros Nothing groundbreaking No options for team speaking Too much walking around Average gunplay not really super satisfying but not bad either Monsters look interesting only reminds of other games The greyish scheme makes a lot of things blend together Long games that cant always be finished in one setting Does not represent itself as when I saw it first when trailers and gameplay came out Bad sound design can't tell where what is coming from fade outs non-existent Very little things you can do with the tools little to no versatility Bioscanner is basically useless Characters look almost the same Pros Nice ambience apart from the fade being non-existent between few tracks Up to date graphics Typing manually in the console to check rooms was neat Cumblaster is cool Has an immersive loading screen minus the frame drops
great game if on the hard side
Basicaly Left 4 Dead with more witches and switches
Fun
its fun af with friends
Nope
Kind of a walking simulator Not my kind of game
Great game that really establishes the atmosphere it its going for Even opening the game sets the mood 100 recommend to anyone who loves playing with their friends
Played the Free Weekend all am gonna say is thanx for savin me money
man this game
yes yes way to hard i do wish the game would scale difficulity to players as me and my 1 friend tried for 4 hours to get past the alarms at the secound map
I can't recommend this game in good conscience You already know this game is difficult from other reviews What you might not know is that the difficulty comes from environmental/hidden factors such as asinine fog mechanics slow interactions on every single item indecipherable matchmaking system unusable guns insane recoil on full auto and a very punishing gameplay loop
gets old fast game
me cague todo
difficult yet fun
It seemed like most of what I was doing was rushing from terminal door to other terminals doors and every so often would come across enemies The melee weapon is useless and you run out of ammo pretty quick You're bombarded with so much information on the screen that you don't know what's going on It has potential but still requires a lot of polishing I got to play it for free but they're currently asking 40 not worth it The most I'd pay would be 15 overall 5/10
Checkpoints were added but they're still lacking and you'll find yourself spending a lot of time doing the same things over and over again
Tried to play with some friends the scariest part of that game is the loading sequence where the game kept crashing of their side The game itself looks nice tho but we hardy played it
Lags as hell on some maps no worth
Great game free weekend would have been cool if everyone didn't pull the trigger immediately Have friends or it's gonna be rough
Like L4D but actually fun
fajna strzelanka z horroru dreszczyk emocje,wybuchy itd polecam cieplutko z
tried during free weekend more fun with friends and a lot of free time since content gets rotated in and out of the game common comparison from a peek at discussions destiny2 understandable but not recommended for people who want a complete experience in their own time apparently there's lore but i'm new so i missed it so gameplay and current rundown mechanics is all there is to care about context be damned within playthrough it is fun and stealth is not tense as i thought it would be using a microphone is recommended so no one rushes to get into the next room without knowing if all other rooms have been checked i can't say much on the communication part during gear selection since i was with mostly new players for a few matches maybe take time on deciding after dying if there's no mic please use the chat box as much as possible and take your time i do hope old rundowns would be brought back if the devs are able to at least re-runs during downtime though the list will grow longer so i don't know about that maybe i'll get the game by then
I can't see anything regardless of how many flashlights are pointed in any given direction Trash
Can't see shit
Kolejny klon L4D kolejny raz nie ma po co za
El juego atmosfericamente es hermoso,es un lf4d hardcore,o trabajas en equipo o no pasaras la primer mision nunca.Lo probe con 2 pendejos mas y no pasamos el principio JUEGAZO
Free weekend Top game Good stress/release phase cycles Better have regular coop mates Automatical save/check point in case your whole team get wiped They move fast they hit hard
do you think they'll notice
This is what I have to say of the few hours ive played so far There are both good and bad things about it I really like the atmosphere and over all artstyle The guns sound and feels good The vibe is good in general and I would say the positive things outnumber the bad for the most part I do think the price for the game is a bit to high though its not to different from other coop shooters Here are some things I feel like you should know before purchasing You HAVE to play this game with a full squad four people or evertything will become extremely hard If you dont have any friends to play with there is a option to play with bots but they kinda suck as to be expected a better option would be to find people on their discord The game is much more punishing than you would think For example if you fail just a little stealth section and end up waisting your very precious ammo it could fuck up your whole run since ammo and resources are so scarce This along with other things make the game a bit rage infusing at times but if you can put up with that I would recomend it
I love this game
IF YOU HAVE 3 OTHER FRIENDS THIS IS SH*T IS GOATED IF YOU DONT THEN SKILL ISSUE LMAO
Steam gem play it dont buy a key devs are really good
I played on the free weekend but there were so many bugs that completely broke the game I think there are no dedicated servers so when one of my friends was the host and his computer crashed the entire lobby froze and we had to restart Another time we all died and were sent back to a checkpoint but it was completely broken and we were stuck in a black void and couldn't even access the game menus
pretty nice 👍
Game design is good but the execution is terrible Matchmaking is broken and they push discord so hard on you when you shouldnt need a 3rd party program to play with people in a 4 player co op game When you do finally find a match through the broken matchmaking system people usually leave in the pregame lobby leaving you to have to find another match When you DO finally get into a game seasoned and casual players alike seem to have no idea what they are suppose to be doing or at least ignore objectives and seek out useless kills and items instead The game design is good levels look goods enemy design is decent but the core gameplay and matchmaking kill the game You will wait 15 plus minutes to finally get into a match and then all your teammates basically sabotage it
Not fun game run and type simulator.Worst menu of any game
Worst lobby i've ever seen in any game

GTFO
Enter strange biomes in GTFO
I tried this game over the free weekend trial I'm not exactly sure where the positive reviews came in Firstly this game reminds of those school presentations you used to do as a kid Insane visuals cool cut scenes awesome sound effects but the actual content is very much lacking You pretty much stand in a circle to open a door type in a code to open a door while fighting off some AI's It got boring very fast and we didn't go much past the second level Maybe it gets more complex towards the end of the game I'm glad I got to try this game out before I spent my money on it
Pick up your deployables I cant do it Pick up your deployables I cant do it Pick up your deployables I cant do it Pick up your deployables Yes If you play this game make sure to have 4 human players Not only did the devs place some lootable boxes the wrong way making them inaccessible to the player the AI of the bots is so bad that we got hard stuck at just opening a door Not just any door it was the last door before finishing a mission we already invested 45 min in There are doors in the game that require all 4 players standing in a a glowing circle infront of it and the AI just couldnt do it We tried 4 times it was such a frustrating experience seeing on the door that we made it through the level yet unable to progress because of game breaking bugs If you are a group of friends playing together i'd say its a fun and atmospheric game You can bring your scared-of-horror-games buddy shooter-inexperienced buddy with you and he will have a good experience too as he can hold a tool that scans for life signs instead of a weapon that requires little mechanical skill but has a great impact on your gameplay If you were an away team he'd be the researcher with the datapad telling you what he thinks is behind that door The game has enough audio logs and story inside virtual computers that you all can immerse yourself in this horror game world I cant really recommend it from my experience but people that dont spoiler themselves so they can still experience the unknown of it all and that have a group that wants to give this a try it might be worth it when 50 off and got a few patches
scawwy
Played this game during the free weekend but gave it up when they introduced the fully fogged areas It was extremely frustrating to navigate the foggy areas when you run out of defoggers and cannot see anything Even when given glow sticks it only lit up the area while the fog stayed fully opaque causing it to turn into neon green fog which I found even more annoying Aside from that the game was fun and challenging If there was a option to lower the fog's opacity i would buy the game but as it is right now it is too big of a demerit
Great game but not for the price

TL;DR Cannot raccomend It's the bad kind of a hard game You need to have friends It's not a long rich game.it's a jail sentence in a cell with spikes on your bed 11 hours and stuck at third mission I love the lore and the ambience of this game It's super cool to be the hacker and ping stuff and discover lore logs in terminals but This game needs a normal difficulty setting 2 hours into the mission 1 guy fucks up and you are all screwed You reach a checkpoint but you already have 20 hp and half ammo if you're lucky I wish there is a difficulty setting where the enemies are the same in terms of numbers and hp and damage but you start up at 100 ammo and the supplies you find are all 100 I mean i have 2300 hours on tarkov i get hard games i love a challenge.but 11 hours and i tried the first mission 3 times the second mission 2 times and the last one we got a game breaking bug at the third try and we all uninstalled There are 10 missions in the protocol 7.0 The bug One of my friends had a Battery Cell on his hands while reaching the checkpoint Later when we died we load back the checkpoint and he couldn't get the battery off his hands We tried to relog Alt-F4 letting him grab stuff change weapons nothing he even died and ressed with the battery in the hand I've had enough If you plan to make your game super hard to let people join with friends don't make a 40 game You are not Blizzard's Overwatch same team oriented 40 game Aim a 20 tag or make it more accessible Also there's no way to get rid of the double text style in the menu You can inside the game but not in the menu 3/10 for accessibility 7.5/10 for lore 6/10 gameplay-stealth 9/10 visual effects light darkness and fog
good game for good children
GTFO can GTFO my hard drive imo Anyone who actually enjoyed this game needs their hard drives checked Nuff sed
Dificil e estrategico bom para jogar com os amigos recomendo Nota final D/10
Jogo muito ideal para jogar com os amigos
very awesome game
Ridiculously hard and incredibly buggy for a complete game 90 of the game cant be cleared without verbal communication and half the time you either get people who don't know what they are doing and triggering hordes or people who don't communicate The bots in this game are brain However the concept of the game play is fun but severely lacks a lore
3-5 L
Honestly it's not what i expected I don't like the whole red light green light mechanic It has potential but I don't think they're gonna do anything about it Not to mention a lot of odd bugs where you can't drop a mission item you're carrying or even deploy your sentry Until these bugs are fixed and they maybe improve on their game I ain't buying it
fun
It has good ideas but everything is badly executed Combat is weird and feels too off Melee combat is even worse Fog is ugly and annoying but if you set graphism to low you don't see it which is an amazing counter Level design is bs The best feature is hacking locks TL;DR go buy ready or not it's a similar gameplay but everything's better
would be absolute fucking pog if this shit available in VR
I love L4D Killing Floor Earthfall TF2 Quake I didn't much care for this played over a Free Weekend Seems like Going to a computer terminal to type in commands no thanks Bots are idiots and if they can't carry the big items then it makes the game redundant Very slow clunky movement Stealth seems to be a must if you don't want that then tough as you'll run out of ammo most likely The Enemies seem to be aimbots with magic fireballs that hit you regardless of your dodging mechanics Not for me for someone else probably just not my style
El juego no es malo esta bien pero me falto un poco mas de chicha Seguramente sea que este juego lo que mola es jugar con tus amigos o con gente interesante y buena para redondear lo siguiente seria las voces en
O jogo simples no entanto de uma dificuldade bastante elevada vejam-o como um Left 4 Dead ou Back 4 Blood que pode acabar com hordas gigantescas sem problema Aqui quanto mais stealth conseguir ser melhor Se tem com quem jogar isso eu sugiro pelo menos 3 jogadores em frente se topa o desafio Caso tenha com quem jogar ou poucas pessoas pra embarcar nessa que vai se frustrar
Good game Would've been better if it sold friends as DLC
GTFO
Hard but the atmosphere is top-notch
GTFO o melhor FPS coop que pode jogar Aqui realmente precisa trabalhar em equipe se era Recomendo demais
the match making is trash not recommended for the solo queue player I went on the discord and the community is toxic and gate keeping I dont know how this shit game has high scores
GTFO=Get The Fuck Out of my library This game is like the Nazis lying to Jews and telling them Arbeit macht frei that work makes them free You are a gulag prisoner that has to fight unlimited waves of alien gypsles with the lowest amount of ammo and gear possible Me and my friend spent 1 hour just to try and find a single door in this piece of sh!t Even if you do stealth and properly aim you will always find yourself running out because all the loot consists of shitty useless glowsticks Play the free weekend so you don't have to ask for a refund
Seriously good scify-horror experience played it during the free weekend and had it on my whishlist for quite some time now If you got a mic use it Realy god game in my opinion Very Atmospheric Es werden keine halben Sachen gemacht Edit I have purchased it now No regrets Tipp search for Teammates via the games Discord
Yea
Fun game with friends a few kinks primarily ammo deficiency makes the game ridiculously hard frame drops and matchmaking with people surely 500 ms ping away other than this quite fun will purchase full game once on special
Sehr gut
i died
Overall this game is good But the checkpoint in this game is too far
Play game Game daijoubu Open alarm door Game no longer daijoubu
Don't buy this game if you don't have friends
Secure and open door Simulator
We died a lot 10/10 would die again
Sci-fi left 4 dead very awesome cool

fetch quest
Interesting premise gunplay is OK at max I am all for resource management but Level design with its verticality not represented in map and also labeling on the map is utterly frustrating We completely cleared the whole area a still were looking for the objective Its like going to australia from europe to scratch your own itchy crotch wtih 5 meter long rope After that they throw you into darkness with abundance of glow sticks and usless flashlights on almost all guns and why not add also ing fog just to add another item to repel the fog Simply bloating game with unnecessary mechanics to add unnecessary items to starve you from items you would really need I would survive darkness if I would get proper horror which is not there There is healt bar but you do not have any averness that you are low and suddenly you downed Game is style over substance Style is fine.very fine but everything else needs huge tweeking I do not mind challenge but I despise frustration Unistall until proper rework not worth
good
its a very good game but it has a long story
It was free for a bit I loved every second of it even if I was playing on 20fps PS The people I played with were very friendly I just wish I had the game and a better computer to play it at 60fps I also seem to have found a bug with the resolution when trying to stretch it It would keep stretching and then go back to black bars every time I go a different setting or try to escape the from settings please fix
Fix the poorly implemented Matchmaking and this games a stunner Until then I cannot recommend a multiplayer game with such poor readability as to how its matchmaking works
very very very boring omg not even scary annoying i see the positive reviews and im like what tutorial is a slog first mission just goes on and on the monster things look like public access assets the reloading is ass sloooooooowwwwww kills any sort of pace in game and all the monsters are bullet sponges anyway long unnecessary hold button door opening mechanic that serves no purpose in the game and every now and again you need to query a real f-ing ternamal to figure out where to go next in game where you have to type bs like Ping white_key_89679 it changes per item and thing you are trying to query,ping,activate,etc and dont get me started on the melodramatic acting in game played during free weekend edit was confused by people ranking this so high so i looked into this game its whole thing is inaccessibility listen this game isnt difficult the stealth is basic and im a compsci so im used to terminals the problem is tedium i learned that on a good run the first mission can take like 3 hours 3 hours of slowly moving threw dark corridors and holding down use to open security doors that look like they have a simple pully mechanism that would be pulled in seconds irl then you got to wait in a security scan circle for a bit then wait even longer for the door to finally open and this can happen 20 times before you see you first wonky looking mutant they all look exactly the same btw i guess they are trying to simulate what space military would be like but your not supposed to replicate the boring parts
oui il vaut son prix bon investisment
Not recommended because its too frustrating Too little ammunition stock too strong enemies etc It's too hard to complete even on the second level bruh
As much as I tried to enjoy this game its barely added or improve anything since its early access release The gunplay is still awful the enemies can still hit you through walls due to buggy hit detection stealth isnt useful or necessary in 90 of rooms and the whole game just ends up being more a chore than anything fun I think my biggest issue is probably the weapons if they werent duct-taped-together sci-fy nonsense it might be playable Most obvious of the weapon issues as a result of developers not knowing what a weapon is are the sights The sights on many of the weapons are over complicated and designed to look interesting but the result is that adding 6 bright illuminated bands to an optic meant to be used in total darkness makes it nearly unusable Other than the sights many of the weapons are just bad They have extremely low DPS low accuracy and low max ammo If this game had the option to be purely stealth then I would accept that the FPS portion could be as awful as necessary but almost all missions have at least one section where an alarm is forced to go off and you must defend yourself from waves of enemies

Actually this game have great gameplay and coop But for performance have problem a bit mostly RAM its said minimum 8GB but its use ram too much even have free ram up to 6.4GB and sometime the game crashed and too lag at Menu because ram You need more optimized like Dead by Daylight Code Vein and other

let just die
EDIT After writing this review and looking at the discussion forums it seems the devs have pulled a desitiny 2 here and removed the previous content of the game Oddly this doesn't seem to be a push for people to buy new DLCs as it was with destiny 2 so I'm a bit confused why they would do such a thing since that even further devalues this game from it's 40 price tag Original review The trailers looked pretty great but I've been holding off since the price tag is a bit steep for this type of game Having played it over the free weekend I'm glad I held back my wallet The matchmaking takes forever It looks like this is one of those games where you'll be matched with someone and they'll see you're a new player and immediately drop out I get it playing with randos in a game that requires a lot of coordination sucks But it also sucks to wait 15 minutes or more only to match up with 3 out of 4 people because you're tired of waiting The gameplay itself is just okay The enemies seem to require precise head shots so the pistols are useless unless you're an extreme twitch fps gamer The other weapons are better but your ammo is stupidly limited I get that's part of the horror aspect but geez one/two clips for a smg That won't last you one fire fight Also just having one consumable isn't very fun or interesting The level design is decent but the areas at least in the beginning of the game are pretty samey looking and not really all that visually impressive As with most multiplayer games this is probably a lot more fun to play with your friends instead of strangers from the internet So if you don't have a lot of gamer friends willing to shuck out 40 bucks a piece I know I don't this game definitely won't be for you Oh I think the UI/UX of the game is pretty great A to the guy that designed that

bad game no wonder it is free for the weekend

It's alright but not for 30 A decent time I suppose but you need people to play it with It's stealth focused but the stealth melee is unsatisfying You slowly charge your melee weapon pulling punches effectively for far too long and awkwardly swing it at the enemy heads It usually just means that every few rooms you need to smack some enemies in sync with other team-members This takes up a solid 60 of the gameplay i kid you not Another 20 is taken up by carefully looking at what each room might have using sound computers careful flashlight sweeps or glowsticks plus a fog repeller occasionally This is a lot less interesting then it sounds and it ends up being the same song and dance for every mission The last 10 is actual combat using the remaining 3/4 of the tools you selected at the start of the mission and it doesn't feel the greatest Any automatic weapons also have terrible recoil so it comes into question why you would use them when you have the quite strong pistols shotguns and snipers To add salt to the wound the game shows some jank Attempting to resupply/heal a teammate doesn't lock you to them like in other games so they can just walk away or you can accidentally use the resupply on yourself its the same button and it's quite quick Fall damage is triggered from falls too short many missions involve slowly carrying a baby around it just makes it slower with 100 more backtracking this should have been made to only apply a slow at the escape when it matters not the entire mission padding the time And the rundown system these tile-set re-use based levels are not procedurally generated they are the same every time This means if you do go and retry a level there is very little variation and unlike L4D where each level is unique the levels very often have the same re-used rooms so they don't feel very different As a bonus all of the levels from each rundown season are removed the next alongside cosmetics So you only ever have one run-down worth of content in the game and any previous level-sets and lore is gone Little content combined with fear of missing out on either is a bad feeling either way.(EDIT a bonus I just remembered weapons swap out as well When this game officially ends at some point you will have almost no more then you did on release meaning it's value will never increase As an unverified bonus I didn't bother with the community but I've heard it is elitist/toxic and the player-base is normally sub 1000 players it's a free weekend right now hence the temporarily higher player-base and my review The list goes on but I'm stopping this review here Unless this is below 15 I cannot recommend this at all It's unpolished and not varied enough It's not that it isn't fun at all but the flaws are glaring and it's the playing with friends part carrying it
Se nao for no stealth tu ta fudido meu irmao kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
game goblok banyak bug
I've had this game on my wishlist for a long time so I finally got to try it out with a friend during the free weekend I really liked the game aesthetic and was really looking forward to playing another survival 4-man co-op game where you have to fight through hordes of enemies and balance your resources to survive I like challeging games where in the highest difficulty you might waste a couple hours in a mission only to see it fail at the last minute because the game threw a million enemies at you and you weren't ready to deal with them That being said this game was very disappointing It had all the elements I was looking for in a game like this but after playing through the first mission for a couple of hours I wasn't having a lot of fun I was just feeling very frustrated While walking around the environments looking for resources using terminals finding keycards and sneaking by enemies was entertaining whenever I had to engage in combat it was when the game stopped being challeging and just became frustrating The combat feels clunky and dissatisfying especially when you're facing hordes Unless you're hitting enemies in their precise weak point bullets seem to do barely any damage You can dodge some enemy attacks but get surrounded by three or more and you will be hit since their attacks seem to follow the player's path Getting hit takes so much out of your health that you will be down before you even realize how much health you've lost and if you need to use a health kit or an ammo bag or pick up some downed player then get ready to be standing there vulnerable for a couple of seconds before the action gets done Everything in the game seems to take a couple of seconds to accomplish even navigating the menus which feels very weird in what is supposed to be a fast-paced game You're going to die a lot which is fine especially in the beginning but then the game gives you a checkpoint so far back that it even erases some objectives you have already achieved You're not playing the last section you failed you're replaying the last two or three Honestly I'm all for hardcore games but there is usually a payoff when a game is supposed to be hard and with this game I got no payoff If I have to grind through hours of the same first few levels to even get a chance of enjoying the game then I'm not going to waste my time on it Usually games like this allow you to adjust the difficulty so you can learn the ropes in the beginning and then challenge yourself when you're familiar with the mechanics As far as I know there was no way to do this with this game At this point wouldn't even say the game is difficult it feels like the combat is intentionally done poorly in order to give you the impression it's hard while actually it's just frustrating I felt like I was fighting against the game mechanics instead of fighting the actual enemies and that sucks I even wondered if the game was still early-access because that's exactly how it felt to play it And I'm not even counting the many failures we had because of constant lag in a lan game Overall very promising but very disappointing I wish the combat would be flushed out to become actually enjoyable There are plenty of hard games out there that will take you hours to push through that will make you fail 2-3 hour missions that will punish you for small mistakes Those games are still fun This one was not
First Negative Review Infinite loading screens mission start buttons not working and invisible players that you can't interact with Not a great first impression I won't be returning after the free weekend This game could be great if only they fixed the major issues impacting the experience Edit All these issues have been fixed and the game is a really solid experience now true night and day compared to when I first tried it during the free weekend I 100 recommend this game now
The game is too difficult repetitive and you will always find glow-fking-sticks rather than useful items Graphics Amazing Guns Variety Utility Bits All in all not worth buying imo because of the difficulty Regeneration over time would be divine but we cannot have nice things ig
GOD THIS GAME IS SO HARD This game need teammate of 4 seriously bot sucks and really dumb Every level such a nightmare you wont survive long and it's almost impossible to complete it in one go for me and my friends at least Bot such a dumbass when there's one alerted they started blasting without thinking and alerting other mutant even though they helped at horde just get a friend it's better To find friends that want to play is hard either Gun play is good the horde is hard the looting is painful stealth is slow Despite all of that i think i like this game Well thanks for the developer to gave us all free week
Janky and unfun mess that puts player's torture above fun You'll get sensory deprivation from the same-looking environments enemies and gameplay No major changes since 2019 beta Avoid at all costs
Extremely repetitive not hard at all if you know what to do gets boring VERY quick couldnt even have much fun playing with friends Still feels extremely early access to me not finished at all Lore is non existant and gameplay is pretty boring
ok
Tested on free weekend I will buy it after proper gun model it's just way too big imo even if you out max fov
Free Weekend Rundown 7 Review Solid gameplay that require teamwork preparation Atmospheric graphic Messy matchmaking Progress breaking bug Can't put down Neonate HSU and charger Crash 1 time Would buy if they improve the matchmaking

As a huge fan of coop games I was interested in GTFO but warned off by the reports that it was heavily stealth-focused and incredibly unforgiving And in both cases that is essentially correct This is a game of limited resources against overwhelming odds and your best chances at survival are careful coordination and tight control of available resources Seeing a free-to-play weekend starting up for this game meant I could finally see if I like it Unfortunately for my group this was simply too much The missions are long if you're trying to tackle them carefully A single bad engagement means that 40 minutes down the road you may simply be out of ammo and facing a forced combat section Could we have kept playing and done better Absolutely But the overall minimalist progression means that failing a mission simply feels like too much time lost Other people have remarked on the poor matchmaking Let me simply relate my one experience 1 Took 6 attempts to find a full group 2 Someone sets off the sleepers in the first room by running at them with a hammer 3 One player kills every other player on the team and quits causing the mission to fail There's a lot to like about GTFO The tension is great the exploration is great and I personally really liked what you could do with a computer for exploration Everything else falls flat for me The game is so determined to be hard-as-nails that my group simply isn't interested in investing the time to get better at it It also requires team coordination on a scale you often can't achieve with standard matchmaking and that's when the matchmaker isn't working against you Ultimately I'll keep an eye on this game and check it out again if anything works towards improving the things my group didn't like Otherwise I'll happily stick with games like Deep Rock Galactic for my 4-player coop fix
Gamepad keybinding system is broken so game is unplayable on gampad cannot crouch cannot issue commands to bots etc Certain gameplay aspects are painfully slow like bringing a case back to an extraction point Some weapons are useless Game in general is too strategic for my taste I like constant action like WWZ/B4B/L4D
op
Pretty hard which makes it fun Glad it isnt too easy it requires communication and strategy to actually win Which is sometimes impossible because a majority of team mates for some reason do not have a MIC Solid game though movement and shooting is pretty smooth Worth it
Deep Rock Galactic
THIS game man.one of a kind.no one can seem to get past B1.We all struggle together and we all die together.good ass game
Ainda precisa de umas melhorias nas dos inimigos mas o fascinante Requer amigos que os bot aquelas coisas
If you don't have a super high end PC don't try it Just don't Game froze on me at the start and when I opened task manager to close it since it was lagging my entire PC even after I put it in the LOWEST settings as possible it was using up to 99 of my memory I can't say if the game is good or not but if you want to try it have a powerful PC before doing so It will NOT RUN on lower end PCs
Worst game I've played in over 10 years zero redeeming quality to it

Best game for horror action rpg and cooperative play
A great game to play with your friend highly recommend

After More than 10 hours playing the game here's what i think Best co op games you can ask for the theme is nicely executed and there is and acceptable amount of enemy variety and weapons but here's the catch you better have three more friends or find someone because the matchmaking is not good or the lobbies in general people get yeeted out of lobby when someone joins or when you try to find that last person instead you join an entirely separate lobby with new people for that reason if you are solo i don't recommend.you can find people in their discord server but that entirely is a different story
The optimization of this game is really fuck the dog the producer can do a good job on the server I only had one match out of five that worked and only one match out of five that started properly that didn't Crash To Desktop making my game experience pretty shit
Ma che sta cahata
got stuck in the lobby couldnt start a game free weekend review
i love this game so much its so fun with the heavy coop aspect and you cant be a one man army at all it really requires good teamwork and cooperation but the biggest downside is not everyone has a friend group actually willing to play it like i absolutely love this game but none of my friends like it I know bots exist but playing with them is boring as hell very very good game if you have friends to play with
this game can be a very good experience and everyone who is giving it a bad rating because they don't have friends to play with and complain about strangers who don't engage in team play are retarded It's not the game's fault how other people behave That said there are game breaking bugs When loading a checkpoint items might get stuck on players where they can't drop it switch equipment or interact with anything else These bugs can completely ruin a run on which you've already spent a lot of time possibly even an hour A quick search on the internet reveals that these bugs have been plaguing this game for many months and still haven't been fixed this is unacceptable
Bueno por lo que he probado es un juego en el que la atmosfera esta muy bien graficamente esta muy guapo y es una muy buena idea el juego PERO para mi gusto falla en que le falta es muy splinter cell te pasas casi toda la pantalla agachado y eliminando los monstruos en sigilo y lo malo es que los jugadores avanzados si eres nuevo porque se nota en tu skin no van a querer jugar contigo ni tampoco van a tener la paciencia de que te adaptes al juego ya algunos nacen ya xD Si te gustan los juegos de tener la paciencia de ir en sigilo el 90 de la pantalla y tienes 3 amigos que lo vais a jugar juntos de lo contrario no lo hagas el juego esta para sigilo y coop no vas a poder jugarlo en solitario porque la dificultad es la misma con 4 jugadores que con 1 Y que pasa si no la hago en sigilo pues que se va todo a la mierda porque la escasea justo para que lo hagas en sigilo
very much friendly play coop

Gra ma tak wiele na gry zostawiam negatywa i devsom powodzenia na plus klimat i atmosfera jest ale gameplay jest jednym wielkim bugiem od RNG Gods za twoim mele kilem czy nagle pomieszczenie z agruje GTFO 2 ale ten do mnie nie przemawia Stealth gameplay w Payday 2 jest zdecydowanie lepszy
Atmosphere lore and environment are awesome Too bad that gameplay is clunky frustrating and enemies are coded to be unfun instead of difficult Too much rng

Gra w fajna jak na 4 osoby gdyby nie liczba jest tak odechciewa Po 30-45 minutach gry gdy umrzesz odradzasz w 1/4 misji i zaczynasz od nowa misje w cale do nie
Really cool and interesting co-op FPS game The problem is dying puts you back by about 5-30 minutes of gameplay Checkpoint system is very poor and instead of repeating the last objective step you have to repeat like 5 or more and it takes a long time If you enjoy playing few hours long missions and a simple mistake forcing you to repeat your previous 15 minutes of gameplay then go ahead and play If you don't want to be bothered just repeating the same stuff over and over after a simple mistake stay away from this game

Kinda sucks
I loved the earlier rundowns but I dislike R6 and R7 doesnt feel like my GTFO anymore So try it maybe you like it but with the state right now I dont
700 P.S
Like the concept and art directory of this game Needs bigger player base Come try it
We tried this game on the free weekend one of us cannot interact and the bot is useless while stayin a trigger circle He/She cannot stay on it
pc
Its hardcore Great to play with friends Hard to find good co-op games these days It would be great with a few extra checkpoints throughout the maps 1.5hrs into the 4th mission died and had to start from deployment again It's missing weapon unlocks and modding or upgrade tree Missions take longer and longer and increasing enemy waves but its the same guns from the start The only things that help are the mutators(boosters Ammo or health drops from enemies even if only the big boys or feelers would also be a massive benifit Myself and my brother are looking to buy this after giving it a go over this free weekend but definitely going to be a weekend game for us First mission took about 75mins by the 3rd mission it was over 3hrs to complete Will attempt 4 again next weekend

i wanted to like this game but the immersion was broken early by the start sequence taking to long would rather have a loading screen stuff happening without much explaing,bots spewing same lines and no exposition made me not care about them the big flashing circles hearding the group togheter and making the game feel like a chore me and my friend who loves horror zombie shooter games was so bored no thanks

Honestly one of my favorite games of all time The difficulty is fair and even solo while it is somewhat boring I can still manage to have some fun Playing with friends is far better though as I have people to yell and crack jokes with when we're not getting ambushed into hell As well if the base game begins to feel bland or you experience less enjoyment download R2Modman They have modding support for this gem of a game which brings so much to the game and great QOL changes 10/10 game for me
Yes
I get why the community says this is a hard game but its not hard for the reasons I expected This game is good but there are so many issues The AI is very buggy we had on multiple occasions enemy's getting alerted from the other side of the room or getting alerted through walls I don't know if its just the melee or the hit reg in general but it makes using melee annoying to use My mates and I have had attacks either deal no damage or pass through an enemy alerting it and others around them The Checkpoint system may as well not be in the game it doesn't work If you use the Checkpoint nearly everything on the map breaks loot getting regenerated Doors being desynced for other players being unable to interact with anything objective item being unusable because they are being Held by a player that can't drop them Why include a warning for Alarmed doors if you are going to make some give no warning C1 Monster was my hope that the missions would start playing out more like this one When we open the security door to start grabbing the objective they spawn infinite waves making us backtrack into said waves to grab Power Cells we didn't move because This door isn't an alarm The ammo economy in the game work unfortunately it need the rest of the game to work aswell Anytime we ran out of ammo was because we had to deal with bugs
I love the setting LORE and idea of the game Its Left 4 dead with a bit more My issues are two matchmaking and the inability to find anyone And lack of customazation to weapons maybe I didnt get far enough still good game just wish finding someone to play with was easier
get rid of the spitting its complete ass gas
I need to define a term first b]rundown[/b A rundown in GTFO is a set of levels usually around 10-14 A couple times a year the development team releases a new rundown and wipes out the current one This brings with it a new set of levels for sure and maybe new weapons or monsters The art assets and lore see a lot of updates too Ok on to the recommendation b]You should consider this game if:[/b olist You're patient and ok with high difficulty sometimes losing more than 30 minutes of your time and commitment This game strongly encourages co-op with humans and sometimes people make mistakes or the internet just says no to your game progress You want a game for the sake of challenge not to decompress or relax GTFO is demanding of your attention all the time Some rooms you need to tip-toe through and screwing up means wiping the group Don't be that guy You absolutely like first person shooters Enjoying horror will enhance your experience too but remember you're playing with other humans and because of that the immersion will come and go depending on personalities You do not get frustrated easily Some nights you will make no progress If you can roll with that you'll be ok When you know what you're doing levels can be finished in an hour When you don't it can be 2-4 hours with other people that also don't know what they're doing This can still be fun but if you need to be comfortable with that kind of time commitment You have a regular group of friends that have similar interests in gaming This is absolutely not required the GTFO Discord community is generally helpful and friendly Almost all of my progress I made with pick-up groups You know what a CLI is and find that as a game mechanic to be an exciting or interesting thing You're ok with or even a fan of using Discord the chat platform olist You should think carefully about a purchase if olist You want a solo experience You i]can[/i play the game with bots but they're meant to supplement groups missing 1 or 2 players Their AI is good but not perfect and sometimes you get shafted In past rundowns sets of maps that get wiped every few months people have completed the game solo but it occasionally requires borderline exploitive tricks or techniques It is possible in future rundowns like 7 which we're on now have a level where it is not possible to complete solo You get frightened easily You get frustrated with other players easily You're hardcore about immersion There's plenty of lore in this game if you want it but often the game mechanics break the immersion For example standing in glowing circles to complete a security scan You don't like typing An important mechanic is typing in terminals in-game to look up items locations trigger events or read lore and logs I'm talking about an actual console interface akin to hitting tilde and typing in commands for older games They built an in-game command line interface CLI You don't like discord You love micro transactions You're a completionist When a rundown is released the old one is scrapped completely Any cosmetic rewards specific to that rundown are no longer accessible It is usually a bad idea to attempt all objectives at once in a level you are not familiar with Level knowledge and understanding is a big part of success and that requires a few incomplete runs and failures at the start Furthermore rundowns are completely thrown away whenever a new one is released There are ways to replay old rundowns but the experience is often janky and you cannot match make You have to sync with other players trying the same rundown Devs discourage playing older rundowns because it fragments the community olist I hope that's enough for people to make smart buying decisions I have a few more after thoughts that new players might trip on Knowing this would have helped my initial confusions list b]Use the official Discord for match making[/b Use the LFG channels and learn how discord integrates with the game e.g copying a lobby ID to the clipboard and pasting it to the LFG channel The in-game matchmaking is a total crap chute shoot and will often match you up with the gutter players Don't use it I know it is weird that a modern game that relies on human co-op to have a weak match making system I agree it is But if you can spend a little time trying the discord integration your experience will be a lot better over all The game has bugs for sure The core game play loop is amazing when it is firing on all cylinders and that is most of the time 90 I'd say Occasionally though especially near a new rundown release like the one we got a couple days ago there are new bugs that break things For example if you're carrying a heavy item during a checkpoint and then reload at that checkpoint you cannot put the heavy item down You can't access any weapons or tools without relogging into the game You need to be patient with these things 10 Chambers is responsive and fixes severe issues but it often takes many days for them to address bugs that have workarounds Minor bugs we often live with until then next rundown You will know pretty quickly if your internet connection with other players specifically the game host is bad The game combat gun play does tolerate lag well enough but other facets like sneaking past sleeping enemies or objectives getting updated can get frustrating or misleading If the objectives look stale ask the host player they'll have a pink name what their objectives say to confirm the game is still on track Do not try to 100 a level from the outset Specifically overload objectives should be attempted after you're familiar with the level because they intentionally make it harder to complete For example completing an overload objective early in the level might slowly fill the rest of the level up with fog over the course of 25 minutes This was a real thing in a rundown 6 level Swimming in pea-soup fog in a level you don't know very well is not recommended list
I've only been playing during the free weekend but for me there are many game-breaking bugs including frequent crashes to desktop If it weren't for the bugs it would be a fun suspenseful and intriguing game Maybe my experience is system-specific IDK
I shit pant
I tried the free weekend I found it difficult to get into any games When I did it was not very interesting
me and friend cant work together me and friend die together good game 10/10
The ONLY reason I can't recommend this is because of the price tag If you plan on getting it I HIGHLY suggest waiting for a significant discount The game itself is pretty nice but its certainly not worth
I'll preface that if you're playing this game solo or with a premade of friends the game is fun and I have no issues with it The problem arises when you're doing matchmaking I hope you know a chinese language because holy fuck you're going to be playing with a bunch of them and the worst part is these jokers do NOT know how to play the game I'm talking about just running into sleeper shooting everything they see and looting all of your stuff I can only assume this is some tribal racial thing because they sure do it EVERY FUCKING TIME to non-chinese players Avoid chinese players it's not worth it especially when you have to TALK and you can't because they don't speak english Another major issue is when you start a game it gets incredibly laggy and when you're dropping down to start a match someone always DC's and you take 5 minutes before you land half the time Region lock the chinese from NA and ban the VPN losers then optimize your game and matchmaking becomes playable There shouldn't be any reason I should be playing with non-english speaking players at all well except for the fact they sold out to tencent The chinese retards you play with are allowed by your chinese overlords
this game is really fun i really enjoy it its badass
Don't even bother starting the game with no friends GTFO is not a horror it's rather a boring thriller you spend hours walking in a maze not knowing what to do No story included It's not ultimately bad tho graphics and gameplay are nice difficulty is challenging but overall it's not worth it Not even mentioning broken matchmaking
Played this on the free weekend trial and found out my dick is more entertaining Better games out there so avoid this mess
b]I would recommend this game if it hits price Pretty well made game imo but the gameplay has cheap feel to it[/b b VERY BAD HITREG.[/b i](Shots often go through monsters firing same target too fast makes rest of the shots clip through as if the monster would be immune few seconds after first hit)[/i b POOR QUALITY SNEAKING.[/b i](Monsters often spot you even with their backs against you OR they don't spot you at all even if you smack other monster down right in front of them)[/i b MELEE IS JUST ABOUT USELESS.[/b i](Melee weapons seem to do more harm to yourself than the enemy charged sneak attacks are only use they seem to have In combat monsters have more invisible reach and you end up getting hit by nothing when you get closer to hit them)[/i b BARELY ANY AMMUNITION IN THE GAME.[/b i](You can't go in the game expecting to gun down every monster you see You will struggle to have ammunition for your guns even if you try to use it wisely.)[/i b BIG FALL DAMAGE FROM SMALL DROPS.[/b i](Jumping down from a desk or very small ledge can and will hurt you a lot!)[/i b WELL BUILT AMBIENCE/ATMOSPHERE[/b b GREAT QUALITY SOUNDS[/b b OVERALL BEAUTIFUL GAME[/b b CHALLENGING GAMEPLAY[/b b REQUIRES TEAMWORK[/b
Well you cannot play this game with random people which is exhausting to find a full lobby or keep people in the game from beginning Beside game would be much better if it was gonna be full auto shooter game Challenging is a delusion to people think they are enjoying If I were Devs I would like to make 2 kind of games much less sneaky/challenging but more action/shooter from this one and compare how many people are playing which version of this game Probably action/shooter will get much more credits rather than crouching version For now if you wanna spend some time on lobby but not playing the game this is the game for you
This game is a little way too hard and the gun-play feels lacklustre and unrewarding when you do finish missions The atmospheric pressure built by the lack of checkpoints and the need to do things correctly is completely outweighed by the fact that you get mauled to death in almost no time while reloading or switching weapons because of the number of enemies and the lack of damage When it resets you to a checkpoint that is about 15 mins of work away it just makes the game feel like a chore rather than a game I'm not really against the game but not really for it This is just my viewpoint of how the game feels to play during a FREE WEEKEND Conceptually and game-play wise the game feels great but the tedium drags it down to a borderline chore of a game
bad

Game's good Wish i had the money to buy it though Crappy moments but from what i heard Thats how the game is This review was made at a Free Weekend
Has potential we got SOOOOO many bugs though Not actually hard the way some people say just kinda broken
spent 5 hours on a level and didn't finish it probably gonna buy this game
Great game this is how cooperative games should be COOPERATIVE But don't bother unless you have friends to play with The matchmaking is awful and Discord is a waste of time you either wait a long time to get players there or you get players who are no different than randoms The matchmaking just picks a random mission of your chosen difficulty and then connects you with random players The host is chosen randomly so expect games where you will have high latency Devs should create a normal lobby system like Left 4 Dead has done ages ago You have bots at your disposal but you will have a hard time beating certain missions with them
No tutorial so i have no idea what to do or what makes this game special That means that im wasting peoples time as well as this game can only be played in a lobby just no
The closest thing you will find to an Alien Isolation co-op experience The tech behind this game seems amazing The enemy AI is fantastic Upon initial boot I was intrigued by the immersive log-in experience Unfortunately in reality this game feels like the bastard child of Alien Swarm and Killing Floor 2 Takes interesting aspects from both games without managing to achieve anything compelling or unique An endless cycle of map sector and terminal checking with un-diverse bullet-sponge enemies In my opinion immersive horror games do not suit this fast-paced FPS genre If you're looking for intense immersive space horror play Alien Isolation If you're looking for fun co-op shoot-em-up play Deep Rock Galactic or Vermintide II If you're looking for immersive co-op horror play Phasmaphobia GTFO tries to be all of the above without managing to be any of them
Game is actually hard requires teamwork and stealth but unfortunately also at least three people Some objectives are super RNG dependent or you just have insufficient resources if there's only two of you If this was also balanced for duos and trios as well it would be amazing Getting three others to buy the game and have time for it is not something easily done Apart from that the guns feel good the shooting is hectic the stealth feels rewarding the atmosphere is great If you like stealthy and tactical coop experiences this game is for you Provided of course you have enough people with similar interest
Absolute zero
Matchmaking is really bad 75 of the time you wont get a full team Once someone leaves in matchmaking no one else will fill the empty spot Sneaking doesn't work because there are too many enemies guarding doors No RPG element No one uses microphone even thou matchmaking requires everyone to use microphone low playerbase
I loaded up the first mission found 3 other people to play you can try to do it yourself but good luck as the guns cant aim for shit and you can take 4 hits before getting floored then one got dropped out the game lagged horribly and the nano pod thing I was forced to carry became cloned and broke the game forcing us to have one person just stuck holding the damn thing The only way we cold get the damn thing to let go was to watch it duplicate itself after trying to drop it several times Another person picks up the dupe and now I can drop mine but they are stuck holding it instead How is this still as bugged as it is On the first mission Uninstalled and Ill skip till its cheaper and properly bug fixed
This game has the worst menus I have ever seen in a game
It's a hardcore coop role-playing shooter that highly depends on teamwork It's not just random maps to kill each other but a sequence of them without clear instructions you have to communicate with each other and figure out where to go I love the part when you need to find terminals and query info about the objective by actually typing in the console when to sneak past monsters when to shoot them and with what Game has a slogan Work Together or Die Together Based on my first match yesterday it's very true On the negative side the checkpoint system is not the best especially knowing that the maps are long And I'm not just talking about when your team dies and you have to do things over and over again if you quit because you know you have a life you won't be able to continue where you left
It's hard for me to recommend GTFO given how little this game is played by other users on steam It can be difficult going the discord route to find a squad of people to complete rundowns with However this is still an excellent game I had an absolute blast despite of the difficulties just make sure you bring a group of friends to play with
Payday left4dead killing floor 2
Simply put Like Left 4 Dead but with a focus on stealth mechanics all the good and bad that comes with it
Long story short played this game during a Free Weekend and completed only A1 and B1 missions finish B2 Personally the game felt tedious and a bit repetitive with a lot of gameplay nuances that do not feel rewarding if you tackle with them GTFO is a game about playing as a team it If you f-up then the whole team might go down Not sure who can survive solely but I guess possible The game features various levels called Rundowns as far as I understand Various guns melee combat and tutorial that explain almost anything The game seems to have an interesting mysterious lore but I didn't get to that point probably will use Wikipedia or something That being said this game is one of those rare occasions when I enjoyed the experience as much as I expected I have high expections no but I thought the game features more enjoyable gameplay loop that feels rewarding when you overcome the obstacles I played with randoms and people from Discord great community though at the end of the day still had the same feeling kinda bored I cannot remember many games that made me feel like it except Sonic series that I just understand However with all said above I think the game will be enjoyed by people with a team full of friends P.S You might wonder why I recommend this game Well I did say I like this game but I say that the game is utterly bad good enough it has a great community and to be honest I might just had a bad mood or something Who knows Heh
very scary if we don't know what it is if we knew what it is we don't know what it is

C'est un jeu que j'ai pu essayer durant une semaine gratuite du jeu C'est un jeu que je trouve pas beau moyen et qui joue beaucoup avec les ombres ce qui est bien pour l'ambiance dont on peut surpris par les attaques des ennemis venant des endroits sombres Les ennemis ont des dommages et visible sur les parties de corps avec des destructions de corps qui change un peu la d'attaque des ennemis si je recommande le jeu le plus gros serait la recherche des 3 pour faire la mission parce qu'il faut attendre un temps incertain et chaque partie repose sur la bonne de nos de plus ce qui arrive souvent dans ce style de jeu d'avoir aucun pour faire la mission me fait penser pour les vagues au call of duty zombie mais les ennemis en mieux en intelligence artificiel en menace et types d'attaques Je recommande le jeu mais il y a toujours la menace de trouver personne pour faire la partie avec nous
great game
Los mejor del juego fue el trailer de la idea no es mala pero mucho a melee y pocos tiros
no one told me you needed to unlock doors with your team together it just made me realize that me and my friends couldn't even open a door

Best game ever If you are searching for an adventure,horror,shooter game,this is the perfect one
Not yet there My real NO is the poor matchmaking you gotta find 3 random people which is easy at first but someone always leave for no reason and you have to start the search process all over gotta keep repeating this until you find 3 other members willing to stay but even if you manage to get into the match there's no in-game invite or rejoin in the event of a crash sometimes rendering a mission impossible to complete with the remaining crew and boy some of them can take quite a while Even bringing friends is up to no good because unless you have all the 3 required friends you cannot find a random person to fill the lobby or if you have just one you gotta wait someone to leave so that you can invite that needs a lot of work plus this may seem harsh but completely clueless or not willing to communicate folks can just completely destroy your run so no way to get rid of them and start all over it is Because of these issues I couldn't get a group to get past the FIRST B sector B1 if i recall correctly-someone would crash/give up or just ruin the run and since there's likely harder stuff ahead well In a co-op game you can't work with barebones team-forming oh and bots are completely useless Perhaps if those aspects improve i'll review the review
some minor bugs like getting stuck on the intro elevator scene other than that game is really fun requires team work and makes you use your brain a little to inputting codes and finding the right terminals

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place Ingredients 1 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 1/2 cup white sugar 3 1/2 cup brown sugar 4 1/4 cup water 5 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6 1 pinch salt 7 5 apples peeled cored and sliced 8 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions 1 Preheat oven to 425 degrees F 220 degrees C 2 Combine butter white sugar brown sugar water cinnamon and salt in a saucepan over medium heat Bring to a boil remove from heat and set aside 3 Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate Place bottom crust in pie plate pour in apple slices 4 Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle Cut into 8 1-inch wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal 5 Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie coating the lattice and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust 6 Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes Reduce heat to 350 degrees F 175 degrees C and bake until the crust is golden brown the caramel on the top crust is set and the apple filling is bubbling 35 to 40 more minutes Allow to cool completely before slicing
The game is very immersive I love how there's no difficulty slider you can spend more than 3hrs doing a level and still lose everything all for you to try again What makes this game so enjoyable/Is that the replayability is endless every mission you are given in the complex feels unique and I love how you must complete the first expeditions in a specific rundown to go deeper in the complex with even more of a challenge ahead Overall this is game is worth all the money I suggest you buy it on sale if you are looking for a hardcore co-operative shooter
Love the gunplay and the coop mechanics but man does this game feel like a walking sim left me bored half the time having to figure where next I had to head to Don't get me started about how ass the matchmaking is if you search for 10 lobbies then you'll get 10 failed lobbies where everyone drops out or the game just craps itself Hard to enjoy a coop game when it makes it hard to find players to coop with Glad I tried it while its free to play no way am I going anywhere near this 50 with a 6-foot stick
Fix matchmaking and fix the vomit inducing UI No I'm not gonna join your discord I can play every other coop game without needing to join a 3rd party service
solo is mayhem and i love it
Great Aliens vibes Claustrophobic and depending on how you play can be quite nerve racking ala vintage Resident Evil Requires more strategy and teamwork and that's what makes it unique to me Weapons are also cool and unique I hope more folks jump on this title its definitely fun with friends/fam
GTFO survival horror 10 Chambers Collective Left 4 Dead 10 Chambers Collective Payday The Heist 10 Chambers Collective 2-4
its a pain trying to get a decent match up its a pain trying to find any object with the terminal its a pain having to resort to using melee most of the way through because you never start off the match with full ammo its a pain the fact they never added any grenades to take out mobs with so you end up wasting precious ammo
tl;dr Really fun take on co-op survival horror totally ruined by broken matchmaking weird bugs and the need to install and use discord to find games Start the game hit matchmake choose your options and start Only 1 other person joins Well too bad you can either play with bots invite friends or you have to reroll the entire lobby again You can't simply matchmake the last 2 slots Even then it's kind of dodgy as sometimes it just wont bother matchmaking you at all That being said if you're willing to install discord and hunt for games there It'll be a great experience I was lucky enough to play on a free weekend so lots players were looking for random games and I had a really great time But I was informed by a long term player that it wont last past the free weekend as the playerbase drops back to sub 1k and matchmaking is extremely difficult after that In summery Very fun game Great concept and art direction Real tense moments Heavy focus on survival as ammo is scarce Most of the people I ran into were happy to share knowledge on how to git gud Ruined by low playerbase and broken matchmaking the interaction key suddenly not working stops you from using doors tools reviving players picking up ammo and health etc music and voice playing fine but gunshots and monster noises sometimes sounding like they are coming from a room somewhere down the hall and a bunch of other bugs that really should not exist so long into a games life Devs would probably do well to cut the price down to 15-20 bux to increase the playerbase I'd be willing to forgive a lot of bugs if I could just jump on hit matchmake and have fun
THIS GAME IS HARD FOR ME BUT THIS IS GOOD GAME
This fcking game is awful literally the slowest paced and repetitive game of all times I cannot understand how tf you have barely 100 ammo on AR and like 20 on pistols to go against zombies who die in 5 bullets even on the head The one thing that i liked abt the game was the fact that we had to share everything w da homies so we could survive atleast one horde of zombies The idea concept itself is hella good but the execution was horibble Just make it more fast paced give more ammo and health or some sort of shield system and remove the cringe fact of using a pc to spot things or know where you have to go lmao For me even 1 is too expensive for something like this Graphics 10/10 Gameplay ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Concept/Idea 7/10 Hud Cringe tried to copy crisis but ended up in some weird and uncomfy thing
1600 rubles is not worth it Monsters kill fast There are not enough cartridges There is practically no lighting
maximal verwirrend dieses Spiel Steuerung komplett Arsch blickt man teilweise gar nicht durch vor allem wen man Controller Spielt Ansonsten Sieht es gut aus Kampfsystem ist ok Waffen sind auch in Ordnung Meine erwartung hat leider nicht getroffen
multiple times have i been glitched into holding a objective in my hands and am unable to drop it even after dying and restarting the checkpoint after spending so long in a mission just to have this happen makes me never want to play this game again please fix the game
If you enjoy having panic attacks this is the game for you

all the nopes that ever noped in nopeland
Love this game and think it has a lot of potential It feels very unique and really captures a horror survival team environment that no other games have The enemy mechanics make you play differently and you have to stay strict as a squad to be able to finish the missions However all the praise I have said for the game is countered by one major issue time Currently there is no way to exit a mission and then resume it later I'm all about having games be difficult but feeling the frustration of playing for 3 hours and not being able to stop because of fear of having to restart that whole mission when you are stuck on one section over and over can really drain the experience It takes away my fun at that point and I don't have that sort of time to just commit to when I sit down to play a game with a group of friends I'm sure this isn't true for everyone but I highly suggest if you and your friends can't set aside 3 hours to play this game at a time then its might not be worth the frustration

If you get a good team it's an awesome teamgame
Until the next free to play weekend boys
Nice if not exactly innovative idea but bad execution Frustrating repetitive and slow gameplay
This game is a blast If you have people to play with it is great or if you play it solo it is just as fun With more people it slightly takes away from the horror ambiance but adds more of a strategy plan to it during door alarms or siege doors With Rundown 7 out now is the time to try it out since they added a tutorial With the new weapons added in and all of the levels to explore the replay ability is there It is a blast trying to figure out were to go and how to survive on the way There's nothing more heart racing as you are on 10 health and your on way to the exit when you have a final alarm to fight your way through Its challenging but not frustrating If you have been keeping an eye on the game now is the time to play
its good but hard like hard if you dont know ins and out of the game melee sometimes clipping the model and miss the head sometimes but its k
stupid game don't play it i still stand by what i said
This game is fun and values teamwork its a great mix of fps-ish and puzzle solving and the puzzles are easy a monkey could somewhat solve it

Extremely great game its a blast playing with friends even if you dont have a full squad Playing singleplayer can be fun but i reccomend trying to do solo stealthly Currently playing through the free period good stuff Hey Simon Viklund and the voice actor of Wolf worked on this game
It's good but still not good enough Crashin a lot Freeze stuck on loading map es D1 Sometimes freeze for unknown reason then wasting about 2-3hrs on run just because of it
Checking out this game on the free weekend with a friend I wanna like it but there is a bug that makes restarting checkpoints frustrating when holding the Hsu container thing and restarting a checkpoint i can't drop the Hsu container and now there's 2 of them If a teammate picks up the 2nd one on the ground then i can drop the one i'm holding.but now they can't drop their's LOL what if i pick it up again they can drop it the only workaround we found online is to leave the expedition and then return luckily i was playing with steam friends to joining back in was easy dunno how it would go if i was playing with randoms I guess you have to remember to drop these sorts of items before starting checkpoints as this bug is well known and this workaround was easy to find online if i didn't have to go through the frustrating workaround because of this bug i would have played another round
he jugado por en steam y puedo decir que este es uno de los mejores la de ser perseguido ser silencioso y es tan que no la he sentido con juegos de 20/10 y GOD
Pretty good atmospheric game Really gets you on the grip with horror survival Typing on the terminal makes me nervous which i think is the point
boaring zzzz
this game sucks
good i like submarins
amazing game to play with the boys 7 hours and all we did was scream for our lives and only beat the first 2 levels much fun would play again

love it
Very fun and super hard bring friends or you will not be able to beat it I strongly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a challenge with friends
great
very hard.monsters get shot.good game 11/10
Jugamos con los pibes menos de 1 hora y la verdad el juego se cae a pedazos ni regalado lo acepten gracias
This game is easily the top on my list for putting an emphasis on teamwork and strategy The game overall is good but there's some rough spots when it comes to the search missions and finding out exactly what to do For the game play it can be slow with some progressive missions but it provides satisfaction knowing everything is going smoothing and to plan as you want with you and your team It's not like a run and gun game at all But when the action comes in with the hordes of enemies it's an exhilarating experience and can be downright terrifying I'd recommend getting it IF you AND your friends are willing to play a hardcore game
Ni regalado vuelvo a jugar esta basura
Its really good its release was kind of rough when there was no matchmaking or bots Now all those are implemented and what seems to be a storyline as you descend further along with some cosmetics as you complete objectives the gunplay is really good but dont let the game fool you this isnt a run and gun game its a horror-coop-stealth game mixed in with some very intense moments where everything dissolves into a firefight for your lives and where you pray the rest didnt hear you
I truly enjoy the atmosphere game design and how much cooperation and common or maybe not so common sense you need to have to beat this game I think it can turn people off how much forethought has to go into every encounter or everyone dies If any link in the chain slips up it's also likely that everyone dies Progress is slow so it may aggravate this issue It is not an FPS like call of duty You have to take it slow and steady if you want to survive simple mistakes early on in each mission can cascade later if you use too much ammo or lose too much health Overall I'd give the game a 9/10 for how far they've come but I believe there are large barriers to entry on this title so it may be a little esoteric
Los son de lo lento y llegan a aburrir de tanto esperar a comenzar el juego menos mal es fin de semana gratis porque ni de broma este juego
It's a great game but the matchmaking seems to be broken
The game is cool but for how long the levels take to complete I expect them to work in C-1 for example The security scan didn't show up and I ended fighting off 4 hordes before we were finally overrun Kills the immersion for me
muito bom
WOW I am so glad I got this game for free so I didn't have to go thru the trouble of even refunding it After this game has been out since 2014 they didn't even bother going thru the effort to make it full screen You heard right the moment I open the game and am sitting at the main menu i scroll over just to have my mouse go off screen before I can play with any of the other settings And no matter how many times I change the displays nothing will work your only 2 options to fix this is to have only 1 monitor or have special logitec mouses or other mouses that have gamer profiles to force our mouse to stay on that one monitor when the game is open Incrediable its up to the community to find round about solutions just to play a 7 year old game
this game sucks dont waste your money
buen juego pero me falta una mejor pc T-T
tedious matchmaking and issues with setting up rooms alright once a lobby is made
Game sucks at explaining what to do
Very long game but it's fun to play with friends I'm joking please do not ever consider to even launch the game
Overall the game play is not smooth There're too many unnecessary designs ex typing in terminal instead a menu unable to run when holding baby and give player several doors at same time but end up have to visit all of them round trip is boring I also encounter an unplayable bug retry at save point but holding a collect case and unable to drop it
friendly fire is bullshit
very fun and not too hard especially when you and your friends don't have the intelligence of a lobotomized chimpanzee
good visual bad code too many retards steam should start doing a IQ test before people can use steam
Tried it during the free weekend with some buddies The UX is terrible It will take you 3 minutes to figure out where the play button is As for game play it's more of a slow exploration game rather than a zombie shooter
Incredibly slow I was expecting it to be slow-paced but this was cringe Spent more time standing in a circle than anything else
game good
I can understand why this game went free to play out of nowhere It's probably the most annoying trash pile I have played in a long time The spaghetti coding is on a whole other level DO NOT RECOMMEND
The matchmaking system is really really bad
I don't know who positively reviewed this steaming hot garbage but their rights to leave reviews on Steam should revoked Boring UE4 school project trash with minimal spookiness and TERRIBLE combat Could be the sequel to a Hello Kitty game
Great game
ta potente
This game is trash and will never be good Match-Maker is broken there're game-breaking bugs the UI is slow clunky the gameplay is primitive you can't reconnect to a game in progress all the info is hidden enemies are boring You will spend hours learning how to clear a stage through trial error but one tiny mistake will cost you a lot of ammo health then set you back half an hour to a checkpoint where your game can break entirely Do not waste your time or money on this overpriced early-access failure
The game is great but the current single player experience is very poor please continue to optimize the difficulty of BOT and single player finding items
IM TWEAKING HAHAHAH
objective based fps it's a ton of fun and a lot to do during each mission
doidimais
shit game
Bloated more complicated and more boring than call of duty zombies
Playing on the free weekend has been a nightmare Just getting a lobby of friends together without someone getting cage dropped early or having issues joining the room was an ordeal
epic gamer game
1200 Upd 1675
good gun play lighting and sound but very unforgiving checkpoint system and mainly tedious if the game had a stealth and combat setup more like payday2 where stealth was there but more line with a challenge run and going loud is more accepted it'd be twice as good as it stands Deep Rock is far more enjoyable
Please add some kind of multiplayer checkpoints
really fun especially if you want a change of pace from Batlle royales and multiplayer games this coop stealth game is pretty fun and obv better with the bois Its worth trying out but definitely worth it Imo
Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City
I really want to like this game but WOW is it ever just frustrating and BAD matchmaking is a joke The bots will randomly shoot at enemies including scouts when you are waiting for a good shot totally screwing you over and wrecking the whole run RIP Boosters Every mission forces you to scrape by on crap all so the second their terrible AI does almost anything Yet again screwed Map design makes everything feel tedious and when combined with avg map play time of 1+hrs by the end you just want to quit I am writing this review after playing the second mission on RD7 solo probably 3 hours spent on this one mission 60 of which was re-trying and failing the very last part because even after checking every room,box and lootable iteam by the last checkpoint i was fine on health but had practically NO AMMO for guns or deployables AND I ALWAYS KNIFE WHEN POSSIBLE So i was pretty much stuck 75 done and after 5 load from checkpoints with a bot running infront of friendly fire or trying to melee a mob of 6 with plenty of ammo I ALT F4'd I read something that stuck with me that went something like the game makes it stupidly hard ex you can play eft and go in with only 1 extra mag and it may be harder but is it really more fun Game is super cool but soooooooo annoying to play maybe because forced apon play style Dont buy unless you got other buddys that are even willing to play
This game is brutal and one mistake can send you back a checkpoint Not meant for running and gunning or players who don't like stealth After playing the game both solo and with friends I can say it is a game worth playing if you're willing to go through a challenging game You will die and be forced to improvise and form a strategy to survive through an attack This game does not hold your hand apart from one tutorial mission You need to be accurate and effective to not run out of ammo completely or be constantly low on health Being stealthy killing enemies with melee using teamwork to take down multiple enemies at the same time/ganging up on a single enemy is often key to survival in this game You'll either need to get really lucky with matchmaking or find good friends to get through levels in this game As the motto of the game says Work together or die together
Firmeza pakas
Very well put together comedy title Very funny game Would not recommend
I've played this for 12.3 hours as of this current review and I've only just made it past B1 with a group of friends If you aren't a fan of slower paced games do not play If you aren't a fan of games being hard do not play This game is about making mistakes learning from them and maybe making the same mistake 3 times in a row stupid scout creatures If you have patience like slower games and are ok with having a slightly small party of players then this game is absolutely fantastic The gunplay feels great the enemies are challenging even though they are pretty basic which is not a criticism of the creatures and each level that I have seen is unique Each level you complete gives you a great sense of satisfaction from the fact that you cleared the level I highly recommend this game to anybody who enjoys a slow horror shooter
very fun definitely need to have voice comms i recommend getting a group of friends together for it in discord thought it would be too scary for me but you get used to it quite quickly really fun and no rundown is the same
incredibly cool and honestly original game be warned this is meant to be played with friends and communication as well as planning is crucial i only have around 4 hours but i feel as if im getting the basics down
fun game with friends very hard
As before with most steam reviews yes and no options for recommendation are not enough I would give this a MAYBE with a lot of if's and but's Hear me out on this it's a good game that's both challenging and fun but with a catch.It can never be those two things simultaneously it seems GTFO has the unique problem of either being challenging and unfun or fun and not so challenging And it switches back and forth between the two sides wildly at times way too much Playing with randoms is a coin flip of an experience 50/50 some good other times bad Would recommend this game only if you have a dedicated group of folk to play with sadly
divertido y entretenido

Lots of fun huge potential but it feels a bit unpolished Also alarm creatures being immune to damage is completely moronic I would pick this up if it was steeply discounted perhaps I'm too pampered by all my autogratification games but this isn't the game for me right now
Pretty fun game get little scary when zumbies scream loud but i have light on house so its okay but i get little knightmares so dont play before bed
very fun Has a fun discord as well the lore haven't gone in depth personally but seems super interesting Has different levels usually update Very fun
On est dans une partie sans aucunes explications et le jeu semble d'une hors du commun j'ai rarement vu franchement On est comme quatre chercher notre chemin constamment passer des portes et encore des portes qui mettent une s'ouvrir fouiller des casiers la recherche des objets au bout d'une minute tout le monde est court de munitions et on se retrouve taper les monstres au marteau mais c'est pas grave vu que ces armes semi-futuristes sont sans saveur Graphiquement c'est assez beau et il y a une ambiance visuelle et sonore je l'admet enfin bon moi je joue pour avoir du plaisir si je veux juste voir des choses jolies je vais au messieurs les A vous de voir mais pour ma part j'ai eu l'occasion de l'essayer pendant le week end gratuit et la sauce n'a pas du tout pris trop mou et trop du peu que j'ai vu
Only been playing for 5 hours and its so fun I've been searching for a multiplayer game to play with my friends for a long time and this is definitely it You have to use strategy not just brute force to kill enemies Your guns feel under powered and ammo is limited health too The game requires team work to get past levels Also no in game micro transactions which is great If your just looking for a Halo/Doom style brute force destroy crap game this is not the game for you as it requires strategy and thinking Overall really fun so far
NA segunda fase estou segurando o BB na mao e tem uma no consigo soltar Mas o jogo legal para jogar com os amigos
I got to play this as a part of the free weekend but even so due to a massive bug in literally the second level I would not recommend this to anyone until they actually fix it I got stuck holding the Collection Case after dying at the end of B1 So I couldn't do anything and we couldn't finish the level Everyone in the lobby logged off after trying to beat it for at least 2-3 hours and they all felt defeated due to a stupid bug Loved the game play even tho I don't like horror that much however if you aren't gonna release a game with minimal or not super harmful bugs then just delay the release
I run an older gaming rig still able to play everything on the market without a problem Loading the first mission caused a 4 minute loading screen while loud whistling wind played on a loop blaring through my headset Upon finally loading was treated to a slideshow Tried to hit escape to lower the default settings on the game game froze whole computer and caused a crash Reloaded tried to switch settings to low Upon clicking Save changes the game froze and crashed again Reloaded again checked settings escape doesn't let you out of the menu you have to click another menu to get out of it Attempted to deploy to mission again realize at this point we're 20 minutes into just trying to get the game to run Treated to an additional several-minute loading screen of whistling wind this now on low settings Finally got it to run but dropped into a slide-show every time I pulled the trigger Obviously if you've got a decent PC give it a try If you don't have a competitive gaming PC don't even bother This game is bloated and non-optimized
plays with friend 2nd level went into ninja mode on a scout hey maybe i could kill it bonk head with hammer doesn't die well shit gets swarmed ans survive meet 2nd scout and proceeds to sneak by Parkouring falls directly on top of him get swarmed for the 2nd time absolutely shatted and on low resources encounters large group of sleeper everybody else sneak past and on security scan can't get through cause them sleeper somehow lock me on pulse mode decided to move after what felt like hours Choccy you dumb fuck 1 sleeper was on scan mode it wakes the others doesn't have any health and ammo absolutely brutally wrecked savagely fails Overall pretty fun game Not recommended to play if you just woke up from a 4 hr sleep and 20 min of nap time
GTFOwn this game
Boring
Jogo horroroso nada faz sentido abre porta mata bicho acaba e acaba vida
The gameplay is too slow The guns are janky Overall the pacing of the game is very slow If you want a slow paced horror game play outlast or alien isolation It might be fun or okay if you play with 4 friends but this is a game that not many people even want to play so there is that
Imagine being scammed into buying this game standing in circles and waiting for teammates to enter that circle so you can continue simulator 17 minutes felt like 40 minutes very little gameplay besides interacting with random doors and consoles
If one fucks up then all fucks up
Amazing atmosphere visuals sound track and overall creativity Unfortunately the gunplay does not feel great and deserves an overhaul to allow for the game to shine
I have 10 hours on this game and I haven't finished a single level Great Game
emotionally taxing
love it
Derivative boring garbage Lots of running around searching for key items and wasting time The main gameplay loop is stealth kill the enemies fight the ones you can't and then begin the scavanger hunt Stealth with other people is annoying and frustrating Enemies will run right through you to attack people behind you and move in annoying erratic ways so melee is frustrating and very bad and shooting at them doesn't feel satisfying Looking for items using the games annoying terminal search/ping function is slow and just adds extra boring steps to the process of getting through doors and moving on with objectives Worst game I've played in a while
COOP IS REQUIRED TALK TO YOUR TEAM MAKE A PLAN AND STAY TOGETHER
I invited my friends to play for the free weekend They said this about the game I'm uninstalling it That's just about it
Very fun much hard Good team not required but necessary Tons of fun difficult missions 10/10 Sharks
Get expected to get dipped head first into the fire There is next to no hand holding in this game But in short it's like back4blood if B4B was more stealth oriented Don't expect to blast your way through a wave of baddies and still have ammo to spare for later in the level You're going to be using your melee weapon primarily and your guns when you get overwhelmed Stick with the gun turrets your tool slot but have one team member quip the bio-tracker which places red triangles on all the incoming enemies It is DARK in many areas so this really comes in handy
GOD

Actually an enjoyable horror experience especially with friends
Achei assim que conseguir passar do tutorial eu retorno
Good
Love it

game is fun but gigadamn highlight key items or mark them on the map once discovered because the objective changes when youre in its proximity even if its not in line of sightr so the objective will change and youll assume your partner must have found it because you never saw it then its a huge waste of time trying to find trhe key item that no one saw that and the mini maps needs to actually show walls and be able to change floors because it doesnt help you when youre lost some kinda weird lag too when you press the trigger and actually shoot the bullet these are my complaints but its still very fun when you dont miss an easily missable thing
Free weekend I somehow feel cheated of my time The bots are stupid as sin The carry this item with you quest is actual cancer I had to put it down to grab some health because these vagina mouth tongue fucks licked me with pizzazz and the item was glitched 30 minutes into a mission and it's done I understand why the game is called GTFO The game proactively wants you to GET THE FUCK OUT So I did deleted MOVING ON
iits and okay game
Muy entretenido y tenso si lo juegas con amigos Yo estuve 4 horas jugando full com mis compis y la verdad se siente el valor de la de cada uno de los integrantes

fun game make friend scared bean
Played the demo briefly Feels like they tried a different spin of Killing floor and missed the mark The missions are repetitive the enemies and gun play are boring I don't understand the hype this game got To each their own I guess
im buyng this when it goes on sale this game is cold asf highly recommend
ist eigentlich ein ganz nices game aber es hat das problem was mobas hat jeder einzelene spieler hat eine unglaublichen hohe verantwortung ein falscher move und der komplette run der vllt ne stunde gedauert hat ist dahin also entweder mit ner gruppe an freunden spielen was aber wie bei mobas viel streit sorgen kann oder einfach solo was aber auch nicht so super ist meiner meinung nach da alles sehr wirkt der druck da keine hilfe da ist noch ist und diese langen runden nochmal deutlich sind versteht mich nicht falsch ich mag das spiel eigentlich aber es brauch eine gewisses an erfahrung oder an ausdauer um es zu
Left 4 dead with extra steps
Its a new player hostile game with almost no re playability after you go through it and becose it's hard playing with randos is a nightmare the gamplay is cool but the luck of tutorials and overal Reason Story to play make it unpalatable for me
Honestly this game could probably be really good with a hardcore 4 man squad Outside of that its completely awful and one of the worst games to ever exist Seriously if you have a hardcore 4 man party and you enjoy co-op games get this Otherwise stay away Modern left4dead

Not worth the time
Played during the free weekend Graphics 8\10 good textures Sound 7\10 muffled at times but good Online game play 2\10 Horrible Difficulty Hard you will die most likely from your team mates Overall One legged hamster trying to run on a treadmill YOU CAN DO IT Not really Experience From what I played of the game which was attempting the first real dive three times First attempt team successfully reached the near end I'm guessing after spending some time getting there Though the run back through the level half the team was killed and the last two people got to the end to stand there not reviving the two folks downed Then they left the game Restarting the check point wasted 20-30 minutes of my day Second dive only three people queued up out of the four slots It lasted about 5 minutes until it all fell apart Third attempt made it for 10-15 minutes until it fell apart from most of the squad shooting each other over and over again Stealth What is that Everyone free for all Review Game would be better if the levels were shorter to not have to invest 1-2 hours of real time for a perfect run Online match making when working good luck Back in the day it was called PUG pick up group you knew you were going to die likely a lot but it's the best you could do That's this game You're going to die a lot but it's the best you got Think Charlie the unicorn getting knocked out for his kidney mixed with having to fight llamas with hats You have a rifle shoot the enemy in the head doesn't kill it Shoot it then in the torso doesn't kill it even without a head Did you notice the four other enemies beating you from ranged Did you notice half your team shooting you as well What is the objective anyway Find a terminal somewhere behind a door somewhere and manually type out a code like PING KEY_ORANGE_839S This leads to most of the time everyone scrambling to find something not knowing where to go or what they are doing You didn't play hardly at all how can you post a review of a larger game Early impressions are important from what I experienced it's a 10 game It's a horror style game you're supposed to be scared and die often Should I be more afraid of my team mates shooting me over and over or the sleeping alien things
Game is quite good but matchmaking is super broken Example 1 Game started with 3 players instead of 4 when full-group matchmaking was enabled One player was a bot This bot didn't spawn properly and had to be kicked in order to unlock a door because all group members were required to be present at the door for a bioscan The two of us eventually died because the enemy numbers were too great further details below Example 2 After starting a mission again with 3 players instead of 4 because one somehow disconnected right as the match started we successfully cleared the mission with 3 players but when we all readied up for the next mission I clicked matchmake to fill the last slot and the entire group of players I was with crashed and the lobby was then empty It's actually a cool game but without a functional matchmaking system or custom servers it's quite frustrating to actually get into a proper match and enjoy the game itself Especially considering enemy numbers DO NOT scale based on the players in the match hence why 3-4 players minimum is generally needed to complete a mission successfully If this gets fixed in the future I will change my review to positive
aburrido
Gud
booooring
Don't expect the greatest AI yet in the game however it gets the job done Souls-Like game meets FPS Don't play the game without a team 7/10
Nothing horror here
boring ass game LOL
most boring 20 minutes ever game suck and take up space on my hard drive
BOOOring is a game to search for chests instead of focusing on objectives sad
lower the price a bit man
Played as part of free weekend in a group of three friends Concept of the game as mix of fps stealth and puzzles is nice Gameplay in the long run seems kind of lack luster and dull Problem is the game as whole seems very confusing HUD is very cluttered with all kinds of text everything written in same font In addition hud has stereo vision kind of layered hologram appearance Fortunately this game be turned off for in-game HUD but NOT FOR THE MENUS The menus are a pain to look at since everything is displayed with stereo dropdown shadow and glitchy textures all over personally causing head ache quite fast Even the epilepsy warning in the beginning is written in same dropdown shadow wobbly style which seems risky
Poor checkpoint system Enemies shoot instant Just chaotic with enemies running past my friend No difficulty build-up Very poor first experience If my experience becomes better I will adjust
this game requires a lot of teamwork but it is really fun
Even tho I am a big fan of hard games This isn`t really a diverse game The enemies are only the same trash golums Being a sneaky ninja in a fcking shooter Tf is wrong with u guys The COD Zombies is more fun than this The coding is cool but there are only three things which u can do QUERY READ and PING It would be a great game if it was cheaper like 10 but really u want 40 for this and what the fuck is that menu Also the bot is just carrying the garbage shit instead of shooting golums
en weekend free conclusion Ce jeux est toujours en le matchmaking la des sessions des invisible des crashs server a gogo abandon de toute part Il avait un potentiel mais en ils faut l'oublier
My friends want me to tell you it's bad
was in an elevator for 5 minutes and discussed with my team why Top Gun 2
No explanation on what to do they just throw you in to figure stuff out Also I pissed my pants at least 20 times Great game Also very hard
gg is the best
Awesome game very intense
epic
There are so many better co-op games than this one Dont waste your money
definitely needs a recently played with tab and then it will be a 10/10
Demasiado en la dificultad mas lo cual te termina sacando las ganas de jugar ya que si no te toca gente demasiado coordinada o jugas con amigos para poder entenderte perfectamente no vas a poder pasar el segundo nivel del juego En resumen de 6 horas no podes divertirte en la dificultad mas sencilla y en la dificultad mas alta debes terminar siendo un enfermo que se conozca al detalle cada de los mapas Un juego que de entrada no sabe volverse amigo y que por ende termina cansando y popular
Trying this game during the free weekend After over an hour of play including the tutorial I have yet to be able to join a multiplayer match and successfully play a mission Seems like a great game but pointless to buy it and support further development and fixes if it is not even playable at a very basic level because of the multiplayer connectivity/matchmaking issues Hopefully they fix these issues and I can support the game and update this review at some point in the near future
SHIT

game is boring
The difficulty is so rewarding when you get all your ducks in a row
figuring out what you need to do in the game is most of the game glad i got it on free to play weekend would of had to get refund from steam
por que si y punto
This the single worst game ive ever player in my life
Yes
JOGO MUITO FODAAAAAAAA MEUDEUS QUERO COMPRAR MAS SOU POBREEEEEEEEEEEEEE

inshallah hahaha siuuu
gra kooperacyjna ale jest bardzo droga
this game do be ass
dis game ahh
I don't honestly know how this game even has good reviews yea right I played on the free weekend not more than 10 mins that's how bad this is
Is it even possible to clear the tutorial
b]This game is really hard and you have to spend at least 2 hours clearing each expedition.[/b combat is not that good kinda boring only customize cosmetics by rewards and you can't even customize your guns it was fixed the atmosphere of horror is great it is not friendly to new players and whoever is not good at English i P.S I don't have much time to play on the deeper sector because I played on the free weekend.[/i
too foggy
For credentials I have played this game once in its super early state once a couple months later and now again with the latest steam free weekend Not necessarily a bad or disfunctional game on principle but this game will be for very few people The mechanics and balance push you to play in one very specific playstyle and doesn't tolerate deviation from it You can not only stealth or only guns blazing While a lot of the artistry like graphics and sound design are top honestly at times the game suffers of aesthetics over function Menu buttons that need holding instead of clicking doors needing multiple activations repetitive horror background noises super loud cutscene to mask a loading screen and gods the headache inducing menu text colour 3d effect Especially the interfacing with the computer panels Yes I get it its meant to be immersive and in your way when you're fighting off monsters but when there's no monsters in an area its just boring busywork Same with the timed lock I just wish most of this stuff was optional with you know a difficulty or accessibility option The gunplay and feel is really good with certain weapons while surprisingly abysmal with others Some of the recoil patterns I just dont get and the shotguns felt like they are shooting maybe 5 pellets in opposite directions of the barrel This wouldn't be huge if the monsters werent fast evasive and if the connections having issues impossible to hit Bots are halfway functional but are unable to perform certain tasks and when it comes to going stealth/loud they seem to just have an on switch and it takes them a long while to go back to stealth The whole point of the horror in this game is to make it razor edge and like it works until it doesn't Once or twice you will wipe to something stupid like absurd bioscan placements or your own turret sentry friendly fire gunning down your whole squad Thats kinda when me and my team reached a point where we had enough of this game As I said this is not a garbage fire there's good building blocks but the game would need some major changes for it to be more enjoyable and from reading dev posts and other comments it seems that they just wanna continue pursuing their vision If you're even remotely unsure about the game give it a try first with one of these free weekends or the refund options cause it absolutely isn't for most people me included
Mir macht das Game kein Fun
Boring atmosphere and just annoying gameplay
THIS GAME IS SICK
Somehow co-op horror was made scary and it's really really damn good Beating missions feels so cathartic The community is also surprisingly kind for such a hardcore game from my experience
pretty decent definitely go slow or youll run out of ammo and health real quick
I played this on a free weekend and I don't usually post reviews but the team AI was so poor that on the second level I was completely blocked from completing the mission because they would not stand in the bloody security scanner to get through a door I restarted from the checkpoint 5 times until I was so filled with blind rage from the mundane process of clearing bland rooms and waiting at doors that I exited to the lobby realised I received nothing for my time and uninstalled the game I'm sure the game is better with other players but it is infuriatingly unplayable alone
Overall this is a great game The gameplay mechanics feel smooth and well designed and the atmosphere is just mindblowing The only downside this game has is its price 40eurs even on steam sale for 30 for a game which requires four persons to play is just outrageous because its almost impossible to convince your squad to buy this game at this price 40bucks for four keys instead would be a good deal Rating Game mechanics 9/10 Graphics 7/10 Game atmosphere 9.5/10 Story 2/10 Price 1/10 Overall 5.7/10
Played the free weekend and tried to get my friends to play it with me Its not very engaging the game is practically a carry this item through the map full of monsters and back It is incredibly hard to go through it but the engaging elements are just missing so your not even sure why your playing GTFO after the first 4/5 matches can't recommend sadly
invandrar spel
Needs to be around 15 quid tops It's not worth 26 quid
Fun and Engaging requires good teamwork and coordination
Time limited content The Game There's 6 rundowns you've missed out on and will never get to play because you didnt play the game during the right period
hg
Randoms have the combined IQ of 40 making the game unplayable
THE worst thing about this game by far is the scope design I don't know who worked on it but they seriously effed up Most of the scopes and sight reticles do more to obscure your vision than to actually aid you in aiming I'd genuinely trade half of them for nothing as it'd at least let me see the centre of my screen And if those scopes/sights are part of the difficulty of the game somehow it's perhaps the worst design decision I've seen in a very long time Seriously please I'd rather take a musket iron sights Other than that it's pretty okay just don't play with the bots They're incompetent at best actually dangerous at worst
would recommend very nice game
Good game very fun RESPECT
You can choose Kurdish as main language at the LFG 10/10
played the free demo weekend fun with friends
One of the scariest experiences i ever had and i didn't even see the gameplay.Navigating trough menus and figuring out how to start coop or anything else will give me chills for the rest of my life.After 40 min of battling game menu and developing PTSD syndrome i exited the game and uninstaled
GTFO
scary game
Infinite loading screen in co-op sat for 15 minutes dropping with nothing never got a chance to even properly play the game but with bugs like these and it still clearly being an unfinished product I'm surprised it has the absurd price tag of 40
Amazing game but I highly recommend playing it with friends and mic on
I love beating funni deformed people with a bat and sledge hammer while also screaming
18.06.2022 free weekend This game is amazing I have played outlast etc but never has a game scared me like this This game was a whole new experience for me im really thankfull for the free weekend 10.12.2023 free weekend Once again im allowed to play this amazing game for free I had a good time but decided that i will not buy this game The game itself is fun and honestly worth the price but even during the playerspike free weekend the community is incredibly gatekeeping and i doubt that i will have a good time when all the other newbies are gone
first of all the difficulty is insanely unbalanced level 3 and 4 alarm on the 1st and 2nd map of the game i played this game with a friend and its impossible in a party in 2 people to complete a mission 5 hours of my life wasted guns do less damage than your fists there's barely any med packs and when 1 monster hits you it takes away 40 of your health witch is 2 medpacks over all this game is incredibly bad and unbalanced as you cant even choose the difficulty you want to play in and this game is not even worth 0/10
Glad I tried the free weekend I had it in my mind to buy this but held off On paper it's very sound I liked how they utilised the console But it's just not very polished I've encountered a handful of bugs rollback during match restarted lobbies and I've also seen how this game has a matchmaking filter system which is next to useless You NEED friends who also have GTFO it's not one of those other co-ops where you can gel by with randoms Unless you're lucky and get at least two people who know what they're doing the run is likely doomed It's a hard task for the devs to tackle but it is what it is I can see it becoming repetitive very quickly as well I can't recommend it although I'd like to it's just not something I would continue to play nor advocate
ok game
Only for hardcore players No saves need finish the level at once which is 1h long
Challenging cooperative focus truly encourages teamwork and verbal comms The game could use a bit more content and polish before I would pay the retail price Wishlisting/Follow for now

Juego ql de pana jueguenlo en squad sino no lo vale tanto
This gives me emotional physical and psychological pain Still fun tho
Realy like this game great co-op zombie/alian survival game/puzzle Good story so far
Even at the beginning the game is unreasonably hard Despite picking the best equipment for the job according to guides and having a full 4 man player team with full coordination and stealth even the starting missions are near impossible to complete B2 level was attempted by us at least 6 times and we were unable to complete it due to always running out of ammo and being faced with flying enemies The RNG is blatant when it comes to loot spawns and it is simply poorly done Theres absolutely a great game there the atmosphere and gunplay is fun when is there But there simply isn't enough ammunition to go around Free trial convinced me not to buy it For shame
The game is good but it is hard as hell
Oyun gibi zombie seven biri olarak bu oyunu en sona yazabilirim Zor alan mermiler yeterli can eriyor ee bu kadar durum zombilere taktisel ya da oyunun keyfini
The difficulty level is too high for a game where one person deciding to YOLO can ruin an entire game This coupled with LONG load times and the developers obsession with having you hold keys or mouse buttons even during the games startup makes trying to get a good game a painful slog These issues are only compounded by a very basic and buggy matchmaking system makes this a quick uninstall for me
no
Always one person has desync issues and basically can't see any mobs or help with objectives Avoid at all cost
I dont see a reason to play this over something like Deep Rock Galactic If you like running around confused from terminal to terminal and actually writting in some code then yes this game is pretty great But if that doesnt sound fun then you can get way more out of something like DRG I feel bad giving this game a downvote because ever since its first teaser I wanted to try it out but after half a round of 3 confused guys(machtmaking kicked out the 4th one walking around with some janky gunplay and janky enemies that are seemingly teleporting around I really cant recommend this And the levels seem to be non procedural so once you finished every quest you will just repeatedly play the same few missions I dont know if I missed something but that half an hour left such a weird taste in my mouth that I probably wont come back Especially since I expected it to be somewhat of a horror game but the only thing horror about this was the tutorial with its loud jumpscare noise when starting it up

Very easy really trust me lol
Some of the best co-op shooter experience I've had in a long time Kinda need a full group but with discord that can be easy to achieve
Was ist das denn eine kranke Selbst erfahrene Shooter Experten ist dieses Spiel viel zu schwer Die Gegner sind extrem schnell stark man kann kaum ausweichen und die Munnition ist so knapp dass man kaum vorran kommt Jeder Schuss muss sitzen sonst wars das Die Sentry Gun die einzige effektive Waffe hat einen stark begrenzten Munnitionsvorrat und kann nicht werden Bei einem Spiel welches so schwer ist dass selbst in der Ersten Mission beim ersten Feindkontakt 3 Versuche sind

from my short time playing this game its amazing def a cop if i had the money i have only played the free trial so far its hard but super fun
While I feel the gameplay is decently fun it gets so fucking boring after the fifth or 79828014890th time
Played over free weekend.Overpriced janky game The core loop is grind for cosmetics Expedition difficulty is artificial Basic functions don't work partying requires co-ordination over discord Matchmaking is quickplay Avoid unless you have a group of four willing to invest their time in it
2 game breaking bugs in 2 runs
AUUGHHH au bout de 10min
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
not fun
This game could've been good The tutorial felt really cool But multiplayer is laggy and buggy Literally couldn't interact with anything but doors after some time 3 people waiting for me to revive and I literally have no prompt Then the teleporting AI plus bullets not feeling like they register And getting attacked through cover I can't even recommend this at the low price of free weekend
This game may be enjoyable with friends but if you play with randoms it's impossible People are impatient and leave after the first defeat Also the game itself is unplayable loading takes a lot of time stuttering and freezes appear whenever mobs come in large quantities sometimes enemies are impenetrable even to hammer With specs higher than the required minimum and lowered resolution it's still a challenge to get it to work

a Great atmospheric game to play with friends

Lo considero un GRAN gioco sul serio il matchmaking tramite discord una delle cose brutte mai viste Macchinoso da morire rovina assolutamente quello che questo gioco ed il suo potenziale sul grande pubblico Dico sul serio Dev mettete l'opzione di scegliere o cambiatela inguardabile una roba del genere nel 2022
Its not hard Resource are just scarce so you need to try to save ammo Doesn't make it fun just annoying Checkpoint are few and far apart Clear rooms for 30 mins to die from something dumb and start all over
i got it when it was free and because my Friends also had it the best thing I've ever done
There is a certain finesse to making a game that is challenging and GTFO misses that If you want to force players to fight off a horde of enemies to progress don't make them bullet sponges that kill you in just a few hits I'm glad that the game had a free weekend so that I could save some money In addition to this There are only four tools at your disposal The weapons aren't very unique and are pea-shooters Stealth is easy as the AI is dumber than a rock including the AI on your team Environments are pretty bland Checkpoints are few and FAR between One thing the game does get right is sound design Your guns might not do any damage but they sure sound like they do
Ich Rieche hier ein sehr schlechtes Indie Game was einfach zu Tode gehyped wurde und Troztdem voller bugs ist Der Fallschaden ist auf ein anderen The Witcher lvl Der Nebel ist einfach Suppe Die KI ist der andere Rotz besonders die KI mates da diese einfach unsichtbar sind die Gegner wo wir grade bei Gegner sind einige laufen/Fliegen durch Meine Empfehlung bekommt es nicht da es Einfach vieel zu Teuer ist oder so ein mist dann kann ich mir lieber was auf IG holen Wenn ihr solche spiele dann versuchts doch mit Warhammer Vementide1/2 oder Deep Rock Galactic da steckt mehr drin
Game kept crashing constantly and when I finally booted it up I was stuck trying to figure out how to invite my friends and how and then how to add AIs Overall confusing game and not really my thing
nice graphics feels nice to play but poor gameplay loop got bored of it very fast
It's fun but hard Definitely need 3 friends or at least 3 people who know what they're doing to play it as the bots are incredibly dumb or get stuck or are just a pain to command at times With the fact you can't really casually play it co-op with one other person that means I don't recommend it You can spend hours doing your best but one tiny mistake means you lose all your health or use up just a bit too much ammo and then your run is screwed Also due to the fact old content is gone it's also a bit meh

Free weekend showed that this game don't worth the price tag grab only on max discount There is a lot of good stuff in the game but sadly it loses in all key departments No incentive to farm just clear everything once and wait for an update or forget about the game Repetitive game loop Overall quality of the game doesn't match the price tag no matter of pros game just feels clunky Buggy don't stand in checkpoints while carrying something Fall damage never couldn't understand game disgners when it comes to fall damage thresholds for it are unjustified and there is many places with wonky coliders where you can slide fall get pushed Changing any video settings causes your game to drop frames for couple of minutes Animation staggering on enemies enemy can be in hurt animation and midway this animation can immediately shoot/hit you Game difficulty doesn't scale to group size in any shape or form Amazing atmosphere immersion to the max Game just looks pretty Juicy sound design Interface is great but takes some time to get used to Big amount of options customization if it's there you can toggle/adjust/change it Pretty good optimization on maximum settings

Played for free weekend not enough loot scattered around the map for 1 person let alone 3-4 if you play with friends poo poo ca ca dont waste time
The fuckin fog
Thank god for the free weekend
Tried it didn't enjoy it
Muito mal otimizado em algumas dificil conseguir manter 4 jogadores o final da partida pq quase sempre um acaba saindo O jogo bem balanceado Se vc jogar com 4 jogadores ou solo tu vai encontrar muitos inimigos da mesma forma Tem um bug que faz vc conseguir interagir com nada ou seja vc fica sem poder usar em vc subir escadas reviver aliados Quando esse bug acontece tu pode quitar da partida pq tu vira um inutil
podczas darmowego weekendu i gra mi nie z ta pozycja jest ciekawsza W moim przypadku do party najpierw 1 osoby potem 2 ostatecznie z i 2 botami Ja rozumiem gra ma straszna ale to prawie nic nie bardziej irytuje nawet lepsza latarka daje po pewnym czasie tak nic nie nie wiem czy jej bateria wyczerpuje czy to bug bo po i podniesieniu jest przez w chyba do czasu zmiany broni W misji z noworodkiem pod koniec trzeba klucz nie a trzeba tego noworodka do maszyny na to sporo czasu zanim to a bot mu

ambientazione molto gradevole e suggestiva interessante il sistema di sopravvivenza e gestione risorse Ho trovato meno meno ben fatto il movement del personaggio che si utilizza non trovo intelligente mettere consumabili torrette e armi nella rotazione con la rotella del mouse difficile inoltre l accesso a cure come medkit l uso del controller limitato in alcune situazioni in definitiva un gioco carino che non vale i soldi che richiede a parer mio
Dachte es wird son bisschen space horror coop Falsch Bist permanent stuck mit gegnern hast kaum muni deine waffen machen kaum bis keinen schaden du wirst geflutet mit mobs und der TEAMDAMAGE den die bots dir antun ist nicht von dieser welt checkpoints sind ass schaltest nichmal was frei sondern nur so skins oder kleine modifier die einmalig verbraucht werden ne runde wow spielst das zeug dich durch den nen einmaligen 5 melee dmg increase mit der linken faust bitte was ist das Der kram ist sogar gone wenn du es nicht zu nem checkpoint geschafft hast Amazing 0/10 nichtmal im Free-Weekend einen Versuch wert Rip die Leute die da reingezahlt haben
Linux hackerman simulator
This game is absolutely amazing but is completely unplayable using ai allies I had 1 friend so I only had one ai teammate following me around and he was responsible for half of the damage i took while playing because of friendly fire Apart from that theyre also made intentionally way too dumb for a game this unforgiving Their immediate awareness is lacking and it feels like your alone fighting a horde with how much they hold back on shooting This was only the second level and we had to give up because they made it impossible I get that this is intended to be with real players but this ridiculous Just remove bots all together if theyre going to be this bad
Like a lot of the ideas checkpoints are very punishing though Doesn't really feel accomplishing either as you don't really unlock anything Menus and the general theme are also confusing Im really glad I played it in the free weekend as I would've definitly regreted paying for this Sorry I really want to like this game but I just cant
Shin GTFO
nice
Is it a good game YES The gunplay and horror aspects are excellent fog guns voice BGM all add to the feel and unique experience that is hard to come across Does it have severe matchmaking issues YES painfully so Take a game that is hard add 4 players that are supposed to corporate Ok possible Take a game and constantly matchmakes you to people in other parts of the world while doing the above impossible With close lived friends this game is possible in multiplayer but with this current match making system which by the way as of the time of writing it is a free weekend so it has more then enough people to pick from to make good hosts of game lobbies 4 out of the 5 lobby matches were so laggy I could not play the game I even had one match where i would press E to pick up an item and i got that item 5 FULL seconds later I also had another match out of that 5 that i was trying to figure out what was hitting me and the enemies were hitting me a full 2 seconds ahead of visually showing me in game and when i tried to shoot them it also took that 2 seconds to respond and kill them In short it really needs a lobby system like Deep Rock Galactic and until that happens your going to get negative reviews no matter how good the core game is This is one of those issues i saw in Alpha long ago that was never fixed and if you happen to take a look around all the successful copop PVE style games they have a Solid lobby system I just don't fully understand why that is not a core function of this game when its focused on HEAVY cooperation and communication For now I cannot recommend GTFO based on my experience However if you have a group of friends that will play it and are regionally near you it can be an amazing time
might be fun with a couple of friends but solo it's a bore and matchmaking is a disaster EVEN ON A FREE WEEKEND What's even more a disaster is the UI like holy shit get rid of it

Today I helped revive a baby that's stuck in a pod while fighting death monsters that leak black liquid mmmmmmmmMMMMM where have I seen that before I think it's in a videogame of some kind Death Starring Dead Standing Die Beaching I forgot Either way it does not have anywhere near as much depth or complexity as that game for the same price You don't choose what you're playing you play what the devs chose for you also known as a RUNDOWN It is a campaign a series of levels limited in time You don't get to choose what to play you only play the levels offered to you in order levels that will eventually disappear Imagine having so little content and removing it regularly Let your players play the game Imagine if literally any other game did that Liked a specific mission Want to replay it Fuck you and die you have to play the specific RUNDOWN of the month Sad so many levels down the drain just because of some silly rotation Also it's a paid advertisement for Discord No Discord No players The gameplay if you do find players is a sluggish L4D2 except meleeing is rubbish I have a lot of respect for GRIN/OVERKILL/10cc but this ain't it Chief
sexy ass on the monsters ngl
This is balls hard impossibly hard For context there are five depth levels determined by letters from A to E E being the hardest We did B1 and with a full team we couldn't finish it EVEN with the checkpoints which we used three times at different points Quite close to the end of the level we didn't have enough resources to finish it we knew our chances were slim Don't tell me to use boosters as they are one-use and getting one requires you to finish the level and i'm not grinding A1 and get people that are going to do the same for a 10 chance boost to finish B1 The game even takes away Artifact heat which I assume is chances of getting pieces of these boosters every time you finish the same level There's only one A mission by the way I like this game I almost exclusively play PvE games but who the hell is this game for I can only imagine people with surgical precision like speedrun-worthy people This is only an example this isn't a game you speedrun being able to finish these levels And you gotta find three more people like them EDIT I just saw this trailer and i'll never get to play the DESERT SANDSTORM LEVEL AND THE TENTACLE WALL LEVEL because of its difficulty and how the game vaults levels like Destiny 2 Someone tell me this hasn't been removed Here's the more detailed quote of my experience with B1 yesterday We did B1 with a full team on Discord synchronizing our takedowns constantly using the Bio-tracker sharing ammo and health evenly using a mine closed door combo when possible Though there are few closeable doors and the hordes barely go through those going to the alarm disablers as soon as possible and we had about 10 ammo each of us when reaching the Neo-nate whatever-device we're using this level and we took care of the flying enemies before we triggered the alarm and we still failed We were gods by any OTHER coop game standards but they are not enough for this game and we still have three other depth levels to go through We can't even play a different B mission because they're locked by finishing B1 first By the way I played the Alpha years ago with one of the same people which was restricted to C depth and that mine-layer/Barricading C-foam combo takes like half a horde away we still couldn't finish it and had to restart three times from the beginning September 12th 2022 It just went up in price for 33 more in my country I'm NEVER buying this November 13th 2022 Old Rundowns are cycling every couple of weeks good Rundown 1.0 has no checkpoints bad
Really is a good game for multiplayer
Pretty sweet that a game does co-op as a focus I love co-op
Matchmaking not good Gun play not good Confusing Boring Thank God for a free weekend so I didn't have to waste money on this
Nein das Spiel macht kein Ja es ist schwer aber was mir gar nicht ist die Sounds der Waffen auch das Handling wirkt billig Metzelstimmung kommt da nicht auf finde ich Echt gute Idee aber das Geld definitiv nicht
Wysoki poziom team play jest kluczem Bardzo polecam trudna gra
oyun sanki ilk kez berbat Orda dur alarm yerinin dur dolana kadar bekle berbat bir combat ile avla 1 gram zevk vermiyor gizlilik tatmin edici 1 unsur bile yok ve sana ilk 30dk dan geliyor uzaktan vuruyo ve medkit zor bulunuyo ve 2 bile genellikle oyunda
Boring game with simple repetitive levels The best part is the gun action but compared to other games it sucks hard I played it on free weekend would never waste a single penny on this trash game
to much bugs
Unfair and incomplete tutorial Very very resource demanding I quit after much effort in configuring graphics to make it playable there is no general low overall setting you have to set manually everything and then when I played I got confused by the tutorial So no I cannot recommend it

Very noob friendly Good for casual fun night with friends Solo play is also super fun 10/10 will buy if my brain is broken
To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day Hardly spoke to folks around him didn't have too much to say No one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip It was early in the morning when he rode into the town He came riding from the south side slowly lookin all around He's an outlaw loose and runnin came a whisper from each lip And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more One and nineteen more Now the stranger started talkin made it plain to folks around Was an Arizonia ranger wouldn't be too long in town He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red After Texas Red Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red But the outlaw didn't worry men who tried before were dead Twenty men had tried to take him twenty men had made a slip Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street Folks were watchin from their windows Every body held their breath They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death About to meet his death There was twenty feet between them When they stopped to make their play And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered round There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground Oh he might have went on livin but he made one fatal slip When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip Big iron big iron Oh he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip big Iron by Marty Robbins

i lost my fucking mind playing this please save yourself
The user interface with the double text is absolutely terrible
Great game if you know what you are doing
Game itself is great Matchmaking is crap Crap ton of Sync problems Matchmaking and Sync is working with Flextape instead of using metal x metal etc compounents
First Impression Very repetitive like literally go there type this go there type that etc stand on a circle infront of a door defend go to the end or start stand on a circle to finish Very buggy some bugs would prevent from going futher Bad hit reg Very overpriced even on sale for 5 sure why not there are way too many good coop games for cheaper Good thing is that it forces teamplay sometime resulting in a cool team moment But if none knows what to do you gonna have to look for someone who does cuz some of the stuff is not very clear and people will run around wondering what to do
Rainbow Six Extraction if the devs spent like a year on it before release Horror Shooter where the horror is lost on bland map and enemy design The shooter portion isn't very good either unless u like slow build-ups to fights that end in 20 seconds that also feature bad enemy hit-boxes and behavior Lack of matchmaking is a wild choice that should've been fixed in the first month Teammate AI is fine I guess They will follow you in the straightest line that they can and will ultimately get in the way of your shots in most encounters but they will kill all of the enemies for you with ease Which is their only real purpose they're not really capable of actually helping you with the half-assed puzzles they are but you have to command them to do specifics and it basically just wastes your time There are ideas in this that are cool The terminal system is very unique for a game of this type and I think it's implemented in a pretty good way The stealth aspect is interesting as well in the same way that it was in R6Extraction but it also fails in a lot of the same ways with it Games like this just don't serve stealth very well in my opinion and maybe that opinion is limiting but like It's just sorta boring it's like a difficulty crutch that makes the entire game trivial because the enemies are the only threat to your success and you can fight maybe 15 of them at a time max because things have to make sense for stealth it just makes the game feel like a half-baked combination of killing floor and payday where any of the charm of either of those games is completely absent Press button stand in circle carry thing to thing type something in the terminal pick this up kill 5 enemies in between all of these actions Sure it's a loop but it's a fucking grating one ty steam for letting me play this one free after forgetting about it a week after its original announcement in 2017 17y/o lily would have probably liked this game more unfortunately
Free weekend experience What I liked Immersion dark enviroments trying to be a team-game What didnt work as expected Unpolished/bugged game in a playable state Very bad and frustrating experience getting a good matchup with voice comms Gameplay is linear and gets repetitive very fast Scripted alarm doors where enemies always come from the same 2 directions Noone is specialized and everyone fulfills the same role in your team Weapons feel unbalanced Enemies teleporting/lagging/desynced because the host is located on the other side of the planet Minigames in form of terminals/hacking no depth or fun useability The tactical map barely used Notes disappear
A very complex game that requires a very high level of cooperation from each member of the team Honestly if you try to play with random players you can't play it or you can play with a high level of handicap difficulty 10 Chambers you did a good job but please do the falling damage lesser 9/10 from a player who played very little of this game
esta absurdamente mal optimizado cumplo todos los requisitos con todo en bajo se van los tirones y va a bajos fps Segundo el juego no deja jugar solo y te obliga a ir con gente desconocida tarda muchisimo en emparejarte Y tiene muchos bugs al comienzo tuve un bug que no me dejaba emparejar por que se iba al menu Y cuando llegas no explica nada te sueltan ahi Si estan buscando un LEFT 4 DEAD o un KILLING FLOOR 2 que si son divertidos de matar oleadas de zombies no es lo que buscas demasiado tactico y complicado para mi gusto Los bichos infinitos te matan de 3-4 golpes Y obliga a los a estar juntos en una zona para desactivar alarmas
So much wasted potential I've wanted to get into this game since it originally popped on Steam but the lack of any kind of matchmaking or server access put me off in the beginning I like many of you do not have the time to troll through Discord channels to find players Finding other players in an online/co-op only game is a serious fundamental that should have been there from day 1 Having tried it over the June 2022 Free Weekend now that it has been out of Early Access for a good 6 months AND has matchmaking very disappointing still in terms of finding active players I spent most of my time in Lobbies that went nowhere or simply couldn't find anyone at all for a good handful of minutes I did play a few games where other players simply left whether they got bored or lagged out it is hard to tell I did have one match that started really well but somehow my connection to whoever was hosting froze out the only way to exit that match was to exit to desktop which raises the question how many people that just disappear crashed/froze/lagged out I was unable to actually finish a co-op match My experiences resulted in teams dying and then ultimately disbanding As for the game itself the tutorial is decent enough to teach you some basic concepts There is a bit of figure it out to level objectives though Kind of reminded me of Destiny 2 before it became another mindless MMO grindfest where the game will not overtly help lazy players that expect follow beacon interact with NPC accept quest follow beacon kill 6 rabbits follow beacon receive reward from NPC repeat style hand holding The game itself as a collection of mechanics is a very good at its core That mix of stealthing severely limited ammunition and bursts of swarm attacks horde is a massive exaggeration there are never THAT many enemies it is ultimately a really good game with one massive flaw Combat feels weak Firearms feel a little underpowered and the spread seems very excessive considering you are so heavily handicapped with limited ammo and even more limited ammo/heallth resupply packs to find and share amongst 4 players Also you do not get a real sense of hitbox variations on the monsters Smashing a warhammer style melee weapon into what appears to be a monster's face sometimes feels like it has the same damage impact as hitting their leg There were a couple of times I felt like I accomplished a headshot style charged-melee blow that took one of the lesser monsters out in a single blow only to find the exact same move in the exact same region later was not enough The combat simply does not feel satisfying A real shame because the visual atmosphere is really good The weird element of interacting with terminals and typing in command lines is also a unique technical touch it is a smart little mechanic that provokes the player to actually do more than just crawl around and kill stuff and keeps a part of your brain active that you normally do not use in shooters Seriously if you find the terminals/typing to be a tedious mechanic sell your PC Just because Microsoft and their Malware called Windows is pushing new idiot boundaries in dumbing down their O/S doesn't make it okay to be an idiot burn your PC buy a Mac and transition over to a safe space for your gaming on a Nintendo Switch Make no mistake there are 2 and only 2 issues with this game A very barebones and incomplete matchmaking system which literally makes it difficult to actually PLAY and a combat system that feels like everything is so NERFed that it makes you care less and less about WANTING to play Implement a proper way for players to connect with each other how is joining an active game not even an option hell just C&P how L4D1 worked we're talking 14 year old netcode concepts that worked really well Fix that and tweak the guns and this game could be worth some solid hours of our time pursuing punishing reruns
Perfeito simplesmente perfeito que jogo melhor coop
amazing game
GTFO CBT THX FAM
Tried it over the free weekend thanks devs and I want to like it but it's just.dull The trailers make it look 100 times more fun than it actually is bland enviroments pretty generic gunplay it just doesn't suck you in granted it maybe improves as it goes but I just couldn't get through the first level without already feeling I'd seen the meat of it and it was rather slim pickings
My friend was screaming in gamechat to troll then we all got hoinky boinked
I love amazon so this is a big learning experience since i have not worked for amazon
Unplayable with random newbies especially when they think that this is L4Dead clone and starting blasting everyting they see
yes

Bin nur am anfang bin etwas das es kein Permadeath gibt aber ist schon so mit Randoms schwer genug XD Ich finds geil
Absolute garbage the game has graphics meant for PS1 Boring af and progess is the same

I think this game did good to create the horror sci-fi feels However I find it hard for this game to be appealed for the majority due to the slow pace realistic art direction and the world feels empty The objectives lacks clarity it difficult for new players to understand what they should do next besides running around back and forth resulted in the slow pace which again not appealing for the majority The levels are big and lighting feels creepy but it feels lifeless Pick-up items are always in the lockers/boxes Lack of blood trails and dead bodies the level feels too clean Enemies are usually spawned beforehand or during defending an objective you can easily predicts the event unfold no surprise or jump scare
Un juego cooperativo que pondra a prueba tu estrategia y un poco de terror pasar de la calma al combate frenetico en un abrir y cerrar de ojos Cambian los mapas cada ciertos meses con lo cual no se hace aburrido ni repetitivo Completar todo en cada rundown es muy satisfactorio cuando lo consigues
Poor gunplay poor stealth mechanics poor visuals terrible UI design Never again Thank you free weekend Literally walk 5 feet stand at a door walk 5 feet stand at a lock walk 5 feet stand at a locked door Repeat
Didn't play many time but Matchmaking is not good cant usually find more than 2 other players 3/4 Takes a lot to load There is almost no lore Why am I going down there Not many weapons to choose ammo system is in Little player customization Stealth is big no possibility of silenced weapons only melee Feels like an Early Access 0.5

i tested the game in a free weekend and i'm glad at it cause i don't won't to buy this game it feels like an early access game glitches like you hold a questitem during a checkpoint and if all died and respawn on the checkpoint you have the questitem duplicated and can't throw it away gamecrashes can't join lobby etc if this problems are fixed perhabs i buy this game but not at this gamestadium
Tedious for the sake of being tedious
This game sucks Would never play again
Game frequently bugs players randomly disconnect and cannot reconnect forcing you to restart the level checkpoints are sometimes corrupted leaving you after dying in state where you cannot continue forcing you to restart the level
Very confusing interface for new players and no built in lobby matching system cant find games with friends without a 3rd party program Otherwise pretty fun gameplay for a while but gets repetitive quite fast
payday
The game in of itself is good gun play is good stealth gets kinda boring after 3 runs it's green light red light stealth The matchmaking is fucking horrible you select English and Voice only you'll get matchmade with Chinese people people who don't own mics people who treat this game like it's Call of Duty or worse people who once you're near the end of a 4h run they disconnect and you have to start all over If you have friends grab the game if not GTFO
Fun concept to a game Downside is that the matchmaking is only to search with randoms based on discord Could use some more variation of how the game plays out Otherwise fun
Game ok graphics ok gameplay meh run around 95 of the game 1 shoot 4 place turrets
Should i get an eye exam if i think the text in this game is too small Overall the game is nice to buy if it's on sale
looks good but pretty meh doesn't give a clear objective so i end up going round till i find where we are meant to be
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY Playing this game during its free weekend and all its issue just shows Been told about the developers and how they don't care where they don't patch out bugs until the map gets rotated out Apparently they also managed to take 2 vacations back to back with one week of work in between Anyways Pros Fun for the first couple of hours Good community Cons Not worth its original price tag worth 10-$20 at most really unpolished buggy and have devs that gives no fucks Will only give you a couple hours of entertainment Matchmaking system that does not work either you can't get anyone or the lobby only fills to 3 people if you try to matchmake for the fourth and a fourth joins it will kick the host Had a stage with 4 active squads of 3 through matchmaking at least that I know from matchmaking for a fourth that was looking for a 4th but cannot do so because the matchmaking system doesn't work Only way around this is through finding a squad through discord Bugs encountered in 8 hours of game play Infinite waves on the last doors to get the 9 objectives C1 Rundown 7 they must have copied and pasted a door that is bugged and when it is opened you get infinite waves of 4 mobs until you complete the objective and must extract It would have been fine with just 4 mobs but there are 3 of these doors you must open so you end up getting swarmed by infinite waves of 12 mobs that you must melee The door is not marked as an alarm and is just a normal door needing power cells Unable to drop objective items if you pick them up and end up using a checkpoint must rejoin by closing the game and of course do it again if you die and use the checkpoint Unable to use utility if hit by mobs when picking them up Note this is only from 8 hours of playing the game on the free weekend Devs that give no fucks can be seen from the fact the game is buggy as hell and the dev's refusal to fix them and call them errors and not bugs to downplay the issue This game has also been out for ages and the matchmaking still doesn't work If the host disconnects you will be sent back to the start or to the checkpoint So you better hope your host doesn't disconnect an hour into the run Also getting hit through walls and through cover is a given
Cool Game it feels good and looks good
Very intense Sneaking horror game that will s**t you out in zero warning if going little too fast or loud not for CoD runners i played on FREE WEEKEND hence got free but i WILL get this after
GTFO 3 5 10
scammed me for my time
404 Hours Review Not Found
It was boring as all hell Ran around for n hour to do a bunch of objectives and fight hordes when a door says fuck you but the thing I enjoyed the most was fucking around with consoles The core gameplay is niche at best and while it has a lot of depth it is not a game I can enjoy or recommend to my friends I am thankful I played it over a free weekend cuz I wouldn't be able to refund it with those 3 hours of gameplay I got otherwise
Juegazo para perder el tiempo se tarda media hora en hacer los objetivos y cuando por fin lo consigues te salen 50 bichos y te parten el culo Recomendable si te gusta perder el tiempo
difficult af but fun
Fiyat konusunda gaddar olan GTFO Eski hissettiren ve yeterli olmayan mekanikleri bir oyun gerek atmosfer gerek atmosferi olarak ve mekanikler hantal ve eski hissettiriyor da gibi es maximum 80 TL verilip ve meze denilebilecek hafif doyurucu bir oyun
I cannot recommend this game simply because you cannot really play it without going to Discord to try to put together a group Otherwise good luck trying to actually play the game As soon as someone drops from the lobby there is no way to get another to fill the slot so everyone drops and tries again This basically leads to an endless loop where one player will almost immediately drop for whatever reason and you just cannot get a game going I tried for close to 20 minutes At one point everyone even readied up and we just sat at the Waiting for Host for several minutes followed by the inevitable dropped teammate A co-op multiplayer game should have a good matchmaking and lobby service Apparently this game's solution is Get a group on Discord
XD
This game is amazing you will feel the adrenaline rushing through your veins when the alarms start blaring and you will feel the huge amount of satisfaction when you get through and complete an expedition Though yes this game is hard and you will die a lot
this game is boring
gameplay is fun but lobby and matchmaking is horrendous and time consuming to the point where its not even worth playing it A shame sense the gameplay is so much fun
I enjoy the game but I hate the developers
Good game very fun with friends that work well together Its a hard game tho so keep that in mind
1675 300
fun as hell with friends even more fun with strangers who don't communicate lol
Poopie
Near full stealth game that forces you to go loud half the time and ultimately didn't design the process to be fun just hard Pros Decent graphics Decent theme voice acting Decent gunplay Cons Overly punishing design Enemies near impossible to kite Boring slow movement Plays story dialogue whilst you're getting zerged by enemies and trying to coordinate with team The entire gameplay is just very slow Very uninspired stealth gameplay without much to it The way the network is setup keeps disconnecting me even tho my internet is fine The game mostly feels like a puzzle game rather than a horror/shooter game and really forces you to play in a very specific way with very little player freedom

Tried this for the free weekend and the aesthetic and core loop are really cool but sadly the game isn't very fun due to problems with the matchmaking system I've been trying for the past 30 minutes or so to do the following Make a lobby Invite a friend Match make the remaining two slots Every time it there's like a 50 chance per slot we match a player into for it to disconnect my friend and put him into matchmaking with other people leaving me in a lobby by myself The one game I did get into from matchmaking solo was pretty cool all of us were talking on voice and working together but then when one player had to leave it failed to change hosts and booted me back to the main menu out of the lobby and therefore I couldn't even continue with or re-match make with the players I had met in that game I appreciate the frustration of gaining negative reviews on Steam but this is a huge roadblock to being able to enjoy the game if this was fixed the game would most likely be really enjoyable to play If you've got enough friends to fill out the lobby without having to rely on this system check it out otherwise I can't recommend it
1-2
Lleno de errores
Jogao da porra sem amigos triste e mas o Discord tanto BR quanto gringo do jogo bem movimentado a braba la que tu acha um Squad
Just no Great graphics sound overall design of locations and monsters But the game is too hard finding items is very boring and tedious maps are repetitive and all that makes the game just not fun to play
No UI scaling terrible hold-to-confirm menus no brightness setting means that due to my window not having curtains I can not see anything Great presentation though I really felt like I was in a dystopia
Fun if you have four friends at all times who know what they're doing Great atmosphere Weapons and tools are cool and unique looking Loud Gameplay is fun Fun time killer Puzzles can be fun Horrific if your playing with any randoms Sometimes samey looking levels Lack of Variety in weapons Stealth Gameplay can get repetitive for some Mission rewards are pretty un-rewarding Missions can sometimes take too long for some 5.5/10 Unfortunatelly cannot reccomend maybe if it was five or ten euro then yes but anything higher unfortunately no
The Game suffers from lack of ingame player feedback Getting hit feels like being hit by a feather but you take damage like a truck hit you the shooting is lackluster and also missing feedback Enemies insta turn around and such the immersion is neat but it get's broken fast by the guy over the comms in the first 2 missions who is loud as fuck and is just a distraction Checkpoins are straight up broken you spawn with carry objectives stuck in your hands so you have to hard restart the mission you sometimes end up with less resources and enemies that respawn next to the checkpoint
Played this on the free weekend This game feels unfinished the guns feel so clunky and sluggish most weapons are terrible/inaccurate Game feels like a chore missions feel empty and repetitive I played this with friends and we all experienced a sound bug where everything went muffled All and all this game is just terribly executed with the gun play and the levels This games title is the exact representation of this review GTFO
The game it self is fun but it gets repetitive fast get it on sale The fog is a joke and should be removed
Game breaking bugs stops our progress with my mates
dogshit game just stand doing nothing most of the time
12 B2
Dont even try it It could have been so nice but its a piece of crap Lobbys buggy and shity It seems that nearly no one is playing it anymore beside the free weekend commnunity I love the concept but nothing more
My muuuum
A ver empezando por el echo de que jugar solo es bastante complicado ya que si estas enfermo como yo que desactivo los bots para morir cada vez que suene una alarma porque a los enemigos se la suda el arma que lleves aunque los mates de una luego toca recargar y si a eso le sumamos que el personaje tiene un retraso severo y no es capaz de recargar mientras corre el cuerpo a cuerpo tampoco es una porque los bichos te pegan desde su casa y claro hay que ver que para desactivar la alarma tienes que estar dentro de una zona bastante aparte casi obliga a ir en sigilo lo cual no entiendo para que sirve despejar las zonas si luego salen la misma cantidad ingente de bichos en las alertas Por otro lado si quieres jugar con gente lo que tardas en encontrar una partida es absurdo intente entrar en una partida y en de 40 minutos no he conseguido jugar con nadie la idea del juego no esta mal y es entretenido pero por el momento no me termina de convencer supongo que cada uno pierde el tiempo como quiere xD
I tried this game during free weekend and I'm glad I did Honestly there's seemingly very little depth in the game and the mechanics are actively trying to ruin all the fun you might have The fog is just the most annoying thing ever I can't for the life of mine figure out how these weapons and hitboxes work because they sure as hell don't shoot where I aim The A1 map was not too hard and had no fog so we managed to get through it without major issues I actually had fun playing it and was looking forward to jumping in the next one but B1 just cranked up the sheer volume of creatures and that combined with the wonky gunplay horrible opaque fog and scouts just kept stomping us We did play with 2 bots that were not very helpful to say the least standing in the line of fire only willing to use melee weapons you know the usual but since the game was intended for 4 player groups I guess that's really just nitpicking I understand that this game is meant to be hard but I'd like to see a point in trying without having to subject myself to torture for 3 hours all for a backpack skin All that being said the graphics sounds and the atmosphere are amazing and very spooky it's a shame the game was just not fun for me Do I recommend this game Idk I played some games that are made to humble you but at least they have redeeming values that reward the grind and effort I don't see how this would and therefor I don't see a point in playing it personally If you like a(n unfair challenge have a full group and don't mind spending money sure go ahead Otherwise you're probably better off with a pizza or something
Me lo he descargado para jugarlo en el que es gratuito lo mejor que pude hacer porque te das cuenta de que todos los comentarios negativos sobre este juego son ciertos y les comento empiezo por lo positivo y acabo con lo negativo Positivo La estrategia para alcanzar tus objetivos Negativo El sistema de emparejamiento es una basura tarda mucho en emparejar y si quieres que te emparejen con siempre vas a ir con guiris Es un juego muy los recursos son escasos y los randoms con los que juegas no tienen ni idea y se piensan que es el COD esto y puedes ponerte a pegar tiros desde el principio si empiezan mejor salte de la partida porque no vas a pasar de 2 puntos de control Lo peor de todo LOS BUGS tengo unas 6 horas de juego de las cuales en de 2 de ellas he tenido problemas el juego peta me puedo mover y oir a los pero no puedo abrir puertas ni atacar enemigos ni nada se queda todo congelado Coges el objetivo principal de la y luego no puedes soltarlo con lo que 1 o 2 jugadores menos etc etc etc El juego es extremadamente caro para lo que es 30 euros en descuento 40 sin el descuento es un robo para un juego con tantos problemas estar free to play El sistema de recompensas en una basura si pasas un nivel te dan aleatorios pero ya les aviso son malos para el esfuerzo que supone de pegarme siglos con los guiris para pasarme el primer nivel En el nivel b1 es donde surgen los bugs ya me es imposible jugarlo porque SIEMPRE SE ME CONGELA EL JUEGO Que yo sepa este juego hace bastante con lo que puedo deducir que no le dedican ni un de esfuerzo a solucionar los problemas que tiene el juego En resumen ni de broma y lo digo en serio NI DE BROMA se gasten ese dineral para este juego no vale nada la pena tristemente Los desarrolladores no son nada cuidadosos y lo tienen super abandonado Si esperas a que mejore mejor vete a otro juego porque este no sirve para nada

GTFO unity 2019.4_21f1_b76dac84db26
i like dick
Hold to activate in all menus and even dropdowns(yeah no idea what big brain could come up with that ingame terminal that force you to actually type every command I have more than enough of that crap at work thank you very much game sessions that can go up to several hours straight with no way to save your progress to come back later even at checkpoints no map edge scrolling
Press and hold the game EVERY interaction is press and hold Even in the goddamn menus You can't turn this off Press and hold to pick item Press and hold to use item Press and hold to put item back The terminal view hides the objectives names that you actually need to type No autosprint It's like every decision was made to make the game as inconvenient as possible Stay the hell away P.S The name GTFO is a perfect fit
oyununu goruntu berbat goruntu bok almakdan
yes
Tried the free weekend.I don't understand what's the big deal about this game it's repetitive boring missions are incredibly long up to 2 hours the map looks the same all the time the missions are confusing the dialogues incredibly long had to lower the volume for them the terminals are difficult to manage efficiently and they are similar to other screens you find all around so the map is poor of details and they are just repeated over and over and it's not even an horror game the worst part though is the MATCHMAKING if you start a mission and someone leaves it will be IMPOSSIBLE for others to join an ongoing session you have to rely on bots there is no depth in this game you have a bunch of weapons a bunch of tools cosmetics and that's it the ping system is inaccurate and weird you can't even pinpoint a specific point on a map or a general direction you are looking at you can pin just general items for example if you find a medpack in a locker it will pinpoint the locker and not the item inside it that you want to ping in a game in which information is CRUCIAL this is a BIG let down and if you plan on talking good luck with that Many people join english speaking servers and they can't even understand or talk you also find lots of toxic people a friendly team member killed me just because I was checking for literally one minute the bind keys at this state this game is not worth more than 15 euros The good part is the atmosphere and the sounds
Fun Game
Didn't like it felt meh

aka BeI
played it for 17 minutes it was free it was terrible it was boring and janky uninstalled I would be PISSED if I had spent money on this crap
i feel like i'm in a Hentai with the amount of times i got smashed by those tounge/tentacles and oh boy i sure do like to get smashed Sent from a salt mine
nice
Jugando el finde gratis 2 partidas a la ni gente hay y en la noche una partida pero literalmente empezaron a disparar a penas y el juego no va luego se todo y los bichos no se si no tienen amigos para jugar no lo compren
This game needs an extraction pvp mode like hunt showdown 100
Cant recommend this game for this price at all Better off as a free game with all these issues Lag spikes when waves of enemies spawn Lag spikes when rooms opened Lag spikes when waiting for checkpoint scans Audio issues when too many sounds/entities present in room Bug with mine launcher that doesnt detonate them at all Cheaters spamming ammo boxes/fog repellents/foam grenades Queuing with English as primary language puts you with people that don't speak it at all
Well-made game fun to play with other gamers
Tutorial is long and boring First smg is weaker than melee and very inaccurate Using med kit or ammo pouches requires holding down a button for 3seconds Same goes for opening doors let alone bioscanning yourself for every other door They are trying to achieve slow paced gameplay but this is not the way to do it Save your pennies and go for something like Rainbow Six Extraction if you want slow paced tactical alien shenanigans edit forgot to mention cancer UI and menus
I tried to play on free weekend I started the tutorial alone seemed O.K I got to the control point got the message on screen game saved I went out After I tried to play with friends I started my game and it did not continue at the checkpoint but started over No save in this game I and the friends managed to join I was not a host and at start of the cinematic the game just closed without any error any warning Well I re-joined and this time not only the game closed but the proper Steam shut down also OMG No way Then I tried to play alone again This time the game opened the campaign lobby I started the mission with bots It was about neonite Hacking the doors is annoying chore Bots run ahead and kill the enemies Amazing You need to type on PC inside the game to get info I wanted to consult something on net put the game on task bar and I could not open any browser no one worked Then the game closed again with the warning GTFO stopped respond OMG Many thanks to permit to try the game It almost broke my PC
Unity Python'a 3
Can't finish lvl 1 get killed by teammates,AFK people 80 of people no mic nice game but dog community
this game too muchhh fun to play more scary i thought the grahpic too much good this game about you and teammate to communication each other to complete a mission you need more real friend to need play this game not recommend to use bot or other player from other place because you'll make mission complete so hard
sleepers go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Played it for free Very repetitive and still buggy Overpriced doo doo Again
Very atmospheric.It rewards careful slow gameplay
Check point bugged Once carry or put sentry after checkpoint not able to press E
have Bug and 1 carry cannot shoot
TL;DR 45 30
boring game just like rainbow six extraction I don't know what else to say
100 20 2 200
3 20
wish I had friends
Simply put why did I wait so long This game is worth every penny Thank you to everyone who made this game plays the game and the discord community A MUST PLAY hands down The videos are so true Yes it's hard yes you HAVE TO work as a team but it is very satisfying just to finish the first level
Simillar to Left4dead You just have to be extremely careful watch your step at any point in time and be very calculated If you fail to do so you will become worm food Hard to play alone friends are recommended

Cannot matchmake for shit Dont wanna have to use discord

dont buy this trash matchmaking is crap you play with dumb fucking idiots and you cant even sneak past them literally you crouch and they still see you garbage game
Empfohlen WENN man 3 Personen/Freunde hat mit denen man zusammen spielen kann Wenn man mit Random Personen spielt ich es nicht empfehlen Eigentlich ganz cool das Spiel Das Problem ist aber das gleiche wie in all den anderen spielen in denen man auf Teamwork angewiesen ist Man hat selten eine Gruppe von Leuten die zusammen arbeitet Wenn man also nicht gerade mindestens 3 Freunde hat mit denen man das zusammen spielen kann ich davon abraten Wenn man eine Gruppe von Leuten hat kann ich es sehr empfehlen In den 3 Versuchen die ich gestartet hab konnte ich die erste Mission nicht mal zur schaffen weil da einfach kein Teamwork war Die Leute arbeiten einfach nicht zusammen Schade

Muy buena y gameplay Lo unico que la IA es bastante regulera sobre todo si decides jugar con bots en tu equipo date por muerto xd Lo mejor jugar solo o con amigos y con el modo de visualizar sonidos en el juego para hacerlo mas immersivo 3
good game but sweet mother of God is it hard
This game is like being stuck in Klescher Rehabilitation Facility in Star Citizen peppered with a dash of Alien and moments of Resident Evil Big brain moves go a long way Patience is key Overall highly recommend
Se gosta de um jogo realmente survivor e desafiador com recursos limitados e com seu squad esse jogo feito pra Agora se um Enzo que quer recursos ilimitados e sabe usar 1 do esse jogo pra

A buggy mess feels like an early acces game Main Menu is somewhat confusing Can't use esc key to get out of the settings menu and other menus there's also no close button or back button In-game UI is also very very small and hard to see/read I really had trouble reading my teammates names their status and even that of my own in 1440p Audio cutscenes seem to be really loud and interrupt the Stealth gameplay Audio overall seems to be very unbalanced but that might just be a bug There are no assissination animations even though stealth and melee is encouraged Melee fighting floaty especially if you come from a game like Vermintide 2 Enemies are janky weird floaty animations ranged attacks that are clipping etc Mostguns seem to be ineffective a shotgun has the spread of 3m at 1m distance and deals like 0 damage Making enemies feel like bullet sponges sometimes Overall the game seems to be lacking a lot of quality control The concept is pretty cool but it needs a lot of tweaking and finetuning and the enemy AI needs an overhaul As for now if you are looking for a tense scary shooter you're better off playing RE:Village for SP or Ready or Not for Multiplayer
I'll be honest deciding whether to recommend this game or not is one of the hardest decisions I've done this month If you're one of those people who would get annoyed at people for restarting the moment the guards got alerted in Payday 2 this game is probably for you Stealth until someone or something fucks up Rinse and repeat There's a very good concept here at its core and it's balanced beautifully but hitting a game breaking bug 40 minutes into an expedition is really deflating thankfully it will get fixed relatively quickly You'll definitely want to play with people the bots are decent but they can't really help you much when trying to stay quiet only prevent a wipe when things go wrong This brings me to the next issue which is one of pricing yes developers deserve to get paid but it's really hard three friends to drop on a game each blindly especially one which up front says you might not like it Keeping an eye on a two hour timer doesn't make for a good experience either Something that could help here would be a demo version that lets you complete a fixed expedition with a fixed loadout with bots or even just the evaluation that was introduced with this rundown rundown 7 Let friends get a feel for the game and if it's worth the money because when there isn't a free weekend going on those player numbers worry me You'll pretty much always be able to play with friends since it's peer to peer but developers can't justify working on a game that doesn't make them money Get this game with at least one other friend set a timer on your phone for an hour and 50 minutes and try it out together See if you like it or not If you like it it's probably gonna be one of the best games you've played If you don't like it you can always get a refund

GTFO.More like gtfout of this game
It's very fun but multiple times my team check pointed someone would be glitched and forced to carry an item like the collection case They couldn't put it down and couldn't use weapons Again very fun but a glitch like that is actually game breaking
sklamanie
10/10 smart BOTS when the whole team has to stand in a circle to open the door your smart bot runs anywhere to the moon to grandma for pies to the toilet to his ex but not to the damn circle Moreover you can go through almost the entire level with him and at the very last door he will stand anywhere except the circle AI is on top And your bot will steal ammo and other important resources at the most unexpected moment The game is gorgeous and very unusual but I wouldn't buy it for 30 a maximum of 6-8 If you've read up to this point here's a recipe for how to make a glass of water as a reward Take water 150 ml and a glass 200 ml Pour water into a glass Ready enjoy your meal 10 10 1500 300-400 150 200
The developers decided to advertise with a free weekend and rather than making sure the game was functional they started it off with the second level in the game causing recurrent crashes or eternal loading Also the game has very little sense of atmosphere for something meant to be at least somewhat horror-centric The scenery design is very cool the gun variety is neat the random aesthetics are a fun idea but there's no real atmsophere keeping you on edge Stealth is very easy I'm just not sure what the appeal is
The shooting feel and default parameters in Unity and UE engine are not as good as expected and it's not about the recoil being too strong The default voice acting in the storyline is quite disappointing The game explores a novel theme The atmosphere created in the game is far superior to many other games

Malo el juego Sino tienes amigos para jugar ni lo compres ni lo intentes no sirve para 1 jugador Dificultad artificial Creo que ya pasamos la etapa donde las balas se dispersan porque si circulo Las oleadas por cada alarma que activas son un total puedes haber limpiados todas las salas anteriores que si activas una alarma tienes mas enemigos por que si Los enemigos hacen demasiado junto a que probablemente mueras por cada alarma y teniendo en cuenta que apuntar sirve para para nada porque literalmente son demasiado pues solo te queda desperdiciar la torreta Frustrante para desperdiciar 1-2 horas de tu vida por cada partida y si mueres probablemente el ultimo checkpoint fue hace 30 minutos Me pueden explicar porque carajos los scout no mueren de un dispararon a la cabeza con escopeta AH SI PORQUE SUS DEVS NO IMPLEMENTARON LA DE UHUHHH QUE JUEGO Entiendo el punto del sigilo pero si me tengo que tirar 15 20 mins y limpiando las habitaciones guardando y vida para que el juego te obligue a disparar a oleadas porque hay puertas que activan alarmas PORQUE SI y tengas que A FUERZA separarte de los porque tienes que pararte en las marcas que te indican para desactivar las OLEADAS INFINITAS pues me sabe a mrda
It's hard but fun as hell with 4 friends The AI however needs some fixing because most of the time the AI straight up alerts the sleepers up by accident and now we have a hoard attacking us
Konnte keiner Lobby joinen als wenn die Server leer gefegt An und sich erinnert mich das Game stark an R6 Extraction Werde es nochmal auf einen vierten Versuch ankommen lassen Geht es dann wieder nicht freu ich mich das ich die Erfahrung kostenlos machen durfte
Listen if you like this type of game go right ahead no stress Atmosphere is pretty dope Weapons and team work is dope But the game is janky at best and some doors failed to load allowing progression overall Interesting concept of a game But it is not worth the 60 and I wouldn't buy it if it was free
fun as fuck but unforgiving as fuck
ta bueno
bon jeu bon gameplay part contre au niveau des graphismes c'est pas digne d'un jeu de fin 2021 ta des jeux beaucoup mieux fait et qui sont moins je pense pas que je vais continuer a y jouer sachant que le jeu et payant c'est mort pour moi RIP ce jeu
Tried the free weekend Boorring There's just no motivation to continue playing I do like the presentation With the low player numbers this game will die soon This is the problem with paid multiplayer only games It feels like a waste of money if no one is playing it and eventually servers will get shut down They could have made a great single player game out of this
looks good play bad

This game is very fun but onky with friends I downloaded this game for a free demo weekend and have been playing with friends I don't think this would be fun unless you were talking with friends I also don't recommend spending the full price for the game I would wait for it to be 50 off
poor co-op monster shooting game limited ammo repetitive/similar map u may feel enjoyable during the tutorial buts it annoying and boring like most negative reviews u sees here said just save your time dont download it even its free weekend
This game has some great presentation and manages to be very immersive but like other reviews have said it kind of throws you straight in and you're going to die a lot and not have much fun Worth the download while the free weekend is on just for the experience of being dropped in but I probably won't be buying this game
Parece que el juego no quiere que lo entiendas Hubieron varios bugs desde la primera partida
This minging shite is so rubbish that they would literally have to pay me to keep playing it Tried to play the first level and the item we needed didn't even spawn so we got softlocked at the end of the level after wasting the time i could have spent playing kenshi which is somehow less broken than this shite which is impressive innit also that sheit is way to long ye
honestly game looks and sounds like a 10/10 but the gameplay is a 0/10
Could be fun if you have a preset squad or friends to play with But if you don't well it is just gonna be quite an underwhelming experience To be honest i really love the gameplay overall but the biggest problem i find is there is no tutorial you are thrown into a game where you don't know nothing about only to be handheld by teammates that have played before For me personally i had a lot of fun playing the first time but after closing the game i can't see myself opening the game up again
ES MALASO PAPU
Repetitive and no action
This game is terrible and incredibly slow paced I would not recommend a snoozefest of carrying a hsu and walking from door to door
This game is such a boring slog It's like these developers wanted to create a game without understanding what makes them fun
De ainda ta caro MUITO RUIM KKKKK
Literally too hard There is NON of guide for the game mechanics or the weirdo tool gun It need to spend A LOT A LOT A LOT of time to die and learn how it work but the feedback is so so poor You can't even adjust the difficulty to make the learning curve more humanity It is a NUH for my opinion PS:The weapons ammo/back up ammo even not shown in start menu Is it really worth to spend your time(with friend to try out every weapon every tools to make the mission work
Jogo bom jogo bem feito
This fall damage is ridiculous I walked off a railing onto a platform it was connected to and took 9 damage Unbelievable All playable characters have knee problems It must run in the family or something
que cagada que bueno que no lo compre jaja salu2
balls
Baixei para testar no final de semana e me arrependi jogo muito ruim e bugado recomendo nem de
Esse Game apresenta uma proposta ele peca quando se trata de jogar single player e com multiplayer Bots burros quanto uma Porta de madeira mal lixada dependendo da fase em que voce joga simplismente tem como achar os itens do objetivo pois como o jogo foi pensado no co-op o fato de vc pingar o item no terminal e ter que procurar por si uma pessima experiencia nunca me frustrei tanto pra procurar um item na minha vida Agora quando voce joga co-op ai que vc aproveitando o 100 que esse game tem a oferecer pois os sistemas de pings do terminal funcionam muito bem com co-op Resumo Caso voce tenha amigos pra jogar passe bem longe desse game pois voce vai se frustrar e pouco Agora caso voce tenha amigos pode comprar que vale a pena
Constantly crashes Moving the game from a HDD to a SSD actually saw the game open but if you accidentally hit the wrong button that opens a web browser or even alt-tab the game crashes and says it's a disk write error Doing all steps such as clearing steam download cache re-install verifying updating Windows and drivers and so on does not solve these errors On top of this if having to use Discord is more or less a requirement to play this game then I'm out I was already fully aware of the difficulty/learning curve and the necessity for teamwork and communication it's part of what made PDTH so fun to play with friends I had high hopes for Ulf and 10 Chambers to replicate that feeling here in some ways but this is such a disappointment Even the devs themselves state that this game isn't built for maximum retention So they don't want you to keep playing after awhile What What a disaster Thanks for the free weekend but no sale At the time of this writing and prior to the free weekend the stats show that the playerbase hovers between 600 to 1000 players at any given moment I'll be curious to see what those numbers are like in six months from now I have a feeling if I bought this it would sit quite nicely next to RAID World War II Hard pass on this
Boring
S h i t Repetitious game loop with constant sneaking that is abruptly interrupted by janky gunplay lackluster weapon impact and ridiculously stupid AI
Repetitive sneaking your terminal is in another room simulator with disconnected gunplay Don't waste your time
Great game very difficult to master
Three Friends The Fxxk Together Fxxk Other
Most fun coop game I've played even with matchmaking
TODO UN NEONATO
they call it GTFO because as soon as you start the game you want to GTFO out of it because it's so boring
n the first mission the game bugged out and the item we had to grab at the end of the mission was stuck in a wall where we could not grab it Confusing game not great
its aight
The game is unique to other games combat is pretty terrifying and the game gives a mysterious feeling you use terminals and input ACTUAL commands in order to progress in the game and the visuals of the game is pretty amazing and doesn't lag too much
GTFO of my room I am playing GTFO Dont bother me the game is really really good Just play it to find out
Muito foda uma mistura de Doom 3 com Swat 4 com The Last of Us com Metro 2033 e Apex Legends se gosta de jogos de terror esse jogo pra acho que esse jogo devia ter um modo historia sem ser coop pois isso atrapalha um pouco a experiencia principalmente se algum jogador tiver com a baixa defeitos que encontrei no jogo que podem ser corrigidos com facilidade o jogo fica mais jogando com bots pois eles causam muito dano aos inimigos alguns inimigos um pouco burros e de matar algumas armas e itens como os de que que as armas vem com uma lanterna e os escuros assim as minas explosivas funcionam quando atira nelas as dicas dos objetivos muito claras principalmente para pessoas que entende comandos no terminal fica adivinhar qual o comando que tem que digitar esses os defeitos do jogo
I wouldn't buy this game because it's too hard
I recommend to the dudes who love trying to stay alive in the better end w amazing teammates of course
Back 4
Wanted to try and play this game for the first time during the free weekend 100 min later and lots of restarts but was never able to get past the Loading Assets into the actual game I reset the game my computer and uninstalled/reinstalled to bad
Easy to die game I don't understand what Game Clearance can get
not for cookies
Find door go through door oh another door
amo and health is way to scarce and hard to find its just not fun when you are stuck on something because you dont have enough amo to fight the mobs other than that it was fun but it was a little bit of a deal breaker for me it also seemed a bit repetitive but I did only do 3 of the missions I put No for recommend but its currently like a 5/10 overall for me
This game is not for all types of people There is action in this game but most of the time u are crouching in the dark with ur volume to 100 listening for monsters if they are awake or not This game is really fun with 4 to 3 players especially if u play with ur friends But when u do mess up by missing a monster or by not paying attention that's when everything goes wild That when the few bullets the prison gives u go by so fast u don't even remember u had any to begin with Anyway all this is to say its a fun game with friends and a pretty well done game
80 gameover
played during the free weekend very fun and will probably buy
P A I N 3 3 3 3
This game is MADE for 4 people Trying it solo is a challenge and kind of a slog to get through but the core gameplay loop is enjoyable Get to a room Listen for clicks Bash em an smash em Loot Die trying to solo an alarm door I have no friends so this is the extent of my gameplay
The game is great but its not for everyone there is an high learning curve right at the start If you are the type of person that likes big challenges even then you will be a litle frustate at the begining but it will get better and you will love this game as I do
de esse jogo caro Adorei o jogo a melhor parte quando eu fechei
What an amazing co-op game for hardcore game fans I literally have decades of experience in FPS and this game smacked the tar out of us This game is all about communications You'll have to reel in any boomer shooter instincts you may have and really think about and discuss your actions before you do them or all hell will come down on you a very dark game and from what I understand it gets darker and darker the further down the mission list you go You will get spanked You will want to scream but each time you finish a mission you will have that delicious feeling of having earned it want to play with friends that you communicate well with The need to communicate and coordinate is paramount give up Keep trying and learn from your mistakes Ammo is valuable as well as health Share with your teammates I highly recommend this game for just playing as well as streaming My Twitch viewers were left wanting the game so much they went and downloaded it this weekend enough breaks in the mayhem for you to fluidly communicate with your chat think about getting this game like I do it or GTFO LOL
Even for a free weekend I feel like I want my money back just for the time I wasted playing this pile of steaming shit From the dog shit UI to the terrible mission design audio enemy design graphics and gunplay This was a grade A pile of shit from start to finish
ALRIGHTAHHH a free weekend is all i needed to know this game is pretty bad if i have to click to hold everything again im going to break someone's arm this game guns felt bad and the graphics are subpar at best don't want and probably never will
GTFO is a great name for this game because it really should get the f out of the steam store The interface makes you want to bang your face on the wall and the game play is just bland
good game with discussions and reviews being filled with free weekend people who have no idea what they're doing ignore the lazy reviews and discussions figure out if you'd like the game as for the game itself it's fun if you have a group of friends who you know will take things seriously or can perform just well enough to get things done although it used to be a lot harder from the get-go in recent times it's been made so the game has a difficulty ramp-up rather than just dumping you into the deep end definitely recommend this it's a nice lesson in using your resources and coordinating your team
good
I freaked out when one of the freaks started naruto running
Checkpoint bug made and hour long plus mission pointless could not interact with anything leaving us stuck staring at a package we couldnt move and doors we couldnt open
Devs are shady Absolute garbage
Muito muito ruim mesmo todo bugado a interface PESSIMA se vc tem ceratocone nem jogue parece q vc usando oculos
muito ruim muito confuso hud ruim e confusa os inimigos ruins e confusos os objetivos ruins e bugados recomendo nunca vou comprar EDIT eu joguei o jogo mais uma vez eles fizeram um update e a hud esta bem melhor o jogo menos confuso e eu acho que pode ser divertido se tu curtir a vibe
good
muito bom nem spawnei
GTFO Gosto de Tomar Forte no Oco Jogo de quem quer se frustar legal e dormir puto porque consegue passar das fases MAS DO KRL
This game is unbelievably boring
it is a well crafted game and would be super fun to play if the multiplayer matching was better Maybe it is a lack of players whatever the case you need a team So if you have more than 2 friends that can play it would be worth getting If not kinda a waste of money played on a free weekend
Joguei esse jogo na semana um jogo com bom potencial falta muitos recursos Joguei a primeira fase em coop sempre com 20 de vida com pouca um jeito efetivo de se proteger dos inimigos morre volta checkpoint morre volta checkpoint e assim por diante Se quer um jogo de jogar as fases tudo de novo esse jogo perfeito Pra mim Perdi a duas horas pra passar da primeira fase morremos umas 10 vezes Traduzindo o jogo Nem de vale a pena Quero jogar para me divertir PRA MORRER E REPETIR O CHECKPOINT 10 VEZES NUMA FASE Nota
very nice game but the playerbase its too small matchmaking can take hours and play with bots isn't an option Hope it gets more players
Is fun
cool game if you're into shooting weird naked people 10/10
Not sure if I can recommend the game at full price The idea itself is interesting I like it However working as a team is a great concept until you need to actually work as a team Highly recommend Devs reward players that play smart even when their team doesn't Meaning if people run around with flash lights on but you play stealth and smart you should stay undetected to the monsters but those whom are running around making noise should get clapped I highly recommend the game on the free weekends to know if you like it It feels a bit too stressful for me So personally I am out I don't like being punished by other players because they set off alarms while I am sneaking around getting objectives done
I would not take this game for free it is TRASH Cool concept POORLY IMPLEMENTED Weapons suck you would be better off being sent on these missions as a damn mutant because mutants are more powerful than you are even armed with all of those weapons and gadgets You don't even have armor and melee weapons are useless It's a lame as hell game It really is Thought I might change my mind on the free weekend but I hate it even more than the first time they tried to get people to buy this game I think I may have bought it and refunded it
Um jogo que perde vida do nada os bots atiram em toda hora quando vai jogar online buga a partida ruim pouco pra descrever esse jogo quero jogar nem de uma vez na vida e nunca mais faz tempo que eu jogava um jogo ruim mais esse superou minhas expectativas tem que fazer um jogo do 0 pra esse ficar bom Lembrando joguei com amigos e joguei com Bots e simplesmente foi a pior gameplay que vi e o tanto que passei raiva live e fiz deste jogo se quiserem ver o tanto de trabalho e raiva que passamos cola ai no Link
fun game very difficult and suspenseful
b]Left 4 Dead Tactico de Terror y para gente que SI quiera jugar en equipo enserio"(ratas individualistas abtenerse)[/b url recomendaciones hace click wachin[/quote][/url Ahora que le unas 6 horas y con varios tipos de gente puedo dar una correcta aunque no llegue a lo que el late game pues no pase de la 3era xD decir que es un left 4 dead de terror es muy para hardcore gamers este juego Es complejo y PARA NADA amistoso con la gente nueva explica lo y tu experiencia tus no jugas en equipo no vas a pasar de la 1 Lo primero a decir la atmosfera weon que buena y desde el menu ya te trata de meter dentro del juego la es en este juego y se ve muy bien y fluido la me impresiono es muy buena Creo que si te dieron sustos juegos como FNAF o Poppy este juego te va a sacar de 1 susto ya que las partes en calma o cuando escuchas enemigos a lo lejos si les quedaron muy macabras e inmersivas Algo que me encanto que el juego te da muchas armas desde el inicio y torretas tmb para que el rol que se te antoje con las armas que se te antojen me encanto que cada uno lleve una torreta y entre los 4 crear un de la muerte Eso si lo malo del juego es que para disfrutarlo si o si es con amigos o con gente que sea experimentada y sepa donde ir por que si no se puede hacer pesado de jugar Por que si jugas con gente egoista el tipico rata de L4D que se va solo adelante o que no sabe donde ir es caminar por pasillos oscuros y te comen las oleadas de monstruos El juego es bastante tryhard y eso lo hace poco accesible Es es complejo y es bastante severo pero una vez que le encontras el ritmo es buenisimo algo malo eso si es que casi nadie lo juega en LATAM aunque como dije si juegas con amigos uff una brutalidad de juego Yo tuve la suerte que me tocaron algunos con experiencia que nos guiaban a mi y un compa pero en otras donde quise jugar con 3 randoms nuevos como yo es un bodrio pues se hace lento por no saber donde ir y todo eso jugar con bots son un asco de usar Repito por suerte a mi me toco gente que carrear a los nuevos y la experiencia fue muy buena Pero no voy a mentir el juego no es para cualquiera es un juego de tryhard de co-op
IT'S GTFO TIME BABY
Its ok levels feel somewhat the same go here stand in circle baddies come repeat i personally dislike the gunplay needs polished a bit
Not even free i recommend played with friends and it was absolute clown fiesta nobody liked GTFO its says but it's all about stealth if you mess up either you get 1 or 2 hits by a small monster thing and the game it's that reclycled stealth and extraction don't buy that or even play it if you got for free
Not even the options are easy to work with The matchmaking is hard even on free weekend The optimisation is killing the game for sure as well as its pace It's slow rather than strategic The UI is not very informative rather cluttered and there are no markers in game for anything Feels like more time spent trying to set up for the game or what is about to happen than actually playing Certainly not recommended with this price tag and zero way to play with others
As someone who played since beta this game is the perfect example of if its not broken why fix it There are just so many tiny pointless things that changed through the game's life time and it has turned into something that just makes me sad This game had everything early on even the lore it was cryptic hidden interesting But what breaks me the most why remove rundowns ie maps levels content Just why The only thing I can praise from the devs is that they were indeed transparent about it but that's like hearing someone say they are going sprint head first into a concrete wall Like sure you can do that its your body your game but why thought Removing rundowns for the sake of whatever argument might be given is beyond ridiculous If anything if it was a tactic to sell DLC I'd probably understand it even if I didn't like it I honestly struggle to put it into words This game had everything to be legendary and at one point it was and I had so much hope to see it and the community grow Time's change games change and not always for the better
Good
it crash at startup every time oh well
A lot a recent patch the game is really hard tho
It's kind of boring ngl
Very fun game with good teamwork if you have a NASA computer that can run it
What the fuck is this shit
This game feels more like a chore Weapon balance is pretty bad there are some weapons that are godlike and others that actively screws you this is due to the damage system of the game if you score a critical hit a headshot you wil blow the head off and do a multiplier of your base damage but if your weapon sucks the enemy will not only survive but be free of any weakspot making the fight harder for everyone Some further maps have a fog that makes impossible to see anything the only way to temporarily remove the fog is with an item found inside the level it is an rng drop so good luck with that Enemy design is downright laughable altough the ambience is amazing the enemies look simple and dumb there is one that literally drags his butt on the floor like a dog with a scratch Missions are pretty repetitive this is due to the door alarm system it makes you follow points and stand in areas while the game throws infinite enemies at you some levels have a huge amount of those back to back No save points inside the level means if you lose or exit the mission you erased all your progress the size of the missions make this even more of a chore PS no the game is not this complex you just need the right loadout aka burst sentry and you can win any level even with bots
they got stuff on their butts peeyew
There are game-breaking bugs that basically ruin hours worth of tedious progression where you are forced to start over I would typically not chastise a game over such a thing but the devs want this to be le HuRDcuRRRR tacticool challenge for the most L33T where you cannot pause or save your progression midpoint In terms of time commitment this is almost like MMO raiding but without the quality control Also the inconsistencies on some ranged enemy attacks that go through cover are fun killer experiences Why add damage model to monsters where you can visually destroy entire torso of its body but they still use their tongues to attack you from long range Just illogical counter-intuitive things all around Hardcore games require hardcore quality control otherwise it is just masochistic waste of time for NEETs
drecks f2p game drecks aus der verbugged ohne ende und heid is erst da patch kema ma
The most fun four masochists can have with their clothes on
Spent over 6 hours total on this game with a couple of friends we reach expedition B1 and right before Zone 96 when we die anytime after throughout the expedition the game breaks and the person that was holding an item beforehand from the checkpoint bugs out and can't switch or drop the item This has happened with a suitcase and a baby This game could be great if it wasn't for that bug as this has potential Sadly I don't see that bug being fixed anytime soon
Great game Friends highly recommended but solo bots using Q is good too
Game breaking bugs where you respawn while holding an item that you cannot drop squad wiping and leaving the game entirely does not fix wasted several hours on missions to encounter this game breaking bug do NOT purchase this game if you are looking for something that works
Holding Item GLITCH
Game breaking bugs Bots do not cooperate in security scans so the monsters just keep coming and you can't go on Monsters are sponge bullets the guy loses half of its body and keeps whipping its dildo of a tongue at me and keeps spitting heat-guided ballistic asid saliva Unless you have 3 others friends ready to play with I advise a hard pass because less than 3 people is simply impossible with the amount of shots the AI can endure Stealth mechanic is weird even though you stand still crouched turn off the flashlight and stay away and still from the monsters they can still feel you Overall feels like an unfinished game you won't be able to enjoy without a full team bots are not advanced enough alongside the bugs so a pass from me
Me aburro
Oyunun atmosferi 10 numara grafikler falan ama bu kodumun oyunununda devletin halka gibi ve elimize 1 2 mermisi memurun gibi bi fight giriyorsun tak ya 20 yada oyunda bir bug mevcut bu oyunun seyrini bozuyor

Interesante pero divertido no es Es un juego de sigilo que carece de de suficientes de sigilo Agacharte Luz Ruido son las existentes no puedes ni distraer a los enemigos si te ven alarman de inmediato y la se arruina porque no es posible recuperar el control de la
game breaking bugs 100 reproduced after failing a mission and restart from the checkpoint one of the players was stuck with the kid in the hand or with the briefcase and could not play at all please fix it this game has too much potential i've played this game in the free weekend btw
Played on free weekend in co-op hitboxes are broken heads in this game does not matter with or without enemies are still alive and perform all attacks even those that require head to be present lol And who said that typing commands into in-game terminal is good idea in action FPS It's a hard game not because it is challenging but just because it is artificially made so thanks to annoying interface and simply broken game mechanics that shouldn't exist
bread
Zu Buggy und somit unspielbar Momentan Teste ich das Spiel da ich von den Trailern war und momentan eine Free Weekend am laufen ist Dachte man sich OK da kann man mal reinschauen und sich eventuell dann doch zulegen Leider in den 17 Stunden Spielzeit denkt man sich hat man ein normales Spielerlebnis aber dies war hier nicht der Fall Immer nachdem man von einem Checkpoint neustarten musste hatte man entweder die NSU oder noch ein Paket in der Hand das man letztendlich nicht mehr ablegen konnte und somit den ganzen Fortschritt vermasselte Bei solch einem Slow-paced game wie GTFO ist das schon echt schade Dann kommt man soweit mit 1 bis 2 Stunden spielzeit und dann macht am Ende ein doofer Bug alles zu nichte und man muss im Endeffekt die ganze Mission von Neu starten Ein weiterer Bug war dass man mit nichts mehr interagieren konnte Sentry aufstellen Team Mitglieder wieder hoch holen und Funktionierte nicht An sich ein Super Game mit einer Spielmechanik und spannender wenn auch gruseliger aber leider durch die genannten Bugs kann man das Spiel nur schlecht durchspielen Von der Grafik her ist das Spiel Tadellos Keine Frage Aber was bringt einem ein aussehendes Game wenn man es nicht spielen kann 6/10
Ein Versuch Dead Space in einen Ego-Shooter mit Coop zu pressen Das was nervt ist das permanente Terminal getippe dies nimmt sehr oft und schnell die Immerson des Spieles Genau so das man immer in einem Kreis stehen muss damit ein Srkipt werden kann Die Geschwindigkeit Movement locker um 25 angehoben werden Nice try but epic fail
Che gioco della costa 40 euro e ha una grafica del 56 input lag di 20 ore e aimbot e zero fisica dei nemici A.I Otttimo vi consiglio di comprarlo
GTFO ta mais pra GET THE FUCKING BUG OUT ou seja jogo ruim

Truly one of the games ever created
they suck me
Nope I didn't enjoy this game at all Graphically its really impressive and immersive The game has no tutorial barely tells you what to do I have spent so much time just wandering what to do or how to get to the next objective You have to HOLD each time you confirm something There is just too much shit on your display and at the same time it barely tells you anything I wish it had a marker to point you to where you need to go everytime Medkits barely heal you like 20 health points out of 100 Really That's it Glad I tried it out on this free weekend and didn't spend any money on this I'd rather play left 4 dead 2
Shit
I got it on the free weekend and played it for a bit So far I can't get past the f tutorial I was in a group with 4 people all new players in a STARTER mission we couldn't get past like the 3rd objective It's a really hard game I was thinking of eventually buying this and it was on my wishlist and I'm glad they had the free weekend because this game is way too hard for me The menu is just a bunch of bullshit buttons so it's hard to navigate where I'm actually supposed to go This game isn't for me but that's just my opinion
Just take my money
trash
Too loud and buggy Pass
Machts doch noch schwieriger dann macht es mir noch mehr die Maus durch den Bildschirm zu pfeffern Schwierig und gut aber beruhigt euch mal
GTFO is not only really fun and also a good challenge but it's also pretty scary Well done

Ja na free weekend i mi gierka nie taka jakby tak lub nie to bym ale jestem zmuszony NIE
Yeah 100 percent waste of time
He jugado una partida y me cagao 16/10
i was very confused idk if its just me or not but i personally didnt have much fun
Good ideas but low quality execution poor variety of monsters that wear thin fast and look ridiculous and are animated even worst like they used MOCAP at 10 fps on a 12 years olg girl in a gym doing stuff and gameplay It has a lot of nice ideas nice gameplay ideas but falls short on almost everything that would make this game desirable It's probably worth around 8 even 29 at the present discount it insanely high for this low quality product that has nothing to offer but good will and good ideas Maybe with a good publisher on the back and an higher budget and talents they might give us something real nice with the next title I like the immersive UI of the menu and the intro while descending in the facility That is cool and probably the best part of the game Audio wise It's nice in some areas and helps the game quite a bit It lacks proper animations feedback from the game and a sense of presence and better textures and overall design
Downloaded the game for the free weekend Hold button to skip intro this one is okay i think Hold button to get into the menu Adjusting the settings again having to hold down the save button Last time i checked i was using a pc not a console what is so bad about a single click to save settings Quitting the game again clicking quit and then holding down a button WHY JUST WHY What is the benefit to menu buttons moving around insert confused jackie chan here What is up with all the UX designers What's so hard about a functional UI if u want to get fancy add really good explanations what each graphics option does Might still be a good game once u get into it the UI is atrocious
Cant get complete 1st mission becous of a bug Very fun just run whit a box on your hand a watch your friends die to monsters and cant do jack shit

I wouldnt buy this game for 30 i would spend a good 10 on it I like the game i just dont think its worth 30 Food and medkits are vital and they are really hard to find in my opinion I also jumped from a small ledge and lost literally half of my health like wtf anyways the game is a very hardcore shooter so if you like difficult games then i guess this is for you but maybe not for me so much
h1 h1 b pve 10/10 b 2 10 hr hr
Man soll immer mit etwas positiven anfangen und hat dieses Game einige positive Punkte Pro die ist einfach MEGA Licht und Schatten die Umgebung und auch das Feeling bei Munitionsknappheit erzeugen eine sehr gute Stimmung Taktische Map interaktiv Grafik ist passend Viele kleine Details Bestes Beispiel Konsolennutzung mein Mate tippt die Commands und ich schaue in Echtzeit zu spielerisch nutzlos aber nettes Gimmick Contra Bewegungen sind unsauber Trefferfeedback ist gut und schlecht Missionsdesign dies killt leider komplett den flow Bsp Ich suche eine Keycard ne wo ein Generator ist welcher mir ne hinter welcher ich ne Keycard finde die Was soll das Es killt komplet den wenn ich 10-15 Minuten hin und her renne Selbst mit Premates macht das keinen Daher kann ich es leider nicht empfehlen
Buggy It doesn't let me press the E button to interact anymore around mid-game Thus I couldn't pick up my sentry I couldn't pick up the objective package And I couldn't hack and open/close any doors Totally became a burden for the team It's only fun when we're prepared with enough health and ammo But that's not always the case It just takes too long to finish a run Currently not recommended
El juego te recomienda y se apoya demasiado de programas externos para poder jugarlo si se quiere conseguir un emparejamiento mediante el propio juego el tiempo de espera es demasiado alto No he visto juego en el que se requiera tanto esfuerzo para iniciar una partida Al menos el tutorial se veia entretenido
Confusing Maps No actual clue bout the storyline Random enemy spam without any reason Atleast when you have the chance to actually find enemies after following a random go there go there storyline Weapons are super unprecise and you get almost no amo if you play with more than 1 player
not a fun game Map design was unintuitive Guns never hit spray pray is your only option Puzzels were just confusing all in all a 2/10
It's a shame to give this game a bad review I really wanted to love it The setting and atmosphere are really promising and I was quite curious to get to know more about the world and lore In the first map I encountered already a game breaking bug after a checkpoint reload I couldn't drop the egg that I was holding Also it had duplicated and the next one who picked that up couldn't drop it either but I was free again and so on Still we managed to complete the map Then came B1 which I played for 5 hours with many randoms and countless tries One time I was close to finish it because we simply wouldn't give up which is the biggest problem with randoms one always drops out and it doesn't feel like difficulty is being adjusted to that Then again after a reload someone couldn't drop the container for a door anymore so it was game over I also encountered the sound bug with the scout everything sounds low after she screams But what I learned from spending ages in this one map was that many elements are unfortunately mediocre Visuals are only in some places nice and nicely lit many areas are just okaish The layout makes no sense at all I even thought it was procedually generated but no There is even a ladder and a staircase right next to each other leading to the next floor 3m down The enemies loot and mission items location changes nothing else So you can start skipping parts of the use the terminal to find x Also this makes the replayability quite low Enemy design has interesting parts the tentacles of the scout and annoying/boring parts with the agile rather close combat one and the ranged one and the big slow one That leads to just masses arriving at the same time and attacks tentacles going through corners projectiles with auto aim that are messy in combination There is no sustainable tension like in L4D In GTFO I know when enemy waves will attack when I trigger a scout or when I open a door with an alarm level The door mechanic is super gamey You have to stand in a small circle with all 4 players and then chase random security circles until it is done Otherwise enemies will spawn endlessly This is the main reason why I saw groups fail and it is not really fun to be honest Especially when the security circles lead you down in the green area with bushes and trees where fighting is a nightmare I thought destroying the head would be most effective to kill the enemies which otherwise take a lot of hits but then I saw that some are still walking without a head which is just messy design communication because in melee a charged hit to the head is enough The stealth part is ok once you have learned the rules but I found it easier and more reliable to headshot the scout for example The bottom line is If you want to make a hard game that players have to play again and again the core loop has to be fun and exciting and unforseen/fresh events have to happen and I didn't have that enough in GTFO to continue trying B1
Boring not very intense as it looks Ended up throwing glow sticks around to amuse myself
its boring
I've seen people playing this on YouTube and wanted to try it out I did and I've never been so careful and scared in my entire life When you put the horror aspect into this game expect it to be terrifying if it wasn't already to begin with Also I recommend to dive right into it that way you get a real feel about what it might be like actually being there not knowing what is happening and what you have to do If you buy the game you won't be disappointed if you're looking for a terrifying first person shooter
I can shoot teammates

La primera que a mi parecer si fuesen inteligente los devs ser la mas atractiva para llamar la del jugador resulto siendo aburridisima al punto de quitear porque ya me daba pereza una copia oscura de left 4 dead con objetivos oleadas de bichos rotisimos que vienen cuando quieren yo no lo recomiendo
Wasn't even able to play it with friends game wouldn't load until the host left
aburrido que 8 horas en un bus
Took 10 min to load and only even loaded after host left 0/10 just unplayable with friends FOR A GAME THAT NEEDS 4 PLAYERS

BORING
I got lost and bored and got the fuck out
Very Boring got lost in the dark without monsters
The game seems qualitatively pretty well made however the gameplay loop in and of itself is rather bad especially when the multiplayer works relatively poorly Enemies kept teleporting around and that alongside them being very hard by default made them pretty hard to kill Probably one of the worst aspects of the game was the flashlight and brightness of the game or rather lack thereof This game is super dark by design and even base brightness cant be turned up like it can in most games
Downloaded and tried on the free weekend I was excited to give this a go as I had been following the game for a while The aesthetics and feel of the game are amazing Matchmaking took forever and many people quit since I and many others were new players When we finally got four people one quit when we touched down Progressed well enough through the initial level of the game but then for no reason the game froze during the first enemy encounter and crashed on me

I swear to god These developers don't have any idea how to make a simple intituive and just straight to the point interface It's so convoluted just to even begin a match it's the same problem Payday 2 has But now even the objetives for every mission were so unclear me and my friend dropped the game after walking in circles for 30 minutes with no idea of what to do Maybe if we invested more time in it we could understand it better But I have the time to read a manual just to play something casual with my friends The aiming and shooting feels off I don't know if that's the studio's way to make their game more difficult and inmmersive but the controls are simply bad The objetives were defend this door and carry this heavy thing from A to B It's a walking simulator with some little fights in it
Not hard enough
Very boring gameplay Can't see anything too blurry Co-op with more experienced players just feels like you're spectating them while wandering around lost
Average Hammer player
This game is making my brand new PC with a GPU 3060 feel like i am near a oven If you value your PC do not I repeat DO NOT GET THIS GAME If you like this game you are a scum and should die alone in your mother's basement
Got Bored 5min in the game.no
No progression.everything is already unlocked
Great concept poor execution You'll get everything you might expect from cheap indie game bugs lags poor level design poor game design decisions etc Fun for one evening more meh
I played this game during the free weekend and i must say that the first time user experience is not smooth at all And the reasons are 1 you have a lot of equipment from the very start It's too confusing for a new player And i am afraid it might be all guns available in the game 2 i could not use button e after loading from a checkpoint and this button is very essential for progressing a level I have no idea whether it was a technical bug or just a really bad UX design but as a result i was a complete burden for my team 3 first location is not very visually appealing i think some of the next locations are much more beautiful Besides that i think the game can attract its player-base hardcore players who don't whine about FTUE
I loved Left 4 Dead and Payday so when my friends suggested this I was on board Little did I know that this game is nothing like he others and unfortunately only in a negative way First the good The Visuals and atmosphere are great that's it Everything else is mediocre at best horrible at worst The game seems to consist of a very small amount of activities Find X Defend door Y Carry item Z to area U It is basically a walking simulator with the occasional enemy on route you need to quietly dispose of or you trigger an alarm which usually screws up your run as will lose precious ammo you might need later In between you have hoard sections where you will probably wipe and that's it Welcome to GTFO This is my next complaint you can pick several guns at startup which you are then encouraged not to use as it will massively increase the difficulty of the run when you trigger an alarm Here is your gun but don't use it or you will regret it later great fun Imagine this in a racing game sure you can pick the Ferrari over the Accord but if you pick it we will make the race so difficult you are basically guaranteed to lose great fun great fun In addition the gun play is how can I describe this horrible The aim feels off like moving your mouse through butter or playing with a controller Guns feel floaty with little impact especially on larger enemies to paraphrase JoshStrifeHayes If I wanted to convey how it feels to fire a party popper at a sumo wrestler this is how I would have done it For me rundowns where more a game of chance than skill In most games when you die there is a reason a mistake made you can attempt to correct not here It's just random bullshit usually killing you from behind So you repeat until the RNG god threw the dice in your favor and you survived After 2 hours I started watching YouTube videos out of boredom as I noticed the only areas where I actually needed to pay attention or be present were the hoard sections at certain doors The rest is just a re-themed Dear Esther on a space station where you occasionally have to open doors If you like cool I can't it's boredom in a can white bread

achei uma bosta
So here is the free weekend and I decided to try this game out I heard about the project some time ago from one of the youtubers but was embarrassed with the dev team's communication with the mentioned youtuber Also read some reviews which were not that positive Thus I decided to hold on What's now I am definitely happy that I have not bought it First of all the basic flow of the game You have semi-consecutive missions Semi because there is some branching present but overall it does not affect the flow itself And this flow is weird You beat several missions and wait for from what I can see two months till another portion of the missions will be dropped You can say Hey man it is regular season/wipe cycle practice However in such games there is usually a permanent servers/league where your progression is kept I get that everything is unlocked from the start in terms of guns and equipment but once two months have passed all the missions are lost forever I am fine with not getting rewards but what if I want to go back to my favorite mission or something like that This is the first major flow The second weird part is the time it takes to complete the rundown I totally understand that missions become harder and harder the first one took around 45 minutes Taking into consideration that we read the keybindings and spent some time getting used to the gameplay So I believe it might take around two weeks of playing casually to complete the rundown As a result you play for around two weeks and then wait for a month and a half Again weird flow for me The following problem is teammates Getting back to the first abstract I avoided official discord with its modders also I heard rumors that the community is incredibly toxic I can get it it's a hardcore survival game such games usually do have not a friendly player base Thus you need to have three more palls to play with as a team Because missions were made exactly for four players You may solo it I guess if you are notifying this game but it is not worth it IMHO What about bots I've seen that they improved the AI And God if they were even worth in the past Poor solo players Bots are bots they are kinda dumb and not suited for silent tactical survival To sum up You pay for playing around 20 hours once per 2 months and then wait Not worth it Maybe at a 50 discount
is trash lol
0/10 4
GTFO
God this shit was so boring aimlessly running around for who knows how long until I finally alt f4'd the only fun I had was jumping off a 2 foot ledge to kill myself over and over again while a bot revived me
P:S
It seems like a decent game But it had not true controller support Like no rumble and no aim settings and therefore i cannot get by to continue to play it
f4cked game can't see a thing nor figure out what to do Also performance on linux is bad

Terminals are almost useless and a pain to use(ping whatever T stops pinging if you remove ur head from the terminal and should be something a player had acces on themself at least You are forced to go most turrents or u have literally no chances Bad Team mates really screws u over Weapons are very underwealming melee system also kinda sucks almost no point to use anything besides spear/hammer Glad i didn't buy this game and got to try it in free weekend

Good idea bad execution The ingame main menu is terrible and the whole terminal system sucks
PROS Great atmosphere Satisfying to figure out a run CONS Incredibly punishing Runs take far too long Things start to look samey very quickly Gunplay doesn't feel good Unrewarding gameplay I've tried getting into GTFO three times now but this game just has a great concept with bad execution Mind you it's not an outright bad game but it manages to feel less than the sum of its parts It feels heavy clunky imprecise and just generally uncomfortable to play Stealth feels inconsistent The gunplay is weirdly floaty and laggy Framerate hitches frequently There's barely any reward to be found in the gameplay loop Failing runs which happens often can cost you an hour of your time with an accompanying sense of frustration Good luck getting three people to consistently play through every rundown/level I could go on and on but I'd rather GTFO of this review
Excellent game for team building and communication skills The unique style of game design combined with older elements of FPS and horror bring a refreshing change to the genre Highly recommend Certainly a learning curve in terms becoming proficient at passing levels but thats part of the fun
free weekend this game is so DUMB 1 mouse sensitivity is totally shot with no ingame adjustment i'm not going to make a gimped mouse dpi profile JUST for this game 2 you start with zero ammo and zero instructions 3 game is boring melee trash I was expecting something like the alien movies but no its just bad content trying to draw out the WORST EXPERIENCE as an excuse for game content no thanks losers if i want to melee i'll play dead island from 2010
just no

No one knows how to play this game Most ppl can't even figure out how to ready up
Dead Space
I cannot recommend this game unless you're really into the aesthetics and don't care how tedious it is besides and have friends who feel the same Spent an entire hour on the first mission The game got completely bugged leading to several checkpoint restarts The objective we were carrying randomly got duplicated leading one of our players to not be able able to do anything besides sometimes pass it around in a very glitchy way This led to us having two players including myself completely unable to attack or sprint on the extraction phase The UI/HUD is terrible hard to read and there are so many visual effects it took us half an hour to realize it was actual information and not just set dressing There are rarely any enemies and when there are they are buggy and teleport around and hard to tell if they're dead I understand the point of the game is to be tactical and not hold your hand but there is not even a tutorial for you to play At least if there is I was not able to discern it from the bizarre menu layout and unclear labeling It's too stylized for its own good and gives you a sensory overload upon seeing it the first time and can be difficult to see what's going on And frankly it was too boring for me to want to sit there and get used to It was sort of fun when things were happening but most of my play session amounted to figuring out what direction the zone or objective was in and using command prompt to open doors and read logs which isn't very fun to begin with but especially not in a MULTIPLAYER SETTING tl;dr generally boring tedious and it does not do enough interesting or different to make me want to stick around to see if it gets better
terrible ass game
LFG in game's Discord instead of matchmaking Rundown menu Discord button
Game has great graphics nice atmosphere small in size but its mainly an incredibly stealthy hard game where resources are scarce and you must work efficiently to complete each level which after a while just feels like a big maze going from room to room to find key cards I instantly uninstalled this game and I recommend trying it on free weekend to see if this is your playstyle I may not like it but the effort put into this is very clearly visible and if you are among that tiny little niche of people that love hard stealth games where being a W-key warrior is not the way to go then try this out
Good game
i'm playing with a bunch of noobs
This might be one of the worst games I've ever played It's boring as hell the gunplay is very meek and unsatisfying confusing level design terrible blurry HUD with awful readability and the matchmaking didn't seem to work This free weekend was one of the worst decisions ever
Worst matchmaking system ever Impossible to play coop with friends
this is the 9/11 of horror games
If you want to play this game you MUST be 4 players,ps not enough glow sticks
Good coop game although 40 euros is a bit expensive do not buy the game if you have no friends to play with the game is not meant to be played alone and will be difficult for one person
Pretty good a whole lot of changes since I played alpha Graphics feel a little downgraded but that's not critical for this type of game A balance between action and stealth mechanics With the current gameplay it feels like a more hardcore fps version of Alien Swarm games Price isn't very high or low it's right in the middle Me and my friends enjoyed a lot
Most boring game to play solo Sort of a L4D2 theme with dumb AI
feels wrong

What engineering group exists now or in the future that requires user-scanning multiple times at the same time in different spots while blaring the alarm too I'll tell you None Ruins the whole point of a silent coop horror stealth game If it's just an alarm blaring because a failure occurred with a security swipe or some hack then ok let's go get the guns out go nuts but to be thrown into a required position where you gotta touch rando spots while swarms of enemies attack you with no option to use cover without failing security check and doing it over again while the swarms keep increasing in size and power feels like the security system was more designed by some Squid-Game m$*^$@!%&*#$ers who wanna bait prisoners into a false sense of security then watch them get mucked I'll tell you I like watching it but I don't like playing it because what's the point it's terribly rigged from the start You gotta luck out on the rando security spots being in the right place at the right time with the right group of enemies spawning randomly so your team doesn't get punished and wiped out from finding literally the right keycard to open the door in the first place Some wacko gameplay design idea there that doesn't execute at all into what you'd want for a game with these kind of stealth coop features Completely ruins the whole thing just that alone
good multiplayer team work game

legit bad game poor hit registeration and poorly designed its not intuitive enough atmosphere is 10/10 but god damn the mechanics are terrible
patience perseverance grit Survive not recommended for casuals not a mindless shooting game matchmaking sucks should've just implemented a server/lobby browser instead of having to go to discord to LFG
hmm way too expensive what offers maybe on 75 discount

Well the first mission for A rundown is the best way to tell people who were trying it on free weekends to not buy this game
Allow me to preface by saying that there are a lot of reviews for this game claiming Ugh too hard and Waaahh so repetitive oh and not to forget Boo-hoo I can't just run and gun Well allow me to debunk these and more if I have the time Too hard No certainly not Is the game itself hard Nope Instead it's challenging Difficult would imply that it absolutely required a high degree of skill to play properly Games like CS:GO and Street Fighter are difficult GTFO on the other hand is challenging because instead of giving you wall to pass it gives you a hill to climb It tests your abilities to complete what it asks of you instead of just saying GG scrub try again Unless you have the patience of a dog you will come back learn from your mistakes and do better It's like Dark Souls in a way Difficult but not inaccessible Unless you're stupid and want victory handed to you on a silver platter Repetitive Uhhhhh Yeah Isn't every game just that if you boil them down enough Is your 6123rd match of your 27th battle royale game repetitive yet I really don't get what people mean what they say this game is repetitive and yet play let's see any other video game Some people just really need to get some perspective Or maybe they find the repetitiveness more obvious because they're already bias against GTFO Can't Run and Gun Some people really missed the memo about this game huh Should I start complaining that I can't mine and craft or that there aren't enough heroes in spandex since we're using that logic This isn't MEANT to be a run and gun game just as Borderlands isn't meant to be a peaceful farming sim And sure not everyone has to find that enjoyable since not everything is made for everyone but you also can't just call it a bad game because you don't like it Now you should never compliment without criticizing and vice versa Need Friends to Play I mean kinda I won't say you should play this game on your own definitely not And whilst the discord is great for finding people to play the game with if you really want to you are going to find the best experience with the game if you have even just 1 buddy with you like I did Bad tutorial Well yes and no The tutorial gives you a good grasp of some basic mechanics like sneaking navigation doors and scavenging so long as you LISTEN to it I do think it might need to be a little more thorough with the game mechanics for game journalists and similarly skilled people such as how to use terminals properly and perhaps a few example mission types Maybe a few different training courses and even a firing range would be helpful for some people who want to be more prepared As it stands the current tutorial is good for people who can fill in the gaps and not many others The Consoles Now I have to admit something I found the consoles really fun Something about my love for problems solving or something BUT I can acknowledge that some people have difficulty with it and it can bring down the level of enjoyment for them So let this be a warning if you're considering buying the game Learn the Consoles so they don't catch you off gaurd and even can help you Or lead you to your death like when my friend and I chased a medipack I discovered through one and die horribly trying to get it My departing thoughts on the game are this This is a really fun games to play with your buddies that can range form horrifying to hilarious to tense The execution is simple to understand the tactics are challenging to master and the consoles will make or break your run when push comes to shove You may or may not like this game but just remember that even if you don't that's subjective and not objective And for what it's worth This game is at least worth a try

tryhard kontol
It was more pain that I thought it would be Great experience though with all stealth melee
Absolute dogshit user interface Who thought having chromatic aberration on ALL of the text boxes was a good idea Why do i have to load mouse buttons And why the fuck is the UI for my ammo almost transparent and on the top right of the screen Whoever designed this clearly didnt think about convenience
Been years battery glitch is not fixed imagine running the same mission 4 times with 4 different teams just to glitch exact same way at the very end To make it worse mission takes 2h to do so i just wasted 8h Otherwise game would be my daily go to However i'm not risking buying it just to glitch on something so stupid FIX THE GAME
Very unfortunate game Feels more like get the fuck out of this game
The hell this game surprised me so much with his quality Every single detail i carefully done Terminal typing and display is very realistic and it's a fun touch in the game I just finished one match and I really really enjoyed it Menus and interactions can be VERY confusing not knowing where to search can be a pain in the ass but just stick to a terminal and get the info you need Try it now on free weekend and you won't regret it
Not rewarding enough just stress and thanking god to have finally finished the mission
Fun with friends I dont have any
is amazing and really fun to play wiht friends one wrong move and your dead

one wrong move and you're dead

Dear free weekend players mald lol
Really enjoyed playing it with friends and the fact it doesn't explicitly tell you which way to go Totally buying it once the free weekend is over
OK
Good game played on the free weekend thing was fun If the dev's do read these please guys please fix the matchmaking I am just trying to invite my brother to play with me and search for other teammates kicks him almost every time and sometimes doesn't even search
Oh god where do I start The good immersive environment The Bad Game about stealth that has the most boring stealth gameplay I've ever seen game designed for friend squads only Solo with Randoms is a terrible experience Terrible UI no progression system No tutorials for newcommers Boring combat gunplay feels awful and melee is not satisfying Can't change difficulty unnecessarily hard and not well balanced level designed way too long and the same happens every time hack fight repeat 3/10 There's too many fun games with better and more accessible hord shooters style out there and wasting your time on this is not a good idea
This game is a great free to play experience The game is very original with great ideas However it is plagued with stupid choices which is why I won't be buying it It starts from the launch when you are greeted with screams and a loading hud that you can't skip even after the first launch You have to press a key to display every player life and status yet you can't get a team status display in the hud Nonetheless you are bombarded with stupid texts constantly You have to hold a key to do everything Picking something up using it or validating something hell even a setting change in the menu Now I understand that it might be a VR thing however you should at least be able to turn this off It really ruins the immersion and pace of the game At deeper level I found the game unbearable You are looking at 60-120min game crouch in the shadows planning melee attacks It's really not for everyone you are far way from your typical coop shooter
Not going to lie at this price point I'd expected a better matchmaking system to be in place Game's using b]exclusively P2P[/b So you either host a match yourself with bots or be in a constant loop of trying to finding a proper game or a working lobby Sure you could also just host a match with 3 of your friends or players you find on their Discord but this is all but a temporal fix and definitely not for the long run Have been eyeing this game for a long time but never really had a reason to make the purchase I dig the aesthetics the game and gunplay seems fun but overall the P2P matchmaking system is a deal-breaker for me If you don't mind the P2P or at the very least have a group of friends that you can play with game's a no-brainer purchase But thanks to the free weekend it has allowed me to properly make my final decision Such a shame
En mi vida me dado por c*lo tan fuerte
Fun COOP game Not for solo players Need friends with at least 1 IQ to make it through D
Finally a game with FOV slider Ranges from 20 to 120 this is vertical FOV so horizontal equivalent is from 35 to 144 its in brackets anyways in the settings 90 vertical FOV is just right for me that is 120 horizontal FOV equivalence Thumbs up just for the FOV slider D
a really good game if you put the time into learning it you cant play it casually

Have you ever wanted to play Left 4 Dead expect you have no ammo and you have to stealth everywhere with the worlds most boring stealth combat I get that this game is supposed to be a hardcore game but my God this game is just painfully boring The developers have stated that this is their intended design and fans will also say this is the intended design its supposed to be very slow and tactical The problem with GTFO is that it's just not fun what so ever The shooting and melee combat in GTFO does not feel good and despite some good presentation the enemy design and environment design is boring GTFO is not a hardcore game its a boring game that punishes the hell out of you in order to create a false sense of a hardcore game Its like if regular enemies in Dark Souls took a hundred hits to kill and killed you in one or two hits it wouldn't be fun it would just be annoying

Mechanics and tech wise it's fine it's just braindead boring perfect for zoomers and streamers
Free Weekend Player I am not entertained I really like the idea of coop in this game but this game tries so hard to push me away From stupid console mechanic to lame stealth manuevering I was hoping for more action I think I'll pass on this game for good unless they make a huge rework on fighting monsters and pathfinding mechanics

I got it for free but it literally dosent work and made both my monitors go black so I can't recommend this game even if its free
Taking advantage of the weekend to try it out I downloaded the game Due to the lack of guidance I can't play it at all Only random matching two teammates came Thinking of following them they too got lost After that the two of them quit the game one after another I was the only one left and was eventually killed by the monster How lucky I am to express my mood with a song

Ich dachte ich probiere mal das Free Weekend ich die Zeit doch lieber in was sinnvolleres investiert An und sich ist das Spiel ja nicht schlecht Allerdings scheitern die Gruppen an den Missionen Und eine neue Gruppe zu finden oder die Gruppe wieder zu ist einfach furchtbar und Zeit aufreibend Falls die Gruppensuche dir jemanden zuweisen sollte Alle 3-4 Missionsversuche das Spiel dann auch noch voll ab Und ich hab jetzt wirklich keinen schlechten Rechner Im Gegenteil D.h Spiel erstmal wieder starten Bis man dann wieder im Rundown ist eine Gruppe/Spieler gefunden hat da hab selbst ich schon Spiele erleben die wesentlich runder laufen Allein von der bisherigen Kritik her Da bin ich noch nicht auf Sound Bots und Steuerung eingegangen Will ich auch ehrlich gesagt nicht mehr
played it no free weekend and this piece of flark can't stop crashing what is this 3\10
You need to fire everyone except the graphical designer Game looks great UI gameplay Tutorials are all nothing short of abysmal
I can remember way back when i saw that trailer at E3 wow those futuristic cave men with clubs trying to crouch and stealth melee throughout the whole game sure looks like the most boring repetitive and creatively bankrupt gameplay in a sci-fi future setting i have seen in a while I wasn't wrong
Literally full of bugs when I died and respawned at last checkpoint I couldn't pick up ANYTHING not even my own mines nor my teammates
I've had this game on my wishlist for a while and now I'm going to take it off while also being grateful that I didn't buy it You have no idea what is happening because there is no story introduction which leaves you going okay most of the time making the game confusing to play The game throws you into a match without giving any guidance leaving you to fumble around in the dark literally looking for what you are meant to do to progress There is a delay when you shoot/melee enemies and a headshot does not kill them either which makes combat frustrating Finding supplies such as medkits cannot be saved for later and must be used immediately oh and also only provides you with 20 health
it's weird man The gunplay feels weird You get tongued by weird ass monsters Couldn't beat the frist level
I mean it looks nice and runs good and has a great atmosphere but I wish It had single player component and more interesting enemies
Cool concept but badly executed Tutorial very brief with how to play The terminals are explained not very well on how to use them Game feels really unpolished for a game out of early access Not sure how this game got a very positive rating on steam because this is one of the most confusing games I have played nothing is explained well On performance aspects the game ran pretty well the only issue I had was when I queued up for a match 2 of people who were in the lobby quit because the game took so long to load into the match So in summary for my free weekend review I'd say update the tutorial and explain on how to use the terminal better because like me and so many others we have no idea how to use it Its bringing down the whole game experience So right now I can't recommend this game

Why does the enemies do not die from a headshot very disappointed thought this game was good but it is a tedious mess Says it horror but it loses the spooky factor when you get to restart the mission multiple times It's hard in the way that you easily run out of ammo to bullet sponges and can easily die if you don't pay attention spoiler]GTFO can GTFO of my library lmao back to fortnite baby See ya all in Amongus[/spoiler
The game does not convey the story or gameplay well enough in the tutorial I would never recommend this game The fingers don't move or even touch the keyboard in the terminal and the game doesnt show me well enough what i need to do
OK
GTFO from my library
AS much as the concept is good the gameplay and the gib system overall are not enjoyable Go play killing floor or aliens firearms elite instead
this game is legit trash couldn't even load into one game with my friends lol this would be a full on waste of anyone's money i don't care if they sold this for a 1 i still wouldn't spend money on it for a fact i wouldn't play the game if it was free because oh wait you cant even load into one match please save your money for anything but this game
worst game ever played
Vu le contenu et le jeu en lui il devrait passer f2p parce que la c'est clairement le pire jeu auquel j'ai jouer cette
Game suffers from the same issue that a lot of games today require Mandatory parties If you have friends you'll have a blast if you're alone you won't even be able to play
yes
this is the most disgraceful game of all times unspecific instructions
THIS GAME IS FOR FRIENDS OR PPL w MIC SOLELY designed to be played with friends there's no room for errors too susceptible for griefing in in public match friendly fire checkpoints rambo etc that's a NO for me but thank you for giving us a chance to try this game on free weekend recommended bcuz dev gave us free weekends to try this game
Muy malo esta totalmente desbalanceado las armas hacen un comparado con la resistencia del enemigo y la que te dan aun el el modo normal es Los escenarios aburridos visto uno visto todos
very cool
Sadly I didn't like it as much as I thought by watching the videos I loved the part that you had to learn everything by playing rather than with a Here's how to do it in-game tutorial I've also had the luck to play with very experienced players but that's the issue This game presents itself as the dark/horror FPS where Stealth Planning is the key as you can see from the videos It is until you complete a level Then it's just people speedrunning an entire room with just the melee weapon I've seen 1 guy clearing an entire room full of enemies alone with his hammer by running from one enemy to the other I understand that it's normal for experienced players to do that but where the hell is the fun in that Where is the anxiety the feeling an horror game should give you If you like shooters with horror graphics it's for you but don't expect much more as there's nothing else
too bad for its price still nothing changed or became even worse no wonder nobody wants to play it x this game deserve to die for real xDD
Not my thing really feels chaotic no seamless introduction Not clear how to choose different class at the start enemies suddenly appeared on the map very unclimactic
Not fun A stealth game that gives you virtually zero ammo but forces you into extended firefights at doors It expects you to lose over and over while trying to figure out what equipment works in what situations through trial and failure And you have to do the long boring repetitive stealth sections over and over to get back to the door firefight that killed you Really poorly designed game flow Glad I tried it on a free weekend
Terrible graphics and terrible gameplay The game looks like something from 2001 and the gameplay is just really crap Thank god this was a free trial and that I didnt spend any money at all on it 50 mintues of gameplay and now its a uninstall 0/5
After only 5 hours of game play which mind you I never noticed how long I was playing for I have thoroughly enjoyed myself The community in the discord is very friendly and helpful There is support from every angle and the game play is phenomenal I am playing on a free-access weekend at the time of this review as well I am definitely gonna save up some money to buy this game it's loads of fun and addicting
trash game
It Just feels like a boring indie game and matchmaking is broken Good thing i got it for free

Deep Rock Galactic
VEry fun Very challenging
1.5 2 5
Not my type of fun Repetitive
Even with a decent system which can play resource extensive games without a problem this game wont run past 20 fps in best case scenario The game was fine in EA but became a waste of space on my system I really want to play this game I have enjoyed it during the EA phase where the same system was pushing 120 fps for me I have tried everything I could to make it run nothing works The vram goes full what the hell is it loading in the memory I can get by the fact that I'll probably never be able to play the previous rundowns but this is just stupid and a waste of money For anyone who doesn't have a system strong enough to contain a fully functioning Artificial Super Intelligent being do not bother buying this game given the fact that you wont be able to play previous rundowns is a let down on it's own which I was fine with because I really enjoyed the game What a waste I am really regretting buying this game for the fact that despite having it I won't be able to play it becaus it is a steamiing pile of an unoptimized mess
Thanks for free weekend save my money a lot
lindo
game is broken
shhh
IT GOOD IT REAL GOOD
It's like a bunch of developers got together and decided to bring out the worst video game mechanics There is nothing more boring than a stealth game
I really don't have fun with this game I played it with my friend together The Parts where you have to sneak and meele enemies is very boring It is just patience not gameplay And doing that in every Run feels chewy

Absolutely not worth 40 dollars Maybe 10 and even then I would wait for a sale Garbage graphics runs poorly on a 30s series card and sound is incredibly buggy Bad game

start_filtration_unit my beloved
Mano curti muito pelo menos bem melhor que R6 Extraction mas me diverti muito sinto algo esquito nesse game mas sei exatamente o que talvez a IA e o level design do game Tem muitos bugs Se o fosse melhor talvez valesse a pena mas nesse acho que vale
bew bew bew
Not fun enough to have so little checkpoints
I am so happy they did this free time The game is so under whelming and I cannot handle scary games to save my life
Very good game to lose all your friends to a faceless spaghetti monster
my favorite rule of horror games if something scary happens shoot everything 10/10

played the free weekend and it was buggy as
A game with the steepest of learning curves outside of the first one or two story missions They have a gold border Do not expect to be able to run and gun through rooms and objectives and still win I've been holding off for a long time on picking this up because of the toe licking around difficulty and I'm glad I have It looks like as of the last two Rundowns the devs have put some serious effort in easing the difficulty curve and providing a better new player experience Speaking of Rundowns did you know every few months they rotate the content in the game with new guns and completely new story content It's kinda sick 11/10 would accidentally shove a giant striker and wiping the run by double tapping c again
CI
Just keeps getting better and better with every Rundown A masterpiece
Upon entering the first game i let the cinematic play and it made me feel like i was about to play the most amazing Pandorum movie themed video game Unfortunately there is 0 tutorial that i could see nothing that says you should basically never use your gun unless a whole group is charging you The menu as a whole is the most atrocious thing I have ever seen This game has the perfect atmosphere and its ruined by poor UI and poor new player experience I may give it some more time and update my review but the groups i've been with are the most oblivious people I have ever seen and its not even their fault
GTFO
Needs saves on checkpoints once the devs add this feature I will say 8/10 Right now 6/10 some of the levels are sloppily designed unbalanced and over-reliant on weapon selection The later is a good thing usually but the weapons themselves are not balanced in terms of damage/supply/etc You can play with bots but sometimes they bug out and do not get resupplied or just get stuck in place during the security scan phase very frequently happens when it is a moving one In terms of previously mentioned sloppy level design let me elaborate on one such occasion Level C2 of Rundown 6 You have to start up the generators to get rid of the green poisonous gas Some of the rooms have it some of them do not And sometimes when you open one of the doors while you have multiple choices of which one to open there just happens to be a gas leakage which puts gas into rooms which did not have it in the first place Checkpoints are sometimes too far apart and a general playthrough of mid-high diffiulty levels solely relies on how those checkpoints were placed evenly or absolutely randomly Such playthroughs may take from 1.5 hours to 5 hours the latter of which require too much time and dedication to sit in one go Yes the biggest downfall of this game is the absolute complete disregard of the devs towards the player time You cannot save on a checkpoint to continue on a later day Nope Either ruin your sleep and nerves trying and memorizing everything or just quit with no progress done at all So yeah right now advised only for those who do not value their time or have an exceptional team to coop with Just add the saves on checkpoints devs bruh
The Concept of this game is great Unfortunately this game is not for me
This game is a load of ass
looks fun
baixei esse game e meu HD simplesmente parou
Wow just wow After all the hype they put out for this game the beautiful trailers and so on This was a colossal disappointment The difficulty is wildly unpredictable and completely freakin random One second you're just plodding along killing mobs doing your thing the next you're being swarmed by a group of creatures no one could possibly fight off without any reason or rhyme The hit boxes in this game are laughably bad The mobs themselves erratically teleport and glitch around vibrate when they move and have absolutely awful animations What were they thinking making a free weekend for this trash They literally just signed their own game's death warrant Because no one in their right mind would play this and buy it on purpose Seriously don't even waste your time on installing it for free I'm not mad just very disappointed
There's more letters in the name of the game than players playing it
BUGS
10/10 te comen la cola
Feels like an early access game it's not worth the full price Interface is beautiful and the concept of the game is cool but it feels way too bland and repetitive
Con los minutos que pude disfrutarlo me di cuenta que hay que jugarlo si o si con amigos porque si no es muy disfrutarlo Excelente juego
Genera mucha tension y es muy hardcore muy recomendado
I'm guessing the positive trend here is a review bomb because this game is absolutely terrible Wander around a map in the dark where excitement is truly few and far between There are dozens of annoying doors some are locked behind quick time events or a charged melee attack and then you're off to the next barely lit room with a smattering of enemies It's like they took the game play loop of a survival horror and left 4 dead but only kept the suspenseful parts in between all of the action So many games pull this off better Don't waste your time with this one
Play if you like pain
not do that again
game has this stupid interface that hurts to look at
Stand in a circle simulator 2021 0/10 It's pretty and it's cool that you can draw on the map but everything else is bad The tutorial barely even explains how to play You're always out of ammo Ammo packs barely restore ammo It's a bad time Why the HELL do you need to stand in moving circles to unlock doors
Got this for free weekend and I am super underwhelmed had it on my wishlist forever To clear up why there is many bad reviews on free weekend The First User Experience for this game is INSANELY BAD The menus UI are definitely an aesthetic but that should be a menu toggle or something because they are just awful functionality wise and a pain to have to sit through and use It is all just really ugly and just I hate them with a passion weapon selection is good and simple however liked that Beginning of the game can be boring spent literally 25 minutes walking around struggling with terminals and where to go before actually fighting aliens only to die straight away because I had no idea what they were and where they were coming from That would be an uninstall refund moment Core game is what really sells it the 4 players using mic in the scary hell hole barely getting through with your life which is GTFO at it's best is just an incredible rush and experience But actually getting to that point for a new player trying it out is pretty impossible unless you got 3 friends because 90 of the mm players have no mics even if you set it to ONLY MICS USERS ALLOWED Unless I had 3 friends to play with as only having the few randoms I am getting right now I wouldn't pay more than 10 euro for the game as is Really relies on getting 3 good teammates with mics without that you will just have ugly experience that will make you uninstall I still have faith definitely wont be buying anytime soon but I feel like the First User Experience can be improved in the next year Cant really give a rating because right now it would be a 2 I haven't had to chance to get the full 4 player co op team experience yet Only watched it online P
This game is dogshit Comically terrible Wander around in the dark with no ammo and a flashlight that illuminates 4 feet in front At least we have our melee weapons right Nope flying enemies spawn now flying enemies in a game where you're lucky to find 2 ammo pouches a game At least stealth is an option Except for the 8 mandatory alarm doors oh and to perform stealth all 4 members of your party have to pause perfectly still for 3 seconds every 5 seconds I played this game on a free weekend and honestly free is asking too much for this game
Hard pass
weno
trash can boring game
Very strange also very cool Must have 4 players in voice chat though
Guns
mom pick me up I'm scared
simulador da jaqueo
no los 50 min de vida hijos puta
cuando tenga servidores decentes recien ahi pueden exigir plata mientras tanto no sirve ni de acceso anticipado o de fin de semana gratuito una poronga
cant get through first stage because bots just wander away also this company is owned by tencent
good game
SHIT GAME ALL BUGGED GRABBED THE NEO NAZ AND GOT BUGGED FUCK THIS
It's not very good and very glitchy
eh
The game outright refuses to be played crashing in the drop animation every time I start a rundown How does a game that has been in early access for so long remain plagued with issues like this is beyond me The matchmaking is also very broken and the optimization for a lack of a better word isn't even there Devs I beg you to get your priorities straight
Ideia identica ao do Space Hulk Deathwing mas sem as heavy armours e com servidores ainda cheios Jogabilidade e de um Dead Space com Left 4 Dead Cuecas borradas paciencias testadas e amizades terminadas Sai do jogo mais tenso do que estava antes de jogar Compra que vale o stress
GTFO of my library
Probably the worst game of this genre I've played You do the same thing over and over the gun play is not great Play any other game like it and you will be happier
Don't play it
Health system sucks imo because you cant just run it down and break all the game elements of being stealthy
Dark gore fast and fun
game is a bit slow sometimes but it makes the intense moments better overall i really dig this game nice mix of horror and shoot em up
Gracias a dios lo desinstale
fun scary epic story love it
i think about this game 24/7 it needs to gtfo of my head also big strike]mommy[/strike i mean mother
Me gusta la idea del juego en general el trabajo en equipo la comunicacion y el ambiente de cada escenario a superar Lo unicoo que deben pulir el la interfaz del juego y la forma de emparejar es un poco incomoda y a veces confusa para algunos Por ahora el juego va por muy buen camino y la idea del mismo es muy original
Sehr geiles game mal was anderes Grafik 9,0 Sound 9,0 Gameplay 8,5
3 nice game
Atmosferi rahmen ve silah mekanik olarak rezalet buldum
even for free its terrible crap
Rezalet bir oyundu Silahlar berbat berbat gelecekte diye abuk subuk scope falan
10/10 game the teamwork required is perfect and can also lead to some pretty hillarious moments at times and in general plays well and looks great
god this game is good it's the absolute best
Too hard
tried this game on free weekend i can see the appeal cause as a multiplayer game its actually really and takes a lot of skill to clear zones unlike me with no skills and no friends to play this with i don't think i will buy it but i would still recommend it if you have a lot of skills and some friends to play this with then yes go for it unless you can beat it without friends then give it a shot
GTFO is a very difficult game the rewards patience and precision I have a lot of fun playing this with my friends

Baita jogasso jogo pra clan fechado e organizado um pve de alto nivel compensa se seus outros 3 amigos forem bem coordendos com vc vira uma aventura das mais gloriosas no aleatorio pode demora pa achar alguem bom boa vontade geral tem mas esse jogo exige preparo pq basicamente um jogo de batmans bom mas exige preparo
its alot of fun even by yourself
This game feels like a mess of good ideas executed incredibly poorly The FOV doesn't scale with ADS so it's jarring to even aim The UI is a cluttered mess way too much on screen and the stupid effects they're using on text etc is an eyesore The guns are a mess bring in customisation to stop this Seriously who puts a thermal scope on an smg Were they high Content has been removed from what I see in the patch notes I had an issue while trying the game where an AI couldn't come stand in the security check bit because he was endlessly climbing up and down ladders causing us to die and waste an hour of my time As said above I love the premise And sometimes the game even gives off Alien vibes with the environment but that doesn't really matter if the games a chore to play All in all games got it's merits They're just overshadowed by the negatives and that'd be okay it's a new game Only it's not and was in early access long enough
COULDN'T F*CK1NG PLAY IT CAN'T START THIS SH1T ALWAYS CRASH WTH3LL
Potente
BULL$H!T like zombies like resident evil like horror survivor like left 4 dead THEN THIS GAME NOT FOR YOU no players BUY FOR 40 HAHAHA BUY FOR 10 HAHAHAHAH BUY FOR 1.5 HAHAHAHHAHAHAH FREE AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THANK YOU BUT NO
When your tutorial is vaguely unhelpful or even OUTRIGHT WRONG enough to make you go This is stupid
First off the spaghetti monsters are pretty scary Sadly there's no incentive to replay the game but on first playthrough its pretty neat especially with friends Some semblance of patience timing and coordination are very welcome should you try this though its not necessarily needed Wouldn't pay the asking price in a million years though lmao 6/10
didnt make 15 mins
Showwwwwwwwwww
20 minutes in queue and still didn't find a match
fun immersive might buy if I dont get bored of it
Good game no matter what you do you die always
AI SUCKS
Buen juego hay que pensar bien la estrategia
Should be 9.99 after reading about how previous content gets removed melee needs to be like Vermintide 2 and jumping down from a short distance shouldn't injure my character I'd rather buy Darktide
Se gosta de dificuldade elevada ficar frustrado ter que repetir a mesma fase e vezes falhar miseravelmente de forma recorrente depender de amigos para auxiliar xingar seus amigos e colocar tudo a perder por um erro esse jogo perfeito para Embora ele comece com o tempo ele continua tem pra onde fugir se tiver amigos para jogar contigo as coisas facilitam pois depois que jogarem a mesma fase por 3h e perderem em quem colocar a culpa A atmosfera do game possui um alto grau de terror o jogo compartilha da mesma que se trata de um cooperativo hardcore com gerenciamento de recursos que por sinal escassos um jogo muito divertido frustrante interessante para se jogar com amigos e colocar a culpa das falhas neles recomendo
New player experience is very weird and too hard Had issues with going through initial main menu how to start a game with friends Very stiff animations Weapons have no feedback Melee weapons feels like HL1 weapon with range of 1 Scavenge open doors kill hordes stealth kills scavenge repeat No shooty bang bang just stealth with wonky melee no ammo for extented gunfights No clear visual feedback when you get hit or damage never know what hit me from a range its not fun Compared to Killing Floor 2 2015 its a huge letdown in terms of graphics animations sound design gunplay and enemy variety or how they respond to melee/bullets Thank you for free test it only made me more eager to pre order Darktide
game is more awful every patch
The main thing i don't like is that this isn't a singleplayer game I don't care for co-op multiplayer Weapons felt weak Graphics looked good and it ran well I played the free weekend but I won't be purchasing
THIS GAME IS PAIN V(-_-)Z
Muito obrigado Steam me proporcional altas aventuras e risadas em um jogo que estava muito caro Agora tenho certeza que vou comprar o jogo Que jogo
richtiges spiel ich the last of us bootleg 2022 aber bocktn icht missionen richtig repetiv und dumm programmiert aber sieht gut aus
Weapons have no impact pacing makes you sleepy you get stuck in the what do I do/where the fuck do I go situations shotguns have no spread maps like a generic Doom spin off environments are non-destructible And instead of tapping E for use or LMB to click stuff you need to hold it for 1.5 sec because devs need to larp this cringy gamer hacker theme GTFO as far away as you can from this game
Muito bug de tomei dano de inimigo atras da parede um monte de vez interface tbm Parece jogo em beta/alpha
Do not buy this game if you are not playing with friends or if you do not want to use their discord to find people to play with The matchmaking is nonexistent and as the game warns you using the matchmaking will more than likely match you with glue sniffers Friends is obviously fun and I've had mostly positive experiences with the discord matchmaking except for one metagaming monkey fuck with 2000 hours that refused to communicate and expected us to know what he was doing by divining the state of the fog around the spot he was soyfacing on it was where the first scan was shame on me for not having a precognitive dream about it Bots do exist if you want to play alone but micromanaging them is a pain and don't expect to get far into the rundown with them A levels are doable solo with bots B is a stretch and i didn't even try C and D solo with 3 bots 2 players 2 bots is manageable tho Outside of this the gameplay is red light green light squid game for about 75 of the time chaotic clusterfuck scans the rest of the time Planning is a must for these swarms and darkness and fog are legitimate problems you need to work around not just for atmosphere There are methods of abusing the game through knowing all the rules of spawning and aggro and what not but it takes away from the fun and challenge I pretend not to know them and is also why i recommend watching and reading as few guides as possible All you need to know starting out is don't move or shine your light on them when they're glowing especially not when they're pulsing save on ammo and resources terminals are your friends back of the head is the weakest spot and fully charged melee hits almost always kill there TLDR great game if you have friends and/or aren't socially inept in the discord Go in as blind as possible
Matchmaking is dead don't bother
giga naze
Honestly GAME is SHITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
dead game
biggest trash i ever played in a while 100 would not recommend to anyone sad
dead game
jogo brabo
SUCKS YOU THINK GUNS AND SHOOTING THIS OUT TO BE FUN YOU WILL FALL ASLEEP caps just makes it easy to read
10\10 zona a1
this is a really good game with tuns of fun with friends
Rare is the game that loses me in the first 10 minutes The UI is a nightmare everything moving and floating and glitch-sfx everywhere Got motion-sick just from trying to navigate the settings to find a way to stop the nonsense and failed If there's a tutorial I must have missed it because before I knew it I was matched up with a team and we sat there for a long time watching the unskipable scene of my team going down a tunnel I guess for a few minutes Can't chat just sit there and stare at the darkness for a while Go make some coffee The very first thing to do is type some stuff into a terminal and suddenly I'm supposed to be a linux admin Quit the game uninstalled Videos of this game are nothing like what I experienced they should change the name from GTFO to PTSD

World War Z
Physics engine when hitting enemies and watching blood splutter runs at something like 30 fps and is laughably amateur in the physics handling Parts blow up everywhere with Doomlike cartoon gore while 2D-rendered blood splatters moving at 30 fps make me laugh every time I kill an enemy The combat feels a bit like the original 1960s Batman series with POW and BLAM popping up in your face when hitting an enemy making the whole thing feel too comedic for me to take seriously
Le jeu est payant donc
I absolutely love this game and take note that this is coming from a guy who isn't usually into games that focused on technology or guns The gameplay itself is fantastic a chance to finally put forward strategy and actual brainpower as opposed to running in guns blazing though this also means your teammates have to do the same lest they ruin the run by making a stupid mistake The level design is a bit bland in some places as there are a lot of reused assets and room layouts that are placed around but in general it does nothing to mess with the game's feel as the Complex is designed to seem like a maze and give a sense of loneliness What gets me most interested in the game though is that it actually remains challenging and even if you are on the last level of the rundown you can still get completely screwed over on the first level if you make too many mistakes This game lives up to its slogan work together or die together 100 recommend purchasing this game but only if you have a group of friends who are also interested that is clincher when it comes to this game You need a team you work well with else the fun of the game is significantly lessened
Am now terrified of the color green thanks

gtfo of this game so much story
Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A Italian is an Italian luxury car manufacturer and a subsidiary of Stellantis The company was founded on 24 June 1910 in Milan Italy Alfa is an acronym of its founding name Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili Anonima means anonymous which was a legal form of company at the time as it was founded by anonymous investors In the initial set-up phase in order to have a building to produce cars the company bought the Portello factory building of Darracq in Milan which was closing up and selling all its assets.[3 The brand is known for sport-oriented vehicles and has been involved in car racing since 1911 Alfa Romeo was owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles the company that was responsible for the production of Alfa Romeo cars until its operations were fully merged with those of the PSA Group to form Stellantis on 16 January 2021 The first car produced by the company was the 1910 24 HP designed by Giuseppe Merosi A.L.F.A ventured into motor racing with drivers Franchini and Ronzoni competing in the 1911 Targa Florio with two 24-hp models In August 1915 the company came under the direction of Neapolitan entrepreneur Nicola Romeo who converted the factory to produce military hardware for the Italian and Allied war efforts In 1920 the name of the company was changed to Alfa Romeo with the Torpedo HP the first car to be so badged In 1921 the Banca Italiana di Sconto which backed the Ing Nicola Romeo Co went bankrupt and the government needed to support the industrial companies involved of which Alfa Romeo was among through the Consorzio per Sovvenzioni sui Valori Industriali In 1925 the railway activities were separated from the Romeo company and in 1928 Nicola Romeo left In 1933 the state ownership was reorganized under the banner of the Italian state industrial organization Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale IRI which then had effective control The company struggled to return to profitability after the Second World War and turned to mass-producing small vehicles rather than hand-building luxury models In 1954 it developed the Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine which would remain in production until 1994 The Istituto per la Ricostruzione IRI the state conglomerate that controls Finmeccanica sold the marque to the Fiat Group in 1986 due to the marque being unprofitable.[4 Alfa Romeo has competed successfully in Grand Prix motor racing Formula One sportscar racing touring car racing and rallies It has competed both as a constructor and an engine supplier via works entries usually under the name Alfa Corse or Autodelta and private entries The first racing car was made in 1913 three years after the foundation of the company and Alfa Romeo won the inaugural world championship for Grand Prix cars in 1925 The race victories gave a sporty image to the marque and Enzo Ferrari founded the Scuderia Ferrari racing team in 1929 as an Alfa Romeo racing team before becoming independent in 1939 It has had the most wins of any marque in the world.[5 Contents 1 History 1.1 Name 1.2 Foundation and early years 1.3 Post war 1.4 Fiat takeover 1.5 Recent developments 1.6 Return to North America 2 Design and technology 2.1 Technological

The company's name is a combination of the original name A.L.F.A Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili and the last name of entrepreneur Nicola Romeo who took control of the company in 1915 Foundation and early years A 1908 Darracq 8/10 HP assembled by Alfa Romeo's predecessor Darracq Italiana The A.L.F.A 24 hp this is with Castagna torpedo body was the first car made by Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili A.L.F.A in 1910 The first factory building of A.L.F.A was in the first place property of Anonima Italiana Darracq SAID founded in 1906 by the French automobile firm of Alexandre Darracq with some Italian investors One of them Cavaliere Ugo Stella an aristocrat from Milan became chairman of the SAID in 1909.[6 The firm's initial location was in Naples but even before the construction of the planned factory had started Darracq decided late in 1906 that Milan would be more suitable and accordingly a tract of land was acquired in the Milan suburb of Portello where a new factory of 6,700 square metres 8,000 sq yd was constructed In late 1909 the Italian Darracq cars were selling slowly and the company was wound up.[7 Ugo Stella with the other Italian co-investors founded a new company named A.L.F.A Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili buying the assets of Italian Darracq that was up to dissolution.[7 The first car produced by the company was the 1910 24 HP designed by Giuseppe Merosi hired in 1909 for designing new cars more suited to the Italian market Merosi would go on to design a series of new A.L.F.A cars with more powerful engines such as the HP A.L.F.A ventured into motor racing with drivers Franchini and Ronzoni competing in the 1911 Targa Florio with two 24-hp models In 1914 an advanced Grand Prix car was designed and built the GP1914 with a

1915 the company came under the direction of Neapolitan entrepreneur Nicola Romeo who converted the factory to produce military hardware for the Italian and Allied war efforts Munitions aircraft engines and other components compressors and generators based on the company's existing car engines were produced in a vastly enlarged factory during the war After the war Romeo invested his war profits in acquiring locomotive and railway carriage plants in Saronno Costruzioni Meccaniche di Saronno Rome Officine Meccaniche di Roma and Naples Officine Ferroviarie Meridionali which were added

Giuseppe Merosi continued as head designer and the company continued to produce solid road cars as well as successful race cars including the HP and the RL Targa Florio In 1923 Vittorio Jano was lured from Fiat partly due to the persuasion of a young Alfa racing driver named Enzo Ferrari to replace Merosi as chief designer at Alfa Romeo The first Alfa Romeo under Jano was the P2 Grand Prix car which won Alfa Romeo the inaugural world championship for Grand Prix cars in 1925 For road cars Jano developed a series of small-to-medium-displacement 4 6 and 8-cylinder inline engines based on the P2 unit that established the architecture of the company's engines with light alloy construction hemispherical combustion chambers centrally located plugs two rows of overhead valves per cylinder bank and dual overhead cams Jano's designs proved both reliable and powerful Enzo Ferrari proved a better team manager than a driver and when the factory team was privatised it became Scuderia Ferrari When

Game is for those who like a challenge and don't mind taking their time Not a run gun type of game sneaking is required for most of the game To play online you need friends or to join the discord If you're like me and joining the discord and planning with strangers doesn't sound fun then you'll need friends to play with If you don't have friends willing to play the game with you don't even waste your time playing with the bot teammates by yourself or even buying the game

That game is the definition of constipation

Boring af
Fkin piece of shiet leading by dumb game-design and pin that appear in walls and you cannot proceed NOT RECOMMENDED Don't even in on free fear
Its better than initially but the gunplay is simply not good Too much camera movement no impactful weapons etc
everyone is giving this game good reviews And its a good game its fun Its what a video game should be On your own the bots are cheesy and cheaty as fuck But if you manage to get a 4 man team its pretty awesome But thats where this review and game ends Because there isnt a single person playing And then IF you get a whole team One of them will quit then someone else will quit And you go back to main menu Fun game good fun environment good fun graphics Lots of super cool immersion I feel like the name didnt attract many players cause people didnt take it seriously and probably thought it was just another steam game asset flip mobile pile of human dogshit that every game has been the past 15 years I feel like it wouldve had a much bigger and longer lasting playerbase if it had a better title name than gtfo Its not an offensive name Doesnt hurt my feelings Dont give a shit about professionalism in a video game But i remember when it released i didnt think twice about it cause i never saw any advertising or marketing for it So when I saw the title popping up in the steam store front page I just assumed it was another small indy dev team trying to make it big Which isnt bad But we are all sick and fucking tired of god damn early access asset flips so I didnt want to waste my money on a game i wasnt familiar with and didnt know anything about I just assumed that it simply wasnt going to be a game that interests me But then I saw a video of someone playing and i was like oooooh what is this it looks fun And thankfully I was able to download it on this free weekend But even on a free weekend not even a year after launch nobody is playing sad it is ONLY getting a downvote from me for the sole fact that you wont really be able to play it I think it has a solo ability I played what you could call the introduction then went online after finishing that part Hopefully you can run it in a solo mode Would be extremely challenging as everything is made for a 4 man team But still would be cool to play it solo if its my only option But like i said A game designed around 4 man coop with no playerbase is getting a downvote from me cause you really wont be able to play it online I think there is more going on behind the scenes than what we know Just think about something Every single triple A game in the industry with gambling loot boxes slot machines microtransactions are advertised and marketed into your brain But triple A games like this that dont have any of that dumb ass shit were barely even able to scratch the surface of the advertising world I dont think mainstream investors and studios want games like this to be even remotely successful Because it takes you away from all the credit card swiper simulators out there just look at that stupid dumb fucking overwatch game The ultimate credit card swipe simulator out there Has a fucking sequel WHICH IS THE EXACT SAME GAME AS THE FIRST THEY ARE LITERALLY SELLING THE FIRST GAME AGAIN TO THE MASSES OF STUPID BRAINLESS HUMANS THAT CANT EVEN DO BASIC MATH unbelievable gaming is dead EDIT Im not gonna downvote this game But beware the online coop is getting close to non existent

Sucks ass
Nie polecam zbugowane E Ale spoko gra na nudne wieczory
Hello friends this game is good Bye
they see us
7/10 would not reccomend not satisfying killing shit weapons were weird hard to find a lobby and when you do its just teamates that leave or not wanna do any work eh
Good fun but you need to have friends with the game to play it
Spent 10 minutes going through several lobbies with players disconnecting after game started Not really my kind of tea
recomendo mais vai aqui meus pontos positivos e negativos pontos negativos jogo tem uma altamente escura ai tudo bem mais o problema a lanterna parece que tem um sereno na frente da lanterna o que atrapalha de jogar e muito e acaba que o jogo fica borrado e para realmente ver um pouco melhor tem que usar a lanterna grande que tambem grande coisa Esse jogo foi feito para jogar solo impossivel se for jogar com os amigos fechando um time Pontos positivos jogo da uns sustos jogos tem um ambiente aterrorizante sim mais como falei a uma porcaria total existe jogos escuros que assusta mais do que esse tem habilidades e outras vantagem que torna o jogo estrategico minha final jogo feito para jogar com 4 pessoas jogo com uma extrema dificuldade de visualizar algo e grande parte do jogo obejetivo matar ordas e abrir portas
Jak smalec domowy w bardzo Rozgrzej najlepiej z grubym dnem na minimalny aby skwarki spokojnie a nie od razu przez 15 minut co czas
meu deus que jogo bugado
It's an endless nightmare in the dark I love it
BORING
So 10 min in the game no match making is possible every one is jumping out WTF hahahahahahahaha so delete this Scandinavian money grab shit
Its a good game but difficult 9/10
is good if playing with friends Matchmaking sucks 3
I asked my friends Is it possiple to catch fish in this game YES they answered well they lied 10 times out of 10 fish caught me
Pretty good game A very hard game also There is friendly fire in this game and the monsters are basically bioweapons or similar to SCPS I really like the hacking and trying to figure out how the terminals work they could locate the items around the zone that you're currently in Cons/Disappointments/Nitpicks Online is dead play this game with friends

oh man wo fange ich an Ich habe GTFO wegen des hohen Schwierigkeitsgrades immer sehr gerne gespielt damit ist es aber seit diesem Patch vorbei Hab mich damals schon die Checkpoint aufgeregt egal Ich bin ein alter Hase der seit beta spielt und mich regt es einfach nur auf das von Rundown zu Rundown die Runs leichter werden damit jeder Heijopai bzw Casualgamer oder 13 Pickelfratze sich GTFO holt hingen wir als Fullsquad Tage oder Wochen lang an einem LVL fest ich sag nur R3E1 Mittlerweile schaut das leider alles anders aus Hey Noob hier ich klatsch dir Resourcen ohne Ende auf die Map have fun Hey Noob du hast ne Stufe 4 Aktiviert macht aber nichts denn es kommen keine Horden mehr sondern 5-8 mobs WOW GTFO war immer bekannt nichts Casualgamer zu sein jetzt ist es genau son mist wie Resident Evil mehr nicht Meine Rezension richtet sich an Spielern die eine Herausforderung wollen Nicht kaufen Alle anderen Fortnite und Roblox Kiddies ABSOLUTE KAUFEMPFEHLUNG
Started from Rundown 6 This game is awesome Nice graphics stunning atmosphere and the thrill during an out of fights Great concept of a necessity for a team with 4 players It's easy to assemble a team on Discord The community is very welcoming Not for the faint hearted friends of mine and it's time to dwelve into Rundown 7 woot Update as of 13.11.2022 this game still kicks and I'd like to suffer more
Great game with a lot of effort being put into it
all these new games require constant updates of the entire reinstallation tired of the extra cost for data to keep the games updated
Wow this game is so spook and my teammate just set them all off
removes content such as maps and guns for no apparent reason
me
Teamwork is essential for success

From the start the game made itself known to be a challenge from becoming the next Sam Fisher to holding the line while you wait for Jeremy from accounting to finish his bioscan The range of weapons all have a unique quality that makes most of them a viable choice for either a personal choice or a situational benefit I've had my frustrations with the game mainly now with the bot mechanics as I believe they need some attention but are still fairly reliable but with those failures I find success something I yearn for more and more each time I make an ounce of progress in one expedition I recommend this game for anyone that likes to challenge themselves through multiple mechanics the game has to offer

scary light make me fright
game good need skill
Bom para jogar com amigos cabe 4 pra quem quiser saber
Amaze game pls get Playerbase is tiny and I'd easily classify this game as a hidden gem However runs are long and you need people to play with as there is technically a matchmaking system but it's not great and really a second thought This game is multitudes better with friends or discord chat anyways If you get this game and like its art direction sound design and gameplay ideas but are finding it a bit slow or difficult trust me Have patience There's something great to love here
need a group
It only took me three hours to complete the first mission on Solo running with bot teammates The bots are full of cheese If you hit them hard enough they might give you some
GTFO is best described as a heart racing heart wrenching horror thriller experience This game is very difficult and is bound to make you mad but that's ok Give it time have patience a LOT of patience With time you will complete the rundown
Well it is what you would expect A hardcore survival shooter which on harder levels require the team to play together The game is not completely unforgivable There are checkpoints and more ressources than you technically need So it is not for hardcore gamers only The game feels fresh within the flood of arcadic shooters and is really great at what it is trying to be The game is for people who are not just for running and blasting in every direction but are looking for a game with thrill patience stealth tactics and action
fun game
The difficulty feels artificial the animations look jank and the weapons feel horrible The game feels really repetitive in a not fun way Game is not worth 40 even if they decided to dump budget into their graphics Dont buy full price or at all dont buy without a collective group of dinguses wanting to throw 160 at a game that isn't all that fun
not very good
Like suffering Do you have 3 friends Do your friends like suffering If answer is yes then this game is for you
Brutal and fun Very stressful and resource management centered Every bullet counts
good game
its hard to gtfo
ok
I am a 58 yr father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 14 now My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories
Very GOOD Co-op game to suffer with ur bros
das game ist super gemacht die kreaturen sind auch richtig gruselig und sehr gut da auch ihren instinkt sehr schlau sind nur ich mir das man das spiel komplett auf deutsch um stellen kann und nicht nur halb da ich mit english garnicht kann aber an sonsten ist es sehr gut
funny creature go skree
This is a hard game and there is NO difficulty setting It isn't aimed towards casual players and is NOT a run and gun type game You must learn to be sneaky like a ninja and use your melee weapons as primary only falling back on your guns when needed which is most of the time Despite the difficulty it isn't unfair not very fast paced and totally doable if you have a well coordinated team with decent aim Think of it like a difficult raid in an mmo where everyone needs to work together or die together and wipe Your class is based on your load out sniper/shotty for big enemies high capacity machine guns for hordes of small guys high stagger weapons for support and boosters that you can earn which refines it even further such as giving more ammo or health with their respective kits I also like how the game gets rundown updates a few times a year which changes out all the maps and some weapons so it's a fresh experience and keeps the replayability high On top of that there is also no microtransactions and all cosmetics are earned through hard work and beating the levels
hard and boring
die in Nvidia GeForce Experience werden setzen alle einstellungen auf Standard Eine derartig schlechte Umsetzung/Implementierung ist mir noch nie untergekommen das ist echt peinlich Dazu dieses verschobene in den Einstellungen grenzt an man bekommt davon sehr schnell Kopfschmerzen bzw die Augen fangen sehr schnell an weh zu tun
CUNT
Makes me C-foam
Personally I would not regard this as a horror game Yes the game is dark and the monsters look grotesque but there are no jumpscares and the only way you can probably scare yourself is tripping yourself over a sleeping enemy which is quite hard to do as they make sound What GTFO is a unique hardcore coop tactical shooter The levels are mostly designed to be stealth heavy and generally has a strategic element to tackling each room and each level Not the kind of game where you can blast your way through due to limited resources Be warned that you're going to fail a lot until you figure out how to approach the level so sometimes it can be frustrating but at the same time satisfying when you finally win Get this game if you have a team of 4 because matchmaking and player population is a problem Or if looking for players in official GTFO discord is a thing for you an hour minimum of time to spare each gaming session not counting retries you enjoy a tactical approach to clearing a level you enjoy a challenge Also every new rundown think of it as season refreshes all the levels with new ones so you get to play new levels Note At point of writing that there are still bugs in the game that can end your run but there are usually ways to avoid them
trash
Makes a lot of fun and is at the same time so frustrating xD
good not as spooky as I would like but very intense and good
very fun not too scary just be retar and u be oke
just get it for the love of god
This game is an amazing experience it's difficulty is some times rage inducing but makes it all the better when you finally push your way through to the end One of the best games I've played in the last while 100 recomended
hola
Mega geiles Spiel
Too difficult takes too long to figure out I played the first level in co-op several times and wasn't able to finish it It would be nice if there were an easier mode for people who don't want to spend a lot of time figuring out the perfect strategies
true unique game pure co-op solo possible good BOTs but sometimes stupid BUT enemies are teleporting sometimes and could hit you through textures
I really like getting my ass schlurped by sleep-deprived creatures
UI HUD SF HUD AI ex 4 ex WORK TOGETHER OR DIE 10
Only buy if 1 You have money time at least 2 friends who have the game 2 It's on sale for 35 and below 3 Are a fan of horror and challenge If you tick all three just buy the game rn
fun as fuck and makes me poop my pants
Nice and scary
New missions soon Finally we can try to spend 20 hours on each new mission again
good soup
Very challenging though entertaining with friends and randoms online
I wished my friends liked it more It's got some weird issues like awkward save points not quite fleshed out enough stealth and obnoxious stand still while being attacked by a horde sections but the feel and tone is great It could also use more items for customisation IMO but there's still some room for experimentation
I am an avid PC gamer Mostly into FPS games and spend a lot of time on them Friendly and OH BOY do I love gadgets Cheers
Throw the C-foam nade at the door not the floor in front of it
I actually love this game Great graphics the sound design is amazing concept is something I've been looking for for the longest time and I love the fact that you can i]earn[/i boosts and things like that rather than have to spend money to get packs of them and roll the dice with good old RN-Jesus seriously tho this is a perfect game to play with your friends When I tell people about it I always explain Think of it as like a game where every mission is a raid mission But you have to stop and think rather than just prep and go in guns blazing Praises being said there are some complaints Great graphics but that's hard to appreciate when you keep getting a heavy rain's worth of blood trickle down slowly on your helmet's visor to block it all Yes they did an amazing job of optimizing the graphics I have a basic little starter computer So I have to play this on low settings Still looks amazing But it's things like the blood on the visor and really poor render draw distance when looking into a black void with a flash light I know that's why the long range flashlight exists as an item But you still can't see anything in front of you if there's no lighting It just looks like fog when there is none there Tho the sound design is great there are still plenty of little instances when it kinda doesn't hit For example that constant low buzzing noise I mean I use an old pair of Turtle Beaches when I play on my PC and I thought they were finally on life support Just waiting on someone to pull the plug But no the buzz is there no matter what and only stops for certain spots in the game when performing certain actions This is a perfect game to play with friends But what if I don't have any friends Well yeah this game is not really a forgiving game in the worst of moments And it's not made any easier with the bots Yeah I imagine that the devs just added the bots because that's what people asked for Because let's face it some people just don't play well with others don't want to play with others just feel like trying it solo for a change or unfortunately don't have friends But as I said a game where every mission is a raid mission The bots don't really help at times They're more of a slot filler They don't use any of their tools they love blocking your view at crucial moments spoiler][b][i]LIKE WALKING IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE JUST WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE A MELEE KILL WITHOUT MISSING AND PISSING OFF A SLEEPER[/i][/b][/spoiler don't pick up and use any equipment like med kits and really don't understand the phrase Close the door behind you I'm not saying that the bots are dumb by any means but they obviously do need some fine tuning Because if these bots are supposed to be allies and can't perform the same actions as real players that's all they are Slot fillers Over all though this is an amazing game and I definitely think it was worth the price I was actually planning to see how this one was going to play out considering it's still in early access and a bit pricey Saw that it may get a console release depending on how things go when they get a full release on PC But I couldn't wait any longer after seeing trailers watching let's-play-ers reading the concept and just finding myself overwhelmingly curious about it This is a case where curiosity didn't kill the bat

stress
this game is like sneaking into your parents bedroom to steal back your nintendo 3ds except your parents sleep with a fog machine and your dad sleeps standing up
I got hacked by muffin man
Big Guy
I love this game It's extremely challenging but rewarding Recent features that were added have only made it better checkpointing means they can keep the same level of map difficulty but actually make the maps larger which fits narratively being able to do the easier part of the rundown means you can lower the level of difficulty but still get the amazing atmosphere and story Can't recommend this game enough
Jesus this is Hard as FUCK Definitly a great game
Really good game but i wish they implemented little snacks to enjoy in game
I love shooting and pissing and farting and shooting and stabbing and pooping and shitting and cumming adn shooting XD addendum beat the rundown 6,5 XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I love to game it is really fun and the new multiplayer is fun and all but its like a ghost town I get maybe 1 other person every 15 to 30 minutes recomend if you have friends with PCs
A cool and unique game
I love this game and hate to see it continue failing as much as it has Its a game with amazing graphics atmosphere weapons and so so much more It tells its story through the logs on the many PCs in the game It's one of the few games that had me and my friends coming back every single day But I still cannot recommend it As much as I love the game It has too many flaws in its design The game is designed without any casual players in mind Missions can take upwards of 6 hours on D levels and below and there are no points where you can save and quit The game is designed for 4 people to dedicate a large amount of time to a stress inducing mission in which one mistake will drop you back to a checkpoint thats veryyyyyy buggy mind you that was over an hour back Its entirely disheartening and after a few attempts you no longer wish to play anymore and if you leave you lose all the progress made leaving a player just sad There are problems with the rejoin mechanics that lead to players abusing changing out weapons and tools as well as loosing their boosters even on accidental disconnect The bots in this are just the worst of the worst Bots should not have the ability to take refill kits from the player Bots shouldn't get stuck behind doors without any ability to be forced to move them A player should have some form of finer control of the bots The rundown system is cool at first but if you want to learn the lore of the game you cant go back to previous rundowns and the Developer of the game seems like he doesn't want anyone to go back even through game mods There Isn't a procedural generation mode to tide you over if you've done the entire rundown the only thing that is procedural is enemy placements This is the least of the Devs worries to be fair The game is riddled with bugs Doors appearing invisible is one of the most common problems I figure its because of the checkpoint system while cool to see the enemies without threat of loss of progress is still a bug Sometimes an area just won't render like at all for a solid 30 seconds Im running on a 2TB m.2 SSD so the failure is not on me Anyway while I love this game I cannot support it until there are quite a few features added Dev If you hear this please just add the save load I want to come back but will not play this game anymore until its added fully

Love the game it's my current favorite Steep learning curve but feels amazing when you complete a level Highly recommended to play with a couple of friends Even if you don't have friends the Discord community for this game will help you out gladly
If you're looking for a horror shooter with amazing sound and effects this would be the game to get The AI enemies can be alerted just by you speaking through the games optional in-game voice chat which if you don't use discord calls adds to the immersion of the game even more furthering the requirement to remain as quiet and stealthy as possible with just how sensitive to hearing the enemy AI is
Get The Fuck Out
The first 30 minutes of playing it was terrifying but after a while it became very boring and redundant It also became very confusing and easy to get lost
A very brutal co-op experience the punishing difficulty makes even the slightest bit of progress even the smallest victories feel amazing
is good big scary
I love the auto sentry
yas queen
amazing value every 3 months you get totally new maps
Great fun with friends Solo is possible bots are good sometime they get stuck and you have to restart the level But its overall a good game that don't sucks the money out of you no pay to win
Pelin helppous
Walking in the dark while dodging throbbing creatures
THIS GAME IS BETTER THAN BANANA BREAD AT WORK BRO H*LL YEAH H*ELL YEAH
If you don't have a perpetual lineup of a full team of four you get screwed 100 of the time unless you're GamerMcGod2039 with 1000 hours logged and play just fine with a team of 3 cpus of course But when you do have that team it's a very rewarding but very very punishing game Not much horror to be had though and it can get a bit tiring repeating the same situations eternally Buy if you have a crew probably hold off if you don't have one
great game kinda
GTFO is a very interesting take on the genre Out of 5 stars I would give the game a 4 star review overall and a 5 star review for me personally I've been looking for a dark very difficult game that requires high levels of coop and skill and GTFO meets all of my expectations however it has some drawbacks Unfortunately GTFO has a few glitches that softlocked a few missions and that caused us to fail the mission We had to restart out of hours of work Additionally this game requires other people to play with because soloing levels is extremely difficult If you have 3 or more friends you'd like to get this game with I would 100 recommend Its a fantastic and creative shooter that is highly difficult and skillful Know that it is a time commitment to even do one level though One of the most fun games I've played though
fun
Still Hard AF Update second time Still very hard
exciting and challenging
its like suffering endlesly but ur gonna enjoy it wether you want to or not help
1
Cool but like most say it is VERY difficult Also the runs are VERY long and the level layouts can be somewhat confusing Still a good MP survival horror with surprisingly good gunplay
This game is excellent and challenging A must buy for teams that like a challenge
I have no idea what's going on where the fuck is the tutorial
pretty goo
GTFO is a challenging co-op shooter with a dense atmosphere that provided my friends and me with solid entertainment for a couple of evenings Unfortunately despite its hardcore difficulty the gameplay offered little variety most of the time and we ended up doing the same stuff over and over again Neither the story nor collectible cosmetics changed this for our group so we abandoned the game pretty quickly To elaborate a little bit more on the high difficulty level While a challenging gameplay experience is fine in general in combination with the checkpoint system it resulted in us always playing the same parts of the levels up and down Instead of making the game more fun it ended up making it more repetitive and ultimately boring for us I'm intentionally emphasizing that this was the experience of my group though depending on your skill level and preferences your mileage of course may vary
This game is a good horror co-op experience
I HATE LIFE
One of my fav games although its pretty much a necessity to have a team of 4 which makes it a bit hard to organize a time everyone is available to play I am also not a huge fan of how the checkpoints work I would love the ability to come back to a mission if you've gotten the checkpoint at a later date since the missions are really long and sometimes we have to just call it quits because we are out of time Awesome gameplay though I have never felt as engrossed as I do when playing GTFO
GTFO Get the f out
It could happen to you
balls deep in yuh mom
Very fun if you have a solid group of 4 Bugs exist but it's not all that bad Great difficult co-op experience
One of the most unique games on the Steam Marketplace.Rust was also once unique but I'm glad this game stays unique and continues to surprise us with updates after updates always keeping the game interesting
not A TERRIBLEL game just thoroughly confusing and with way too many choke points.I have had this game for 6 months and have yet to beat a level I enjoy challenging games like Doom Cuphead and Vermantide but this is a little much Would not recommend unless the lobbies start to fill up a little more But with dead lobbies you have to rely on bots and these aren't super useful Rather be getting my head smashed in elsewhere
pros scary as all hell will make you stressed cons its so difficult that youll go to sleep to S/O with teeth marks on pillows bed walls and your spouse
Fun to me but I would highly advise against playing with people who give up easily
Spooky Stealth L4d nuff said 1 You want friends for it the bots are missing some essential team functions i.e swapping pick-up tools and the teamwork makes the dream work 2 You'll want a guy who can type for computer stuff cuz there's typing in this game 3 You'll want to try solo with/without bots at least at some point because a lot of the tension is lost if you're playing with fun people And personally I feel that it completely loses that horror game spooky magic Having to do most of everything on your own with too many tools and supplies and not enough pockets to carry any of them it really brings it back full circle into survival horror 4 Dive Deep or don't dive at all this abyss has a bottom and pussyfooting doesn't get you anywhere
This game is just my daily life with girls I make one sound and they're all after me I shoot them and they die This cycle repeats every day I don't know how long I can last I'm running out of ammo on my second gun I failed the lock timing I don't have any med kits I'm done for

Honestly just git gud noobs This game is the easiest game I've ever played
Scary game to play with friends be quiet Theyre listening
spooky
Great game Fun to play with bots or in a party Make sure to checkout the Discord server
havent played a bunch so far but out of the 4 failed runs ive done with my 1 other friend i have learned that this game is not possible for new players unless you have at least 3 preferably 4 players so keep that in mind before purchasing although it is fun even when youre losing
better cod zombies
Super fun
yes
This game just sucks a lot Would not recommend

Unforgiving but so satisfying Love it
Have your girlfriend ever beat you with a wet spaghetti noodle because she has a twin sister and you got confused this is how it feels to get detected by a scout in a room full of em on DX
Can't enjoy the game More stealthly than expected
PDW
Dont have enough friends to play
worth it
The game is great looks great and plays great I just wish there was some differences in how security doors were handled and I wish there was more you could do in the terminals I am a techie and love the CLI addition to the game I hope it gets more gameplay one day I wish I could hack or something ala hacknet or say forgo one of my weapons or tools for a set of daemons and scripts to run or something idk Running big brains with my smooth brain friends would be neat The game has this focus on stealth but you end up having to fight everything anyways so it seems so damned pointless to sneak it feels like so adding ways to get past sec doors would be great idk wish in one hand and shit in the other The game is brilliant beyond my grips and fun to play Its an incredible challenge solo and alot of fun with friends and randoms Rundown 6 has an awesome story and the whole mythos of the world is intriguing and keeps me coming back
Que buen juego lpm tenes que jugarlo con amigos si o si sino es gg siempre xD
PTSD inducing 10/10
Difficult but very spicy
Bardzo meczu dopiero wieczorem
Great game if you have a solid crew
If you can get a good team together this game is amazing
Whaaa
Trop de travail pour peu de Tout passe de 0 100 et de 100 0 rapidement et impossible de jouer avec des bots leur IA se rapprochant de celle de Rochelle Ne jouez pas ce jeux si vous n'avez pas d'amis assez pour faire la mission en boucle pendant 8 heures
Really enjoying this game so far
