Date 2025-03-27 Playtime 8h 48m Rec Positive Se colocar a Samus da pra oficializar que é uma continuação de SUPER METROID mais o jogo é muito bom.  E pena que a maior parte da minha geração Z nem sabe oque é METROID.
Date 2025-03-27 Playtime 3h 10m Rec Positive Tiene una vision retro de 8 bits muy interesante pero con mejor movilidad y elementos metroidvania. Divertido y desafiante como los juegos de antes. Recomendable
Date 2025-03-26 Playtime 14h 25m Rec Positive Лучшая метроидвания. Серьезно. Настолько глубокий лор, настолько удивительный сюжет с таким количеством поворотов вы не найдете ни в одной метроидвании. Умеренная сложность, все максимально грамотно сделано. Всем рекомендую.

Date 2025-03-24 Playtime 14h 7m Rec Positive Received this game in late January for my birthday.  Gameplay is very similar to Metroid, which isn't bad but nothing too exciting either. You do get more than a dozen of gun options, and the drone mechanic is much cooler than the morphball.  The story, however, was the coolest thing. Brief, yes, but lots of tidbits to uncover when exploring. Like a true Metroidvania, the game rewards exploring a lot.
Date 2025-03-22 Playtime 28h 2m Rec Positive Um dos jogos que mais traz a essência Metroid, simplesmente fantástica a mecânica e traz uma boa história, com bom plot twist! Já comprei o 2 e tô ansioso pra jogar. Recomendo demais Axiom Verge, não se enganem por ser 2D, E entendam uma coisa: jogos assim precisam ser muito bons pra compensar a falta de gráficos incríveis em 3D, ray tracing etc. E ele é!
Date 2025-03-22 Playtime 1h 0m Rec Positive After putting an hour into this one, I got several upgrades and defeated two bosses, while exploring various areas of two maps. Having played Metroid on the NES as a kid, and Super Metroid on the SNES when I got a bit older, this game seems to borrow more heavily from the visual aesthetics of the former than the latter, while including a FEW of the quality of life aspects of Super Metroid. Specifically, you can save your game in certain rooms and can switch weapons at will. That said, the overall feeling of the game - at least for me - was mostly on par with the original, albeit less cumbersome and frustrating.  I had an alright time with what I played of the game, though after just one hour, I'd gotten all I really cared to out of it. I quite like the Metroidvania genre, but this one only really hits the nostalgia angle, as opposed to outright sucking me in like Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, Steamworld Dig 2, Ori and the Blind Forest, Dust: An Elysian Tail, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and Shadow Complex did. Also, the fact that the map in this game doesn't mark items in rooms like Super Metroid (or other Metroidvanias) build up the dread of having to go wandering around lost looking for them later on once I got the appropriate upgrades. The game only lets you mark two rooms as points of interest, and I already had 5 places I wanted to mark by the time I finally quit. Also, I would've liked it if the gun kept firing (even if slowly) while holding the fire button instead of having to hammer it non-stop during boss fights.  The game is well made and - based on an hour of it - it seems like a very solid game for fans of the original Metroid on the NES. I can't guarantee it will satisfy beyond that OG Metroid craving, though.
Date 2025-03-21 Playtime 8h 7m Rec Positive This has become one of my favorite video games ever. It is a masterpice of a metroidvania game. 10/10
Date 2025-03-20 Playtime 11h 5m Rec Positive Full of heart and soul and an excellent presentation of the 'metroid' half of 'metroidvania'. Charming and fascinating as it is unsettling and alien. It's no replacement for the titans of the genre but it stands on its own proudly and is absolutely worth the time it asks for.
Date 2025-03-19 Playtime 4h 15m Rec Negative Why would I play this over Super Metroid?
Date 2025-03-18 Playtime 8h 57m Rec Positive Fun little game for Metroid and Mr. Driller fans alike
Date 2025-03-18 Playtime 11h 45m Rec Positive Si ;)
Date 2025-03-17 Playtime 10h 22m Rec Negative 길을 헤매는 불쾌함만 가득한 게임  게임의 진행이 전혀 자연스럽고 매끄럽게 이어지지고  내가 가는 길이 올바른 방향인가 확인 할 길이 없기에  한 번 헤매기 시작하면 공략을 보지 않는 한 끝도 없이 헤메게 된다  길을 헤매는 과정에 있어서도 재미보다 불쾌함이 앞선다 길을 헤매는 도중에 새로운 길이나 아이템을 발견하여 진행된다는 성취감을 느끼는 시간에 비해 정처없이 헤매는 불쾌한 시간이 압도적으로 길다 보니 하는 내내 재미보다 불쾌함만 느끼게 된다
Date 2025-03-15 Playtime 13h 29m Rec Positive ja
Date 2025-03-15 Playtime 21h 39m Rec Positive чистейшая, 100% концентрация метроидвании
Date 2025-03-14 Playtime 1h 50m Rec Positive oh my god im on the verge of axioming right now
Date 2025-03-14 Playtime 12h 52m Rec Positive Pros +Interesting world, story, characters +Huge variety of enemies that all engage differently +Vast catalog of weapons - rewards you for using the right tool for the right enemy +Traversal tools unlocked are very unique +Beautiful pixel art +Great soundtrack +Tons of secrets and rewards to be found  Cons -Not much replayability (does support speedrun and randomizer modes, however) -No fast travel (there is a tram, however)  I had heard Axiom Verge was good, but I have sometimes heard good things about games that were a letdown. This one knocks it out of the park. It oozes style, rewards exploration, and has so much creativity to offer. This is a must-play for modern Metroidvanias.
Date 2025-03-12 Playtime 26h 2m Rec Positive A very loving homage to Metroid, and a fantastic Metroidvania in its own right.
Date 2025-03-10 Playtime 2h 3m Rec Positive Good game held back by a few nitpicks that could have made it excellent.  The good… the game itself is fun.  Nice nostalgic look with a hint if new age tech.  Great exploration/rank system to upgrade self and weapons.  Bosses can be a challenge but nothing too bad that takes only a few tries.  The bad… played on the steam deck and the pesky phase through mechanic later in game was constantly triggered via joystick.  And probably the worst aspect of game that really made it a chore the last 1/4 of the game for me was the map and having zero idea where to go next.  The amount of time back tracking and wondering what the heck do I do next was a total drag.  Very little to no direction.  If that one aspect of the game was changed I would give this an A tier rating.  But because of it I would lean closer to B.
Date 2025-03-10 Playtime 18h 6m Rec Positive This game rules. buy it.
Date 2025-03-09 Playtime 13h 49m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a 2015 indie metroidvania praised for its engrossing atmosphere and rewarding exploration, but held back by lackluster boss battles and a confusing map, falling short of genre greats like Hollow Knight in combat despite its unique retro style.
Date 2025-03-09 Playtime 16h 40m Rec Positive Amazing Storytelling. The gameplay might be slow at first, but as you get the movement upgrades, zipping around the map will be a lot easier. Boss fights are meh, but that was to be expected from this sort of retro emulating game imo.  Overall, would play again just for the story.
Date 2025-03-08 Playtime 12h 53m Rec Positive yes
Date 2025-03-07 Playtime 11h 16m Rec Positive Really solid.
Date 2025-03-03 Playtime 24h 52m Rec Positive Who liked the metroid-like games but always struggled with the speed-booster puzzles, this is for you!
Date 2025-03-01 Playtime 20h 19m Rec Positive 第三十款通关的类银，全成就难度较大，某些隐藏过于逆天，不看攻略和地图很难找到所有，就算看全收集地图都要花上约等于通关所耗费的时间，还有随机生成的不计入收集的五个断层空间，直到通关还有一个没找到。（地图右上角紫色点是区域全地图，黄色点是区域全收集，算是稍微方便玩家对照地图看收集了）  音乐美术看个人，我还挺喜欢这种复古的，剧情感觉很有意思，但没完全看懂。  地图虽然表面上非线性，其实开局路线挺固定的，因为大部分地方都去不了，少部分路线因为引导提示较少会卡（岩浆也能入侵?！）无传送导致跑图非常耗时，同时路上击败怪物没有收益（回血不算）导致有点无趣，某些跑图探索能力有点鸡肋，比如钩爪，手感烂不说，距离还是个问题，解锁无人机和交换以后那个键位只有取消无人机用了。  战斗老实说挺烂的，前期血少怪物伤害高，还有跳脸僵尸，后期血高了也有吸血虫子直接粘身上，boss就是标准的找弱点输出，挺回合制，甚至有些还能逃课，武器虽然多实际有用的就几把，探索能力几乎只是探索能力，用不到战斗上。  最优秀的其实是探索，喜欢找垃圾的朋友有福了，神奇hack枪加上奇妙马赛克穿墙衣玩出花，需要密码学八级的sudra语配合本来就读不懂还要给你乱码的字条，让你看到都想不到，四处飞行的机械居然还能带虫子旅行，和虫子互换竟能做出无限上升，只能说，探索方面，这游戏可以非常满足舔图怪。  如果你能忍受繁琐跑图，无中文，引导较差，而且不是全成就党（某些点不看攻略真的错过就得重开）又非常喜欢类似《动物井》里找蛋，那这个游戏还是很适合的。  
Date 2025-02-27 Playtime 11h 44m Rec Positive 非常棒，完整的银河战士体验。 很多时候玩家并不需要特别新奇的系统，而是一个成熟的好玩的游戏。
Date 2025-02-27 Playtime 11h 53m Rec Negative Although the lore and visuals of this game are amazing, I really think this game, as a metroidvania, sucks.  It's got the basics down, it's got a huge map, upgrades that allow you to have more movement option, stronger weapons and bigger healthbar as you go, but the movement isn't fun, controlling the drone isn't fun, using the grappling hook SURE AS FUCK isn't fun, the map feels like its trying to copy metroid more so than improve upon it, as such the map exploration and movement around it just feels like a chore.   If there's a good reason to suggest why castlevania SOTN improved the genre is by adding teleporters around the map. This map is HUGE and the game is NOT short at all and you will be backtracking constantlyto get the upgrades, there's a "vehicle" to move you around the entrances of the sections of the map but really having a teleporter is exactly what would have fixed the game for me.  The enemies do a surprisingly large amount of damage to you to the point of making some areas a bitch (Yes, i do mean those fuckwit golden flying enemies specially) so its always a good idea to go around grabbing as much health upgrades as you can (not that it helps that much), which makes more time spent backtracking and trying to find them and get them all around the map.  If there's one area of the game to give it praise to is the story. I was fighting the desire to put the game down and give the sequel a short try or not even that up until I found "the plot twist" which frankly made the game a lot more appealing. I didn't expect it to actually be a good twist.  Really there's so many games that do metroidvania better on steam... I had more fun playing gato roboto than this.
Date 2025-02-26 Playtime 12h 39m Rec Positive SAMO GĘSTE #25: Axiom Verge      Relatywnie często pisze tu o różnego rodzaju Metroidvaniach, w tym Hollow Knighcie, którego okrzyknąłem czempionem tego gatunku. Co natomiast jest srebrnym medalistą? Wielu ludzi powiedziało by, że któraś gra z cyklu Ori. Są świetne, ale mnie aż tak nie kupiły, a że ja tu jestem sołtysem to dziś porozmawiamy o innej gierce.       O Axiom Verge dowiedziałem się z dość dziwnego źródła, mianowicie ze spotify. Gra jest bowiem okraszona świetnym retro elektronicznym soundrackiem. Jak już jesteśmy przy oprawie audiowizualnej, to coś jest w tym giegerowskim pixel arcie co mnie absolutnie chwyciło za serce. Gra wygląda więc i brzmi tak jak ja prywatnie lubię. Ale na tym zalety się nie kończą.       Ogromne wrażenie zrobił na mnie arsenał power upów, głownie dlatego, że nie składa się z jakichś podstawowych rzeczy typu podwójny skok, pływanie yada yada. Te upgrady są wręcz tak ciekawe, że nie powiem wam co to żebyście mieli niespodziankę. Projekt poziomów jest również solidny, choć preferowałbym więcej punktów fast travelu. Dodatkowo pod koniec gry jest kilka miejsc, gdzie sposoby poruszania się których gra wymaga wchodzą na poziom, który zakrawa na "speedrun shit". W końcu przeszedłem, ale byłem zdziwiony, że zdecydowano się na takie rozwiązania.       Jeszcze jedna rzecz, która w tym wszystkim bardzo mi kliknęła to lore gry. Rozgrywka roztacza przed nami tajemnicę. Gdy pierwszy boss mówi do nas "Demon, Athetos says, kill". To zaczynamy się zastanawiać co tu zaszło. Jest wiele rzeczy, które można odkryć. Nie muszę tłumaczyć, że w połączeniu z oprawą audiowizualną stworzyło to dla mnie niesamowity klimat. Z wypiekami na twarzy czekałem, żeby druga część wyjaśniła cześć tajemnic.      Właśnie, Bo Axiom Verge ma sequel. I niestety o ile sama historia jest ok, to nie dała mi zbyt wiele nowych informacji do wydarzeń z jedynki. Jest też nieco gorsza pod kątem stylu. Natomiast jeśli chodzi o mechaniki to jest świetnie i po przejściu jedynki absolutnie ją polecam.       Najpierw jednak zanurzcie się w AV1. Pozycja obowiązkowa dla fanów metroidvanii, a dodatkowo wybitny obraz retro estetyki. Mam nadzieję, że choć jedna osoba z was doceni to choć w połowie tak jak ja. Bo w mój gust trafia niesamowicie.
Date 2025-02-26 Playtime 13h 32m Rec Positive I don't know how to recommend this game Just play it
Date 2025-02-25 Playtime 13h 39m Rec Positive 氛围有点吓人，武器有点鸡肋，地图有点空，有些怪物有点恶心。除了美术以外不算很有创意的银河城。玩久了会有一种独自漂泊于浩瀚宇宙中的孤独感。
Date 2025-02-22 Playtime 12h 10m Rec Positive Hard to review this with any objectivity; I've played this game numerous times on my Switch (about once every 1 - 1.5 years since 2018), but for the first time on Steam in 2025. I love how strange this game is, and I mean strange in the truest sense. Tom Happ has created a world so alien it's at times disgusting, other times serene, but most of the time completely foreign and incredibly hostile. As the tag line for this game notes, it's a thin line between dream and nightmare.  The story works for me, but I understand doesn't for some folks. There's a TON of misdirection going on, and it suffers from the feeling that the full story isn't realized just yet (Axiom Verge 2 fills in some holes, but produces more questions than answers), but I really enjoy what's shared AV 1. It gives one the feeling of being ensnared in someone's conspiracy, but no one is really sure who the true puppet-master is. Wonderfully realized world, I hope we get to see more of it. Easy recommendation if you like Metroidvanias.
Date 2025-02-22 Playtime 13h 38m Rec Positive A wonderful example of the Metroidvania genre, Axiom Verge offers its own unique mechanics and a very original, well-written story to propel the player through a labyrinthine game world. Special mention goes to its music and detailed graphics that give each region its own ambience and feel. If you're a fan of Super Metroid or Castlevania SotN or any of their derivatives, you'll be right at home with Axiom Verge.
Date 2025-02-20 Playtime 20h 59m Rec Positive buen game :)
Date 2025-02-18 Playtime 5h 20m Rec Negative Boss 1 80% complete Boss 2 70% complete Boss 3 50% complete This game basically, is good until the 2 hour mark then it sucks. 'Thx you can't refund now have fun metroidvania experts OR look up a guide' Idek if metroidvania experts would like this game unless they have a photographic memory. I cannot backtrack to certain areas, all other roads are dead ends, and trying to drill random walls I find a secret only 40% of players found. People giving this game lip service then think they're just bad? Idk, but this much lost player count is kinda bad. Is it possible I missed an item and got soft locked or I overlooked a second room in the 3rd boss chamber? Idk.  And the secret area doesn't mean shit that I found because I need to jump ever-so-slightly higher to reach the end of it. Maybe I have post-covid brainrot or underslept, but I cannot think of a prior area to route to with my new items. And when I backtrack theres limits on how far back I can go. So either I'm softlocked from missing an item, or, theres a random wall somewhere I accidentally neglected. In either case, bad pacing after the first few hours.  Edit: I apparently need to damage boost, cool for vets of the genre, not cool for me
Date 2025-02-16 Playtime 49h 2m Rec Positive 10 years later, Axiom Verge remains one of if not THE best retro-Metroidvania experience around. The graphics, the music, the challenges... everything is perfect.  The only thing that would have made it better would have been to have a more extensive world to explore. It's over a bit quickly, and that's my only regret.
Date 2025-02-15 Playtime 40h 6m Rec Positive I feel like Axiom Verge has been totally forgotten in the modern day. I really do wonder why. It feels like it was a pretty big deal back when it released.... roughly ten years ago, jesus. I could be biased since I have such good memories of it from back then, but personally I think it deserves more love. Its inspiration from Metroid couldn't be any clearer, yet it has more than enough unique ideas to set it apart. Despite its flaws, it's just really damn fun and immersive. Maybe there are more people who have the same feelings.
Date 2025-02-14 Playtime 2h 53m Rec Negative Spent over an hour playing only to get softlocked in Zil because the game allowed me to enter the area without the required upgrades to advance or return. Googled quite a bit, couldn't find any solution. Time wasted.
Date 2025-02-13 Playtime 16h 44m Rec Positive Puta jogo bom pra quem curte ficção cietifica e metroid. Jogo bonito, bem feito e com uma gameplay muito boa. Minha unica resalva fica quanto ao mapa mas logo vc acostuma. Muito bom!
Date 2025-02-13 Playtime 61h 54m Rec Positive One of the good metroidvanias I've played and only made by 1 dude. Awesome music and gameplay.
Date 2025-02-09 Playtime 46h 42m Rec Positive amazing game 
Date 2025-02-09 Playtime 20h 58m Rec Positive I've heard people tell me this is basically Metroid, but made today, and they were right.  For better or for worse, hunting for secrets feels very retro; very limited map management, no fast travel, and visuals to match.  The more modern touches were nice to have, though.  There were a LOT of different types of weapons you can use.  I almost want to say there were too many.  But having such a variety was neat.  I think the game started out a bit on the tough side, but after collecting everything, the final stretch of the game was a piece of cake on Normal difficulty.  I didn't really connect with the story in this one.  I get it, but it just didn't fit my personal tastes, I suppose.  I don't think it was bad, however.  By the end, everything made sense.  I had fun with this!  It was a good, solid game that doesn't really win any awards from me.  Perfectly adequate.  I liked it!
Date 2025-02-08 Playtime 13h 55m Rec Positive El Juego es perfecto desde una vision general. los entornos los jefes estan bien logrados y con un buen nivel de dificultad
Date 2025-02-07 Playtime 22h 43m Rec Positive It's an okay metroidvania, mostly I enjoyed the vibe and the looks, it's like playing a retro game, but my main complain it's about the mobility at the latest levels, I didn't liked the platforms and the dash mechanics. Still good tho.
Date 2025-02-07 Playtime 18h 52m Rec Positive soy un verdadero manco para los juegos en especial contra jefes donde los nervios y la manques se unen y termino errores estupidos, pero los jefes de este juego no me parecieron tal dificiles solo tenia que buscar la arma correcta para la situacion y se asia mas llevadera.  si lo recomedaria?  si, incluso para los que no tienen tanta experiencia con estos tipos de juegos eso si armate de paciencia y te soprenderas de o lejos que llegaras   
Date 2025-02-06 Playtime 9h 45m Rec Positive It's excellent!
Date 2025-02-05 Playtime 4h 42m Rec Positive AV è un tributo a un certo modo di giocare e concepire il videogioco, figlio di un tempo passato che ormai non c'è più: un gioco "semplice" nella sua struttura ma dalla qualità e dalla realizzazione eccezionali. AV è un piccolo capolavoro di tecnica e inventiva, un piccolo scrigno nel quale è racchiusa una colonna sonora della madonna, una pixel art fuori di testa e una giocabilità così immediata che difficilmente ve ne staccherete.  Cheers...a Trace.
Date 2025-02-03 Playtime 9h 56m Rec Positive Neat.
Date 2025-02-03 Playtime 14h 28m Rec Positive honestly a bit of a mess at times, but pretty fun the glith gun is a intersting idea, and the pixel art is fantastic. some of the secret area entrance  locations being random kinda sucks amd makes it hard to tell if you are doing the right thing but its alright
Date 2025-02-01 Playtime 19h 51m Rec Positive This game has the Metroidvania formula down to a degree i haven't seen since Super Metroid. 10/10.
Date 2025-02-01 Playtime 9h 48m Rec Positive A competent metroidvania with some cool ideas for upgrades. Though it suffers from having a boring early game and dull boss fights. But if you can put up with those, you'll have a good amount of fun. I appreciate the existance of a built-in randomizer, but personally I felt like I got all the enjoyment I could out of this game in a single playthrough.
Date 2025-02-01 Playtime 29h 51m Rec Negative Game has a good story and ambiance, but the teleport often fails when using it in the up direction, instead of going through the obstacle, you'll bounce off it a dozen times before it will work. The reason I quit the game however is because roof doorways repeatedly wouldn't allow me to jump through them. Sometimes, if I quit and reloaded the game, causing me to have to traverse from the previous save point, it would work properly, but this happened far too many times and I finally quit the game after getting the Shards weapon (this is about 2/3 through the game)
Date 2025-02-01 Playtime 8h 41m Rec Positive um metroid de terror até onde joguei. pretendo terminar ele com muita calma
Date 2025-01-31 Playtime 15h 19m Rec Positive Good game. Good OST. Good ending.
Date 2025-01-30 Playtime 8h 49m Rec Negative I've played countless Metroidvania style games. Hell, I've played and beat the original Metroid, which this game is heavily inspired by. The game IS fun, the setting is eerie and the soundtrack just the right amount of weird to be memorable. But when I tell you that this game has the most infuriatingly large map, and that the game seems to delight in cock-blocking you trying to just, I dunno, PROGRESS? It actively feels like the developers just don't want you to play the game at some points. Yes, finding dead ends and back tracking is part and parcel of the metroidvania experience, but this game pushes that concept to the point of frustration and redundancy. I *wanted* so badly to like this game, it's a legend in the indie space. But unless I want to play with a goddamn strategy guide on my second screen telling me EXACTLY where to go, well, I won't be beating this one. A shame, honestly. It does so many things right, but you can only spend so many hours wandering around the same 3 areas before you just get bored with it.
Date 2025-01-30 Playtime 11h 15m Rec Negative Decent. But in hindsight I'd rather spend my time playing through Super Metroid for the 10th time than had given this a shot.
Date 2025-01-30 Playtime 42h 31m Rec Positive A cursory glance at the Store Page's screenshots will tell you most of what you need to know about this game and how inspired it is by Metroid. I was critical of it at first and there's maybe some components that could have been different but look up how many people developed this, and you won't mind that either.   I would have liked maybe different damage types. There's tons of weapons that mean very little but are insanely hard to acquire. As with some other Metroidvanias, guidance is minimal and backtracking to random rooms trying to find my objective did eat up a chunk of my playtime. The first three or four bosses were so easily cheesed that I started to lose interest. And then the game picked up and I started WANTING the next boss. My advice is, if you find yourself struggling, just look it up. There's too much stuff to find and some of it is hidden in the most insane ways, you'll not find it all without help.   I got this on sale. If you catch it on sale too I highly recommend it and its sequel, though the sequel is a very different game imo.
Date 2025-01-30 Playtime 18h 59m Rec Positive JOGO DE MALUCO PSICO 7/10
Date 2025-01-29 Playtime 10h 40m Rec Positive Очень хороший метроид Игра безумно порадовала качественным исследованием мира, хотя возможность телепортироваться между сейвами могли бы уж дать под конец, без этого 100% как-то тяжело зачищать кажется. Хотя центральный коридор балдеж, но локации сами по себе довольно большие, так что он хоть и спасает, но не до конца. Много интересных способностей, но они постепенно заменяют друг друга, крюк нужен совсем не долго, потом его заменяет телепорт к дрону и совсем в конце телепорт на двойное нажатие. Впрочем, это даже хорошо, потому что настолько фигово исполненного крюка я давно не видел, как же им ужасно не удобно пользоваться. Двойное нажатие на телепорт тоже ужасное, когда надо не работает, когда не надо не работает, сделали бы на кнопку отдельную, было бы отлично. Тем более, что в конце игры уже боссы требуют от тебя использования этой абилки в бою для нанесения урона. Под конец игра дико душит сложностью, может я предметов маловато собрал, но умирать в конце начал слишком часто и слишком легко. Некоторые комнаты и моменты выводят из себя дико, пару раз чуть геймпадом об стол не двинул. Сюжет мега балдежный, много лора, всё запутано, но при этом общий нарратив более-менее понятный, сделано круто. Визуал тоже отличный, ну а музыка мое почтение, такую музыку ещё поискать надо.
Date 2025-01-29 Playtime 13h 54m Rec Positive Это всё ещё прекрасная и динамичная метроидвания даже спустя столько лет. Плюсы: пиксельарт, музыка, приятный геймплей и возможность настроить управление, хорошая локализация и разнообразие, при том, что сама игра довольно небольшая. И у неё есть вторая часть! И будет третья! Минусов для себя я не нашла, но кому-то, возможно, игра покажется слишком сложной местами или слишком линейной
Date 2025-01-28 Playtime 10h 32m Rec Positive Fun metroidvania with interesting twists on the formula
Date 2025-01-27 Playtime 16h 28m Rec Positive How insane that this game was made by a single guy, right down to the music? Axiom Verge is at least an A-tier metroidvania, with clever gameplay, beautiful pixel art, and an eerie atmosphere.  I especially enjoyed the environmental storytelling, how the alien world reveals its secrets over time, and how you get an increasingly disturbing picture of what happened in Sudra. One of those games where after completion, I immediately opened the Wiki because I wanted to know everything about the lore.  Oh, and the alien techno soundtrack was great. 9/10
Date 2025-01-27 Playtime 25h 32m Rec Positive Awesome Metroidvania, impressively created by a single dev! Amongst the best stories I've ever seen on a Metroidvania.  It is a masterpiece, but has its quirks: - The WORST Grapling Hook of all games, hard to use - Dash, oh god, Dash should be a button, and not tap twice a direction...  Probably will have to deal with these quirks to replay the game on Randomizer sometime in the future...  SPOILER: If you see Scanlines, there's a secret near!

Date 2025-01-26 Playtime 15h 49m Rec Positive Instead of double jumps and dashes you've seen a thousand times in other games before, Axiom Verge subverts these metroidvania "clichés" with unique and creative power-ups and a wide roster of different weapons. The pixel art is great, but perhaps a bit repetitive in some places. Progression is mostly linear, but still gives the player a lot of room for exploration and finding secrets, which, oh man, there are so many of... The bosses are mostly ok, Ukhu however can suck my balls. The reverse bossfight is what got me  Overall, Axiom Verge is an extremely enjoyable and creative experience, and in my opinion, is very underrated.
Date 2025-01-25 Playtime 5h 48m Rec Positive the only Metroid game we got on the Wii U. good weapon selection and unique mechanics. can be a bit tough at times. Highly recommended.
Date 2025-01-25 Playtime 6h 16m Rec Positive Great Super Metroid clone that is slavishly faithful in gameplay and tone. Dials up the H.R. Geiger all the way. It's very easy to get lost or be confused where to go. The story is stretched too thin with very little meat in between. Despite the dark atmosphere, the game is surprisingly easy.
Date 2025-01-23 Playtime 10h 12m Rec Positive El mejor metroidvania Tipo metroid clasico que hay. lo mejor es la coherencia y como el juego maneja su propio ambiente tanto con enemigos como ambientacion y musica.
Date 2025-01-22 Playtime 45h 46m Rec Positive Bem legal! Para quem jogou e gostou de Metroid no NES (nintendinho) esse será uma ótima maneira de revisitar o gênero no modo mais clássico dele.  O bacana é a mecânica de glitch, que no jogo é tratado como parte do universo. Tudo bem utilizado.  Gameplay é o que se espera de um clone de Metroid, movimentos mais rígidos mas fluidos, as ferramentas (upgrades) são legais  e armas bem diversas.  O combate não é nada muito desafiador, os chefões são poucos e com pouca ou nenhuma estratégia. inimigos comuns são variados, mas dentro do limite de um único desenvolvedor.  Não gosto do design do personagem, cara feio e sem graça, parece um nerdão emburrado.  De resto o visual é bme legal ao que se propõe, principalmente as Rukal... esqueci o nome delas, as faces femininas que te ajudam no jogo. O Design de mapa é bem legal, assim como seu visual.  A história é interessante, tem um profundidade legal, só o herói que não cativa em nada , e o vilão é muito mais interessante.  Enfim, fechei em 100% no HARD somente, até o momento não tive tempo para fazer o desafio do speedrun em 4 horas, quero jogar outra coisa...

Date 2025-01-21 Playtime 14h 45m Rec Positive I really liked this game. It doesn't rank quite as high as Hollow Knight on my metroidvania list, but it was still amazing. It's art and gameplay is largely inspired from Super Metroid which kind of just made the game feel classic.   It's plot was well thought-out and had lots of items and new abilities you were constantly getting, keeping the game exciting.  At times it was very confusing on where to go, and sometimes the bosses just felt a little bit incomplete, but amazing game overall.
Date 2025-01-20 Playtime 15h 19m Rec Positive 購入してかなり長いこと積んでいましたが、やっとメトロイドヴァニアやりたい熱が溜まってきて崩すことになりました。 もっと評価の高い面白いタイトルから優先的にやっていたので、こちらは後回しになっていました。  評価を一言で表すなら「全力でパクリ回避したメトロイド」です。 ゲーム性の感触としてはもう完全にメトロイドのオマージュなのですが、ギミックなどは出来るだけオリジナルな要素を盛り込もうと努力したように感じました。 例えばこのゲームには二段ジャンプがありません。 メトロイドヴァニアというジャンルでは大抵の場合二段ジャンプ出来るようになってからが本番みたいな所がありますよね。 それを無くした代わりに、アイテムやギミックを駆使して二段ジャンプっぽい挙動が出来るようにしています。 これをオリジナリティと取るか、ただめんどくさいだけと取るか。 私としては、普通に二段ジャンプできた方が楽だったんじゃないかと。 そうかと思えばファストトラベルが無かったり。 そんな所を初期メトロイドに倣わなくても。 おかげでそう大きくはないマップですが隅々まで探索するのが非常にかったるくて、一応クリアはしましたが100％収集は面倒すぎて諦めました。  オススメするかしないかで言ったら、一応オススメにしておきます。 アクションゲームとしては簡単すぎず難しすぎずとてもバランスの良い難易度で、プレイしていて充分に楽しかったため。 メトロイドヴァニアとして探索を極めて隅々までしゃぶりつくそうとすると面倒くささが勝ちますが、そこを全部切り捨ててもセールで安く買ってこれだけ楽しめれば満足です。 私はもう切り捨てて続編の2をやろうと思います。
Date 2025-01-19 Playtime 32h 50m Rec Positive El juego está muy bien.   Es divertido. Tienes mucho por descubrir. Cada mapa tiene varias zonas que se van desbloqueando sólo cuando obtienes un determinado objeto, así que tienes que volver varias veces a la misma zona a rebuscar si te has dejado algo.  Puntos mejorables:  - Hubiera estado bien un viaje rápido (aunque fuera una opción que se desbloqueara a mitad del juego por ejemplo).  - El mapa es mejorable. Hubiera estado bien que las zonas por descubrir se marcaran en color oscuro o algo así. Alguna manera de saber que ahí, hay algo y que tienes que descubrir como entrar o necesitas aún algún objeto para hacerlo.   En cualquier caso, un muy buen juego. Recomendable al 100%
Date 2025-01-19 Playtime 27h 55m Rec Positive So I've tried some metroidvania style games outside the actual metroid-castlevania games and not many really resonated with me. 2 in particular were ori and rain world. I found them to be way to difficult to be enjoyable least for me. Rain world especially was just way to hard with the die, eat, die, eat, struggle to build up your bar to even get clearance to proceed to another extremely hard area. So I gave up both in frustration, ori was just to damn kill you over and over with hard jumps instantly. Ori was not as bad as rain world however because least it don't set you back 2 hours for dying.  So coupled with all the prove yourself platformers these days like end is ni, and meatboy, I was growing a little untrusting of what people tell me is a good platformer these days. I loved a hat in time, but that's more mario, gather the star pieces platformer. Most of the really good ones I still find to be the classics for pacing themselves and not expecting really ridiculous feats. Not all of course some oldschool stuff is severly hard. But as far as metroids and the metroid style castlevanias (sotn, aria) I could not find a single new one that held the same attention from me. So I gave this one a try, and it held up to all my expectations.  One thing, I was a bit of a skeptic at first with this game, it does start out a little basic with jump and shoot. But give it some time the game really hits its stride mid to end game. I have not actually beat this game yet, but got one more boss on the achievements left so I think I'm close to done. One thing this game does really well tho, it really manages to be a good mid point, inbetween challenge, satisfaction, and accomplishment. Meaning its not super easy, its puzzling, but its not frustrating. Its fun to play and explore, does some interesting things with oldschool nes style graphics I haven't seen before, and has interesting atmosphere and story. Also mixes things up a lot from what metroid did. I wouldn't say its better than metroid either just different. In metroid, well samus was a suit, you knew what to expect. Trace on the other hand is a scientist, his upgrades are not really predictable and it would be to much of a spoiler to tell you about his upgrades. Lets just say it manipulates 2d platforming in some of the ways samus did but in more trippy theoretical, less physical ways. For example he can phase shift through walls by tapping directions. Which adds a whole new dimension of platforming explortation.  The game is not prove yourself, its actually quite enjoyable. Its an atmospheric, puzzling game, and beating a speed run or not dying even once could be hard. But just playing it through its more of a thinking mans game and less of a twitch platforming prove yourself with jump tricks game. That's what I love about it, so does it hold up to metroid and castlevania? I would say it does and the price on sell or not is reasonable, its already sold axiom 2 for me. So if you want a good metroidvania, that's more metroid than vania, this is a good choice.
Date 2025-01-18 Playtime 9h 36m Rec Positive Decent game, though a bit short. I let myself get sidetracked by backtracking to secrets I remembered, yet a full clear on my first playthrough only took 6 hours. Bosses are a little easy, every one can be cheesed which is a bit of a miss on the boss design front.

Date 2025-01-11 Playtime 22h 1m Rec Positive I had this game in my library for a while, and just recently decided to play it. It's amazing. After 22 hours, tho, I only have about half of the achievements, cos I couldn't find all the stuff. The world is huge and it takes a lot of dedication to find everything. I usually love finding all the stuff, but this was a bit too much for me. If you're a completionist, I recommend checking out the guides just as soon as you start playing and not halfway like I did. Now, after having finished the game, I'm just too lazy to go back and find everything. But, yea, very strong metroidvania with great 8-bit style graphics, lots of weapons, abilities and interesting mechanics.
Date 2025-01-11 Playtime 0h 16m Rec Positive good metroidvania game solid so far
Date 2025-01-11 Playtime 0h 5m Rec Positive Excellent Metroid style game
Date 2025-01-11 Playtime 15h 52m Rec Positive There is a fantastic sense of progression in this game, when you're moving through it exciting things are happening almost all the time, when you're stuck it can take quite a while to unstick yourself. In the first half it really feels like you can think your way out of most encounters, if you choose the right equipment and the right approach you wont take a scratch. This somewhat fades later on and it becomes more about dodging and reacting. I think this works but I did miss that feeling of mastery from solving the puzzle of the encounters at the start. The music is absolutely incredible, and when you're about to die a heartbeat monitor sound perfectly ramps up every song. The pixel art is extremely well done throughout the game but there are particular stand out moments.  If you like metroidvanias you should play this game, if you don't know whether you like metroidvanias this is the game to try.

Date 2025-01-10 Playtime 22h 6m Rec Positive Massa
Date 2025-01-09 Playtime 0h 8m Rec Positive I bought this game way back when it was a PlayStation exclusive and I have to say it's when of the best metroidvania titles I've personally come across. Solid gameplay all around, very cool selection of weapons and abilities and a pretty cool story as well.
Date 2025-01-09 Playtime 9h 51m Rec Negative Cool atmosphere but almost demands you use a guide. You often find required items by shooting random walls. And you just do that in massive biomes till something works.
Date 2025-01-09 Playtime 24h 8m Rec Positive An extremely fun Metroidvania with really interesting themes. Absolute gem.
Date 2025-01-09 Playtime 22h 18m Rec Positive Old but gold.  O meu eu do passado era muito burro pra zerar esse jogo.
Date 2025-01-08 Playtime 8h 44m Rec Positive An extremely competent Metroidvania, with level design that very naturally guides you towards finding the right upgrade to proceed and an arsenal of all kinds of fun laser weapons. Great pixel art and sound design, and the story's conveyed pretty well through only a few cutscenes and dialog boxes.  9/10
Date 2025-01-08 Playtime 20h 8m Rec Positive This is a fun metroidvania, with a creepy and eerie sci-fi atmosphere. I love to explore everywhere and collect as much items as possible. I do think this game is a bit easy, but this might be because I played on normal.
Date 2025-01-07 Playtime 12h 18m Rec Positive Хорошая метроидвания, эдакое переосмысление классического метроида. Как по мне, вышло лучше, чем то, что сделала нинтенда в последней части. Игра короткая, прошел за 9 часов зачистив карту на 93% и найдя чуть больше половины предметов.  Отличная музыка делает атмосферу, графика ностальгичное ретро, но передает антураж диковинной планеты и местных шумерских биотехнологий. Сюжет есть, раскрывается в записках, и он неожиданно хорош.  Надо сказать, в 2025, спустя 10 лет после релиза, игра выглядит очень свежо, поскольку не имеет ставших уже традиционными изъянов жанра:  - не рогалик  - не сосалик  - не суперсложная  - почти нет рандомной генерации уровней  - чекпойнты ставятся рядом с боссами  - нет километров скверно написанных диалогов  - нет бессмысленной ролевой системы для галочки  - нет западной аниме-стилистики  - стилизация под нормальное ретро (нес/снес), без странных идей типа имитации геймбоя/четырехцветной палитры/черно-белой картинки  - нормальное отзывчивое управление, без аутентичной ретро-дубовости  Всячески рекомендую к прохождению.
Date 2025-01-07 Playtime 36h 33m Rec Positive Um Metroidvania muito mais "Metroid" do que "Vânia", provavelmente alguém já deve ter dito isso, pois melhor e mais objetiva descrição sobre esse jogo não há. Na verdade acho que ele não tem nada de "Vânia" o certo talvez seria chama-lo apenas de "Metroid", e só por isso já deve ser elogiado. Não me entenda mal, eu não tenho nada contra os "Vanias" na verdade gosto muito, só que eles praticamente monopolizam o gênero, apesar de o nome dessa categoria ser formada pela junção do nome de dois jogos, pouco se vê de Metroid e muito se vê de Castlevania nesses jogos, então alguém conseguir fazer um jogo bom tendendo mais pro Metroid é algo louvável. E Axiom Verge É BOM! Se você ja jogou Super Metroid, ou o Zero Mission, ou o Fusion, e gostou, em outras palavras se você gosta dos Metroids clássicos que ajudaram a dar o nome dessa categoria de games, então é simplesmente impossível você não gostar de Axiom Verge.
Date 2025-01-06 Playtime 2h 41m Rec Positive Good visuals, gameplay and story, If you like metriodvania games this is a must play.
Date 2025-01-06 Playtime 13h 27m Rec Positive play this while i was on my 9-5 got caught and fired too but deserves the time i spend on , 10/10  highly recommended
Date 2025-01-06 Playtime 12h 3m Rec Negative 游戏没有传送机制，玩得有些累。来来回回的找隐藏和探路已经把耐心给消磨没了，玩到后面有些烦躁，没心思整什么全收集了。
Date 2025-01-05 Playtime 18h 30m Rec Positive I should have picked this game sooner. It's brilliant. It reminds me of the fun that I had when I picked up Metroid II as a young kid, it's that good.  The pixel art will look a bit rough at times but is reminiscent of what we had in the early 90s in terms of colour palette and animation. But since it runs a computer and not an old console, it gets virtually 0 limitation in the number of animated sprites that can be rendered simultaneously so your weapon will always look good, the enemies will blow up into pieces, the game will never slow down, and it can even apply some interesting effects. I like how the "glitch gun" can change the apparence of enemies and walls. The effects rendered as you get the ability to "glitch" through a wall.  The soundtrack is a lot better than I expected. Only a few songs I don't like too much but tracks like Cellular Skies are most definitely my jam. We are approaching the quality of some the AAA titles of the old days here.  The design of the levels is actually pretty good. Secrets that are not too hard to find, save points well positioned and not too far apart. Shortcuts that can be used as you unlock equipment to navigate through the level. A lot of thoughts was put into it. The map you get to navigate everything is decent, but a bit limited; only two markers (R1 and R2) you can place on the map, and it will not automatically keep track of the items you have located or anything like that.  I am only a couple of hours in it and I have 5 different weapon beams, and at least 5 or 6 piece of equipment. Some weapons are very creative actually. There is just not enough games were we get to pilot a drone.  I can only thing of a few things I don't like about this game.  -Enemies that are waiting to hit you outside of the displayed screen, but without the capability to move the camera around to detect them and time your shots/jumps. So what will happen is that you'll get hit, memorize their location and learn to use some of the different weapons to hit them before they appear on the screen sometimes. -Lots of weapons that don't really feel "needed".  I haven't received anyting that matches the dmg done by the first weapon we get. And changing weapon fill clunky at times, because it essentially pause the game as you get the weapon "wheel". You don't  get "weapon slots" for quick toggles. Instead, "extra" buttons will be mapped to some equipment like your drill or the glitch gun, which can indeed be used like weapons at times. -Controls can appear a bit stiff at times as a result of some of the choices/compromises made. The grappeling hook get some used to while you'll be trying to reach some places that are harder to reach. But everything is responsive and works well.  The difficulty so far is a lot lower than I expected it to be. You can definitely beat lots of bosses on a first attempt. They have very rigid and simplistic patterns for the most part. So once you figure out the vulnerable area and how to hit it without getting hit in return, it's over. It normally revolves around being patient, equipping a proper beam to minimise your exposure, and timing jumps correctly. And so far, nothing has survived a second attempt.  If you are a fan of this genre of game, you need to pick this up eventually. Plus, it runs on a potato which means it is a great game for handheld PCs when playing on a battery charge, and regularly gets on rebate. It was -85% during the last winter sale. You just can't go wrong at such a price point.
Date 2025-01-05 Playtime 11h 50m Rec Positive Axiom Verge es un Metroidvania que ha pasado injustamente desapercibido frente a otros del mismo género. Si bien cuando salio se le dio cierta notoriedad en la actualidad es un juego que solo resuena entre los círculos mas acérrimos al genero Metroidvania con buena aceptación. Y no es para menos pues el juego es una Joya dentro del genero. Tiene particularidades únicas que lo hacen destacar entre sus congéneres. La jugabilidad recuerda a juegos posteriores como Hollow khight, siendo bastante abierta y estimulante para el usuario. Ofrece gran cantidad de herramientas que ayudaran al jugador a desenvolverse en el mundo que se presenta sin ponerle las respuestas en bandeja de plata, estimulando así la inventiva del jugador. El apartado artistico es de calidad siendo a mi parecer uno de los mejores juegos representantes del estilo Neo-retro. La música presenta pistas memorables que simulan perfectamente el contexto que se presenta en el juego. Hablando del contexto, la historia nos pone en el Papel de Trace un investigador que cierto día sufre un accidente y se despierta en este planeta extraterrestre guiado por una voz que loo guiara por este viaje de auto descubrimiento donde reflexionara sobre la Moral y la existencia. Axiom verge es sin duda un excelente Metroidvania y es de destacar que el hecho de que haya sido desarrollado por una sola persona lo hace aun mas maravilloso. Totalmente recomendado
Date 2025-01-05 Playtime 4h 56m Rec Positive Hollow Knight is still my all time favorite Metroidvania, but this is definitely up there. The boss fights are not very well designed so far (five hours in), but it gets the exploration and key-and-lock world design totally right.
Date 2025-01-04 Playtime 27h 40m Rec Positive Классическая метроидвания + визуал Гигера = Шедевр
Date 2025-01-04 Playtime 39h 46m Rec Positive Jogo incrível! É o primeiro metroidvania que zerei, e me interessei por ele por causa de sua história, que pode ser um pouco complicada a princípio, mas vai ficando cada vez mais instigante à medida que você avança no jogo e lê as notas encontradas pelo mapa. A estranheza do mundo e a música dão o clima certo pra deixar cada área interessante em vez de parecer algo repetitivo e genérico. As armas tornam a experiência mais divertida já que a variedade permite que cada jogador tenha um jeito diferenciado de jogar dependendo de quais ele escolha (eu te amo, dinger-gisbar). Embora nem todas sejam necessárias (e são muitas), não deixa de ser menos interessante explorar o mapa e encontrá-las. Gostei tanto que fiz logo 100% de tudo, cada pedacinho desse jogo vale muito a pena.
Date 2025-01-04 Playtime 14h 8m Rec Positive Estava com saudades de um metroidvania que realmente lembrasse Metroid, pois os demais fogem muito da formula clássica desse game maravilhoso. Uma pena o Axion Verge 2 (que eu joguei primeiro) ter fugido disso se aproximando mais de todos os outros. Apesar disso, gostei e recomendo ambos os jogos, pois as histórias são fascinantes e cheias de reviravoltas existencialistas.
Date 2025-01-03 Playtime 10h 38m Rec Positive Game visual is absolutely stunning but please I getting lost every 5 minutes even with the map. After few times it starting to irritate me. The moment you cross the whole map and realize you had to figure out what devs had in mind
Date 2025-01-03 Playtime 13h 1m Rec Positive Metroidvania wie es sein sollte.  Grafik ist zweckdienlich. Freue mich dieses spiel komplett durch zu spielen.
Date 2025-01-03 Playtime 20h 39m Rec Positive Great metroidvania , leaning heavily on the metroid side of things. It has a unique and interesting story with a distinctive bio-mechanical sci-fi style mixed with an alien landscape reminiscent of Super metroid.  This game does a lot of things right , it has the classic style of a Snes metroid game without the limits of one , the visuals are great , sound and music are very good , often the music sets the mood for the area.  As a metroidvania it has what you would expect , lots of secrets , 100% item and map completion stats to aim for , a focus on boss fights and platforming and potential for speed running and even randomizing built into the game itself as their own select-able modes.  I spent 20 hours to 100% it on normal and it was very doable with only a few "game logic" secrets that wasted my time but honestly even those could be brute forced or looked up in the steam guides section if needed.  I do have a few complaints , the first is that a main movement feature of the game , a warp dash , requires you to double tap direction buttons to use it , this is garbage.  when moving is so vital being required to stutter step like this causes all kinds of problems and just feels bad , if you use analog stick it can be janky , or if your D-pad isn't very good (Xbox controller) you might get mis-inputs.  Most other buttons can be rebound but not the dash , this brought my enjoyment down and I ended up not using the dash as much as I would have if it was a button press like a dodge roll.  The second complaint is a sound error that seems to randomly occure when changing areas , I played 60% of the game without encountering it but at the end when quickly changing areas to look for secrets I ended up triggering this bug 5 or 6 times , each time it happens the game audio begins to stutter roughly every 2 seconds , turning off steam overlay seems to fix it but until I read that note in the discussion section it was very frustrating.  Overall I would give this game an 7/10 , if you want to play a game like super metroid this is a great choice both in style and feel.
Date 2025-01-03 Playtime 27h 14m Rec Positive Un metroidvania con todas las letras, aunque podría decir que a veces "menos es más".  Desde el inicio se siente increible, sabes a lo que vas y la estetica de metroid queda increible aparte tiene una buena historia, aunque a veces llega a confundir o sentirse laberintico cuando las mécanicas de obtener algo ya deberían ser suficientes, otro detalle es que tiene en exceso cosas que pudiera parecer bueno, pero juega en contra ya que terminas con decenas de armas y sólo unas 4 son (sin contar la que obliga a conseguir) son necesarias o útiles, así como algunos poderes como la capa roja o el gancho, que pueden llegar a ser poco intuitivo y sentirse no tan pulido (por suerte, posiblemente, existe un axiom verge 2 que quizá arregla esto). La estética es increible y los monstruos se ven atemorisantes, pero sólo eso, se ven porque de todos ellos sólo 2 me dieron batalla, 1 por ser esponja de balas y el otro porque tenía un truco para derrotarlo sin problemas, y es triste ya que se sienten desperdiciados. Terminarlo al 100% no es complicado, es tedioso, ya que hay que tomar decenas de items, y muchos son interesantes, al quedarme a poco % de todo tuve que revisar guías e imagenes, porque algunos eran injustos de encontrar o sumamente complicados ya que algunos poderes se "saturan" haciendo más un ejercicio de prueba y error que de habilidad, eso no quita que antes de revisar lo faltante, es gratificante encontrar las cosas escondidas.  En resumen, el juego es increible, muy bueno, se nota el amor y dedicación, es una compra obligada si te gustan los metroidvanias y el iniciar/acabar será bastante gratificante, eso sí, si quieres el 100% lo mejor es acabar la primer partida, e iniciar otra en díficil con guía en mano o sufrir viendo uno a uno los sitios dónde faltó algo.

Date 2025-01-01 Playtime 21h 53m Rec Positive Mais um ótimo metroidvania, meu estilo de jogo preferido, amei ter jogado AxioM Verge.
Date 2025-01-01 Playtime 17h 17m Rec Negative 我个人的游玩体验不太好。 跳跃手感很复古，在空中被上面的平台卡身位掉下来的感觉，和红白机时代的游戏类似； 怪物设计恶意大，很多怪物纯恶心，又快又肉，硬往人脸上贴； 音乐上，最让人不适的就是部分怪物被重构之后的音效，简直像是声卡或者音箱坏掉的声音，刺耳至极； 隐藏要素藏得毫无规律，部分物品连提示都没有，这么想藏那就藏着好了，没啥可找的； 地图设计上，部分位置对操作要求极高，看别人的视频，甚至有一种“飞天”的技巧。不理解这种需要奇怪技巧才能玩的设计思路。
Date 2025-01-01 Playtime 13h 53m Rec Positive This is one of the best metroidvanias I have ever played. And that's saying quite a lot. It has some of the most unique and fun upgrades in any metroidvania in addition to top-notch exploration. The abilities in this game haven't been copied from another game (unlike a certain other popular indie metroidvania), but they're also just a lot of fun to mess around with. There are also tons of secrets to discover, including a variety of optional abilities and weapons in addition to the standard upgrades you'd expect from a metriodvania. The story is great. It makes zero sense whatsoever, but don't worry about that because it's clearly not meant to. This game holds its own even against Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night, and if that's not enough to convince you to buy it, I don't know what is. If you've ever even considered playing this game, or even a metroidvania for that matter, drop what you're doing RIGHT NOW and go buy this game. 10/10.
Date 2024-12-31 Playtime 24h 24m Rec Positive Exactly the type of modern Metroid-vania that I love. Lots of weird items and powers, plenty of exploration and secrets, and the perfect level of difficulty to provide challenge without frustration.
Date 2024-12-31 Playtime 0h 55m Rec Positive Greatest Metroidvania ever made, by a longshot.
Date 2024-12-30 Playtime 13h 11m Rec Positive +
Date 2024-12-30 Playtime 1h 16m Rec Positive Класическая метроидвания, что тут ещё сказать?) Правда людям с атрофированой долей мозга, как у меня, врядли получится дойти даже до Кседруса. Однако, это не мешает этой игре быть класикой жанра, кайфовой и играбельной, даже для нынешних лет.
Date 2024-12-30 Playtime 11h 58m Rec Positive Such a great metroidvania. I just had so much fun with this game, it really scratches that metroidvania itch with a great map that feels natural to traverse.
Date 2024-12-29 Playtime 33h 24m Rec Positive I had already finished this on WiiU over 5 years ago, and double dipped when I recently bought Axiom Verge 2, and decided to 100% the game this time arounds  Pretty good game as other reviews already might have clued you in, my single gripe is that now that I had to 100% it, I noticed how lacking the info on the map is to keep track of what you already achieved.  Getting 100% not only required me to retrace my steps while using a very detailed community map, I basically had to go back to every single item point in the map because I wasn't sure of what I did get and what I didn't. If the game provided any kind of info about things that were already acquired it could've saved me easily, around 7-10 hours.  Probabbly the won't ever get this single QOL feature, as the dev has long since moved on, but it certainly would be a great feature for a game that's already excellent.
Date 2024-12-29 Playtime 21h 41m Rec Positive This is metroidvania at its greatest. Definitely a classic.   For beginners i suggest using a complementary map.
Date 2024-12-28 Playtime 4h 50m Rec Positive Metroid but not made by Nintendo (it's pretty good)
Date 2024-12-28 Playtime 22h 36m Rec Positive Esse foi um dos jogos mais memoráveis que joguei esse ano (ok, nem foram tantos, mas ele é incrível). No começo achei que não ia gostar muito, pois achei os gráficos meio "pobrinhos" e monocromáticos e a jogabilidade não parecia ser grande coisa, bem como a primeira música que tocou na primeira jogatina rápida que fiz, só pra conhecer o jogo. Mas essa impressão foi se invertendo totalmente - os cenários começaram a ficar mais diversificados, com combinações lindas de cores, os inimigos foram ficando mais interessantes, as músicas ficaram muito cativantes e refletem bem o ambiente e as armas foram sendo aprimoradas, melhorando ainda mais a jogabilidade. Em resumo, logo percebi que estava com um BAITA JOGÃO.  Divertido demais, dá vontade de explorar tudo e descobrir cada vez mais desse jogo. Quanto à história... bem, ela é meio confusa e, honestamente, eu não costumo dar muita bola pra história de jogo na maioria das vezes, ainda mais quando ela tenta fazer uma coisa muito rocambulesca (como parece ser o caso de Axiom Verge), mas entender a história também não é primordial para se divertir demais com esse jogo e os diálogos que acontecem durante a jogatina não incomodam. 10/10
Date 2024-12-27 Playtime 23h 25m Rec Positive Waiting for the third part
Date 2024-12-27 Playtime 14h 51m Rec Positive Completely forgot I ever played this game.
Date 2024-12-27 Playtime 32h 28m Rec Positive I don't really know what to say here, I just really love this game. I wholeheartedly recommend it.

Date 2024-12-27 Playtime 14h 29m Rec Positive Nice take on the metroidvania genre with tons of hidden stuff to discover. Great selection of weapons and some unique gadgets. Kinda reminiscent of Metroid 1, though a lot smoother and more modern. The graphics are simple, but some of the artwork is very cool. Has a nice little sci-fi story that unfolds at certain key points along the way. Took me 9 years to play this since its release, but would definitely recommend if you like metroidvanias.  Also, perfectly suited to the Steam Deck!
Date 2024-12-26 Playtime 303h 58m Rec Positive Wonderful game. Very fun, lots of weapons, options, and secrets. The story is confusing and weird, but that's fine for a game this fun. I had to look up the FAQs on Steam, as the game leaves a lot unexplained. The soundtrack is fantastic.
Date 2024-12-24 Playtime 10h 6m Rec Positive Classic Sci-Fi like none other
Date 2024-12-24 Playtime 7h 30m Rec Positive Gran Metroidvania. Tardé un poco en agarrarle el ritmo pero valió la pena.
Date 2024-12-24 Playtime 16h 8m Rec Positive Muy buen Metroidvania. Si le cambias el traje por el de Samus, en los 90 hubiese sido una maravillosa secuela de Metroid de NES. El juego me ha durado unas 16 horas hasta completarlo.
Date 2024-12-22 Playtime 11h 6m Rec Negative The first two hours of the game are AMAZING and hooks you completely. Then as it progresses it slowly depletes your interest over time. Forcing you to run back and forth on the map without instruction hitting a wall with your new power up  to find the next destination. The enemies slowly get worse, where they are seemingly designed to waste your time. Then the last two hours the game implodes by dumping buckets of enemies on your head. I felt like the rug was pulled from underneath my feet.
Date 2024-12-22 Playtime 19h 39m Rec Positive As far as solo developed indie games go, this one's easily in my top 3. This game is very much on the Metroid side of the Metroidvania genre, which is great, since nobody every really knows when to expect the next 2D Metroid. If you're a fan, this is a must-play imo. Can't wait to jump into the sequel.
Date 2024-12-22 Playtime 31h 30m Rec Positive Axiom Verge es un juego que rinde homenaje a la época dorada de Metroid con su jugabilidad de exploración y acción en 2D. Su ambiente es una mezcla perfecta de Mega Man, Metroid y Castlevania, ofreciendo una experiencia única y nostálgica. El arte visual, con un estilo pixel art, es impresionante, creando una atmósfera solitaria y llena de incertidumbre que te sumerge por completo en el mundo del juego.  La jugabilidad es desafiante, pero muy gratificante, con mecánicas innovadoras como el uso de un "Virus" para hackear el entorno y alterar enemigos. La historia, aunque enigmática, mantiene el interés y se va desvelando poco a poco mientras exploras.  Si eres fan de los juegos de acción y aventura con exploración no lineal, Axiom Verge es una joya que no puedes dejar pasar.

Date 2024-12-19 Playtime 12h 46m Rec Positive A hidden gem amongst the metroid-vania style of games
Date 2024-12-18 Playtime 11h 49m Rec Positive I usually prefer action platformers over games that require exploration, but Axiom Verge always intrigued me because of the visual style. It's taken me long enough to get around to playing it but I really enjoyed it.  Collecting the upgrades, using the drone and warp techniques and fighting some huge bosses really made this game stand out.  I would definitely recommend this to those who enjoy the genre and even if you prefer things a little more linear like Contra or Metal Slug then it's worth playing.
Date 2024-12-18 Playtime 9h 49m Rec Positive It's a classic Metroid game. Buy it if you like that sort of thing.
Date 2024-12-17 Playtime 22h 55m Rec Negative i liked the game in the beginning but i cant get through this game without stressing myself. im done edit 1: gonna give this game another try to see if i can beat it. ill come back in about 400 hours
Date 2024-12-17 Playtime 15h 25m Rec Positive Certified good time, just a really well-done metroidvania (leaning way more heavily toward the metroid side of things) with lots of rewarding goodies to seek out. The secret worlds mechanic is interesting, but a little frustrating to look for on my crappy monitor.
Date 2024-12-16 Playtime 27h 10m Rec Positive 艺术和战斗部分都很优秀www很不错的一款类银
Date 2024-12-16 Playtime 12h 23m Rec Positive good
Date 2024-12-16 Playtime 20h 36m Rec Positive It's been almost 10 years, and the soundtrack still occupies my brain space. Look, the gameplay is okay, and the story is nothing to write home about, but I love revisiting this sci fi world and it's haunting tunes.
Date 2024-12-15 Playtime 18h 29m Rec Positive A Metroid clone at its finest. It has a lot of gun types (like over 20), so you can kind of pick your playstyle. The ability progression is great and the bosses are fun challenges. There are lots of good secrets to find and the map is complex but not overwhelming. The gameplay is fun and intuitive for the most part Overall, a good game worth its price.
Date 2024-12-14 Playtime 23h 45m Rec Positive This is a great metroidvania, My bar has been set high in the genre because my only other experience in it was Hollowknight (xbox not on steam), both Ori games, Carrion, and Nine Sols. Yet this one still met my high expectations. I would not say it's as good as HollowKnight, Ori, or Ninesols. But it still deserves to be checked out.  And the exploration perfectly satiates the need for silk-song as of right now.  As for some criticisms, the weapons are not balanced, quite a few are very op. And the boss fights are not that good, either having attacks almost impossible to dodge or being painfully easy to cheese with no in between.  Other then that, the pixel art is beautiful at times, while unbalanced the weapons are at least very unique and fun to play around with, again the exploration is top tier, the music is great I wish their where more tracks, you will find a lot of secrets, and the Intro has one of the best hooks into the narrative I've seen.  Would recommend, the sequel is on my wishlist.
Date 2024-12-14 Playtime 19h 24m Rec Positive Retro bliss!
Date 2024-12-13 Playtime 0h 16m Rec Negative This game overwrites your save file when you die.
Date 2024-12-13 Playtime 17h 42m Rec Positive One of the greatest metroidvania games out there. The sense of being lost in an alien, hostile world and finding your way through it is EXTREMELY satisfying. Every little detail makes for a perfect experience. Feels like the first Metroid with all of these years of refinement.
Date 2024-12-12 Playtime 8h 11m Rec Negative Axiom verge is an incredible achievement considering it was made entirely by a single developer. However, while it has many great features, I found the overall experience to be mediocre.  First, the positives: The art design is great, although the pixel art is often unrefined - I suspect the developer was mimicing old SNES-style pixel art without fully understanding why it works. The music is also quite good, although there isn't that much of it. The game's atmosphere is excellent, and I really enjoyed the overall story idea. The game is much more Super Metroid than Hollow Knight, which is refreshing in a genre where every new metriodvania is trying to be a soulslike. The equipment/tools were really interesting, especially the address manipulator (when used on enemies), and the drone was awesome.  Unfortunately, story wasn't actually that great once you get into the details. The characters were interesting, and I wish we had more time with them. There were some interesting and deep ideas that were not properly explored, and while I understand that you're supposed to collect pages to figure out the story, too much of it was either not fleshed out or only dropped in lore-dumps at the middle and end of the game. Also I really don't like the idea that "it could have all been a dream" (it canonically wasn't, but that feeling is annoying).  The gameplay itself is not that good. There are way too many weapons, and most of them aren't any good - I used one main weapon, then a new one when I found it, then a third for the rest of the game. I found no situational use for any of the other dozen weapons past the first hour. The general combat is good, but not amazing. Boss battles are boring and easy, and every area is designed in the same way, with only slightly modified enemies. Backtracking is particularly annoying because there are no fast movement upgrades and you have to spam your address manupulator and drill everywhere to find anything. The map just felt like a chore to navigate. The idea of "glitching" enemies was really interesting, but there was so much more potential for actual proper puzzles utilising this mechanic. Also the controls are not good, especially the dash which requires you to let go and then double-tap.  Mostly, the large amount of aimless backtracking, too many unused weapons, and boring bosses and areas made the game feel like a chore after a few hours.
Date 2024-12-11 Playtime 0h 31m Rec Negative TL;DR - я вернул игру из-за отсутствия лайфбара у первого босса.   Обзор на первые 30 минут игры.  Axiom Verge это олдскульная метроидвания. Классный визуал, саундтрек, интригующая завязка. По факту всё как обещано, без но - это реально тот самый продукт, о котором заявлено на странице Steam. По крайней мере первые 30 минут это точно он. Важно обратить внимание на детали. Это [b]олдскульная[/b] метроидвания.  Регенерации нет, есть несколько чекпоинтов - это окей, но нет и аптечек, при сильном ранении проще умереть, чем идти до босса, в чём кайф?  У босса нет шкалы жизни. Мой опыт - я добрых двадцать минут стрелял, уклонялся, погибал, заходил на него заново и не понимал - вроде бы вспышка урона по боссу есть, но никакого прогресса нет. Мне такой диалог с игрой сильно грузит голову - правильно ли я всё делаю, понимаю ли я этого босса или же мне нужно лезть в walkthrough просто чтобы убедиться - стреляй и будет тебе счастье?   В итоге так и оказалось, нужно просто выжить и достаточно долго пострелять в босса, но желания пытаться это сделать уже не было - если сейчас так, то что ожидать потом?  Предупреждали ли меня другие отрицательные обзоры? Да, наверное. Но я хотел взять что-то очень [i]красивое[/i] по хорошей скидке. Объективно Axiom Verge - красивая игра, даже интересная. Но не настолько чтобы я стал ради неё мучить себя в догадках, идиот я или нет.  Not my cup of tea. Мне не понять бумерство новых игр, которое достигается за счёт примитивных ограничений. Эстетика - притягивает, бесспорно, но мазохизм - нет. Делает ли меня это казуальщиком? Мне всё равно, я взрослый семейный мужчина, моё эго давно не привязано к играм.   [i]В 90-х у меня компьютера не было чтобы ностальгировать, а в нулевых я читовал чтобы просто посмотреть сюжеты игр (либо звал друзей пройти за меня). [/i]  Справедливо будет пройти её на ютубе, но опять же, в мире столько красивых игр которые мне ещё и по зубам, что скорее всего у меня просто не дойдут руки.  Без оценки, мнение субъективно, это просто моя ошибка что я её купил, будучи человеком не для этой игры. Если вы в чём-то на меня, то я игру не рекомендую. Если у вас другие вкусы - никаких претензий, искренне надеюсь что вам всё понравилось.
Date 2024-12-10 Playtime 19h 17m Rec Negative A disappointment.  + The pixel art is adequate and the bio-mechanical, Geiger-esque setting is interesting + Customizable controls + The music is actually quite good  - Absolutely atrocious UX (i.e. different keys for the same action across multiple menus) - Only two map markers allowed, without text = easily lost and a [b]huge[/b] waste of time spent backtracking  - No fast travel whatsoever - Double tap to dash instead of a dedicated button is counter-productive and unjustified - Movement is stiff, especially when using the grappling hook and attempting mid-air dashes - The story is uninspired, generic

Date 2024-12-08 Playtime 1h 34m Rec Negative Yo lo siento muchísimo, porque el juego tiene pinta de estar muy bueno, pero la exploración es la cosa más aburrida que hice en mi vida.   Me pasé dos bosses y noté que tienen un diseño interesante, e imagino que más adelante, en otras zonas, habrá más y mejores.  El juego hace todo bien, pero si es aburrido, no hay nada que hacer. Muy tedioso, me dio paja seguir jugándolo.

Date 2024-12-07 Playtime 11h 49m Rec Positive Nice to have an indie Metroidvania that's more Metroid than Castlevania for once.
Date 2024-12-06 Playtime 21h 2m Rec Positive Amor y odio.  Me gustó mucho la música, el diseño de los enemigos, los escenarios, la historia a pesar de que a veces puede ser confusa.  Todo esto se ve opacado por el control. Yo lo jugué en su totalidad con una stem deck y con lo que mas tuve problemas fue con este apartado. Los controles llegan a ser poco responsivos y el dash, ve verdad que lo odio.

Date 2024-12-03 Playtime 16h 15m Rec Positive This brings back memories of playing Super Metroid years ago.
Date 2024-12-02 Playtime 14h 50m Rec Positive I love a good metroidvania, and this one was just fine. I enjoyed exploring the environments to find upgrades and managed to finish it in the same weekend I picked it up. It isn't perfect, though. The sound scheme is pretty grating, the story doesn't make much sense, and the boss fights are fairly simple. It doesn't rise to the level of Hollow Knight, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, or Dead Cells. Still, it satisfied my desire for a metroidvania fix just fine, especially at the sale price. Ran perfectly on the SD.
Date 2024-12-02 Playtime 23h 33m Rec Positive [i]“Nothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is non-existent. And don’t bother concealing your thievery - celebrate it if you feel like it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: “It’s not where you take things from - it’s where you take them to."[/i]   This quote from Jim Jarmusch Is the perfect definition for what Is Axiom Verge.  On the surface, this game can look like a direct copy of Metroid, but once you go deeper into this game the comparisons with that game become mere references. Axiom Verge, took all the elements of classic Metroid, aesthetic, atmosphere, exploration, scale of power, player agency, and took it further and created an own Identity In the process, but not only with Nintendo's franchise, It also takes the retro aesthetic as a part of the worldbuilding In an original way. making it stand out of the rest of retro-inspired Indie Videogames out there.  This game is also varied and packed with content. It's Insane how much this game have. there's a ton of collectibles, zones, enemies, Items, mechanics, secrets, and weapons, lots of weapons. each one with their own quirks and functions.  Another aspect that is great Is the soundtrack. normally, this type of games have a good OST, but Axiom Verge has a very good, varied, and memorable OST that goes with the ambient of this game and it's variety.  And those thing I describe was made solely [u]BY ONE PERSON[/u]  Words cannot express how good and original this game is, because that would spoil the experience. Axiom Verge Is one of those pieces of work that is better to experience yourself without knowing nothing about it before. so what are you waiting for? BUY THIS GAME NOW!
Date 2024-11-30 Playtime 31h 0m Rec Positive Really enjoyed Axiom Verge. Found it super hard though. Worth completing. Works great on steam-deck.
Date 2024-11-29 Playtime 13h 37m Rec Positive One of the best MetroidVanias I've played. Great exploration, graphics, and combat. It manages to find the sweet spot in backtracking and discovery in that important items and areas are well hidden enough to make discovering them feel like an achievement, but are not so well hidden to make finding them feel impossible or necessitating the use of guides.
Date 2024-11-29 Playtime 33h 22m Rec Positive Как я говорил ранее я поделю обзор на три или две категорий. 1) плюсы игры: ну самый первый и очевидный плюс игры в том что игра напомнила мне старые игр  которые я играл в детстве за что авторам большое спасибо, второй плюс это механика управление она проста и легка в понимание, третий плюс в том что музыка разная и враги с боссами разнообразные, четвертый плюс в оружий его в игре не сказал что много но и не мало что очень порадовало меня особенно огнемет это оружие стало моим любимым. 2) минусы игры: минусов оказалось не так много ну или я просто дурак и не заметил их. первый минус это карта и собирание всех предметов, возможно это даже не минус но мне честно сказать было сложно это делать и причина проста в некоторые места я просто не мог попасть и причиной оказался коды для этих мест а как я по вашему должен был догадаться  и наверное все. 3) мое мнение о игре: что странное игра мне не понравилось, да она напомнила мне детство и мне было приятно, да музыка была нормальной, врагов и боссов тоже были отличные да все в игре было отлично, почему же тогда мне игра не понравилась, все просто из-за некоторых достижений в игре я её и стал ненавидеть, вроде игра простая и можно сказать легкая но я потратил на эти достижение больше времени чем на саму игру когда проходил её и даже так я не смог получить эти достижение, но именно но я все ровно получу эти достижение и больше не когда не буду снова играть в эту игру, шучу может когда нибуть и поиграю снова, чтобы вспомнить как она меня раздражала. Советую я эту игру другим думаю да только тем кто хочет вспомнить старые игры им она больше понравится а так игра нормальная была бы отличная если бы меня не мучали те достижение.   Я хочу добавить пару слов, я получил все достижение в игре и как было ранние сказано о игре так и остается, я потратил больше времени на эти достижение чем на игру когда просто проходил и знаете что получив их я смог принять тот факт что наконец-то смог это сделать и я рад этой игрой очень но больше не буду играть в нее как говорил ранее возможно только в будущем поиграю да и то не точно.

Date 2024-11-27 Playtime 10h 45m Rec Positive No está mal, a veces es frustrante el seguir avanzando porque hay demasiadas trabas, demasiado backtracking al que tienes que ir mucho, MUCHO más tarde de lo que sería normal y te lía hasta el punto de no saber por donde ir porque la parte del mapa por la que deberías ir, ya la has olvidado. Se juega bien, los gráficos están bien y la banda sonora salvo un par de temas cargantes, no está mal.
Date 2024-11-24 Playtime 15h 2m Rec Positive It is one of the most popular metroidvanias, and for a good reason. Very similar to Metroid in the general style. The Babylonian references and "glitch"-based story are great.
Date 2024-11-23 Playtime 15h 10m Rec Positive a masterpiece that does what a metroidvania should. its actually comparable to metroid and castlevania games. not just a poor imitation, not shit controls, just a great game. the plot is good, the options are nice, it plays well, it looks amazing, and its not too short of a game to get your fill. my only complaint, is back tracking could of been improved a bit

Date 2024-11-18 Playtime 28h 15m Rec Positive 还没通关，但是非常想吐槽钩锁，取得钩锁之后还以为一段爽快的游戏体验即将开始了，结果拿个生命值搞了快1个小时，我知道自己手残，但是这个钩锁手感也太屎了——评价于2024.11.18 确实是一款好玩的类银河恶魔城游戏，越玩越上头的那种，钩锁手感确实不太好，但是后续解锁瞬移和无人机传送后，游戏就爽了很多，强烈推荐。——评价于2024.11.24
Date 2024-11-18 Playtime 11h 31m Rec Positive Recommend for Metroid/Super Metroid fans. Liked the music a lot. Found that I skimmed over a lot of the weapons. R3/L3 hot slots + double tap direction to teleport made for some frustrated inputs. I kept jumping between D pad and analog sticks.  Overall though, vibrant, creative, and immersive. Nice work.
Date 2024-11-17 Playtime 28h 1m Rec Positive Played on hard difficulty from the get go, it was challenging but mostly balanced, it was a great experience, the story is very intriguing, the environment is beautiful and feels alien as it should, the music was great and it  supplemented that alien feeling, the weapons and abilites were varried enough and very fun to use, the lack of fast travel and the inability to dodge against the last few bossess are probably my only complaints about the game.  As for the achievements, they aren't very tedious or such, they were reasonable and fun, and all of them can be finished in 2 playthroughs with relative ease. In short, I highly recommend it.

Date 2024-11-12 Playtime 18h 34m Rec Positive Un Metroidvania Algo Extraño Pero Fascinante!!!
Date 2024-11-11 Playtime 19h 45m Rec Positive Yeah this game is great so far. (I don't actually have 30 hrs played, Steam Deck bug. It's more like 4.5 hrs)  Will update upon completion.  [b]Edit:[/b] Just rolled credits at around 19 hrs. Overall I enjoyed Axiom Verge. Exploration is probably its biggest strength. Except for the fact that all the game's collectibles are not hinted at. I don't enjoy feeling like I need to refer to a guide to 100% a game.  This game has so many different weapons and I think that's awesome. However, half of them are pretty useless because they're designed with a specific gimmick that just don't compete with some of the better, straight-forward weapons. But when you have to switch to certain weapons to eliminate a specific enemy, I think that's a really fun design. It makes games feel less one-dimensional.  Speaking of combat, some of it can feel clunky. Though that may be because this is a "retro" game and you shouldn't expect it to feel as smooth as Metroid Dread. But overall it's pretty fun, when you're not fighting one of the game's more annoying enemies. Like the final boss. Oh my god what a terrible boss design. You know it's not good when every strategy discussed over this boss is some weird way to cheese the win. There's no fun or fair designed way to beat it and that brought down the score of the game for me. It was bitter sweet to have enjoyed the game most of the way through just for the final area/boss to sour the experience. It made completing the game feel a lot less satisfying. It was more like, I'm glad this is over.  I still recommend this game though. It has some really unique designs that left me impressed. I enjoyed getting each traversal ability. My only complaint about them would be the grapple hook. I wish it was utilized more and didn't feel so janky to use. But teleporting, different jackets with different abilities, drones, hacking? So many cool designs here. And the music was pretty great too. As for story, this game goes pretty deep sci-fi and I basically skipped through most of it because it did nothing for me. But that's okay, I'm never really expecting stellar writing with this genre. All about the gameplay.  7/10
Date 2024-11-11 Playtime 15h 33m Rec Positive DOGSHIT
Date 2024-11-10 Playtime 11h 38m Rec Positive Not bad. It isn't the sort of game I usually play, but it was okay. Too bad there's no fast-travel. The save pods would have been perfect for that.
Date 2024-11-08 Playtime 20h 3m Rec Positive Decent Metroidvania with some fun power-ups, a lot of different weapons to collect which gives you some freedom in tackling how you play, and cool boss and NPC designs. Downsides: if you get lost or can't figure out where to go next, you might have to do a lot of backtracking, and that can get annoying - a more robust/modern fast travel feature could have really helped out here. Also, sometimes when you get hit, your sprite disappears and you can't tell where you are, which is a problem when you keep falling into a vat of poison or whatever. Also, it's pretty short and has an explicit speedrun mode which I haven't played yet, and given how long I typically spend on games I consider this a plus. Overall I give it a neutral-to-positive review.
Date 2024-11-06 Playtime 31h 38m Rec Positive One of the best games I ever played.
Date 2024-11-05 Playtime 20h 10m Rec Positive Un juego de plataformas bastante bueno que nos ponen en el papel de un investigador tras un accidente que es llevado a un mundo extraterrestre por unas maquinas que les pide ayuda. Por gameplay es bastante bueno con muchas armas para divertirse ademas de explorar las zonas del mapa varias veces para saber secretos, me entretuvo bastante.
Date 2024-11-03 Playtime 11h 57m Rec Positive Playing Axiom Verge immediately after Environmental Station Alpha was an interesting decision on my part. It's certainly not an original comparison, given that both games are heavily inspired by Metroid and were released within a month of each other, but regardless, it's a comparison that is difficult to avoid. Where ESA seeks to replicate the structure and design of Super Metroid in a low fidelity, mechanically tight construction, Axiom Verge instead returns to the progenitor of the series. It almost plays like a souped-up version of the NES Metroid, as if it had been dragged kicking and screaming into the modern day. Room layouts have been lifted entirely, and the dreamlike, surreal quality of those 8-bit visuals have been reimagined as a Giger-esque nightmare.   Again, very little of what I've written so far is original observation. The inspiration for both games is worn very clearly, but I find it interesting how different they are when from the outside they seem so similar. One isn't necessarily better than the other, their individual strengths and weaknesses are probably about even, but in the end, I find ESA the better game. That game seeks to replicate the mechanical purity and structure of its inspiration, but Axiom Verge is all about the *vibe*.  Much more work has been put into Axiom's presentation. The visuals are at times jaw dropping (though they are just as often muddy and overly-detailed to the point of visual exhaustion). The music too is impressively varied, with a great selection of synths, vocals and moods presented. The creature design, powerups and story are more interesting too, with certain abilities entirely new to the genre, and though the plot is fairly thin, the background and setting are pretty original. Axiom Verge feels like what playing the original Metroid back in 1986 must have been like: etheral, surprising and, crucially, a bit shit.  Yeah that's the twist there. For all the artistry of the visuals, writing and music, the gameplay here lets Axiom Verge down hugely. Moment to moment, it's fun. The selection of weapons is impressive and by the end of the game, you feel like a god of death. But compared to Environmental Station Alpha or, hell, even to Super Metroid, it's stiff and unsatisfying. The grapple hook is a fantastic example, where ESA's hookshot is a delightfully nippy, skillful powerup that relies on perfect momentum management, Axiom's grapple is ripped right out of Bionic Commando with next to no improvement. It's fine, it's fun enough, but it's a bit crap. Other powerups are equally finnicky, with the teleport dash requiring a fiddly double tap on the D pad rather than a single button press, making it feel like you're constantly sequence breaking rather than doing what the game wants you to do.   The combat is as disappointing as the platforming though. For as cool and impressive the weapons look at first, most of them are junk and would be better off never being collected as they only serve to clutter the weapon select wheel. The combat never asks more of you than just picking the gun you think will work best against the current enemy and spam  it over and over. The bosses too are pretty dire, all of them way too simple to defeat and visually very similar. Worst of all though might be the navigation, as it's almost impossible to remember the samey, nonsensical layouts of the world. Whereas in ESA and Super Metroid, every room has a distinct layout that connect to one another in memorable ways, Axiom feels almost random in its world design. Combined with a map that records only the basic shape of each area (not even recording the locations of found pickups, let alone hidden ones or obstacles yet unpassed), makes a game that is very annoying to actually find the stuff you need. Over and over I see people complain of how much they got lost in Axiom Verge, and I get it, I myself at several points had no idea where I was supposed to go and had to resort to trawling across the unnecessarily big map before happening on the path forward seemingly at random.  It might seem like I hate Axiom Verge, but that couldn't be further from the truth really. I enjoyed my time with it a lot, but it's incredibly unrefined. As a solo effort, it's still extremely impressive and its art and world design are incredibly unique, but in the end it's far from the peak of this quasi-genre. If you've run out of Metroid games and want something that will give you that same feeling without coming off derivative, absolutely give Axiom Verge a go, but don't expect a masterpiece.
Date 2024-11-01 Playtime 13h 26m Rec Positive Tutto sommato è un buon metroidvania, ma che man mano che va avanti perde un po'.  L'esplorazione è ok, ma non troverete molta roba, solo potenziamenti passivi e armi che però in tutta onesta non ho quasi mai usato. In piu ci sono i potenziamenti necessari per raggiungere una nuova area.  Sul finale i nemici diventano piu difficili che è normale, ma ho trovato andare avanti un po' frustrante. Non da abbandonare il gioco, comunque  La trama è meh. C'è un motivo per cui fai ciò che fai, ma potrebbe essere descritto in 3 righe, e del colpo di scena non te ne frega niente. euro Non è brutto, quello che ha è abbastanza solido, quindi in sconto è un buon gioco, ma non lo prenderei a 18 euro 
Date 2024-11-01 Playtime 46h 39m Rec Positive Very good game, the music and some ideas are very good. A bestiary for hacker achievements would be nice... (also some enemies the same color as the background was a bad idea...)
Date 2024-10-31 Playtime 13h 59m Rec Positive Starts off kinda slow, but it's fun and there's a story.
Date 2024-10-29 Playtime 17h 42m Rec Positive  A beautiful and solid homage to metroidvanias that does enough interesting things to stand on its own and be considered among the greats. The first game share more DNA with metroid and the second more with castlevania, I absolutely cant wait to see what direction the solo dev takes the third game in.
Date 2024-10-28 Playtime 17h 40m Rec Positive Great metroidvania fun! The story is quite compelling as well - with a little extra hint after beating hard mode.
Date 2024-10-27 Playtime 18h 20m Rec Positive First playthrough directly in Hard mode . The only complains are bosses are very unbalanced from being cheezy to very hard and some enemies are very hard to dodge away in the end game , so it is basically a race between you and the enemies .   But outside of these , art style and exploration is super fun . The enviroment is super lively and engaging gameplay wise ( unlike Hollow Knight )  . Highly recommend it .
Date 2024-10-27 Playtime 19h 3m Rec Positive This is a surprisingly solid metroidvania, especially given its genesis as a single-developer project.  It's got several gameplay elements -- such as the ability to "glitch" some blocks and enemies, or the ability to launch a remote drone -- that are innovative for the genre, and manages to be one of the few metroidvanias that feels complete and robust without a double jump.  I do recommend it -- it will reward your time.  That said, there are a few parts which I personally feel could have been improved.  It follows the retro Metroid aesthetic of having lore and powerups which are entirely hidden, with no or very little clue to their presence.  For games where weapon strikes are enough to reveal the hidden areas, that's on the edge of reasonable, but for a game where any one of six different movement/exploration abilities might be the trigger for a hidden area that might be literally anywhere on the map, it gets extremely frustrating without a guide.  Once I realized it did this, I gave up and just played with one open, resenting the game a little.  It also has a retro type movement aesthetic that feels a little hostile in the modern age.  While movement itself is crisp, and it's got a button to hold position and aim, there are one or two notable gaps.  The aim button is excellent, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't seem to have controller support -- you're limited to up/down/left/right/diagonal.  The game also has a late-game dash ability, but that dash ability is mapped to double-tap instead of a button, and some of the longer/taller jumps are unnecessarily challenging due to having to go from holding a jump direction to double-tapping it to holding it again.  This also means that you have a dodge input delay, so you can't rely on it much in combat, forcing you to be much more tactical about slow guerrilla warfare, abusing corners and thin walls.  Fortunately, the game (at least on normal) is generous with health and save points, but it's a drag on the combat system.  The game also has an *absurd* number of weapons, 20 plus three secret additions -- and there's no feedback on damage levels, so it's more or less impossible to optimize; and it's so tedious to switch between them that it's easier to pick a reasonably versatile weapon and fight inefficiently than to switch back and forth to address new situations optimally.  All that said, those frustrations are the difference between being a solid game and a classic of the genre, and solid is still an accomplishment worth celebrating.  There's also a sequel, and I'll definitely see if I like it better.
Date 2024-10-26 Playtime 6h 1m Rec Negative Why not just play metroid?
Date 2024-10-23 Playtime 10h 41m Rec Positive 非常好玩的一款类银游戏，游戏难度也不高。特别是这种复古的画风，很是喜欢。非常推荐玩一玩。就是全收集有点折磨人，太能藏了。打完物品收集才77%，地图95%。（汉化补丁我是在小黑盒评论里找到的）
Date 2024-10-22 Playtime 28h 48m Rec Positive Es como Metroid 1, pero si fuera jugable.
Date 2024-10-21 Playtime 7h 23m Rec Positive It's a very fundamentally solid Metroidvania, though it uses a few too many buttons for my liking. The art style in particular is beautiful.
Date 2024-10-21 Playtime 10h 16m Rec Positive I had this game for the longest time on my library, I must've bought it on a sale long ago. Glad I did, it was quite a pleasant experience, full run took about 8h give or take, non 100%.  The enemy/environment hacking really makes for some interesting possibilities, specially when this is needed in order to attain pass codes to open hidden areas, definitely one of the highlights of the game.
Date 2024-10-21 Playtime 14h 0m Rec Positive Es un muy buen metroidvania con armas de fuego, tiene una excelente estética a lo Alien, eso si, me perdi bien feo un par de veces y tuve que buscar un video de youtube para saber donde ir, pero me encanto.
Date 2024-10-21 Playtime 0h 41m Rec Negative Sencillamente no es mi juego. Al que le guste un juego sin objetivo, para vagar por ahí muriendo y estar horas perdido sin rumbo y no saber qué te ha matado, va a tener un GOTY delante.
Date 2024-10-20 Playtime 12h 29m Rec Negative This is a fun game, but ultimately unsatisfying.  Heavily inspired by the 2D Metroid games, you pick up a gun, run, and jump around Metroid-esque environments doing very Metroid-style things. Lots of shooting and picking up upgrades. The environments are well built, the music has identity, and the action is pretty nice. So why do I give it a thumbs down?  The lack of fast travel and the unresolved story.  This is yet another game that thinks having no fast travel is a good idea because it encourages "exploration". What it actually does is cause massive backtracking. There are no objective markers, either, and your next goal isn't always clear. Most item-gates are also not labeled on the map. There's a couple of markers you can put on the map yourself, but they simply say "1" and "2", no symbols. Exploring is made so difficult in this game that I honestly think you would get through the game faster if you just drew your own map. The items you find are admittedly quite good, though.  Meanwhile, the story ends on a cliffhanger that may never be resolved, making the story overall kind of lame. It starts with a lot of promise, but it eventually gets bogged down by unlikeable characters and ends with what's barely a resolution if you were following along with the notes and dialogue. It's not the worst thing, but it is frustrating.  Worth it on sale, but I wouldn't buy it at full price. My expectations were high going in and those expectations were not met.
Date 2024-10-19 Playtime 17h 56m Rec Positive Solid Metroidvania
Date 2024-10-19 Playtime 14h 55m Rec Positive Definetely itches the Metroidvania itch. Enjoying it so far. Seems built for speedrunning if that's your thing. A noticeable con: The environments seem to kind of meld together some. Different colors and all but kind of samey.
Date 2024-10-19 Playtime 12h 14m Rec Positive Good game
Date 2024-10-18 Playtime 11h 0m Rec Positive 玩了一个小时，太吵了，实在是太吵了！TOO NOISY!!!!!! 游戏本身挺不错的，通过解锁武器来到达地图上更多的地方，很标准的类银河城，目前遇到两个BOSS，战斗难度不高，小怪比较烦人。 骇入系统很喜欢，不同的怪物被骇入之后会有不同的效果，后面应该是通过提升道具等级可以骇入更高级的怪物，这是促使我玩下去的一大动力。 地图还可以，有小地图也不用经常打开地图看位置，好评。 音效对于喜欢这种风格的人来说应该还行吧，我不理解，对于我来说就是A PIECE OF SH*T. 喜欢银河城的可以入手试试，把音乐音效关了听着其他东西玩还是挺不错的，有空通关后再谈谈感受。 The game,good.The vioce,bad.
Date 2024-10-18 Playtime 0h 51m Rec Positive Simples e atrativo, deixa muito jogo com visuais fantásticos no bolso... grata surpresa.
Date 2024-10-14 Playtime 23h 1m Rec Positive [h1]Comentario Analítico: "Axiom Verge"[/h1]  Quizá uno de los mejores Metroidvanias del sector independiente, Axiom Verge me sorprendió muy para bien. Entré esperando un juego entretenido y acabé enganchadísimo con su historia.  Visualmente es precioso, tiene un aire a Ghost in the Shell, sabe jugar con el concepto de glitch y aprovecharlo para su argumento, no se limita a ser un espectáculo visual e incluso el flickering de algunos sprites ocurre a medias, tal y como ocurría en la NES. La banda sonora es fabulosa también, digna de tenerla guardada en tu celular.  Si tuviera que puntualizar algo negativo diría que algunos enemigos atacan desde puntos muertos que el jugador aún no logra visualizar. Los jefes son fenomenales pero no me gustó Ukhu, creo que con unos cambios en su arena podría ser un combate excelente.  [b]¿En conclusión?[/b] Una muy grata sorpresa.
Date 2024-10-14 Playtime 46h 15m Rec Positive Axiom Verge в эту замечательную игру поиграл по совету товарища, я в диком восторге, давно уже не получал тех эмоций после прохождения метроидваний на эмуляторе. В купе с бомбезным саундтреком первое прохождение наслаждался по полной.  В итоге наиграл 46 часов, пройдя все режимы и залутав все ачивки, на очереди вторая часть и ожидание третьей
Date 2024-10-11 Playtime 1h 16m Rec Negative i only played like an hour but i hate how often you had to backtrack without a small hint, i know metroidvanias are supposed to have some level of backtracking but you get upgrades so often and the map gets too big really quickly and there are so many blocked areas that i wished it gave me a hint on where to go next or at least the map marked inaccessible or newly accessible areas in some way  i also hate the enemy placements in some cases cause you have no way to get past an enemy without taking damage and it sucks even more that enemies have a low chance to drop health
Date 2024-10-08 Playtime 18h 59m Rec Positive Очень хорошо здесь практически все. Жду третью часть.
Date 2024-10-05 Playtime 20h 12m Rec Positive Esse jogo foi uma das melhores experiências que eu já tive. Tudo nele remete à jogos antigos como os Castlevania 2D ou os Metroids clássicos. (Óbvio, já que o gênero se chama Metroidvania)  Mas esse é diferente, ele não te interrompe com salas de loja, NPC's diversos com várias linhas de diálogo. Os diálogos, quando existentes, são somente para a história principal, tudo se encaixa de uma forma excelente na narrativa.  A gameplay é fluida, dinâmica, responsiva, em momento algum eu senti que o jogo é injusto, se teve algo que eu tive dificuldade foi 100% skill issue meu. A exploração é perfeita, a sensação de visitar novas áreas sempre dá um peso gratificando à jogatina.  Resumo: Incrível
Date 2024-10-05 Playtime 13h 9m Rec Positive One of the pinnacle examples of MetroidVania gameplay on PC. Stop reading and buy it.
Date 2024-10-04 Playtime 4h 46m Rec Negative ㅈㄴ 구림 메트로배니아 좋아하지만 이건 좀 일부구간은 진입하자마자 몹한테 바로 닿아있거나 다굴당할수밖에 없는 이상한 레벨디자인 정상적으로 진행했음에도 갇히게 되는 구간도 있음(재시작하지않으면 탈출불가)
Date 2024-09-29 Playtime 1h 43m Rec Negative Well, it took almost 2 hours before I got hopelessly lost and feel like I have no way to progress. That's better than Metroid at least. Game's got a great atmosphere. It looks good and sounds good. Also controls well. I do like the selection of weapons, though I do find I only really use the base gun for range or the short-range electric one for damage. Not a fan of having to drill every block to check if that's the arbitrary one that breaks and is hiding an upgrade or a path. Nor am I a fan of the glitch ray whatever its called. They just make exploring tedious. Which is largely why I'm dropping the game now. I could look at a guide to find where to go now, I don't mind. I just don't really feel like I care enough about this game to bother.
Date 2024-09-29 Playtime 18h 10m Rec Positive VideoGame na sua forma mais pura e doce, gostei de cada segundo, muito boa a exploração, combate, e armas muito criativas, um metroidvania dos bons.

Date 2024-09-25 Playtime 14h 21m Rec Positive It's literally just Super Metroid. No hand-holding, easy to get lost, tons of secrets, play patterns dramatically change as you unlock more abilities. Very kindly puts save points immediately outside each boss. No ammo systems to worry about. Overall good game.

Date 2024-09-19 Playtime 9h 51m Rec Positive nice metroid vania. Kommt jetzt nicht unbedingt an super metroid oder Metroid Fusion dran, aber is trotzdem ne gute Alternative gewesen. Der Modus Randomizer ist auch ne gute Idee.

Date 2024-09-17 Playtime 9h 13m Rec Negative A ripoff of a little game called metroid. if it were up to me this game wouldnt exist, id throw it in the grand canyon and everyone would forget about it.
Date 2024-09-17 Playtime 14h 47m Rec Negative Просто не моё, хз что написать про эту игру. Это просто метроидвания, довольно неплохая по меркам метроидваний; но в ней нет ничего особо выделяющего эту игру из других, чего-то из-за чего я бы сказал что "надо поиграть каждому". (впрочем, я в ней провёл 14 часов, так что, видимо, чем-то цепляет... хм).
Date 2024-09-17 Playtime 61h 4m Rec Positive very fun
Date 2024-09-16 Playtime 2h 54m Rec Negative Fazla beğenildi diye denedim. Açıkcası bunu bir insan neden beğenir emin değilim. Bosslar zor değil, zevkli de değil. Keşif sıkıcı. Bir gimmicki var anca o zevkli. Tek bir gimmick oyun yapmıyor ama. Hani bazı diğer ünlü metroidvanialar da sıkıcı olsa dahi en azından beğenebileceğim noktaları var, bunun yok.
Date 2024-09-15 Playtime 21h 37m Rec Positive great metroidvania I would encourage anyone to play
Date 2024-09-15 Playtime 25h 27m Rec Positive For a game developed solely by one guy, this was an awesome Metroidvania experience. definitely recommend.
Date 2024-09-14 Playtime 14h 37m Rec Negative I liked playing, but didn't think it was a great as reviews lead me to believe.
Date 2024-09-13 Playtime 33h 21m Rec Positive A solid game clearly inspired by the Metroid series. It builds its own identity through a hard sci-fi story, which doesn't pull any punches making you feel out of place in a strange alien world. As you can expect, it features a huge map with different biomes that will involve plenty of walking back and forth, all in order to search for items and make use of new abilites to get to places that were previously unreachable. Plenty of different weapons to use too, although this is a double sword as many will range from overall great to situational at best.  Clearing the game isn't very difficult overall but completing 100% can be a challenge. It will involve deep searching through areas and in many cases block hunting (there might even be a point or two I'd argue was too much). Map markers are also fairly limited. Like in the Metroid series, there's replayability built around completion time and stuff like a randomizer mode in case you enjoy those. There are also some secret bonus areas that will change locations and layouts each playthrough, which helps to make new runs feel a bit different from each other.

Date 2024-09-11 Playtime 17h 8m Rec Positive 👍
Date 2024-09-10 Playtime 38h 36m Rec Positive 完美致敬老任的太空战士，很好玩，推荐！
Date 2024-09-10 Playtime 15h 12m Rec Positive Very good. If you're looking for something that closely mimics the spirit of the original Metroid, this is it. Even more impressive is the fact that all the main content (graphics, levels, music etc) was made by a single person as opposed to a whole team for the original.  It's not perfect. The story is rather vague and the navigation puzzles are not quite as interesting as they were in Metroid and other metroidvanias. Some, but not all issues are addressed in the sequel.
Date 2024-09-10 Playtime 7h 2m Rec Positive Muito brabo, música massa, gameplay muito fluido, as vezes muito confuso infelizmente, mas em geral muito bom.
Date 2024-09-09 Playtime 11h 14m Rec Positive Very cool game! Lots of interesting weapons and upgrades to find and use. The atmosphere, visuals, level design, soundtrack, etc. are all great and immersive. Difficulty felt just right for most of the game on Normal difficulty but it does get hard toward the end so I recommend going back from time to time and grabbing some upgrades to help you.
Date 2024-09-09 Playtime 47h 22m Rec Positive Great game overall. Maybe I'd make the ending a little less like a button smashing fest and have more place for the metroidvania.
Date 2024-09-08 Playtime 10h 52m Rec Positive I did manage to finish this game up on Hard mode and found 100% of the weapons.  I'm sure this game was revolutionary back in the day with the hacking aspect in the game but otherwise the game was pretty simple and easy. Just finding the items was a really complex and after 3 hours of just wandering around I never found 100% of the health and damage powerups.. I have no idea how in the hecc you can find those things. I ran against and drilled every wall, threw my drone in every little nook and cranny and opened up all the map I could. And I never found em. I don't think it was worth it in the end ..just annoying.  I can still recommend this game fully. Great music, great characters, interesting plot and good metroidvania action. If you want to 100% this game just make sure to reserve 20 hours just bang your head against the wall.

Date 2024-09-07 Playtime 12h 42m Rec Positive very fun! highly recommended. 
Date 2024-09-05 Playtime 15h 9m Rec Positive A great Metroidvania. Easy to learn and pick up with an interesting story. Kept me playing for probably longer than it should have taken me. Sometimes I was confused and had to backtrack, but that's common and what I like about this genre. Well done game and the music will stick with you.
Date 2024-09-05 Playtime 15h 48m Rec Positive Спасибо автор за эту игру, она мне очень понравилась! Отличная метроидвания, с неплохим сюжетом.

Date 2024-09-03 Playtime 12h 33m Rec Positive This is a good Metroidvania. Quite fun and a bit of story (but not much).
Date 2024-09-03 Playtime 4h 22m Rec Positive I see multiple negative reviews mentioning issues with being able to hit enemies. I feel it's likely they didn't pay attention to the controls. Like Super Metroid you can aim in multiple directions. This game makes it easy to do so. I just wanted to get that out of the way.  I haven't completed the game yet, but I haven't had so much fun in a long time that I felt the need to write a review ASAP.   The game is incredibly sharp and smooth looking with both the movement and animations, also movement is very reactive. I haven't felt like I'm fighting against the controls. If I screw up, it was my fault.  Combat is fun and bosses I fought so far are great. The music and sound effects are fantastic.  The visual theme is actually very interesting.  I will add more after I complete the game.
Date 2024-09-02 Playtime 14h 15m Rec Positive я почти 4 года назад прошел, вроде норм было
Date 2024-09-02 Playtime 25h 27m Rec Positive Metroidvania sviluppato da una sola persona che segue lo stile minimalista/NES del primo Metroid, in cui siamo uno scienziato che fa… [i]qualcosa[/i], il laboratorio ovviamente esplode e poi si ritrova su un pianeta alieno. Trova un’arma, inizia a farsi strada, e incontra strani enormi costrutti biomeccanici femminili che gli spiegano un po’ dove andare. La trama non è chiarissima, ma nemmeno è molto importante.  Come da tradizione, proseguendo si otterranno diversi strumenti e armi utili per raggiungere zone prima inaccessibili, facendo un bel po’ di backtracking ogni singola volta – almeno per la prima metà del gioco.   Il gameplay e il combat sono abbastanza basilari e in linea coi vecchi classici, si può sparare in 8 direzioni e anche restare fermi mentre si spara per maggiore precisione. Ci sono tante armi con diversa forza e portata, e quando dico tante intendo TANTE, ci sono molte più armi di quanto sarebbe assolutamente necessario in un gioco del genere. Più varietà forse, ma ¾ non le userete mai comunque.   I boss non sono troppo difficili e sono ben disegnati, mentre quello che non è così ben disegnato è il mondo stesso: Axiom Verge gioca molto sul concetto di “glitchare” le cose (nemici, piattaforme ecc.) per avere effetti strani, il problema è che la stessa grafica di gioco è piena di “glitch”, piattaforme bizzarre, elementi buttati a caso in primo piano e sullo sfondo e non è sempre facile capire su “cosa” si può camminare e su cosa no, oppure se serve prima “glitchare” qualcosa per far comparire magari qualcosa di invisibile.  Anche i controlli di alcuni strumenti sono abbastanza imprecisi (tipo il rampino o il teletrasporto) e cercare di usarli correttamente senza cascare di sotto può essere più frustrante di quanto dovrebbe. Ovviamente c’è anche la solita mezza infinità di potenziamenti di vita/danni, anche se trovarli tutti è quasi impossibile. Più che al primo Metroid, per questo si ispira a roba come Simon’s Quest: intere stanze con potenziamenti sono nascoste dietro a muri uguali a tutti gli altri o in passaggi impensabili, per non parlare del sistema di password che “sbloccano” alcune aree apparentemente irraggiungibili. Come si trovano le password giuste? In giro. Facendo [i]cose strane[/i] a cui nessuno arriverebbe mai. Non pensiate di finirlo al 100% senza una guida.  Non è comunque un gioco molto lungo, in una decina di ore si finisce anche perdendosi spesso e volentieri per le varie aree cercando di capire dove andare coi poteri appena acquisiti. Per chi vuole c’è una modalità Hard con il true ending, e una Speedrun che taglia tutti i dialoghi e i tutorial.  Un metroidvania tutto sommato sufficiente che come molti altri cerca di riprendere stili e meccaniche di titoli NES, riuscendoci in parte, senza particolari guizzi e con qualche inciampo. Comunque un lavoro notevole se si pensa che è stato sviluppato da un tizio solo, merita una run solo per questo.   
Date 2024-09-02 Playtime 16h 10m Rec Positive Pulido metroidvania con ideas muy originales y gran banda sonora.
Date 2024-09-01 Playtime 13h 21m Rec Negative The atmostphere is nice, but combat is terrible (lots of fast enemies that positions themselves in positions that are harder to aim at) and exploration is poor (gets boring after a while because of no teleporting and long distances to go, and there are no mechanics to help you know where are the items that you missed).
Date 2024-09-01 Playtime 43h 31m Rec Positive Le doy recomendado por darle ya que la mayoría de jefes son un insulto a la inteligencia que esquivas solo saltando o directamente quedándote en un sitio donde sus ataques no pegan siendo los otros dos jefes injustos como ellos solos y la historia es lo más básico que te puedas imaginar sumado a que me perdí más que un hijo de fruta en el día del padre. Los puntos que más me gustaron fueron la originalidad de las habilidades, todo el apartado visual y sonoro y mi amigo William el dron.
Date 2024-09-01 Playtime 17h 55m Rec Positive I do recommend this game a lot if you like metroidvanias. This one will feel right at home. The controls and movement are precise.  The downside is that this game takes too much inspiration from the first metroid game that I feel like im playing as discount male Samus inside planet Zebes, I mean Sudra. It does have the identity of its own, though.
Date 2024-08-30 Playtime 46h 56m Rec Positive DEMON. ATHETOS SAY, KILL.  100/100, wish there could be an alternate end where [spoiler]Athetos actually tells Trace something. Though Elsenova would just probably kill Trace. Then again, Athetos is a scientist that has been working nonstop with technology from Sudra and had an epiphany about the world, shouldn't be impossible for him to save Trace if he really tried to, together with Ophelia.[/spoiler]
Date 2024-08-29 Playtime 17h 42m Rec Positive Estupendo metroidvania con ambientación de 'mundos alternativos' alienígenas. Se podría decir que es un isekai, pero no en el medievo. Yo de este juego me quedo con que es fantástico para disfrutar de la experiencia de exploración y descubrimiento de nuevas zonas mediante nuevos objetos. Muy muy disfrutable. Con un pixel art bastante bonito y un apartado sonoro muy retro. El único punto negativo que le pongo es que los jefes son muy fáciles si encuentras el punto exacto donde colocarte. He muerto más veces explorando el escenario que en los jefes. Habré tenido unas 40 muertes en total y con un juego de este tipo son muy pocas muertes en mi caso. (no, no soy demasiado bueno que digamos xD)  Le voy a poner una nota de 7 sobre 10. Un juego muy recomendado para tener un metroidvania ligerito pero disfrutable.
Date 2024-08-28 Playtime 5h 35m Rec Negative This honestly sucks to write because i usually really love metroidvanias, but this one just didn't cut it for me. It feels dated and boring compared to other metroidvanias. It's cool but it just wasn't for me.
Date 2024-08-25 Playtime 18h 48m Rec Positive Axion Verge es un metroidvania con una visual pixel art.  Axion Verge tiene referencias de Metroid. Su mayor virtud se basa en que es un juego extenso, con mucha exploración y gran variedad de items y armas. Lo malo puede ser que es un poco frustrante y que sí o sí te verás estancado en algún momento del juego, la gran variedad de armas que es una virtud, también es un defecto, ya que no las usarás todas y te quedarás con algunas como favoritas. Los jefes no son difíciles y tampoco son memorables.  Recomiendo Axion Verge si quieres probar un metroidvania como las de la vieja escuela pero con toques modernos. Te pasarás un buen rato disfrutando y explorando los distintos lugares del mapa. 
Date 2024-08-25 Playtime 11h 54m Rec Positive If you are a fan of Metroid, then that's the game you are searching. Metroid: Zero Mission was the first game i ever played and Axiom Verge it's the closest thing to that game other then Metroid's sequels, you should really try this one
Date 2024-08-25 Playtime 10h 57m Rec Positive A good game with a few too many nitpicks in a genre full of amazing games. I would only recommend it to the biggest metroidvania fans who have yet to try it.  Axiom Verge is a hard one to review. It isn't a bad game, but it has enough annoying nitpicks for me to struggle to recommend it over the hundreds of incredible metroidvanias out there today.  Pros: - Exploration is fun, especially once you have all your abilities - The story is interesting, if a bit hard to piece together - Abilities really are unique and unlike anything else in the genre  Cons: - Enemies have way too much HP. I played on hard mode, so that may be a factor here. None of these enemies have particularly complicated attacks or movement patterns, they just take way too many hits to kill, making exploration agonizingly slow at points. - No fast travel. Easily added an extra ~2 hours to my playthrough. - Most of the weapons felt useless. I found over 10 weapons in my playthrough and only found three of them that really felt worth using. - Some collectibles are in absurdly cryptic locations or locked behind the awful password system. - No items or hints to help you find missing collectibles. You get a little dot on your area map if you found everything in the area, but no nudges in the right direction to find those missing things. - Bosses are really boring. I only found one boss to be particularly challenging. The rest were too simple and uninteresting, even compared to the old games that inspired this one. - Unavoidable damage is everywhere. Quite a few rooms have an enemy literally sitting at the entrance to the room. You enter the screen and immediately take damage. Some other enemies rush straight for you and stick to you before you can put out enough damage to kill them.  Axiom Verge isn't a bad game by any means. Despite the large list of issues I had with it, I still think the game is well-made for the most part, especially for being made by only one guy! I just can't strongly recommend it over the literal hundreds of metroidvanias that have been released in the last few years.
Date 2024-08-24 Playtime 11h 29m Rec Positive Overall it's fairly good, it's definintely got that old school feel to it, in graphics, design, and gameplay.  Overall exploration is nice, combat is ok... story is interesting if not a lot present. Ok experience, not amazing, but worth the time I'd say once past the best of the modern metroidvanias like hollow knight or Momodora RUtM, Ender Lilies, Or Afterimage.  Main issues are probably, that like many older classic games i'ts got some issues with controls, and clarity at times. Also can be slow to explore with no fast travel end game. Combat is often very simple and just repetitive or slow, and the dodge/dash you finally unlock is the most unreliable thing ever to use in combat... Still, while there were more than a few moments that got frusterating or annoying, overall it was a pretty nice experience, and brought back some of that classic metroid feeling, if not quite as good, it could still have been a very solid game for the time.
Date 2024-08-20 Playtime 9h 47m Rec Positive I understand how this sparked a bunch of indie metroidvanias.  Captures the super metroid's vibe very well, even if the dialogue is a bit iffy.
Date 2024-08-19 Playtime 18h 12m Rec Positive If you look at all the reviews most of them use the same word: "solid"; and that's the best way to describe Axiom Verge. It is a decidedly *solid* Metroidvania. It plays very much like classic Metriod, but with enough additions to move the genre forward. It is well-balanced, instills a desire for exploration, uses well-drawn-yet-still-retro art, and has a decent plot.  I have to mention a couple gripes while I'm here, though: The weapons become absolutely worthless after a certain point (I legitimately fired 8 of them only once), it becomes very easy to beat later bosses without thinking, there was just barely too much backtracking required, and I still have no idea how you would figure out some of the solutions for reaching a couple items on your own without a walkthrough.  Essential playing for Metroidvania fans.
Date 2024-08-19 Playtime 56h 52m Rec Positive Es ist nicht irgendein Metroidvania. Es ist AXIOM VERGE! Glaub mehr muss man dazu nicht sagen.
Date 2024-08-19 Playtime 17h 33m Rec Positive im quite a way into the game and havent put together enough scraps to really understand the story yet but as a metroidvania game its doing great, all the powers and abilities are interesting and nothing feels "unfair"
Date 2024-08-18 Playtime 12h 26m Rec Positive The first 3/4 of the game are challenging, but fun. Then the difficulty suddenly turns up to an insane amount. Maybe it's just me, but I found the final parts too difficult and frustrating. Lots of backtracking to remote locations and basically no hints on where to go next. The last few boss-fights highly incentivize cheese strats, which wasn't the case (for me at least) during the earlier boss encounters. Still very much loved it. Art, music, story, gameplay - all incredible! 
Date 2024-08-18 Playtime 21h 50m Rec Positive Gud gueimi! Fiquei perdidaço em alguns momentos, mas, metroidvania né...

Date 2024-08-17 Playtime 23h 58m Rec Positive I've never played Metroid. If this is what it's like, I should.
Date 2024-08-15 Playtime 16h 26m Rec Positive it's good! although you can't get far without googling "stuck in axiom verge" and seeing exactly where everyone else gets stuck.
Date 2024-08-15 Playtime 44h 46m Rec Positive レトロ感ある2Dアクションゲーム 研究室が爆発したと思ったら謎の惑星に移動していて、何が起こったのか探索をする物語。 未来の出来事なのか遠い宇宙での出来事なのかよくわからなかったです。  ゲーム難易度としてノーマルとハードがあるがそこまで違いはないように感じました。というより持っている武器やアップグレードアイテムをどれだけ持っているかのほうが難易度に影響していきます。つまり、より時間を掛けたほうが強くなれるというわけです。 探索して敵を倒しつつアイテムを集めボスを倒していくというのがこのゲームの大まかな流れです。 ストーリ上必要な武器は3つのみですが全部で20種類以上ありそれぞれ性能が異なっていて敵に合わせて武器を切り替えていくのが楽しいです。体力や攻撃力を上げるアイテムも各地に散らばっていて探す楽しみがありました。 マップは広大で一本道というわけではなく蟻の巣みたいに入り混じっている。地図があるから今どこにいるかということは把握できるが、次の目的地はどこなのかという情報がないのが難点。せめて攻略上必要なアイテムぐらいは地図に示してほしかったです。ワープもないから遠い場所に行きたいときは地道に歩くしかないです。（一応マップ中央に移動リフトがあるのが救い）アイテムの場所も示していないので困ったらsteamガイドのマップから参照しましょう。wikiのマップはなぜか一部が消されているのであてにしない方がいい。 音楽は癖になる曲が多く特にボス戦BGMは中毒性があります。気にいったら音楽配信サイトにあるのでリピートするとよいです。 敵はどれも攻撃に癖があるし、ボス戦も一部の武器で特定の部位にしか攻撃が効かないのでどう攻略するか思考が試されます。 もし攻略できなかったらsteamガイドにある攻略を見るか、動画サイトから探すか、ブログの攻略記事を見るのがいいです。しかし、動画の最短攻略しているものは今のゲームとバージョンが違っており動画で行っているような作者の意図していないバグ技が現在使えなくなっているのが結構あるので注意が必要です。 [spoiler]スピードランで弱い武器しか無いときはとりあえず火焔放射器さえあれば大体何とかなる[/spoiler]  個人で作ったとは思えないほどのクオリティのあるゲーム性、音楽、イラストなので是非とも遊んでみてほしいです。
Date 2024-08-15 Playtime 28h 51m Rec Positive Amazing game overall. A solid metroidvania experience with really good platforming and combat, imaginative bossfights. The story, and the information you aquire about the games world is really interesting, altough you need to spend extra time on putting the puzzle pieces together for you to understand it.  I had a lot of fun backtracking and finding secrets, the abilities are some of the most unique ones I've seen in metroidvanias so far. The weapon variety is pretty large and most of them feel good to use.  Overall just an amazing experience, would highly recommend.
Date 2024-08-14 Playtime 10h 52m Rec Positive Es un buen juego que bebe mucho de la saga Metroid, siendo un homenaje total con sus escenarios, música, enemigos, variedad de armas e items. La jugabilidad está bien, pero las habilidades especiales como el gancho y el dash son incómodos con un mando, y cuando debes combinar ambos para llegar a zonas más altas se vuelve realmente frustrante; el knockback también es tedioso. El mapeado es interesante, pero a veces no termina de ser natural y acabas perdido buscando cuál es el camino correcto solo porque el juego no es suficientemente claro en lo que quiere que hagas. Los jefes están bien, excepto por la avispa que termina siendo un dolor de cabeza terrible, muy mal diseñado.  En general lo recomiendo pero solo si de verdad les gusta el estilo Metroid, porque de Castlevania no tiene prácticamente nada.
Date 2024-08-13 Playtime 6h 56m Rec Positive I aimlessly backtracked for 90 minutes because I missed a wall I was supposed to walk through.
Date 2024-08-13 Playtime 18h 38m Rec Positive Hell yea!
Date 2024-08-12 Playtime 17h 14m Rec Positive Really cool Metroidvania that will definitely scratch that itch. Interesting upgrades, really cool lore in particular.  Solid gameplay overall, though some of the guns feel useless by the time you find them, and the game could use more tools to help reach 100%. At least visual hints on the map when a visited area still has something to discover, or some ingame mechanic to nudge you in the right direction. Or some more ways to speed up traversal when you comb through the entire game.  I wouldn't go for 100% personally, but I certainly tried. I had fun. Worth full price.
Date 2024-08-12 Playtime 16h 18m Rec Positive 原汁原味密特罗德
Date 2024-08-11 Playtime 8h 18m Rec Positive very cool, very stylish. in the vein of the older metroid/super metroids and what have you more than any variants, but with a pretty interesting little arsenal of weapons and traversal tools. mostly i recall enjoying it for the atmosphere, music, world building, moreso than the actual gameplay. easily recommended to fans of the genre or appreciators of the aesthetic/unique pixel artwork.
Date 2024-08-10 Playtime 9h 30m Rec Positive ...
Date 2024-08-10 Playtime 11h 18m Rec Positive Very good metroidvania, each new power is surprising and unlocks a new feel to the game, as well as plenty of new opportunities and back tracking.   Clearly inspired by Metroid, with lots of hidden secrets,  I completed in 10 Hours IGT, but didn't 100% the game.  Worth a buy for fans of the genre,
Date 2024-08-10 Playtime 20h 32m Rec Positive One of the best non-metroid metroidvanias I've ever played. If you like classic metroid and want to support an incredible solo dev then do yourself a favour and get Axiom Verge.
Date 2024-08-10 Playtime 28h 25m Rec Positive Эта игра является чем-то великолепным и особенным для меня, не особо любителя игр с космической тематикой.  Наш главный герой так прост и близок к обычному человеку в схожей ситуации, что мне очень легко сопоставить себя с ним.  Сюжет действительно интересный, он дает пищу для размышлений, но не ломает мозг от кучи вопросов и несостыковок.  А эта музыка, Господи, эта шикарная музыка, я не могу... Ее даже в свободное, от геймплея, время слушать приятно, а уж в самой игре и подавно.   Axiom Verge, по моему мнению, один из лучших представителей Метроидвании.  Она не давит тебя, не ломает, а дает насладиться игрой. Даёт изучить ее, не душит проверкой на скилл, позволяет комбинировать все что ты найдешь, чтобы найти множество странностей и секретов внутри.  Уже сейчас, спустя много времени после прохождения я стала задавать себе множество вопросов: каков был народ Судры? Как выглядели русалки до появления вируса? Кому из них принадлежат другие роботизированные части тела русалок? Что двигало Атетосом, как он мог так измениться? Да и что, в конце концов, произошло на самом деле?!  Я уже успела заспойлерить себе вторую часть и уже чертовски разочарована нею. Мне не нужна вся эта мишура, дайте нам больше о мире, что вы создали здесь!
Date 2024-08-09 Playtime 1h 28m Rec Negative Ran into a boss that shoots pairs of bullets high and then fires a bubble-destroying cannon low. It was a looooong, incredibly boring fight. I checked, and apparently most bosses have this problem. That's pretty much it for me; no thank you.
Date 2024-08-08 Playtime 10h 21m Rec Positive I liked the game but didn't love it. This is a good Metroidvania and I had fun playing, so if you like the genre (specially the metroid part of it) you should probably give it a try.   I enjoyed the story, that was the unexpected highlight of the game for me.  The OST is also good.  Now, here are some minor negatives:  - I got lost a little too much, and movement is kinda slow. If you can't find where to go or you are simply backtracking, exploring can become slightly annoying. - Another important thing is boss battles(On easy/normal mode at least. I don't know if difficulty changes behaviour). I feel like bosses would benefit from being more complex.  
Date 2024-08-05 Playtime 0h 58m Rec Negative I've tried to get into this game several times, but it's just boring. Hasn't held my interest at all. I don't mind the pixel graphics, but 8 bit music and sound effects is a big turn off and the enemies are kind of dumb and generic.
Date 2024-08-05 Playtime 14h 20m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvanias out there. Solid mechanics, great atmosphere and soundtrack, and an intriguing story.
Date 2024-08-05 Playtime 15h 42m Rec Positive The music and the style of the game wakes up in me feelings of nostalgia and missing something, like if this would be connected to my previous life. I really like it.
Date 2024-08-05 Playtime 6h 14m Rec Negative Esperava um metroidvânia do mesmo nível que os outros que fizeram história nesse gênero, mas o que eu recebi foi um jogo totalmente sem alma e chato, uma grande decepção pra um jogo tão fortemente inspirado em Metroid.
Date 2024-08-04 Playtime 12h 1m Rec Positive Great metroidvania, with cool machanigs and somewhat interesting story. It have a cool setting, and really engaging powerups - I love the drone and all its functions. Didn't had much difficult to finish the game and never got stuck for much time. Found the navigation to be pleasant, the game isn't enormous and you can traverse the environment from places to places with ease, even though the game doesn't have a fast travel option. Oh and I LOVE the 'dimensionator' tool (hehe, no idea what's the right name of it). I confess that some environmental puzzles I figured out a little by accident (instinct?), and I like that "oh snap" sensation when these things happened. I didn't like the ending - or didn't learned enough to understand it properly, but the gameplay is great from start to finish. Oh, and I like the boss battles as well, none of them were really challenging except for one that I scrached my head a bit to figure it out. Solid 8/10, and I recommend it.
Date 2024-08-04 Playtime 24h 25m Rec Positive Muy Bueno.
Date 2024-08-03 Playtime 5h 2m Rec Negative (Take this with the caveat that I have not beaten the game yet, but I have simply found playing it to be incredibly frustrating for the reasons I list in this review)  I really want to like this game. I am a huge fan of the classic metroid games, and a huge fan of modern metroidvania titles. So much so that I don't even remember the last singleplayer game I played that wasn't a metroidvania - I hoped this would be another timeless classic to add to the list of amazing MV games. With that context in mind, I unfortunately have to rank this as probably the worst metroidvania I have played.  Enemies are placed in downright annoying places, knocking you down from otherwise simple platforming challenges, exhibiting AI that makes them incredible frustrating at times to deal with without taking contact damage or without failing to dodge their projectile attacks, dropping off of the ceiling, being untargetable by weapons then eating you for half your health.  Boss fights are excessively simple. Some of them can be bested by effectively standing in the same place and shooting until they die. I have yet to feel like a boss fight has actually challenged me or made me excited by how they are designed.  Movement controls are responsive and feel good initially, however upon unlocking grapple and dash - items crucial to progress in the game - this movement becomes awful to control. It is possible to dash in mid air, however for reasons unknown the control for this is to doublepress a directional input. This feels absolutely terrible to use, and makes platforming which should be easy feel incredibly hard just because of the difficulty of consistently executing an air dash while maintaining momentum. SImilarly, the grapple hook is unnecessarily confusing to use. You can hook onto ceilings, but at some point will fall off. I can't tell if this is an input I'm pressing to make me drop or what, but I cannot seem to hang onto ceilings consistently while trying to swing. These two abilities also exhibit hilarious anti-synergy, whereby you can accidentally input an air dash while swinging, leading to you dropping the grapple and falling.  The weapons seem interesting, and I like the idea of having a large arsenal of weapons to deal with enemies in different ways, however I seemed to collect a multitude of weapons which all effectively did the same things as each other, which leads to me generally sticking with the same few guns that exhibit highest damage, range, or fire rate.   The art is in places very pretty, however in other places very much not pretty. This is opinion so I won't rip into it too much, but for me, the art style was not doing it for me.  The story feels like it could be very interesting to see unfold, however the protagonist is wholly uninteresting to me and acts as a stereotypical 'hero' in all of their dialogue.  Absolutely check out other reviews to mine before you make a judgement on this game, as I have generally just not got on with the game. I fully respect that this was made by a solo developer and I admire the dedication it must have taken to piece together a full game by themselves. With that said, if you are a fan of highly polished modern metroidvanias with smooth platforming and intense combat, this might not be the game for you. For me, this game feels difficult in unfair ways as opposed to challenging ways, and easy in every other way.
Date 2024-08-03 Playtime 17h 41m Rec Positive Loved it. The art is superb.

Игра имеет просто уйму плюсов, но и минусы тоже есть, о них и скажу . (ВНИМАНИЕ! ДАЛЬШЕ МОГУТ БЫТЬ СПОЙЛЕРЫ!) [h1] плюсы : [/h1] 1)аудио Очень крутые саундтреки, переходишь в новую локацию и кайфуешь. 2)количество контента  Несмотря на то, что игру можно пройти часов за 10, ощущается это все как 20 часов, хотя что бы закрыть все ачивки на 100% понадобится ≈30 часов, тут так же дофига  пушек(24) и чуть чуть меньше способностей( около 10) 3)Огромный мир Да,он и вправду велик , около 10 локаций, и все они отличаются, саундтреком, лвл дизайном,мобами и многим другим, крч во 👍 4)простой сюжет На самом деле сюжет в Axiom Verge это что то второстепенное, тебе что то говорят ты забываешь минут через 5 и идёшь туда, где ещё не был, а потом случайно приходишь туда, куда и надо было по сюжету. 5)секреты и отсылки  В игре есть секретные проходы и не только, но в основном все секреты находятся через чит коды, через них можно найти большинство отсылок, например через один секретный код (который я подсмотрел на вики) наш гг получит знаменитый костюм из матрицы,солнечные очки и черный плащ.и это ещё не всё, но не буду спойлерить дальше, что бы не портить интригу. 6)геймплей Из за огромной карты, количества пушек, и множеством способностей, геймплей становится уж очень насыщенным, что несомненно является большим плюсом. 7)❤️ДРОНЫ ПАУЧКИ❤️  Топ 1 механика в игре, играть за дрона веселее чем за Трейса. 8)Разнообразные мобы  Каждый враг в игре уникален по своему, кто то таранит на лету, кто то стреляет лазером, а кто то и то и другое, дизайн у всех разный, а благодаря одной способности мы можем полностью изменить механику врагов, от обычного ослабления характеристик до того, что ранее кидавший в тебя огромные снаряды монстр , будет любезно делиться здоровьем, и это далеко не все . [h1] минусы : [/h1] 1)визуал Не скажу что он плохой или типо того я просто от него очень быстро устают глаза, а в целом притензий нет. 2)дизбалансные боссы  Какие же здесь боссы мусор, они тупо скучные, дай бог имеют хотя бы три разных атаки (один босс имел 4 атаки, и это даже не финальный босс) они не запоминающееся,пройдя игру, я уже не помню половину боссов (а их около 7)к тому же они дизбалансны, либо они очень слабые, и ты можешь сесть на одну точку и закликать их , при этом не получая урона сам , либо же слабое место там, что в него ещё надо постараться попасть, а урон при этом будет хавать треть твоего здоровья за тычку.Финальный босс тоже разочаровал, идея очень крутая, а на деле у босса всего 1 разновидность атак на каждой фазе💀ну и в целом все. 3)простой сюжет Сюжет на самом деле довольно простой, и поэтому очень скучный, а его подача такая... Сырая? Что ты просто его не запоминаешь, да и сам сюжет можно поместить буквально в два предложения (был Трейс позже его прозвали "атетос" (главный антагонист игры) он был учёным , после неудачного эксперимента он ослеп и не мог передвигаться, но пока он был слепым он что то придумал и он с другом(который ему помогал) отправились в другой мир( где мы собственно и будет находиться) там была цивилизация с технологиями которые в разы превосходят наши, но та целевизация деградировала и в целом вот."атетос " находит яйца(чикпоинты в игре )и после его использования он восстановился(оставив свое ДНК из которого можно делать клонов)и понял что надо уничтожить эту цивилизацию ради собственной , что он собственно и сделал .так же есть русалки , они восстановили Трейса ( клон атетоса ) и попросили помочь им убить его, что бы атетос не смог их убить окончательно. Ну а дальше все будет в самой игре.как то так в общем. 4)отсутствие шорткатов  Т.к. карта в игре просто огромная,и передвигаться по ней довольно скучно, пол часа идёшь в один уголок, потом в другой и так несколько раз, есть что то вроде лифта улитки, но не сказал бы что она полностью решает проблему. 5)хреновая карта Я говорю не про игровой мир, а про карту мира, она тупо непонятная, просто фиолетовый квадратик без намека на что там. Так же были моменты когда показывают что где то есть проход, но там стена, а потом ты ломаешь голову мол "чё за бред, тут же должен быть проход" 6)Отсутствие хилок Как таковой, хилки тут нет, ее можно выбить из мобов с определенным шансом, и восстановить часть здоровья, ну или найти чикпоинт и восстановить фул хп. [h1] отсебятина ; [/h1]  Игра определенно стоит того, чтобы пройти ее, и могу сказать что игра очень хороша, несмотря на то, что это не Hollow Knight: Silksong. В целом я рекомендую игру всем фанатам метроидваний.👍
Date 2024-07-31 Playtime 26h 46m Rec Positive Эй, слушайте сюда, вы пиксельные задроты! Если вы не играли в "Axiom Verge", чем вы вообще занимаетесь в своей жизни? Эта игра как будто ваши детские мечты стать богом ретро-игр родили ребенка с научно-фантастическим романом, а потом этот ребенок решил отправиться в дикую кислотную поездку. Во-первых, визуальная часть - это великолепный ретро-стиль 16-бит, но с таким твистом, что ваши глаза могут выпрыгнуть, как будто вы только что выпили галлон газировки. Окружение так красиво проработано, что вы можете забыть дышать, пока исследуете. Серьезно, возьмите минутку, чтобы оценить графику, прежде чем с головой окунуться в хаос. Теперь давайте поговорим об игровом процессе. Эта штука - шедевр в жанре Metroidvania! У вас есть оружие, которое кажется, будто его создал безумный ученый, только что открывший, как совместить лазерную пушку с тостером. Управление четкое, а исследования заставят вас говорить: "Еще одна комната!" пока мама не начнет кричать, чтобы вы шли ужинать. А сюжет? О, это головоломка! Вас бросают в мир, который кажется вырванным со страниц извращенного научно-фантастического комикса. Вы будете собирать повествование как пазл, одновременно ставя под сомнение свое существование. Это глубоко, чувак. Глубоко как "Что такое жизнь?" Так что, если вы ищете игру, которая заставит вас чувствовать себя полным боссом, одновременно ставя под сомнение ваше душевное здоровье, "Axiom Verge" - ваш билет. Возьмите ее, поиграйте и готовьтесь к поездке, которая оставит вас и взбудораженным, и немного запутанным - как и любая хорошая поездка! Это передает суть стиля Filthy Frank, одновременно выделяя ключевые особенности игры.
Date 2024-07-30 Playtime 15h 57m Rec Positive I love this game! It's a classic metroidvania and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of game. Personally I enjoy exploring and going back to places I had been to before to find new secrets. The story is also fun and keeps me drawn in.

Date 2024-07-29 Playtime 12h 52m Rec Positive Muito Bom, Pra quem curte um metroidvania pode comprar sem medo. Ps - Trilha sonora espetacular
Date 2024-07-29 Playtime 37h 5m Rec Positive super 
Date 2024-07-29 Playtime 21h 37m Rec Positive TLDR: Metroidvania true to the original Metroids. Don't play on hard, you might regret it. Positives:  - Large interconnected world that gradually opens up. - No hand holding, it is up to you to explore. - Surprisingly interesting lore. Negatives:  - Design of late-game bosses is bad. There is no strategy to them. Damage is unavoidable, you just tank the damage with your face and pray to out-DPS the boss. If you play on hard and do not collect enough health upgrades and the right weapons, you can effectively softlock yourself on these bosses.
Date 2024-07-29 Playtime 24h 56m Rec Positive Juego de tipo Metroidvania, pero para variar esta más del lado de metroid que del lado del vania, Tiene un estilo gráfico y musical de 8 bits muy bien logrado, con un estilo de "glicheo" muy particular,  historia increíblemente compleja y en algunos casos necesaria para desbloquear mejoras, jugabilidad fluida y mejoras que se ajustan a tu estilo de juego, pero con el elemento de la exploración un poco tedioso, tanto por las gráficas como por el diseño de los mapas. Ah, y en una partida es posible perder los logros, así que te recomiendo jugarlo con guía, o si en verdad quieres todos los achivements definitivamente tendrías que jugarlo 2 o más veces. Por mi parte con una tuve suficiente, pero fue una experiencia más que disfrutable. Algo peculiar y que merece mucho crédito es que el desarrollo de este juego lo llevo a cabo un solo individuo (Thomas Happ), lo cual por su profundidad en la historia, nivel de detalle, dinámicas de juego hacen que en realidad sea una empresa encomiable y muy bien lograda.  La historia se centra en Trace, un científico que tras sufrir un accidente en un laboratorio en Nuevo México se encuentra sin memoria alguna en un universo extraño y escucha una voz que le pide de su ayuda. Conforme se va explorando este mundo extraño, que tiene un poco de futurista/terror espacial, se va desenvolviendo la historia en una serie de notas que necesitas traducir y diálogos que tienes con personajes secundarios, no diré nada de esta, solo mencionar que hay wikis especializadas en desentrañar la historia y la forma en la que se desenvuelve la encontré con buen ritmo, aunque si es algo confusa. Se nota que este juego esta fuertemente inspirado en Metroid; algunos enemigos se le parecen e incluso la estética y la jugabilidad es muy similar, y la verdad es que se logra muy bien, disfrute de las gráficas, pero llega un punto en donde la música cansa (aunque no es mala) y para mi fue un cambio bienvenido pues venia de jugar varios juegos en donde la base de juego es combate cuerpo a cuerpo, y aquí fundamentalmente usas armas de largo alcance. A lo largo del juego vas encontrando armas que le dan variedad a tu estilo de juego, desde las de poco rango y gran daño, tipo escopetas, a las de gran rango y poco daño. Aquí el estilo va variando dependiendo de tu preferencia. Las mejoras te permiten esquivar y atravesar obstáculos, pero la movilidad del personaje es limitada. No hay doble brinco (tienes un gancho en su lugar), la posibilidad de atravesar muros se accede ya hasta el final y mientras tanto tienes que usar un taladro y te mueves a una sola velocidad, lo cual puede ser un poco desesperante a la hora de explorar. Quizá la mecánica mas distintiva del juego es la posibilidad de "glichear" enemigos. Con una mejora en el arma (de las primeras que obtienes) puedes disparar tu arma una serie de ondas que permiten "corromper" enemigos o algunos objetos en el mundo, en efecto glicheandolos. Estos incluso se ven así, y cambia su comportamiento en el juego, algunos aumentan su velocidad, otros la disminuyen, algunos se vuelven vulnerables a ciertas armas, otros destruyen parte inaccesibles para el jugador. Esto me pareció interesante y da una forma de juego en donde tratas de glichear a la mayor cantidad de enemigos posibles para ver su interacción y descubrir zonas secretas.   Quizá el punto mas flaco y cansado del juego es la exploración. El mapa esta muy bien segmentado, te permite marcarlo para ubicar zonas en donde no tienes acceso, no no es extremadamente grande, sin embargo a la hora de juntar los coleccionables se vuelve un festival de la repetición pues no hay fast travel. Si necesitas ir de punta a punta no hay de otra más que recorrer todo el mapa hasta llegar a tu destino. Quizá lo más parecido al fast travel es una zona central libre de enemigos que te permite atravesar casi todo el mundo sin la necesidad de dar tantas vueltas, que lo veo bien desde el punto del diseño del juego, pero hace que la exploración sea tediosa. El segundo detalle es que el personaje se mueve a una sola velocidad, caminas todo el tiempo y la posibilidad de hacer un dash no mejorar la velocidad, además de que encuentras esta mejora casi al final y el tercero. El tercer detalle es que si quieres completar el mapa, hay mucho espacio vació que tienes que hacer malabares para llenar, al menos en 3 zonas en particular, en donde tienes que ir brincando o lanzando un dron solo para poder cubrir la superficie del mapa completo lo cual hace que la exploración al 100% sea una prueba a tus habilidades mecánicas. Pero quizá lo mas frustrarte son los acertijos y las zonas secretas. y es aquí en donde las gráficas, a pesar de estar bien logradas, le juegan en contra al juego. Hay lugares en donde hay paredes falsas, o sitios que puedes glichear pero son prácticamente imperceptibles por que son prácticamente idénticos a las gráficas del fondo, entonces no te queda remedio más que buscar en todas las paredes zonas que puedas taladrar, glichear o atravesar, lo que convierte la exploración en "encuentra una pared y siguela hasta que hayas rodeado todo el contorno del cuarto" lo cual es un poco cansado, sin decir que es posible perder coleccionables, lo que implica que lo tienes que jugar más de una ocasión.  La dificultad es de media a fácil, como en la mayoría de los juegos de este tipo, conforme aqueres mejoras disminuye la dificultad (más si estas familiarizado), los enemigos y los jefes tienen patrones fáciles de memorizar y no hay gran variedad de ellos, mas bien existen ciertos enemigos básicos, y conforme vas avanzando los vuelves a encontrar con una coloración distinta en lo que cambia es que se mueven más rápido y hacen más daño. Yo lo juegue en normal y morí 37 veces, así que el desafió sigue siendo moderado. El juego te puede durar, en una primera vuelta unas 15 horas, lo cual lo hace un juego respetable pero con una duración de moderada a corta, si quieres sacar todos los logros, es decir una exploración del 100% con unas 25 horas tienes (que es lo que yo hice). Aquí no tienes que matar enemigos de formas repetidas para buscar objetos, si no mas bien pegarte a todos los muros para ver si no hay secretos. Los logros para speedruns nunca los hago, pero al parecer 4 horas bastan para terminar el juego en su versión rápida.  Este juego ya tiene tiempo, de hecho recuerdo haberlo visto anunciado para el PSP (o el Vita en todo caso), así que creo que hasta un microondas puede correrlo. Desde ese tiempo siempre me dio curiosidad jugarlo y la verdad es que lo disfrute bastante, si eres fan de metroid, o de juegos de ese estilo, ya sea por la jugabilidad o por la atmósfera, creo que este juego lo vas a disfrutar bastante. Yo diría que tener control es obligatorio. Buena historia, buena jugabilidad, pero la exploración algo tediosa, sin embargo, si merece una oportunidad.

Date 2024-07-27 Playtime 32h 50m Rec Positive Wow.  this is one of the most satisfying metroidvanias i've played in years.  really checks all the boxes.  the game mechanics are varied, fun, and useful.  the maps are fun to explore.  the setup requires tons of backtracking and exploration.  the weapons all feel useful.  the music... oh my god.  one of the best OSTs ever.  this is 15 hours into my first playthrough.  i have been taking my sweet time, but i've also been challenged to uncover everything.  im only 60% map and 45% items complete!  there is an insane amount of content yet to discover.  i have not even beaten the main game yet, much less touched the randomizer or speedrun modes.  i will be playing this again and again for years to come.  absolutely triumphant.  this is in my top 5 favorite ever all time for sure.  i will definitely be buying the sequel.  any naysayers who criticize this game are simply wrong.  wrong, wrong, wrong.  it's quite nearly perfect.

Date 2024-07-27 Playtime 37h 19m Rec Positive One of my top 3 favorite metroidvanias, absolutely worth giving a try! Really interesting story and world to explore. Fun guns, mechanics, and boss fights. 8/10

Date 2024-07-26 Playtime 17h 23m Rec Positive A very good Metroidvania that holds up even nearly a decade later. I love the "glitch" themed abilities, and the interactions with some glitched enemies were especially interesting. Combat and exploration are very solid. My one notable criticism is that direction on where to go next for progression, and where to find secrets, can be especially unclear, with on many occasions the player having to resort to literally trying all their options against every wall, floor and ceiling to find secrets unless they're using a guide. I've played over a hundred Metroidvania games in my life and very few of them have as obscure paths as I experienced here (though your mileage may vary). Though I find this is most prominent during the middle portion of the game, and the game comes together a lot better for me towards the last quarter.

Date 2024-07-25 Playtime 20h 35m Rec Positive excellent metroid vania
Date 2024-07-24 Playtime 17h 8m Rec Positive Very nice metroidvania game. It doesn't seem like it was developed by one person at all, and in 2015. Good weapons variety, nice style. Good graphic and musics. Great controls. Difficulty is not so high like in others metroidvania.  Only bad thing, is that some secrets are a little too secret. Without watching a guide, it's pretty unlikely you'll discover everything. Vote: 8/10
Date 2024-07-23 Playtime 10h 51m Rec Negative This game is, fine. The big thing holding it back is that it sucks so much to backtrack, cause you can only walk. And walking is really boring. Especially when I was going through the final screens trying to find the final items I hated the backtracking, and that really makes a metroidvania bad.
Date 2024-07-23 Playtime 14h 20m Rec Negative Full of ideas but extremely bad at execution

Date 2024-07-21 Playtime 16h 45m Rec Positive Bello
Date 2024-07-21 Playtime 15h 37m Rec Positive This is a great game inspired by metroid series.  But it has a few flaws.  One of them being that the weapon select system was obnoxious. It didn't feel natural and easy to use, and I probably used it the wrong way and it would have worked out better if I had done it correctly. Another weapon issue is that the found weapons are added in order of being found, so you can't quite tell which are late game weapons and which are early game weapons you missed and found later.  Another big flaw was that some areas were not accessible without passwords. I managed to find the passwords for reading notes on my own, but apparently I'm too  dumb to read the notes and figure out the secret passwords. I ended up using a walkthrough and getting the passwords from there. I also wasted quite some time trying to get past the password barriers thinking normal gameplay methods.  It is also not quite explained that purple dot means all map is found and yellow dot is all items are found. But I slowly discovered that while playing. Some parts of the map was also horribly annoying to try and clear due to no helpful skills like space jump from Metroid.  However, the rest was really interesting and fun and kept the feeling of metroid both exploration wise, but also in how the character and weapons moved.
Date 2024-07-21 Playtime 24h 15m Rec Negative I heard good things about this game as part of the metroidvania genre, but unfortunately it is just so annoying and frustrating. First of all, I played on hard difficulty. Exploration in this game is terrible, with so many repetitive areas and enemies, there are lots of dead ends for no reason (after you get a new ability, sometimes you use it to go down a difficulty path just to get nowhere or even worse: get stuck in a new area until you find another ability!), the knockback after you get hit is INFURIATING, some enemies behavior erratically and attack you off-screen (which means sometimes luck will be the factor that will make you progress), lots of unbelievably difficulty spikes, bosses are not fun at all... Controls such as the double-tap jump and grappling hook are horrible... I usually like games that don't hold your hand, but it is not intuitive at all where to go next and what a new ability unlocks. It is a slog to navigate the map to backtrack, as there is no fast travel and only 2 markers. It is so hard to ignore the enemies to find secrets in previously visited areas because of that disgusting knockback when you are hit... It is just not fun to play this game and it feels too long... I'm looking forward to finish it as soon as possible if I don't drop it before and definitely won't go after every item / map piece. I will also skip the sequel. The soundtrack is good and visuals are interesting, but the rest is an extrememely overrated metroidvania. The last area of this game and the awful 3 bosses located there are enough reason to regreat playing this game entirely and wasting my time!!!
Date 2024-07-20 Playtime 17h 3m Rec Positive A love letter to Metroid with inventive mechanics and startling graphics!
Date 2024-07-20 Playtime 22h 29m Rec Positive O game é nota 1000, dos últimos metroidvanias que joguei (Hollow Knight entre eles), esse de longe foi o melhor. Desde que zerei toda a saga dos Metroids de plataforma, eu fiquei meio orfão de um game com a mesma vibe, e o Axiom Verge caiu como uma luva. Recomendado 100%.
Date 2024-07-20 Playtime 0h 25m Rec Negative bok gibi 
Date 2024-07-20 Playtime 11h 18m Rec Negative I think this is the first time I've written a negative review for a game on Steam, and even then it's definitely more of a "mixed" vibe.  I fully completed Axiom Verge on Hard, minus getting every item and full map completion (only managed 78% and 93% respectively).  You might wonder why a negative review with that amount of playtime, but it's simple really.    I just think this game can't really hang anymore in a genre full of such heavy hitters.  I know it was a solo effort and I know both it and the sequel are now quite cheap, which is why I picked it up.  It's sort of worth it then, but even so it's just...kinda' boring?  I spent the whole game wondering when weapons/movement/exploration would start combining into something special to glow up the experience (like how it works in the best Metroidvanias) and they never really did.  The most prominent movement tech is the drone shot teleport...that I know of anyways...and although it helps it's still kind of awkward feeling?  That, and the map design just doesn't feel very conducive to fluid movement, and I'm also not a fan of double-tap being the default teleport binding, although I probably could have changed that with custom Steam bindings.  I also just didn't think the story was very compelling.  It starts off interesting enough but loses its charm towards the end, perhaps saving too much for the sequel.  The ending in particular is extremely underwhelming, regardless of the version you get (I watched the full one on YT and was glad I didn't start wasting the time to try and do it legit 😂).  The biggest positives are the concept of the Address Disruptor altering enemy capabilities (though this really should have been fleshed out more), and the music.  It's also nice that it scales really well to higher frame rates...playing at 90 FPS on the Deck OLED and 120 while docked was neat enough in its own right.  Butter smooth gameplay, even if the traversal gameplay itself didn't feel quite as good.  Axiom Verge is a fairly impressive solo accomplishment, and as many have mentioned is definitely more Metroid than Vania which is kinda' beat.  But it just pales in comparison to modern offerings.  I was excited for it when it first came out and it probably would have been more wowed then, but nowadays I'd recommend HK, Ori, and Bloodstained (to name a few) over this in a heartbeat.

Mais, en vrai, ça tue la bite.
Date 2024-07-17 Playtime 20h 37m Rec Positive [b]不可错过的宝藏类银！[/b]  美术音乐全都由作者一人完成，tmd他就是个天才！风格非常复古，画风有点类似H R Geiger，色调看起来也有点像魂斗罗（毕竟也是像素+异形），比较压抑和猎奇，有些场景则非常震撼。 手感很棒，操作丝滑流畅。 剧情很有意思，不过没中文，开头的蒙太奇手法很巧妙，中途的反转也是完美呼应，全收集后解锁的隐藏剧情更是细思极恐。 流程不长，难度较低，大部分难度可能都在跑图上，很多房间堆怪，boss战反而很简单，而且还有几个是剧情杀。战斗不是重点，虽然游戏里提供几十种不同的子弹（射击方式），但是实用的就几个。 本作的真正重点是探索！ 游戏内没有任何具体指引，所有的剧情对话都是到特定房间触发，推动玩家前进的动力就是地图上还没去的房间。不过整体流程是很线性的，整张大地图可以分为七个区域（游戏内是九个），其中正中间是一个巨长的横向电梯，连接着外围一圈的六个区域，这也是唯一称得上的“快速旅行”。保存点直接无法传送，同样也是为了限制进度，最明显的一个位置就是从左下区域到右下区域时无法直接返回，必须在右边地区获取好几个能力才能过去。 获取新能力的顺序也是固定的，主要能力有高跳、黑客、穿墙、挖墙、钩爪和控制小机器人。高跳和挖墙没什么好说的，就是可挖掘砖块和普通方块外观没区别，得挖一下才知道能不能挖，钩爪只能抓天花板，不是很好用（一眼致敬希魔复活），剩下的几个能力随流程获得升级。 穿墙，一级只能站在平台横向贴墙使用，所有一格竖条都能穿；二级可以八向冲刺，还能在空中穿墙，一次最多穿两格；三级能直接撞碎可挖掘砖块，增加冲刺距离，一次最多穿三格。 小机器人，主要用途是前往一些狭窄的地方，自带挖掘功能，升级后可以直接把玩家传送到小机器人所在位置，让玩家飞跃到正常跳无法到达的地方。 黑客，一个扫描器，其实是早期就能获得的能力，升级后也只是增加可黑的内容。放在最后说的原因是，这个能力被作者玩出花了！正常流程里玩家只是入侵方块（那些好像贴图错误的位置，实际上是精心设计），用来消除拦路方块或者制造平台方块。 而最惊艳的是所有的敌人都能被入侵（除了boss），前期一些敌人被入侵后还真是一些常规变化，比如说变成队友、变成资源、变成平台等；后期越来越神奇，某些敌人被入侵后能够破坏方块、被玩家操控等等（不能再透了，和收集、解密息息相关，最好自己一个个试） 收集也是非常有意思，有加血上限的、加武器射击范围的、加武器伤害的，还有补充剧情（甚至关系到解密）的文本，各种各样的武器（射击方式），藏的位置可以说是脑洞大开，解密方法更是千奇百怪，特别是得到物品时那“噔噔”的音效让人无比满足。 最后，游戏里还有随机房间和随机武器，只不过每个存档只有四个随机房和一个随机武器，随机房间会提供一些额外强化，不计入全收集成就中。
Date 2024-07-17 Playtime 3h 10m Rec Positive I remember playing this game a long time ago on my cousin's console, but I never finished it. I'm playing it now, and it's pretty fun, especially as a Metroidvania genre enjoyer. i'm into the exploration and the satisfying combat in pixel art.

Date 2024-07-16 Playtime 13h 5m Rec Positive A beautiful homage to Metroid from the NES era sadly almost ruined in its final moments by terribly designed late-game enemy types and bosses.  The end game feels like you need 100% of the upgrades unlocked to make the difficulty reasonable but even then the 2 final bosses just do not feel well-designed and are not enjoyable. Overall though it is worth playing and it has a smashing soundtrack.

Clearly takes a lot of inspiration from Super Metroid I was immedietally compelled by this strange world you find yourself in. very cool story that you can ruminate over for a long time, i could'nt stop thinking about it for a while after beating it. Every time my path was blocked by not having an ability i needed to progress i thought i knew what the ability that would let me reach a new area and each time i was wrong, like seeing a small hole and thinking "morph ball" or a dash but it turned out to be something different and much more interesting, this happened over and over. glitch gun is really cool, the different weapons are all cool, puzzles are cool, bosses are cool. This game is just COOL
Date 2024-07-14 Playtime 26h 36m Rec Positive Solid 10/10 You're in the Game for 2 Minutes and you're already loving it,  the music is one of the most amazing things in this Metroidvania. A must play for every Metroid Fan, OMG do i love this one
Date 2024-07-14 Playtime 16h 56m Rec Positive Si os gusta Metroid un juego que aunque no llega a sus cotas, siendo un indie es recomendable

Date 2024-07-12 Playtime 9h 57m Rec Negative Pros: - Good soundtrack i guess  Cons: - The main story line was okay, but the actually interesting stuff never goes anywhere. The whole axiom thing is in one hidden note and never gets brought up again. - Breakable/illusory walls are identical to everything else, so its just trial and error - Backtracking is made very tedious by repetitive areas and lack of fast travel - The grappling hook is somehow the worst movement option - Dash being bound to double tap makes it really annoying to use, and its the one control you can't change - Only two map markers per area - You can only view a small portion of the map at once - A lot of enemies seem actually impossible to dodge. Everything moves and shoots way faster than you, and sometimes they just spawn on top of you.
Date 2024-07-12 Playtime 0h 8m Rec Negative 拿到勾爪后10分钟就红温删游戏了(游戏时间很短是因为用家庭共享玩的，气的我还特地用这个号挂了5分钟来给差评)，这个勾爪的手感真的让人一言难尽，我玩这个游戏之前完全想不到一个银河城游戏能把一个频繁使用位移技能的手感设计得这么狗屎，明明主线流程就有很多长天花板要你勾过去，但勾爪的伸出速度又比人物下落速度慢，就导致你勾爪如果是在比较远的地方勾到的天花板，你还必须往回收一下才能保证你下一次能勾到天花板，而且这个勾爪狗屎的手感有时让你很难判断这个天花板到底是因为勾爪本身长度就不够上不去，还是你位置不对导致跳跃高度够的时候勾爪还没伸出来，而游戏又没有 任 何 提 示 ，我知道迷路是银河城的一部分，但《不能判断自己是迷路，还是操作不对》并 不 是。    另外就是非常《复 古》的地图，除了房间之间有无连通，没有任何别的信息，既不显示当前房间是否有需要能力打开的门，也不显示收集品，信息量甚至比1994年的太爷爷——超级银河战士还少，你干脆直接复古到gb的银河战士2去得了，直接黑白画面多好啊   以及没有传送，在没有任何提示，需要不停试错找路的前提下，游戏走的是银河战士路线而不是恶魔城路线，没有等级没有需要刷怪获得的素材，也就是重复打小怪没有任何意义，而游戏又没有空洞骑士的超级冲刺或者ori的猛击一样可以完全躲开怪物的超级机动技能，就导致不仅要重复找路，还得重复打小怪，而且你第一次要打多久，后面每次路过都得花一样的时间，然后走到底发现不是这条路，恭喜你，没有传送哦！再走一遍回去吧！   最后，我不得不提到游戏逆天的黑客枪，我承认这个一开始玩起来还挺新鲜的，但是游戏对于有些可以用黑客枪黑的物品提示完全是不够的，门被明显的乱码或者美术风格完全和当前场景不符的方块挡住了，这个没啥问题，一根从上往下延伸的藤蔓中间突然缺了一块还会时不时闪一闪，这个也没啥问题，但是在拿勾爪的必经之路上，有块可以被黑了垫脚的岩浆只是稍微比普通的岩浆亮一点？？？我tm第一次路过那地方的时候还以为要拿到一个可以冰冻岩浆（密特罗德：生存恐惧里就是）的能力，或者在水里也能高跳的能力，然后我把所有能走的路全探了一遍，整整7条路啊，没有传送啊，我怎么想都没想到是那块岩浆能被黑，我tmd最后实在没办法了，查攻略了差点没脑溢血，然后拿到勾爪后10分钟因为手感红温删游戏，一气呵成啊   总体来说，公理边缘作为一款和铲子骑士一样的复古游戏，并不像铲子骑士一样除了美术风格和游戏玩法复古，其他的如画面，音乐，玩家友好度，操作手感，后辈玩法传承上全面现代化（对我为什么说铲子骑士是全面现代化的复古游戏感兴趣的，可以参考GMTK的关于铲子骑士的视频，b站：BV15x411h74i），而是仅仅在画面和音乐上现代化（操作手感上部分现代化），别的我在前文提到的部分全部没有现代化，导致玩起来非常难受，建议像我这样只是喜欢玩银河城，但没亲身经历过FC，SFC时代恶心人设计的玩家绕道
Date 2024-07-12 Playtime 19h 40m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a successful game that rises to the challenge of becoming a very good metroidvania, thanks to its well-thought-out and designed level design, which follows the metroidvania rules to the letter with a new and fresh creativity of our time. The multitude of enemies with different patterns and the tools given to the player to fight them (weapons, abilities) are very interesting, diverse, and also impressive considering that a single person developed the game. It is inspiring to see how a passionate individual can create such an excellent game as Axiom Verge. The graphics are splendid, and the soundtrack is really nice.   Thank you for this great experience. I will keep this game as a good reference if I ever work on a metroidvania.

Date 2024-07-12 Playtime 29h 7m Rec Positive Bel mix tra estetica meccano-sintetica e musiche acide ed elettroniche. Power-up mai scontati e perfettamente diegetici, purtroppo un tanto ostici da utilizzare soprattutto in concatenazione. Mappa coerente e non labirintica, qualche volta è necessario andare avanti e indietro ma tant'è connaturato al genere dei metroid-vania. Nel complesso molto divertente, consigliatissimo

Date 2024-07-11 Playtime 9h 8m Rec Positive Great game
Date 2024-07-10 Playtime 10h 42m Rec Positive アイテムを見つける→行ける場所が増える→アイテムを見つける→行ける場所が増える→アイテムを見つけ・・・ それだけのゲーム！ 見た目だけじゃなくファミコン時代の不便さもそのままなのは大きなマイナス点。 セーブポイント間のワープぐらい有ってもバチは当たらないだろう？ 広いマップにマークがたった2つしか付けれないけどそれぐらいは好きに付けさせて欲しい。 一部のボスがどこに攻撃を当てればいいのかわかりにくすぎる。色々と惜しいゲーム。
Date 2024-07-10 Playtime 26h 22m Rec Negative Presente em praticamente todas as listas de melhores metroidvanias, Axiom Verge não faz jus a fama sendo no máximo um jogo mediano, e abaixo seguem minhas críticas:  - Há um problema gravíssimo no combate ocasionado por inimigos que vão pra cima pois não há alternativas defensivas/ofensivas pra lidar contra ataques corpo-a-corpo (a única opção surgirá apenas lá no finalzinho do jogo), portanto a única alternativa viável durante boa parte da campanha caso não seja possível mata-lo (antes do mesmo iniciar os ataques) seria tentar pular, porém na maioria esmagadora das vezes os corredores não são altos o suficientes pra executar o salto. Fugir não é uma opção nessas situações pois o protagonista é muito lento comparado ao movimento dos inimigos; - Outro fator extremamente problemático, também relacionado ao aborrecimento citado acima, é o fato desses inimigos geralmente "grudarem" no protagonista. Esse detalhe agrava consideravelmente o problema pois como mencionado não existe alternativas pra lidar contra inimigos no corpo-a-corpo, e a partir do momento do "grude" a única alternativa é ficar parado recebendo dano e atacando até matar o infeliz; - Na prática, não existe necessidade ou até mesmo função pra grande maioria das armas (são 20 + 3 secretas), portanto elas estão ali apenas pra "encher linguiça". Curiosamente, apenas as 3 primeiras (Disruptor axiomático, Nova e Kilver) são realmente necessárias/úteis durante a campanha; - As batalhas contra os chefes são relativamente fáceis pois resumem-se a executar uma única e repetitiva estratégia (e ainda existe falhas que podem ser exploradas pra mata-los facilmente), porém aqueles que andam livremente pelo cenário podem causar problemas dependendo do comportamento da IA, por exemplo: 1)Chefe Ukhu (vespa) pode ocasionalmente avançar gradativamente junto ao chão, sem subir (sem brecha pra passar por baixo) até prensar o protagonista contra a parede tornando praticamente impossível desviar de seus ataques; 2)Gir-Tab (escorpião) pode ocasionalmente começar a avançar até quase prensar o protagonista contra a parede, e nessa situação não há chances de desviar de seus disparos a queima-roupa; 3)Telal (2º chefe) também pode executar esse padrão; - A situação descrita acima, é no mínimo bizarra pois os chefes não deveriam possuir a possibilidade de executar um comportamento que ocasionalmente inviabilizasse o jogador de vencer a batalha. Inclusive existe a possibilidade dele vir pra cima e não recuar mais (facilmente percebido no Ukhu); - O jogo não possui "Fast Travel" (teletransporte entre pontos do mapa), e obviamente é desgastante percorrer novamente todo o caminho a pé. Também não possui bestiário ou nomes aos monstros, mas obviamente há uma conquista de hacker todos os inimigos que dá um trabalho dos infernos pois é difícil checar aquilo já hackeado justamente pela falta de nomes; - Secret World Entrance. Essas passagens secretas são geradas aleatoriamente à cada nova campanha, encontra-las é um verdadeiro inferno pois são dezenas de possíveis localizações, mas na prática não são necessárias pra terminar o jogo ou tão pouco compensa tentar encontra-las (apenas 1 é necessária caso queira pra platinar); - Jogabilidade. Infelizmente, é frustante em diversos momentos pois os comandos são "duros" em diversas situações, por exemplo, o gancho é um verdadeiro caos, a resposta do comando direção+direção (dash c/teletransporte) é lenta falhando em muitas situações, completar determinados espaços altos do mapa dá um trabalhão e o próprio combate também não é lá essas coisas;  Veredito Joguei apenas o necessário pra platinar (26h), e não pretendo voltar a jogar nunca mais. Axiom Verge não é um jogo ruim, inclusive possui algumas qualidades como um belo trabalho no level designer (a parte de exploração pra fechar 100% é muito boa), porém como já mencionei a fama dele não faz jus ao jogo pois a jogabilidade e combate são bem irritantes em determinados momentos.  Pra quem realmente gosta de metroidvania, pode compensar comprar caso esteja em promoção, mas definitivamente há diversas opções muito melhores dentro do gênero. 
Date 2024-07-09 Playtime 15h 59m Rec Positive As a big fan of metroidvanias, I'd definitely recommend playing this at least once. It's not my favourite metroidvania, but by the end of my 15 hours or so play through, I mostly had fun and probably would come back to it again in the future.  The positives: - Love the restro vibe. Was actually really nostalgic in a way, and brought me back to the days of the old Mastersystem. - The background visuals are actually really good. It's obviously pixelart, but you can just imagine the scale of the world with giant machines or sky artifacts. - Music is great, and unlike some other 8-bit/16-bit-like games, it never got to that point it felt repetitive. - Loved the unlockable abilities. Felt great unlocking something new and interesting and wanting to backtrack to explore new areas. - Weapons were interesting. I had unlocked 10 separate weapons by the end, and probably used around 7 of them frequently to counter different enemies. - Story was pretty decent. Very dystopian/sci-fi with a bit of a cool twist.  The negatives: - Whilst the map fits in with the style of the game, it was a little frustrating to navigate through when searching for something you remember seeing. There's no real detail with the map, being only squares, and combine this with a lack of a proper pin/flagging system, and you will be doing a lot of tedious trial-and-error backtracking. Sometimes it felt very "fumbling in the dark". - There's no way to see or track what items you have already unlocked or ones you are missing. This for me is one of those things that will probably prevent me 100%ing the game. I'm happy to play through the game, explore, keep backtracking to see if there's any interesting things in newly available areas, but once I get to the end, unless there's a way to see what I've already obtained, I'm not going to spend countless hours searching in places I've potentially already been.  - Boss fights are hit and miss. The earlier bosses in my opinion were better than the later ones. Hell - for the last two mandatory bosses, I pretty much just stood there shooting whilst face-tanking all damage until I won. - This one may be just me, but the combat controls leave a lot to be desired. If there was a way to aim your gun independently to your movement, I think combat would have been much better.  Like I said, if you're a metroidvania fan, I'd definitely recommend playing this at least once.
Date 2024-07-09 Playtime 0h 5m Rec Negative No mouse and keyboard support. I'm talking about extremely trivial things like pressing ESC to exit a menu, or ENTER to confirm (neither work). You can't even bind mouse buttons at all.

Date 2024-07-08 Playtime 15h 31m Rec Positive Easily one of the best modern Metroidvanias available today.  Incredible atmosphere, challenging but fair difficulty, rewarding exploration, and a compelling story.
Date 2024-07-07 Playtime 41h 12m Rec Positive So, are you a M E T R O I D fan? Do you love exploring alien worlds alone and fighting scary monsters and finding neat upgrades? Welcome home. This is axiom Verge, a game I can safely say is a spritual successor to Metroid all on its own merits and concepts.  If you know anything about art or cinema, you may heard the name H.R Giger, interesting and weird artist dude.  He was responsible for doing alot of designs for monsters in movies like the Alien trilogy, which also inspired Metroid.  This game is neither Alien nor Metroid, but a new idea all its own. Instead of being a super-soldier or genetically engineered bounty hunter, you're just a guy. (maybe even a scientist or engineer). The point is, Trace is just a normal guy, no superpowers, no combat experience. His previous job was working at a lab. So he's relying on his wits to keep him alive.  This is where his story begins.   Upon waking a mysterious feminine voice greets him, but tells him that she is in trouble. She also is dying, but he needs to remedy that, immediately. She tells him about a gun in the next room that can help him.  The Axiom Disruptor. Think of it as an armcannon, but much more unweildy. You can still shoot in 8 directions, and it can be upgraded.  Soon Trace realizes he's awoken in a world of horrifying monsters, ancient intelligent constructs, and maze after maze of blocks with many unknown obstacles blocking his path. He learns of an antagonist that is seeking to destroy his newfound friend, so that needs to be dealt with, too. He just hopes that if he helps the constructs they can send him home, back to Earth.  I love the music, the controls are smooth, and the sound effects are fitting. The story is pretty light, but it doesn't have to be deep. You're here to shoot stuff, right?  (Charts incoming when I update my review.)
Date 2024-07-07 Playtime 6h 8m Rec Positive мир всегда был не таким, каким мы его знали... время проснуться...
Date 2024-07-07 Playtime 9h 36m Rec Negative Looks great, cool music, really original setting, and the fact that the health-bar pulses in time with the current song is drool to me. Original weapons and tools, but I have to say, of the 8 or so weapons I've picked up so far only one has replaced my original one. The others are just dreadfully bad apart from very specific circumstances. I wish they were modular in some creative way instead of just replacing each other.  I spend most of the game running back and forth, back and forth, across a kind of big map looking for the door I missed. Some times I get a new ability and go "hey this is definitely what unlocks [that passage] I saw earlier" and more than half the time when I get there it's either not the case (yet) or it's just for a random health upgrade or similar (and a dead end). It feels awfully random to progress and find a new area. When I do, I often really enjoy it and its new creative challenges it poses, but the further I get in the game the farther apart in time these moments get and in-between them is just ages of wandering.  A few hours in I got to a point where I would boot the game up due to sunk cost. I want to finish it but I kind of don't want to play it anymore. All those good retro parts and great music and intriguing visuals and backstory doesn't make my time fun.  I think what would save the game for me would be any kind of in-game hint of where to go, even if it's vague. It doesn't have to tell me exact locations for things, but maybe at least an area. Some indicator, other than a non-filled map. Maybe "this area has 4 currently reachable map squares you have yet to discover" or whatever. Anything, really, to prevent me from wandering for hours and resorting to the internet for answers. 
Date 2024-07-06 Playtime 5h 16m Rec Positive Short and sweet Metroidvania game that is super reminiscent if you ever played super metroid, without falling for the same mechanics. I am glad I played it even though it's an older game. Aged gracefully.
Date 2024-07-06 Playtime 28h 15m Rec Positive El juego es tremendo, el diseño, la bso, la historia, no siempre te sirve la fuerza bruta y que el juego tenga zonas Glitch teniendo sentido con la historia me parece increíble.  Me llevó mucho tiempo terminarlo pero no quise mirar guias.  Un Saludo

Date 2024-07-05 Playtime 17h 31m Rec Positive :)
Date 2024-07-04 Playtime 12h 39m Rec Positive great old school metroidvania that takers inspiration from Super Metroid. Good level design with an interesting story and world. The aesthetics give it a lonely and a bit of an oppressive atmosphere like old Metroid games. In terms of gameplay it is unique by having many different types of guns that all do vastly different things, though some are more helpful than others. Look forward to their next game.
Date 2024-07-03 Playtime 4h 20m Rec Positive It's good.
Date 2024-07-02 Playtime 11h 20m Rec Positive If Contra and Metroid fused together, this feels like this would be the result. Overall fun time. Controls are very smooth and well thought out. Look forward to playing the sequel!
Date 2024-07-02 Playtime 13h 44m Rec Positive Одна из лучших метроидваний : оружие , сюжет, музыка , звуки , визуал = все на высоте
Date 2024-07-01 Playtime 39h 38m Rec Positive I LOVED Axiom Verge and I still love it today after replaying 9 years later. To me this is what Metroidvania is and I mean seriously it feels like the creator tried very hard to recreate the Super Metroid Experience while slapping-on a new IP. It's not perfect, for one there are WAY too many pointless guns and the story... well let's be real here, metroidvania games aren't about the story they're about the gameplay and exploration and gaining new traversal methods that let you explore more and this game does that great and I especially love the design of these traversal methods.  I played on normal difficulty, the bosses are on the easy side but I'm not that good so I was happy to be spared the stress of overcoming a boss that keeps handing me my ass (I didn't like Hollow Knight and Metroid Dread, let's leave it at that)
Date 2024-07-01 Playtime 11h 1m Rec Positive Bebe directamente de Metroid pero con la suficiente personalidad como para hacer su propia cosa, guapísimo. Lo único que se le podría echar en cara es que se podría haber aprovechado más que glitchear enemigos afectase al escenario, pero no me parece ni que sea algo negativo, porque el juego es buenísimo.
Date 2024-07-01 Playtime 13h 56m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is very metroid-y in both mechanics and aesthetics. I guess this games falls under the "metroidvania" umbrella.  The game controls well, mostly. Has a large map to explore with plenty of secrets. The snes era visuals are good and the glitching effects are neat.  Some negatives that come to mind: -The grappling hook is pretty bad. -I wish it had fast travel between save points.  If you've played other metroidvanias before you know what to expect.
Date 2024-06-30 Playtime 14h 54m Rec Positive Great metroid+ game, awesome atmosphere and finally a normal and relatable character. Also stops you from making moral decisions, but whatever.
Date 2024-06-29 Playtime 16h 4m Rec Positive Ti piace super metroid? metroid fusion? Questo gioco fa per te. La sensazione è di stare giocando qualcosa nella stessa vena.  Una pecca: alcuni potenziamenti/collezionabili sono nascosti in nicchie molto poco plausibili.
Date 2024-06-29 Playtime 16h 34m Rec Positive The presentation, the visuals, the music was S-Tier. The story was even good to some degree. I also liked the fact the game had this mysterious vibe to it and encouraged exploration.  But man the combat sucked. Fighting the enemies was tad bit boring. Also, the enemy design was really bad. But more offensive part were the boss fights. couple of them were good, but man did they sucked.
Date 2024-06-28 Playtime 35h 15m Rec Positive This game is just amazing for metroid fans.... played it on the PSVita and i still love it
Date 2024-06-28 Playtime 23h 26m Rec Positive Something about Axiom Verge is alien in a way hollywood and almost anyone else just can't do. The aesthetic alone is worth it's weight in gold. It's also a very good metroidvania.
Date 2024-06-27 Playtime 12h 22m Rec Positive Entretenido. Requiere de bastante 'backtracking', lo que le quita algún punto para mi, pero sigue siendo un juego muy bueno si te gusta el género.
Date 2024-06-27 Playtime 13h 26m Rec Positive [h3] Overview [/h3]  Axiom Verge wears its classic Metroid influences on its sleeves. This game is a pure Metroid-like instead of having the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night elements that are seen in more modern Metroidvania games. I have played and enjoyed Metroid and Super Metroid, but I personally prefer the "vania" elements of Metroidvanias more than the Metroid elements. But if you love and perfer the classic Metroid games, I am sure you will love this game and it will be worth the purchase for you.  [h3] How Does it Play? [/h3] This games plays and looks like the original Metroid, but has the advantage of decades worth of improvement in game design knowledge. By this I mean that the game does a much better job at teaching/guiding the player with organic game design and level design than how classic games did things in the past. I didn't really play through the original Metroid and Super Metroid games until I was an adult, so I don't have nostalgia for them as I would if I grew up with them. I still found them fun and important in the history of video games. But if Axiom Verge were released at the same time as Metroid and people played both games side-by-side, I would say almost everyone would say Axiom Verge is all around better.  Axiom Verge has a good sized map, plenty of secrets and power-ups to obtain to strengthen your character, and has a plethora of weapons to choose from. There is a map and mini map which helps with navigation, and there is an in-game transit system of sorts that helps with "fast traveling" through previous areas. There are plenty of bosses to fight, but they range from super easy to cheese all the way to a little confusing to figure out how to actually fight it. But to the game's credit is there is usually a save/respawn point right outside the boss room. The game for the most part has pretty solid controls (besides a few issues which I will address later), and the combat feels pretty fluid. Whether because of my experience or the wealth of combat options available, I feel Axiom Verge is easier than the classic Metroid games in terms of combat difficulty.  [h3] Hack/Glitch Mechanic [/h3] One of the most interesting mechanics in Axiom Verge is the glitch mechanic that lets you "glitch" enemies and certain terrain. For terrain, this serves as a way to get to previously inaccessible areas by removing blocks or by revealing hidden blocks for platforming.  But this gets really interesting with enemies. Each enemy has a unique thing that happens to when you glitch it, all of which are beneficial. These include but aren't limited to: *Slowing the enemies attack/move/projectile speed *Reducing the amount of projectiles it fires *Turns enemies into health drops. *Enemies that shoot dangerous spores now shoot health *Links the health all enemies of the same type on the same screen so killing one kills them all *Turns enemies into platforms *Makes the enemy's attack destroy breakable terrain - revealing secret/hidden paths.  This made encountering a new enemy type intriguing because you can experiment with this gun to see what new effect will be applied to the enemy.  [h3] The Map [/h3]  The game has a good map layout and enemy placement, and there are a handful of shortcuts that unlock as new traversal mechanics unlock. However, I do feel the game could have benefited from at least a few fast travel points (even if it was an item that just took you to the transist zone), just because some of the zones can be pretty labyrinthine and can get a little tedious to back track through. I do appreciate that the game does allow you to put a pin on the map as a reminder to come back to later, but you only have the ability to put down 2 such pins per zone - but I guess it is better than nothing. The game has plenty of secrets, but I feel (compared to classic Metroid games) this game does a much better job at giving you hits/clues on where the secrets are at by suspicious block/tile/enemy placement. Without the help of a guide, I explored nearly all of the map and got almost all of the items just through being observant and intuiting where secrets are at. I much prefer this to the original Metroid design where you had to bomb or shoot/rocket every block just to make sure there wasn't a secret there (heck, the classic Metroid games would even have the main progress path blocked behind a non-descript secret block that needed to be blown up). I don't know about you, but I did not find that fun to do in the old Metroid games.  [h3] Criticisms [/h3]  Besides wishing for a little bit better of a way to traverse the map in the later part of the game, my other main complaints are with some of the controls. Later in the game you get a grappling hook which can be a little finicky to use as some platforming puzzles will require you to chain grappling hook shots multiple times to get across large gaps. It took me a bit to figure it out how to properly use it (the default shot for the grappling hook is at a diagonal - making many shots fall short of hitting a surface so I would fall). I feel this could be remedied by either making the default angle straight up, or increasing the length of the grappling hook so there would be less missed shots when trying to swing. Eventually I would just spam the button for the shot and just move baby steps at a time to avoid falling.  The other control issue I had was when you get a teleport/dash movement ability that moves your character forward in a desired direction. However, the keybind for this is to double-tap the desired direction in order to activate the dash. I generally used the analog stick for movement, so this is very touchy to try to do with the stick: at times it wouldn't go off when I wanted it to, or it would go off when I didn't want it to (sometimes leading to over shooting platforms and falling). This was fine for most of the game when you only used the ability for certain platforming sections. But towards the end of the game it is all but required to use in order to defeat the final 2-3 bosses. Because the keybind for this ability was tied to double-tapping a direction, I couldn't find a way to rebind it to a single button press (even with the help of Steam Input). I ended up having to switch to using my controller's D-pad during those final boss fights in order to ensure precision use of the dash in order to beat them. I wished the game had a way to rebind this ability or offer an alternative controller scheme that offered a single-button press for the dash.  [h3] Summary [/h3]  Overall I enjoyed Axiom Verge and am looking forward to playing its sequel. The game did a good job of teaching and guiding the player without the use of external guides or resources in order to complete the game (heck, the original Metroid games often required you to read the game's manual to understand even the basics of how to play or progress the game).   I managed to beat the game without the use of any online guide or extra help. According to the game's final scorecard for me: It took me about 13 hours to beat the game. 95% of the was map explored. ~82% of the items/weapons/powerups found.
Date 2024-06-25 Playtime 10h 55m Rec Positive Fun game, tight controls, great music. But unnecessarily cryptic, both in the gameplay(it's common to get stuck) and its story.
Date 2024-06-24 Playtime 13h 5m Rec Positive A really well done metroidvania with extra metroid. It's all round a decently controlling game, but one tool in the game ([spoiler]the god-forsaken grappling hook[/spoiler]) gave me a headache to use, as it almost seems like it fails to function. As others have said before me, the control scheme is a bag of dicks, so readjust it as you please. Other than those two quirks, it's a fun time.

Date 2024-06-12 Playtime 17h 21m Rec Positive great game, sorry I missed it in '15
Date 2024-06-12 Playtime 10h 39m Rec Negative Terriblement frustrant.   Metroidvania je veux bien, mais là c'est très mal géré.  Sa logique de progression consiste à être constamment bloqué et à devoir faire le tour de toute la map pour déceler le petit carré inexploré quelque part en espérant qu'il s'agisse de l'endroit qui vous permettra de poursuivre. Jusqu'à ce que vous débloquiez une microfonction que vous n'aviez pas avant qui vous permette d'avancer sur un autre carré inexploré que vous ne pouviez pas exploiter avant. Meh...  Les combats: énorme malus. Vous disposerez à moment donné d'un dash, qui vous permet de faire des dégâts aux ennemis traversés et à esquiver les projectiles. Dans l'idée c'est très bien, mais la manière dont il est configuré le rend inutilisable en combat. Ca se déclenche sans arrêts quand ce n'est pas désiré, et les boss à un certain stade sont suffisamment unfair pour que finir le jeu en hard mode soit quasi impossible (4% des joueurs seulement, c'est parfaitement normal quand on voit à quel point le jouer manque d'options pour ce qui est du combat).  En résumé, c'est terriblement dommage à mon sens, parce que le scénario n'est pas inintéressant, les graphismes et le son hyper qualitatifs si vous appréciez une approche rétro en pixel art.  Mais pour ce qui est de procurer de la satisfaction, ça reste très mitigé.
Date 2024-06-12 Playtime 19h 15m Rec Negative Axiom Verge is an aborted fetus of gay couple who played super metriod way too much and tired to implant an in vitro-fertilized zygote in one of their colons.  The design of this game is terrible. Whoever thought that having d-pad/stick double tap as the way to activate dash should be captured and studied, because apparently having negative IQ is possible.  Don't buy this game and if you bought it or got it for free for some reason, don't play it because it will make you wanna become a pencil drawing just so that you could erase yourself.  MY GOD, WHY IS THIS CRAP SO BAD 
Date 2024-06-11 Playtime 2h 14m Rec Negative The game started off good and sucked me in. But after a while it just felt like the game is too laborious. I just think the game world is too big. I think Iji is the better game.
Date 2024-06-11 Playtime 4h 16m Rec Positive What else is there to say? One of the most Metroid-y metroidvanias out there. I love everything about it. I'm disappointed that the sequel went in a different direction, but I'll always have this.
Date 2024-06-10 Playtime 12h 34m Rec Positive For an unassuming game Axiom Verge does quite a few interesting things.  The lack of fast travel and sheer amount of late-game backtracking weigh down the overall enjoyment but the weapons, abilities, and boss battles in this title are worth the time and financial investment.
Date 2024-06-09 Playtime 13h 1m Rec Positive A very good metroidvania game - much closer to Metroid in its inspirations than to Castlevania - that does the essentials properly. The combat feels good and backtracking doesn't seem particularly bad even though there's no quick travel between save rooms (!), even extras like setting and music hit the right spots. Despite having a lot of powerups Axiom Verge is simple and effective at its core gameplay, a nice change from some of the other metroidvanias I have played in recent years.

Date 2024-06-09 Playtime 8h 29m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania so far!
Date 2024-06-09 Playtime 16h 32m Rec Positive Nice game that focuses on non-linear exploration and features countless items and powers up to discover. It is definitely worth playing if Metroid is what makes the genre good for you
Date 2024-06-08 Playtime 9h 16m Rec Negative I really don't see what people like about this. I guess when it came out we didn't have the MV selection we do not, but it's just not a good game.
Date 2024-06-08 Playtime 13h 38m Rec Positive man i really love this game and the most unexpected thing i like is the story which as you play more things will be revealed. with that said the default control for keyboard is atrocious so you are better off making your own control which is possible from the start. overall a great metroidvania game. buy it at sale and you will have a good time.
Date 2024-06-08 Playtime 6h 39m Rec Negative The game doesn't have enough heart and feels like a Kickstarter-funded product. The lack of quality shows mainly in the dialogue and the story, at least in the first 3 hours of the campaign.
Date 2024-06-07 Playtime 12h 22m Rec Negative Ótima pixel art, música, alguns efeitos sonoros, mas tem muitas falhas no game design. As primeiras 3 horas do jogo é um jogo perfeito, você desbrava o desconhecido, sente medo e confuso mas consegue novas melhorias para se sentir poderoso e consegue superar, mas quanto mais avança no late game mais as rachaduras desse modelo de game design mostra até completamente ruir no final.  Quais seriam essas falhas de game design? (Observação, isso só começa a ser notado da metade pro final) - Inimigos totalmente injustos. Alguns são literalmente invisíveis e quando surgem aparecem a 1000 km/h, alguns estão em pontos do mapa que você não consegue atingir mas eles conseguem te atingir (e fogem a 200 por hora quando você chega perto ou o padrão de movimento faz fugir para cantos difíceis de atingir), alguns estão em grandes quantidades e que é difícil de matar (boa sorte em passar vivo), e outros só são rápidos demais para atingir.  - Mapa confuso. Certo que é uma característica de jogos metrodivania você não saber o próximo passo e descobrir uma nova melhoria que te ajuda a passar por um local que você estava preso e achar cantos escondidos que melhoram você além do básico, massss, aqui não soube construir o mapa para indicar uma progressão. Pois muitas áreas que são para progredir a história do jogo estão praticamente escondidas, já que devido a como foi feita a arte, as áreas importantes são desapercebidas devido a se misturar com o fundo, ou estão em uma posição que se parece algo que não é possível de se fazer, no que resulta em você revirando todo o mapa para descobrir que você deve pular no meio do fosso e atravessar a parede dando um mortal para trás.  - Arte difícil de distinguir. Por mais bonito que a pixel art seja, em certo momentos fica muito difícil de notar o que seja monstro, cenário de fundo ou objeto que você pode interagir.
Date 2024-06-06 Playtime 1h 6m Rec Negative This sure is a lot like Metroid!  And not the good ones!  This is very very retro, which is not what I want out of my games of this genre.
Date 2024-06-05 Playtime 23h 19m Rec Positive Wonderful sound, graphics style, gameplay and feel to the game!
Date 2024-06-05 Playtime 40h 3m Rec Positive fera demais
Date 2024-06-04 Playtime 14h 18m Rec Positive Classic of the genre, absolutely. Great combat, lots of places to explore, an awesome way to do secret areas, amazing music, all of it. Highly, highly recommended. One thing I will say is that you might want to get a map if you're trying to 100%, as the tilesets make some of the rooms a bit harder to tell apart compared to say, Super Metroid.
Date 2024-06-04 Playtime 16h 20m Rec Positive Se tiver paciência, será uma ótima experiencia, mas fiquei confuso com a navegação e o gráfico retro dificulta encontrar mais segredos nas fases, não que isso seja ruim, contudo facilita você a ficar perdido.
Date 2024-06-04 Playtime 13h 48m Rec Positive Gracias Alfresa por este regalo y hacerme jugar Axiom Verge.  Un golpe en la nostalgia fuerte de Metroid; Tal vez demasiado. Con un sistema sencillo, un laberíntico mapa que parece infinito, una historia que se va descubriendo en medida que interactues con el espacio, y que tienes que hacer sí o sí para tener la historia completa, que igual al final sale sobrando. Pero se siente bien el combate, al menos un 70% del juego, después de golpe todo es una pesadilla, por que si bien el backtracking es algo que esperamos, posiblemente odies perderte en este juego y es algo que pasará seguido y más veces de las que quisieras pues si algo hace bien este juego es tener la idea de "dejarse perder" para explorar las posibilidades. Lo malo, te obliga a conseguir objetos, y claro que es normal en un videojuego, pero, no se siente natural el ir a buscar esos objetos, desearlos realmente, sólo son para pasar una pequeña fracción del mapa y luego da igual si los tienes o no porque quedan obsoletos. Aún así, es muy divertido el juego, una gran puesta visual y sonora, con enemigos más difíciles que los Bosses, y una historia sencilla pero bonita que es fácil de conectar mientras te vuelves loco tratando de recordar dónde habías visto un lugar al cuál no podías pasar y cuando lo re-encuentras te das cuenta que aún con tus nuevos poderes sigues sin poderlo pasar. jaja.  Suerte a todos en este bonito viaje pixelado-
Date 2024-06-04 Playtime 32h 27m Rec Positive great retro metroid flavor
Date 2024-06-03 Playtime 23h 25m Rec Positive As you have probably heard, this is one of the better games to be inspired by the Metroid Franchise.  As for my experience, it plays great from start to finish. Give or take a few road blocks you may run into depending on your memory and puzzle solving skills.  The Whole Soundtrack is a certified banger IMO. (although it might get old if you're listening on repeat because you got lost) There are many great twists you'll encounter both gameplay and the story. Tons of secrets that I have yet to discover. A new randomizer mode was added for ''practically endless'' gameplay.  I personally find it most impressive that this whole thing was made mostly by one person, and was one of the last games released for the ill-fated Wii U.
Date 2024-06-03 Playtime 14h 58m Rec Positive 还是有不少亮点的，但是有些东西不会藏建议不藏
Date 2024-06-03 Playtime 22h 52m Rec Positive 看着地图玩的，有很多隐藏，甚至每个存档还有5个随机的隐藏空间，我只找到了3个。游戏过程总体比较线性，刚开始一些地方的怪手残很多次才过得去，不像2代直接有个调整敌我方伤害倍数的辅助模式，可以安心推图，不过随着探索深入获得很多能力之后就很舒服了，而且后期一些能力的组合可以玩出很骚的操作，比如扔无人机的技巧，是全收集的关键。游戏没有方便的传送功能，因为有些图就是故意设计让你不往前拿新能力就回不去的，因此玩家在看似无法继续推进的时候可能会卡关，特别是地图还容易迷路，不知道要去哪里，但其实还是可以继续的，只是后期全收集跑图就比较痛苦。无人机和干扰枪的设计很出彩，这两种能力在2代稍稍改了一下又有很不一样的体验。剧情看起来很厉害的样子。1、2代都十分推荐。
Date 2024-06-03 Playtime 4h 26m Rec Negative Quasi unplayable with mouse and keyboard, I got stuck in the options because the key to go back is Q for some god forsaken reason and not Esc as one would expect and overall the gameplay and bosses are just tedious
Date 2024-06-02 Playtime 15h 15m Rec Positive Axiom Verge was created by a single indie developer, Thomas Happ. You'll take control of Trace, a scientist who, after suffering a crippling injury, wakes up in an ancient and high-tech world. The game focuses on a non-linear exploration and features countless items and power up to discover.

Super cool!!! -Quite an interesting sci-fi and complex plot that develop itself until the end. I enjoyed it. -Average graphics at best. Nothing stood out to me except bosses. I thought they were graphically unique. -The music is atmospheric and definitely fits the game's theme. It get repetitive though. -Difficulty wise, I think 5/10 is about right. Most will finish the game without a sweat. -Non-Linear just how we like it. -On the shorter side of things. 10 hours on average for the main story. -Worth replaying for the insane amount of secrets, puzzles, collectibles. I'll Definitely try to find everything. -About $22canadian. I think $15 would've been a sweet spot but nothing to scream about.  -Controls, I personally disliked it and it's what made me struggle to dive into the game at first.  -Not much to say about combat other than shot ahead. -Ok amount of different enemies for a desolated world. -Bosses were extremely simple. No second phase but they shot/move faster as they approach death. -Zero fast travel. There's one area where there's a platform to travel from west<->east that's it. -A fair amount of worlds but to me, it failed at feeling unique and memorable. -A LOT of exploration and backtracking. A bit tedious sometime due to map layouts/lack of fast travel. -There's a lot of weapons, power ups, health nodes, notes to find throughout the game. -I finished the game with 90% and I explored A TON. Secrets requires dedication, observation, reflection… -There isn't "many" puzzle solving but they are challenging. -Platforming-wise, it's generic for the most part but eventually you get to combine abilities to access areas. -No rpg elements from my knowledge.  -There was no cat in the game…You make the call if it's worth playing the game due to that.  *Conclusion, I actually ended up enjoying the amount of explorations and collectibles to find. I'd like to do a second playthrough and find everything. The abilities brought something new to the genre for sure. The glitch-like effects and context is something I've never seen before, super rad. Other than the controls, the only other things that annoyed me is the randomization of the secret worlds and how to find them. I thought it was uninspiring. Also, it had a good amount of "filler" platforming and rooms that could've been compressed to make the overall experience better. It was great to play a 'simple' game without to much combat complexity while having a huge amount of optional secrets to find. I also haven't experienced a single Bug/Glitch. An amazing game from a single Dev !!!

Date 2024-06-02 Playtime 15h 5m Rec Positive Really fun game. Its basically a better metroid with a fun story. Only thing I suggest to new players is to finish the game first before you try to 100% the map because it will be overwhelming. I recommend beating the final boss then see if you're willing to explore all the secret stuff
Date 2024-06-02 Playtime 18h 22m Rec Positive Un gran juego con una historia bastante interesante, descubrí este juego por casualidad y me termino encantando, ahora mismo voy a empezar a jugar el 2
Date 2024-06-01 Playtime 16h 52m Rec Positive Outstanding soundtrack, a grimy Heavy Metal kind of art style that I appreciate and engaging gameplay.  Not perfect, though -- the phase dash ability is activated by double-tapping a direction on the D-pad, which makes it both impossible to reliably activate on demand and trivially easy to activate by accident. And it has way too many weapons and traversal abilities, which is an odd thing to complain about, but the end result is that you get equipment that you use briefly and hate the entire time before finally getting the three things you end up using for most of the game. Ideally, there'd be a much smaller set of great feeling tools that you use across the entire game, instead of 12 weapons that you never touch and a terrible grapple.
Date 2024-06-01 Playtime 0h 26m Rec Negative Can't get into the convoluted controls. Bad design choice. Waste of money. Overpriced.

Date 2024-05-25 Playtime 57h 31m Rec Positive одна из лучших игр своего жанра. eбeйшая графика и чокнутый сюжет. страшные твари и загадочный игровой мир. тонны оружия и паверапов. я рад что узнал про эту замечательную игру. вставьте сюда шутку про пушкина
Date 2024-05-25 Playtime 18h 34m Rec Positive mientras mas avanzas mas guapo se pone  Edit: efectivamente mientras mas avanzas mejor se pone, pero hay un punto cercano al final en el que no se entiende una poronga, era un 8.5 de 10 pero llegando al final se vuelve un 6 de 10.
Date 2024-05-25 Playtime 12h 20m Rec Negative In English below. ------- Приобретая игру - я думал получу приключение, я ошибся и получил мучения. Много поиска с возвратом, специально понаставленные колонны чтобы игрок о них запинался итак не быстрым персонажем. Две трети находимого оружия бесполезно перед стартовым. Абордажный крюк - малополезный и совершенно не ускоряет прохождение.  Играя в эту игру, я подумал "Почему Super Metroid великая игра"? И понял... - дело в очень тонком подходе к игроку, игра создана очень динамичной хотя и без особых диалогов. Очень жаль что в Axiom Verge единственное хорошее - это сюжет ставящий некоторые вопросы перед игроком, подумать. Но этого для звания игра, на 2024 мало. _____  When I purchased the game, I thought I would get an adventure, I was mistaken and ended up in torment. There is a lot of searching with a return, specially placed columns so that the player will trip over them with an already slow character. Two thirds of the weapons found are useless before the starting one. The grappling hook is of little use and does not speed up the passage at all.   While playing this game I thought "Why is Super Metroid a great game"? And I realized it was a very subtle approach to the player; the game was created to be very dynamic, although without much dialogue. It’s a shame that the only good thing about Axiom Verge is the plot, which poses some questions for the player to think about. But this is not enough for the title of game, for 2024.

Date 2024-05-24 Playtime 15h 12m Rec Positive 100% Recommended if you enjoy Metroidvania games. Axiom Verge is a well made Metroidvania game. It has a great story and fun gameplay, but it can be a little tedious sometimes. It has a lot of the great aspects that classic Metroidvania games have, like the need to explore for upgrades, new weapons and the feel of reward for checking every wall for a hidden entrance.  Overall i had a blast and it was an amazing experience.
Date 2024-05-24 Playtime 12h 49m Rec Positive A 2d metroidvania game that focuses on finding weapons and skills, which help you progress through variety of not really hard (on medium difficulty) fights and challenges.  pros - lots of guns - cool upgrades - controlling a drone - soundtrack - beautiful pixel artwork - a mystery filled story  cons - lots of useless guns, I used maybe 3 or 4 and theres like 20 or something lol - not really challenging on medium difficulty - most areas are just a different color - which makes the backtracking to 100% the collection a boredom filled experience  
Date 2024-05-24 Playtime 23h 3m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is one of the best Metroidvanias ever made - The general gameplay is simple yet fun, the music and sound design are great, and the game sports some absolutely phenomenal pixel art and spritework, with some of the most unique items in the genre.  An absolute must-play for any Metroidvania fan.
Date 2024-05-23 Playtime 0h 29m Rec Negative I like the ideas in this game, but it's all around way too unpolished. It gives me a sense of a beta that got released instead of getting its final three months of QA. The music in the starting area has a very obvious looping point and is also just intense enough to give me a headache after a while. The dialog boxes interfere with the gameplay and are kind of weird about when they allow you to actually continue them with a button press, which makes them feel excessively unresponsive. The controls don't feel as fluid as they should be. Unsure about why, the movement itself is fine.
Date 2024-05-23 Playtime 11h 33m Rec Positive 相当不错
Date 2024-05-23 Playtime 12h 20m Rec Positive 100% Metroid, 0% Vania  Everyone seems to have played Axion Verge by now except for me. I'm not a fan of the Metroid part of metroidvania. This one is all Metroid (the original game from the 80s to be precise) so that is why I avoided this one for nearly a decade. Often too obtuse for it's own good and some of it's control scheme hasn't aged well at all (making the dash ability a double tap on the direction keys rather than mapped to one of the shoulder button is its biggest blunder). Despite everything there is something so compelling about the game from the moment Dr. Trace awakens on an alien world of pulsating flesh and gigantic machines with feminine faces that I had to see the the adventure through to the end. Even when it made me want to pull my hair out.   Some tips to hopefully make your time with the game a bit less frustrating than mine: 1. If enemies seem too aggressive and difficult to fight, use the glitch gun. This will usually make them easier to deal with 2. There is a point in the game where you get corralled in a section of the map (it's a big section so you can still get really lost) and can't backtrack to earlier zones until you get some traversal abilities. There will come a point after you get the space jump where it looks like you can't move forward. You actually can. Use the glitch gun on any bodies of water. Sometimes you can make a platform even if there is no glitching effect to indicate you can.  3. In the late, late, late game, after you clear this palace place on on the mountaintop, there is no indication of where you are supposed to go next. Return to the Edin zone and go to the top of the map. If you have the third upgrade to your ability to phase through walls, the drone teleport, and the upgrade that makes your drone launch higher, there is a tunnel your drone can enter that will take you to the final area of the game. It's up so high that you have to trigger your phase dash during an upward jump and launch the drone into the air to even see the ledge.  Your welcome. With these tips, I probably saved you several hours of running around aimlessly.
Date 2024-05-23 Playtime 9h 7m Rec Positive almost as good as super metroid very good 9/10 big reco if u like the genre
Date 2024-05-23 Playtime 3h 24m Rec Negative Game has decent bones, but of the mechanics of the game aren't good enough. This really feels like a baby's first metrovania. Most of the games "difficulty" just come from it being tedious to play.
Date 2024-05-22 Playtime 12h 10m Rec Positive Superb. One of the best Metroidvanias ever, entertaining almost the whole way through. And that music - wow!
Date 2024-05-22 Playtime 39h 0m Rec Positive Definitely wears inspiration on it's sleeve, but so well done. Tons of different, unique weapons to find, also random secret areas with upgrades and stuff. Story is mysterious, unique and interesting, more importantly the game-play is fun. I waited way too long to finish this game, the sequel makes you wish for more of the original. And of course, "DEMON! ATHETOS SAY KILL!"
Date 2024-05-22 Playtime 20h 5m Rec Positive Alright, I had to change my review because of playing Axiom Verge 2. Before that this one was "not recommended", but that's because I kind of didn't like to get those achievements, which will be similiar with Axiom Verge 2. I like both games, even though they play differently. This one is more action based, kind of like the old Metroid Games.  If you liked those, you most likely will like this one.  If you have Achievement OCD and want to have all of them, you will get to it, because it's not too hard, but it's kind of tedious. You have to do a speedrun (which is not too hard, but I hate those achievements), a run with not more then 40% of the items, one hard mode run and you have to glitch all of the enemies, which are nearly identical in the second game. I didn't like these achievements and I wish, those wouldn't be in the game.  But if you won't get these and you just want to play a good game, this game can easily be recommended!
Date 2024-05-22 Playtime 8h 50m Rec Positive Great game! Controls are snappy, the story is interesting, the upgrades are surprising and original, the music has some bangers. The bosses are a bit on the easy side but still fun to fight. I recommend it.
Date 2024-05-22 Playtime 9h 32m Rec Negative The controls are painfully awkward. Most of the game involves figuring out how to hit enemies without giving them the chance to hit back. Maybe that's a staple of the genre--I haven't played many metroidvanias--but it feels cheap instead of satisfying.  The music slaps.
Date 2024-05-22 Playtime 17h 49m Rec Positive Beautiful, challenging, rewarding. Worth a detour.
Date 2024-05-21 Playtime 11h 2m Rec Positive About a year ago, I was made to sit down and play through one of the old Metroid games. I absolutely loved it - something about the feeling of playing something so old - yet so well-put-together that it held up even by most modern standards - was an experience that nothing else I've played has ever really captured.  Until Axiom Verge. The game wears its Metroid influence like a lightbulb on its sleeve, yet never once feels like a clone of it. This game has its own identity, striking incredible balances in nearly every aspect of the game. There's a reason it's so beloved - I get it now. If you like Metroidvanias, and especially Metroid, this is one you just have to play!

Date 2024-05-20 Playtime 35h 14m Rec Positive 【8.1★】复古类银河城代表作之一，久仰大名，不愧是经典，玩起来就是顺畅。设定引人入胜，机制创新十足，游戏难度适中，但弱引导和较为慢热的节奏还是会劝退不少新人，加上没有官中，唯一优秀的汉化包还是繁体字的，这也导致本作在国内知名度较低。  【优点】 ①　极其劲爆的开局，一秒入戏，悬疑感营造得相当不错，前面两首BGM也十分带感，神曲级别。 ②　难度曲线合理。没有过分堆怪，也没有太折磨人的卡关，跳跳乐难度相当高，不过主要难在收集隐藏上，正常游玩的话还是以探险和收集情报为主。 ③　剧情复杂深奥，我喜欢这种一眼望不到边的故事，虽然通关后也没弄明白到底讲了什么……  【不足】 ①　没有传送，中央区域的列车行驶慢得要命，全收集玩家叫苦连天。 ②　本作是非常纯粹的电影级体验的类银河城，它并没有太多有意思的其它玩法，没有升级养成系统、没有支线剧情、没有技能加点、没有BOSS RUSH之类的附加玩法，只能推动主线，略显单调。 因为玩法比较单一，我玩到后期会莫名有种疲惫感。  ③　BOSS战设计太单一。BOSS们看着吓人，可实际上没啥威胁，它们的技能主要是吐小弹珠和发小冲击波，掌握好节奏就很好打。 （这游戏毕竟是2015年出的，那个时候可能没有特别好的BOSS战竞品参考，只能说空洞把我的口味养刁了。）  ④　可能是我的心理问题，这游戏的场景看久了会有种压抑感。中期也不知怎么回事，总是迷路。

Date 2024-05-19 Playtime 12h 5m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a fun metroid-like that doesn't ask too much of the player. The gameplay loop of finding weapons/power-ups, unlocking new areas, and fighting bosses feels fun without being too frustrating. Although nothing challenged me too much, I still found it engaging throughout.  There are cases where you can get lost, but often during your time finding your way, you find optional secrets that level up your character.  The Story is passable, with some lore that you can deep dive into.  Music is great with some stand-out areas. This game is well-worth your time.
Date 2024-05-19 Playtime 18h 51m Rec Positive This game is great. It has its issues, I don't love it to death, but I won't be confused if someone else does. The story is gripping even if not the most deep, the lore is very fun, and the gun variety is a nice touch.  Yea, i wish the bosses were better designed in terms of combat, and that some of the secret pathways were better telegraphed cause some of them seem random. But it doesnt bog down the game for me which is still an indie masterpiece as far as I'm concerned. The pixel art is great, the level design overall is great, the atmosphere hits just right. Enemy design could use some polish but I cant complain much.
Date 2024-05-19 Playtime 9h 35m Rec Positive Played this game to 100% completion just over 5 years ago as of February this year, and coming back to it now I'm immediately enthralled once more. Combat can be tricky, the world is fascinating, and it's so satisfying completing the map and collecting items. A really marvellous metroidvania.
Date 2024-05-19 Playtime 15h 12m Rec Positive This is basicaly Metroid 3.0 . Which accept from the fact that this makes this one of the few metroidvanias that is more of a metroid rather than a castlevania game, it also means it is a vast improvement that nails almost every aspect. The story although sort and nothing crazy, it was interesting. The music ranged from exciting to downright unsettling, complimenting the abstract cyberhorror theme of the visuals. But the real hero is the gameplay and its "glitch" mechanic. It really turns the whole thing on its head and you never know what to expect when encountering something new. Also something interesting that I noticed. Usualy in metroidvanias you get a bunch of powers where 90% of them will either become obsolete by the end or are usuless from the beginning. But with this one the powers are so diverse in behaviour where personaly I found myshelf switching around constantly. My only real complaint is the sort lack of boss fights and thats mostly because the few boss fights that exist, are just that damn epic.  tl;dr A wotrhy successor of the old ways of gaming, up there with legends like Hollow Knight, Shovel Knight and so on.
Date 2024-05-19 Playtime 8h 54m Rec Positive I really enjoyed this game. Everything works really well here. A good "Metroidvania" keeps you moving with your upgrades and map exploration and this does that well. I'm still not sure why we call these games "Metroidvania" games when Metroid came out before Castlevania II. Either way, this is a great game. The music is awesome and the bass with a sub woofer will go throughout your house. The weapons and abilities are excellent as well. The graphics are really well done for that 8 bit style. It's as if a NES had no limitations as far as audio or color pallet. No real complaints here as the whole experience was enjoyable and kept me going until the end.
Date 2024-05-19 Playtime 14h 41m Rec Positive One of the best Search/Action/Metroidvania games with a great soundtrack.
Date 2024-05-19 Playtime 27h 13m Rec Positive I still remember getting this game and playing it on my old Wii U not long after hearing Vinesauce Vinny mention it in one of his videos many years ago. It's astounding just how much he influenced my gaming interests when I was younger. If you are a Die-hard Metroid fan like me, then you absolutely should consider getting this. This will also appeal to you if you like Gigeresque art as this game is chock-full of those kinds of abstract and surreal visuals.
Date 2024-05-18 Playtime 0h 8m Rec Negative not my kind of game. aim in 8 directions, aiming and moving are not independent. the whole game just feels.. old, like decades old.

Date 2024-05-17 Playtime 24h 2m Rec Positive [h1][b] A modern Metroidvenia classic [/b][/h1]  Axiom Verge checks all the boxes on what makes a Metroidvania game excel!  From the exquisite 8 bit pixel art and music, down to the captivating story and exciting world building and Lore. Such a blast from the past with well thought out modern touches.  It was an unforgettable experience, that I highly suggest everyone to experience for themselves!
Date 2024-05-17 Playtime 14h 50m Rec Positive This game is a love letter to Metroid and Super Metroid. I'm playing this near 10 years after it's release and it still holds up. If you had said that a Metroidvania without double-jump would end up having the most enjoyable movement tools I don't think I'd have believed you. It's difficult, but exploration - even for Lore fragments - is very rewarding, often providing the tools to challenge bosses in very different ways. Strongly Recommended - it starts slow, but opens up after the first 30 minutes and it's worth sticking with.

Date 2024-05-15 Playtime 19h 25m Rec Positive Originally posted by me on Reddit (u/ArthRol)   [h1]Axiom Verge - estranging, unwelcoming, yet a brilliant metroidvania.[/h1]  Well, Axiom Verge is eery, or, in other words, there is nothing [i]concrete[/i] in its labyrinthine world. To me, everything was abstract and uncanny. This made me feel like a stranger in this dimension, whom I actually [i]were[/i] - seeking forms and shapes where they never should have been. The music was contributing to this impression with its outlandish rhythm. At one location, it begins with a humanish voice in a crescendo, making you inwardly shudder.  How should I describe the enemies, the locations, the bosses? Like something abstract, too. Unfathomable even. Albeit they would sometimes arise an association - say, with marine life, or with an alien desert. And then there were those colossal structures - [i]Rusalki[/i], they were called. And that weird, giant steel-made moving head. Something grim about it all.   Yet these are only subjective impressions. Frankly, Axiom Verge felt off-putting at first - but then I grew accustomed to all its quirkiness and came to appreciate it. From objective point of view, this metroidvania is almost flawless. The world is captivating to explore, and with every new ability, you might come back and visit previously inaccessible locations. Some of them are tricky as hell. But the reward is due, and you are somehow driven to explore every uncompleted corner in your reach. Honestly, I haven't felt such motivation in other games. And the world is diverse - locations are not similar to each other, and they are even dissected in [i]sub-locations[/i]. There isn't a proper fast-travel system - but you don't need it either.   I liked the weapon system. You find new guns during your organic progression or exploring some nooks. Every weapon has its pros and cons, they all have their use against certain types of enemies. The bosses are not that hard, but will anyway pose a challenge and are fun to beat.   Oh, and the game is full of glitches - intentional glitches. They are part of the core mechanics. You have to pass through them, or even use them for your favor. You may run into the wall and glitch, but... nothing is really done without a reason. At one instance, you glitch yourself.   Overall, I liked it very much, but since I have run out of adjectives, I'd simply say it was very interesting. It's really worth playing. A shame it has got only 5 thousand Steam reviews.   P.S. Frankly, I not really grasped the plot, and I will have to watch a video on it or something. My bad - should have been more attentive. But I still sensed that I was in a ruined world, in an epicenter of a battle for the fate of it all, that I were [i]a chosen one[/i].  
Date 2024-05-15 Playtime 1h 14m Rec Negative A homage to the clunky and experimental era of 8-bit games that deserves to stay in history - There are so many better metroidvanias out there for anyone to waste their time on this one, unfortunately.
Date 2024-05-14 Playtime 17h 53m Rec Positive Got some minor issues but overall very fun metroidvania with sold gameplay.
Date 2024-05-14 Playtime 18h 58m Rec Positive Disclaimer: I got the game in a Humble Bundle for 14$.  Just finished my first playthrough on Hard, here's my thoughts:  - Does a good job of mimicking the feel and aesthetic of Metroid while putting its own spin on it.  - The corruption mechanic is quite interesting and used well.  - Direction is clear without being handhold-y. Usually going to what parts of the map haven't been filled in will lead you to where you need to go.  - Fantastic music, definitely going in my playlist.  - Weapon variety is solid, although a consequence of that variety is a lot of weapons feel redundant. Axiom Disruptor (Vanilla starting gun), Nova/Multi-Disruptor (Hit at weird angles), and Kilver (Short-range AoE and hits through walls) can handle most situations and you get all of them early on.  - Navigation is a bit tedious even after unlocking the fast travel system, this becomes an issue when you're exploring the map trying to find the way to go.  - The [spoiler] dash/teleport [/spoiler] feels too easy to trigger while fighting since movement and aiming share the same button. Not a huge problem but it makes movement in the late game a bit annoying.  All in all a good game, highly recommend it if you're a fan of the Metroid series.
Date 2024-05-14 Playtime 1h 19m Rec Negative Brutto gioco.
Date 2024-05-14 Playtime 12h 46m Rec Positive If you are a fan of retro style metroidvania I feel you can do a lot worse then Axion Verge. If you are like me, someone who is still very new to this style of game you will likely feel confused and frustrated at times, I am not ashamed to say I had to turn to a guide half a dozen times. But despite my annoyance, I still enjoy the story enough to where I can happily recommend Axion Verge if you know what you are getting yourself into.
Date 2024-05-14 Playtime 13h 37m Rec Positive Un metroidvania NES style davvero carino, con al suo interno una storia altrettanto interessante e con dei punti per nulla banali e dei colpi di scena non indifferenti, le "poche" boss fight sono tutte eccellenti e portano una varietà davvero grande, sia dalla parte di diversità in se del boss, ma soprattutto di approccio, infatti in alcuni casi mi sono ritrovato a invertire i ruoli, e ad essere quasi il carnefice piuttosto che la vittima. Il finale è scritto davvero bene, visto che comunque lascia spazio al suo sequel che ci rivelerà quello che non abbiamo ancora scoperto. Consiglio
Date 2024-05-13 Playtime 13h 49m Rec Positive Un digne successeur à Super Metroid sur SNES. Axiome verge à sa propre identité avec un lore intriguant et une direction artistique cohérente du début à la fin. Entre Metroid et Giger, que du kiff.  A noter que le jeu aime se jouer de vos attentes en genre de Metroid-like et se montre très original dans son gameplay et ses power-ups ( bigup au glitch gun )  Bref si vous avez aimé Super Metroid, c'est un achat gagnant assuré.
Date 2024-05-12 Playtime 30h 59m Rec Positive One could say it's a love letter to the original Metroid, I'd say it's more like a shameless blow job to Metroid and feels just as good. Tight, polished, nails the desolate atmosphere and the music. Go get it.

Date 2024-05-02 Playtime 19h 16m Rec Positive Pretty good game. Would recommend. The story is interesting, but it leaves me feeling somewhat unsatisfied at the end. The fact that a lot of the context is in journals/notes you have to piece together yourself is kind of cool. But I wish the game didn't hide such an important piece of itself. I shouldn't need to look up a walkthrough to discover the context of the game.  Overall I'd say: plan to play it twice. Once on your own, and then again with a walkthrough to find all the items and whatnot.
Date 2024-05-01 Playtime 0h 44m Rec Negative Чет нет, я так и не понял почему иногда камни бурятся, а иногда нет.  Почему иногда враги восстанавливаются в локации, а иногда нет.  дезигн и музыка на 3 из 5.  враги - летающее и ползающее скучное ничто, для 89 года норм, но в 2010 х выглядит как калл.  Не скажу что прям плохо, но зачем это в 2015 ом? 
Date 2024-04-29 Playtime 27h 19m Rec Positive This game is absolute gold, a great metroidvania.
Date 2024-04-29 Playtime 22h 19m Rec Positive I recommend it only if you're into old retro metroidvanias, because this game carries the whole baggage. That can be good or bad depending on what you're into.  THE GOOD: - It's an amazingly crafted metroidvania by ONE PERSON in 5 years. From the art, the music, and the multi-layered story. I can tell you it's not lacking in polish. - It lacks any obvious hand-holding element that modern metroidvanias tend to have. You're just plunged into this world and you have to figure out where to go next. Personally, I love that. I didn't get lost at anytime, but I can understand if a lot of people may get lost a bit. - Small UX touches have made this game more modern, but still maintain its retro feeling. Like how the first enemy of any type will always drop healing when killed so you are not punished too hard for things you haven't known yet. Or how the beeping sound effect of "in critical health" fades out so it's not getting annoying.  THE BAD: But that same retro feel is the thing that doesn't gel too well for my taste.  - For once, there is NO FAST-TRAVEL in this game, aside from one long corridor that connects everything and a "bus-like" train system. That does get me burned out rather quickly, because traversing the rooms becomes tedious very quickly. For the record, I didn't get the same fatigue when I'm playing Hollow Knight. - Then, the sheer amount of hidden items in this game can quickly make you annoyed if you want to 100% the game. A lot of them are not as obvious as you may think, some even are hidden behind walls you can just walk through if you already know where to look. - Boss fights always feels awkward because your movement abilities are very limited. Plus, the amount of powerup in this game can make every boss VERY EASY or VERY HARD, if you don't know what you're doing. It's honestly frustrating that you've been struggling for half an hour, only to switch to a weapon that beats the boss in 10 seconds. That also includes the final boss.  Overall, I think this game taught me that I wouldn't like retro-style metroidvanias. But it's a high-quality game that you should at least try once. Had the game push a bit more on modern design, like adding fast travel and make the combat more fun, it would be my top favorite metroidvania ever.  EDIT: After playing so many other metroidvanias, I finally figure out what didn't work for me: the movement in this game is just not fun. You're not flinging around or have any agility-tech to get to. It's pure retro metroid along with its limited movement options. Again, that is indeed the goal when the dev make this game, so it's really a matter of taste.  That being said, I would still buy and play Axiom Verge 2 just to explore the lore and worldbuilding again. It's just that good.
Date 2024-04-29 Playtime 8h 1m Rec Positive Una valanga di armi, ho usato la prima per tutto il gioco, forse 21 minuti un'altra, 3 ore iniziali bellissime, poi boh, si perde e perde, punto

Date 2024-04-26 Playtime 2h 5m Rec Negative Нет
Date 2024-04-26 Playtime 12h 53m Rec Positive Engaging mystery-driven story, unique art-style and FANTASTIC soundtrack. The bosses can be a bit boring but they don't take too long to defeat. If you have some time to kill and enjoyed metroid, this game is for you.  Edit: Finished the game and I'll only add that there are some poor choices in game design near the end. The ending is slightly cliche (albeit perhaps not at the time the game was made!) and the placement of the respawn area relative to the optional boss is... unfortunate. Other than those two qualms, this game is great for what it is intended to be.
Date 2024-04-25 Playtime 25h 18m Rec Positive My favorite game of the last 10 years no joke.
Date 2024-04-24 Playtime 3h 47m Rec Positive Très bon Metroidvania. Les graphiques sont vraiment beaux. C'est du rétro très bien fait. Les effets de moniteurs RTC à l'occasion au fil du jeu sont un bel ajout nostalgique.  L'histoire est intriguante et il n'y a pas trop de dialogues pour que ça ralentisse le rythme du jeu.  Je recommande.
Date 2024-04-23 Playtime 15h 4m Rec Positive Очень хотелось бы поставить что-то нейтральное, в районе 6.5/10, а не "советую/не советую", но нельзя.  Достаточно качественная игра, особенно учитывая то, что она сделана одним человеком.  В плюсы можно записать олдфажный (закос под Супер Метроид), интригующий сюжет, приятный визуал. Стоит игра недорого, особенно на скидке.  Однако очень сильно игра раздражает в мелочах. Платформинг вроде кажется неплохим, но потом появляется крюк-кошка, очень короткий, а герой с него регулярно срывается и снова приходится подниматься. При прыжках снизу вверх регулярно ударяешься головой, и герой вместо того, чтобы проскользить дальше по инерции - теряет весь импульс и падает вниз. Трюки типа прыгни по диагонали, запусти прожектайл с жучком, переместись в тело жучка и резко дважды тапни кнопку движения, чтобы переместиться сквозь стену - вообще выводят из себя, когда делать это приходится по 20 раз, заново поднимаясь к месту, откуда прыгаешь, ведь герой просто упорно не хочет слушаться. Дико бесит, чем дальше тем больше. Много врагов, они респавнятся, если сменить два экрана и они жирные. Ковыряй-ковыряй-ковыряй. Очень много оружия - штук 15, зачем? Чтобы через них постоянно мотать в поисках нужного?  Бэктрекинг - вообще отдельная песня. Все скажут - да ведь это основа метроидвании. Я согласен, но не так, как это реализовано здесь. Фасттревела нет ВООБЩЕ. При получении очередной абилки ты просто открываешь карту и не понимаешь куда дальше-то идти с ней. И в итоге бегаешь туда-сюда кругами из одной локации в другую, по уже виденным местами десять раз, убивая этих бесконечных врагов, занимаясь кривым платформингом. Не описать как это бесит.   Ну вы поняли. И вот получается, что вроде всё на месте, а реализация механик очень хромоногая, и само по себе перемещение по миру игры вызывает регулярный бомбаж.   Поэтому и что-то среднее: 6-6.5/10.
Date 2024-04-23 Playtime 16h 36m Rec Positive AVOID | LACKING | MAYBE | WORTHWHILE | [u][b]COMPELLING[/b][/u] | UNMISSABLE  Axiom Verge is an action-adventure metroidvania with a strong focus on exploration. It is WILD to me that this game was made by one person because the quality is super solid. The soundtrack is incredible and really adds to the overall vibe of the game. The story was interesting, but not quite my thing. I suspect for those that like it, it's quite compelling, and for others, it's easy to skip over.  In terms of what could be improved, my suggestions are relatively minor and mostly focused on QOL improvement. There are some non-linear difficulty spikes where one of the hardest enemies in the entire game is like the third type you encounter. I wish you could set reminders for more than two locations. I think there should be more clarity on what certain map indicators mean. While I applaud the reward for exploring, some items are [i]really[/i] obtuse to find (like a random hidden wall in the ceiling that you can break if shot at just the right angle. The sort of thing that's really hard to stumble upon or logic your way into). Pixel graphics aren't really my thing either, but I knew that going in, so I can't hold it against the game.  Otherwise, the music is good, the combat is solid, there's a nice variety of weapons and enemies, there are fun boss fights, there's cool platforming, and you're rewarded for exploring (and if something seems off about a room, it's probably on purpose!).  One playthrough took me ~15.5 hours to complete with 100% items/map. I started in hard mode and changed after an hour given the aforementioned difficulty spike with an early enemy, but I wish I had stuck with it (I had wrongly assumed it was going to increase in difficulty the same way it had up until that point in time, in which case there was no hope lol). I think this game requires a minimum of two playthroughs to get all the achievements, depending on how efficient you are (e.g. a completionist run and a speedrun with minimal items, with at least one of these two runs being on hard mode). I decided to not try to get the remaining 5 achievements I could get with another playthrough.  Overall, for fans of metroidvanias, this game is very likely to delight. For the length, the price seems quite fair even when not on sale.
Date 2024-04-23 Playtime 16h 40m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a cosmic horror metroidvania done right. Highly recommend.
Date 2024-04-22 Playtime 31h 42m Rec Positive A Metroidvania like... Well, all the others that do it right!  There are very few features that I want in this game which are not supplied and frankly, the combat is beautifully implemented.  An epic assortment of weapons, items, lore-items and of course, abilities!  The pixel art style catches you out and to the uninitiated, will seem out-dated or even old... further could be from the truth! The engine runs a far more smooth system that  even processes points of a pixel in terms of accuracy and jump-distance, but always seems to air on the generous (player) side.  I highly recommend this fantastic game and wholeheartedly hope to see more from the developers.
Date 2024-04-22 Playtime 19h 43m Rec Positive Had a lot of fun :) Progression's kinda slow but there's one point when you become god.
Date 2024-04-21 Playtime 10h 40m Rec Positive Great metroidvania by a great fan of Metroid games (he created a gba game rom that is a new character that is playing in Brinstar from Metroid 1). Great variety of weapons enemies world and power ups, and chock full of secrets. You love metroid and metroidvania? go play it now!
Date 2024-04-20 Playtime 9h 31m Rec Negative Um jogo que curti algumas coisas como, um plot twist no meio do jogo mais ou menos. Que não curti, músicas ruins, certos sons bem mais altos que todos os outros ( alguns gritos dos inimigos e quando acertamos um tiro, sons bem mais altos que todo o resto do jogo). Ambientação do jogo, senti estranheza, algo não agradável como metroid. Nem tive vontade de pegar tudo do jogo, zerar já tá bom pra mim, nem vou comprar o 2. Vale comprar com uma boa promoção. NOTA 6/10.
Date 2024-04-20 Playtime 22h 8m Rec Positive Wow, i had this game in my favorites for a long time, once i started to play i cannot stop, it really brings back memories from metroid and other great platform-er games, each new level is a surprise and i can wait to finish this game to start playing the second one.
Date 2024-04-19 Playtime 56h 13m Rec Positive Some of the absolutely wildest worldbuilding and lore outside of really obscure scifi from the sixties. Not only that, but you have to really dig for it, too - as in, actually needing to *interpret text*. Everyone is deceiving everyone else. The distinction between reality and dream breaks down. If you dare to take the implications presented seriously, you're in for some primo abyss-staring
Date 2024-04-18 Playtime 17h 22m Rec Positive There aren't enough Metroidvania's that are like Metroid in my opinion, luckily this one is like Metroid and I enjoyed it a lot. Cool weapons, great level design, has a built in randomizer and speedrun mode and the story is pretty good aswell. Only thing that's a little dissapointing is that in the main story the movement abilities come pretty late which makes traversing the map sometimes feel a little too slow. Apart from that 10/10 experience
Date 2024-04-18 Playtime 11h 51m Rec Positive 메트로베니아 보다는 그냥 메트로이드에 더 가까운 게임
Date 2024-04-15 Playtime 13h 5m Rec Positive Relatively short game that had a lot of really cool ideas that honestly overstayed its welcome. Visually cool, with a story that wasn't easy to follow and aim mechanics straight out of the 90's. Decent game with decent boss fights.
Date 2024-04-13 Playtime 2h 22m Rec Positive Entertaining, set pieces definitely bring the various areas to life. I feel they're a little close together but at the same time people that are a fan of the original metroid games or other platformers from the golden age of 2D consoles will have a good time with it. My only recommendation is to look up the controls outside of the game at first so you don't get stuck in the menus for too long.
Date 2024-04-12 Playtime 9h 7m Rec Positive Metroid if it was good  Only major issue I have is that it can be very hard to tell where you're supposed to go, made worse by the (mostly) absence of fast travel. That can make the game needlessly annoying to tell where to go. Powering through it though revealed a game with excellent mechanics that fleshes out the Metroid-style of Metroidvania better than any other I've seen.  + native linux port is epic, having one for the sequel too even more so. You love to see it.
Date 2024-04-10 Playtime 87h 24m Rec Positive Having played many of the 2D platform Metroid games throughout the years and loved them all, I actually think this is better. I love all the different ways there are to do it, all the different modes, and the huge array of different weapons. I just got my last achievement for this, so the fact that I cored the game out entirely and enjoyed every bit of it is a testament to how good it is.
Date 2024-04-09 Playtime 14h 16m Rec Positive Muy buen juego con excelente historia, buen gameplay y lleno de secretos. Si te gustan los metroidvania este juego te va a encantar.
Date 2024-04-09 Playtime 13h 18m Rec Positive For a solo project, this is fantastic. Axiom Verge tips its hat to DOS platformers of old with its crunchy sound and retro aesthetic, but builds on them with tight controls, an interesting story and a veritable arsenal of novel weapons and upgrades.  That said, it is not without its flaws.  Firstly, this game is crying out for fast travel. If you don't know where you're going (which you often don't, since it's a Metroidvania) then you'll most likely be doing a LOT of backtracking.  Secondly, some of the enemies can be incredibly frustrating to fight. At times - especially in the late-game - there is no obvious counter to an enemy and the game quickly devolves into "find the cheese": how can you get the enemy stuck in such a way that you can hit them without them being able to hit you?  My third gripe is not necessarily a flaw, but... many of the items are so well hidden that they are unlikely to be found by casual players without the use of a walkthrough. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but I came away feeling like I'd missed out on some fun items, and after beating the game I just don't have the motivation to seek them out.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed Axiom Verge and I'd recommend it to any Metroidvania fans out there.
Date 2024-04-09 Playtime 36h 10m Rec Positive Axiom Verge's main inspirations are no secret but it is an excellent departure from its source material in its difficulty, density, and unique style.
Date 2024-04-07 Playtime 16h 37m Rec Positive Most Metroidvanias are much heavier on the -vania part than the Metroid part. This one is as close to Metroid as it can get without the lawyers sharpening their knives. It's not a perfect imitation, there's a lot more verticality in this and the character has a better jump to compensate. The story has a lot more cosmic horror and abandoned technology spookiness than Metroid's lush alien landscapes and destroyed labs. The platforming is tight, the combat is, well, what do you want out of this? I personally found the bosses to be the weakest part of the game, but that's hardly even criticism. They are big fun "shoot the glowy spot" fights that mostly get you amped up for whatever it is you are gonna unlock afterwards. It starts to drag some at the end, but for a game this scale and done by one person it is unmatched in the genre. If the words metroidvania/dimension hopping/half life if the vortigaunts were hellraisers make you interested, you owe yourself the dozen hours this will give you.

Date 2024-03-20 Playtime 7h 57m Rec Negative I don't understand what this game is so praised for, easily one of the worst metroidvanias I've ever played. It's boring, level design is meh, environments are so uninspired, teleport is clunky af, so many guns but most of them are useless and bosses are too easy. Just play Super Metroid.
Date 2024-03-20 Playtime 16h 51m Rec Negative 狗屎一样的操作手感，只有三个角度还设计勾爪，不如直接限制这个游戏只能手柄玩吧，真的是史中史，还有各种恶心人的敌人种类，也没有回血道具，困难难度玩到现在纯属坐牢，我玩渎神都没有这么坐牢，boss也是弱智一样的血量，容错率因为没有回血道具的设计导致很低（尤其是弱智一样的蝎子），很多人说简单我是真的不理解，初见困难模式玩到现在基本纯属坐牢真的恶心得一逼这个勾爪操作手感，还有部分怪物也是真的恶心。我是真的不明白为什么作者不设计回血道具？是想做魂吗？基本上一命要跑到下一个回血存档点初见是基本不可能，但凡这个游戏能给个回血道具提到容错率我都会称这个游戏为神，但很可惜它没有，那它只能是一坨酱香巧克力味道的史

Date 2024-03-16 Playtime 25h 23m Rec Positive No doubt a well-made & fun Metroidvania game, there's just this feeling like, something is keeping it from being an impressive game (still good, just maybe a little bit distance away from great?).  Perhaps it was the enemies design & combat, where even though you could have a lot of different guns (power) with unique projectiles, the best strategy always seems to be shooting the enemies from off-screen, OR behind the wall...*shrug*

Date 2024-02-24 Playtime 6h 11m Rec Negative The game feels too boring to play, and the unlocks, despite their availability, don't provide any new experiences or opportunities for exploration. It's disheartening to invest time and effort into unlocking content, only to find that it doesn't significantly enhance the gameplay or offer fresh challenges.

Date 2024-02-10 Playtime 15h 24m Rec Positive Axiom Verge é um jogo que atraiu minha atenção principalmente por seu estilo "Metroid 1" e a grande variedade de armas. Apesar de não ser perfeito, ele é um ótimo Metroidvania.  Como fã dos gráficos simples do primeiro Metroid, adorei o visual deste jogo. Mesmo usando um estilo "8-bits", Axiom Verge consegue nos trazer um mundo bem alienígena. Assim como os gráficos, o gameplay também é inspirado no Metroid 1, mas com algumas melhorias, como um minimapa, saves automáticos após morrer, e claro, uma maior variedade nos power-ups, especialmente as armas.  Admito que fiquei um pouco desapontado com a seleção de armas; muitas delas são semelhantes demais umas às outras, tanto em dano quanto em alcance. No meu 1º playthrough, eu só cheguei a usar umas 5 das 20+ armas do jogo. Os outros upgrades, por outro lado, são bem legais. Já localizar todos esses power-ups... nem tanto.  A coleta de upgrades é meu único ponto negativo do jogo. Axiom Verge praticamente não te dá quase nenhuma dica de onde eles estão localizados e como achá-los. Isso significa que para achar todos os itens, o jogador terá que usar suas habilidades em absolutamente todos os cantos possíveis do mapa, e mesmo assim, terá dificuldade em obter certos itens, como os que requerem passwords para ser acessados, e... *sigh*... os localizados nos mundos secretos, que estão bem escondidos.  Apesar da frustração que tive em encontrar todos os power-ups, eu gostei muito de Axiom Verge e o recomendo para todos os fãs de Metroidvania. Mas também recomendo que use uma guia se você quiser obter 100% dos itens.

Date 2024-02-05 Playtime 37h 19m Rec Positive I played it once and beat it a few years ago. I picked it up just the other day and played it again on hard mode and ground out a few achievements as well.  The graphics, music, sound, and cut scenes are all on point. A lot of effort was put into the level design in a way that eliminates needless backtracking and exploration on multiple playthroughs as well as facilitates speedrunning. The game mechanics and controls are both familiar and alien in a way that makes the game unique and enhances the overall experience.

Date 2024-01-29 Playtime 13h 15m Rec Positive 思来想去，还是给了这游戏一个差评 首先，公理边缘确实如同评论和很多up主介绍的那样，是一款纯粹的银河城游戏，游戏全程没有引导，玩家探索世界的驱动力在于玩家对这个世界的好奇心，而且游戏也为玩家的这份好奇提供了动力。无论是发现一个又一个新区域的内心欣喜，还是意外发现一个隐藏区域的愉快都充分激发了玩家的探索欲望。 但不幸的是，成也地图，败也地图。游戏虽然探索地图很好玩，但没有提供相对应的跑图手段。游戏全程没有传送，导致在没有引导的情况下你可能要重复走很多很多回头路。游戏没有超冲等手段，冲刺手感非常不好。游戏的探图能力很隐晦，有时候给了你能力却一一种摸棱两可的态度告诉你。比如说游戏中我们会获得一个穿墙能力，介绍是两下右右，正常人也会认为是水平穿墙，结果我获得新能力后发现新图走不动了，然后肯定会以为是要走旧图，又在没有传送的情况下三百六十五里路，最后依然没有找到，看攻略才知道可以上上穿墙？serious?你好歹多提示一下吧。然后获得了一个能够传送到无人机的位置能力，我发现我又卡图了，又往回走了，结果才发现原来要把这个传送当作高跳。诸如此列比比皆是，就好像一般的银河城是A能力探A图。它这是只给你a，你要自己摸索出A=a，令人忍俊不禁。特别是后期，它需要去几个前期图获得能力，但没有任何指引，导致迷路太久了。  boss战更是一坨大粪，全程就3招，有几个boss你还根本达不到它 只能说，银河城可以允许自由探图，但你应该给玩家更高的探图体验。整体而言，游戏优缺点很明显，如果你能忍受上述恶心的部分，它的探图体验确实是满分，但steam只有好坏，站在我个人游玩体验上还是差评。  来自玩完超音的补充，对不起，公理边缘，比起超音要人命的隐藏和傻逼boss战，你还是更亲切一点
Date 2024-01-28 Playtime 160h 17m Rec Positive Axiom verge hits that metroidvania sweet spot for me. It's far less linear than Ori, and lets you actually explore to find items and stumble across new areas rather than shoving a dumb quest marker on your map. I found less than half of the available items, which just goes to show how many weapons you can find and exploit. Unlike other metroidvanias, Axiom Verge doesn't give you the typical double jump and dash--instead in the early game you'll get a glitch gun that allows you to create footholds from thin air and even manipulate enemy AI. Later on, you'll get to launch a robot drone to fit into small spaces, teleport, and walk through walls. The story is pretty good, but I found the final boss to be a little underwhelming. Still, though, everything about the game is super impressive. And even more stunning is that it was all made by ONE PERSON. That's what astounds me--it was all made by one guy who had like eight hours a week to work on it, and yet the art, gameplay, and especially the music are awesome. I can't even begin to describe how good the soundtrack is. Each area's music matches the alien environment perfectly, and it was so good it made me want to revisit areas just to hear the 8-bit melody. Anyone who says Axiom Verge is just a metroid clone or fangame needs therapy. 
Date 2024-01-28 Playtime 18h 35m Rec Positive Beautiful art, fun exploration and upgrades, lots of little lore nuggets to hunt down. Playing this on Steam Deck would have blown H.R. Giger's mind.

Date 2024-01-27 Playtime 29h 20m Rec Positive 雰囲気は古きファミコンのメトロイド、プレイは何と言うか・・普通に戦うだけでなく、集めたバグや裏技で先を進むようなゲーム 装備の力でいけない場所に行ったり（天井に掴まるフック、短距離壁抜けなど）、バグった地形を治すかバグらせて足場にしたり、敵をバグらせて有利な状況にしたり（攻撃が利くようにする、回復アイテムを延々と吐き出させる、足場にするなど）を多用してラスボスへと突き進む その過程で自分がなぜ惑星スードラにいるかという秘密にも触れていくストーリ  ただ道具の使い方を熟知してないと決して行けない場所もあるし、巧妙に隠されて見ただけじゃ何があるかわからん物も多い（ガイドなんかを見ると「これをよく見つけられたな？」というモノがかなりある） 運がかなりいいか、何ができるか知り尽くした人でもないと、１００％を目指すなら攻略ガイドを参照するのは必須かもしれん  まあ装備もだけでなく、武器も使ってて面白いモノも多いから遊んでて楽しいゲーム でも検証と探索に時間をかけず、AからBへと急ぐ人には半分も楽しめないと思われる

Date 2024-01-26 Playtime 13h 19m Rec Positive Very well designed metroidvania with a ton of secrets hidden in this carefully crafted world. I really loved it, even though I was quite lost sometimes.
Date 2024-01-24 Playtime 10h 0m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an experience that defines the normally nebulous "braindance." Where you will be swallowed by a world of monstrous eldritch flesh, rending it apart with alien weaponry, mending it with that same gun. All the while you will feel the delight of a Hippocampus getting rewarded for exploring such a nebulous place. The Occipital Lobe will familiarize itself with the soundscape of the game, between smooth ceilings, sharp edges, unfamiliar chants, and a booming drum. Though, the navigation particularly towards the end of the experience will make you feel like your Amygdala is being prodded by demands of dodging the undodgable, shooting the unhittable, and navigating the wild wrinkles of the brain. If you can overcome that pain point at the end, this is a masterclass successor to Metroid.
Date 2024-01-24 Playtime 12h 39m Rec Positive 很爽，流程设计及其舒适，没有后期疲软，能让人提起探索收集的欲望，除了几个史怪，基本没啥毛病
Date 2024-01-23 Playtime 10h 51m Rec Positive Axiom Verge é um Metroidvania mais inclinado para o estilo de Metroid.  Ele apresenta uma boa variedade de armas, nem todas sejam úteis, ainda assim, são uma adição interessante. Além disso, possui mecânicas bem interessantes, como a habilidade de usar um drone para acessar áreas estreitas e aplicar um "glitch" nos inimigos, o que altera o seu comportamento e que pode deixar o combate mais simples ou mais complicado.  Minha única crítica é o level design. Na minha opinião, achei um pouco confuso, pois muitos cenários não tem tanta diferença entre eles.

Date 2024-01-20 Playtime 11h 12m Rec Positive When it clicks it clicks but goddamn this game has like 30 different weapons and no fast travel. The weapon switching is annoying because I don't remember if I pressed A or Right Joystick to set that weapon and even if I do know which one for some goddamn reason you can also use the Left Joystick to assign a weapon and if the Left Joystick is the weapon you want you can't quick assign it to A or Right Joystick you need to buffer assign the Left one to a different weapon to assign it to the Right one.   A lot of the weapons are dogsh*t too, like you will never use it because it's inaccurate or a pain in the ass to use. Like it's ridiculous the sheer variety there is being absolutely useless in execution.  Also the achievements are fucking annoying fr fr. The exploration becomes a slog. Once you get all the tools you've basically have to slowly maneuver around until you reach areas you have yet to explore but the traversal is genuinely annoying because you have to fight enemies back and forth and frankly this game would've been a lot better if you could fast travel between respawn points because more time is spent retracing your steps than forging new ground. It's ridiculous

Date 2024-01-19 Playtime 31h 57m Rec Positive Really awesome game.  Retro vibe like super metroid.  Interesting story with a cool buildup and awesome ending.  10/10 super glad I bought and played through twice.
Date 2024-01-19 Playtime 14h 31m Rec Positive Firstly, developed by one guy? Absolutely incredible. But good music and interesting story with some odd gameplay choices makes this an average metroidvania.   Sadly, there are issues that prevent this from being a top tier metroidvania. The movement mechanics are a bit clunky and dont feel great. Such as the dash a double tap instead of R1/L1? Having a double tap means you must come off the direction pad and lose all momentum before tapping again and getting the dash. This is awkward. The weapons are weak and basic enemies can kill you meaning often searching areas is a slog.  After slogging around battling the basic enemies, dying, respawning, and retrying, you reward is often an item that is 1/6th of an upgrade. I often used the 2nd out of 10 weapons as they all feel nerfed. Another issue, the map select is in sequential order, not the order it appears on the map. Just another odd choice. These issues lead to a good game that can be slightly more frustrating than it needs to be.   But its not a bad experience and the fact its made by one dude is amazing. Good job to him.
Date 2024-01-18 Playtime 13h 8m Rec Positive Well designed and a very interesting theme, though navigation can be frustrating.

Date 2024-01-16 Playtime 8h 24m Rec Positive pezzaccio
Date 2024-01-11 Playtime 10h 29m Rec Negative The first half of this game is well fleshed. The areas are interestingly crafted, the enemies aren't too easy nor too challenging, and the first bosses are incredible to fight. The first upgrades and weapons you got helped with exploration and enemy control too. The story slowly starts to pick up and the mystery and exploration had me hooked initially...then 5 hours pass and the cracks started to show.   The controls have not aged well. "Yes" and jumping are tied together in the same way "No" and Grapple are also the same button prompt. These things being tied together make it to where you want to do things seemlessly but the controls fight you every now and then on controller. This small thing makes it annoying to set up a controller layout that fits properly. There's no mod for this either which I was able to find to fix this  If you do end up with the basic keyboard, right and left click do not do anything in this game. It's all strictly keyboard based which is a shame as having left click be fire and right be say grapple would let someone be more comfortable in getting used to the controls. Just like above, there are no mods online to help fix this. If there is they're hella hidden that's for sure  Too many weapons you can get aren't needed, nor change combat encounters much. Sure there might be some cool concepts, but enemies all fall easily to your starter guns as efficiently if not quicker. You don't have any real reason to not stick with them. Enemies don't get specific weaknesses to specific guns, so you'll just stick to certain weaponry.   This game relies too much on special upgrades that it quickly clutters up your keyboard space. Some of them don't get much use after getting a new upgrade to replace it. It would have worked better to make some upgrades to pre-existing tools you had  The soundtrack doesn't loop properly which makes it more annoying over time. Some tracks in later areas feel like they needed to be worked on a bit more. Boss encounters all use the same soundtrack too. Would it have hurt to add an extra track or 2 for later bosses?  Bosses later on don't have much variety in their attacks in interesting ways that make you have to move to avoid attacks as much as I feel like they should. This rings especially true to big bosses that feel like they have a whole arsonel to take you down with  There are a ton of things this game DOES do well. The story's simple yet the mystery works. The atmosphere in different areas being absolutely wonderful. The hidden areas, enemy designs, so much of it is well done. It is a shame that these issues bog down the game for me.
Date 2024-01-09 Playtime 2h 9m Rec Positive Super Metroid, with a side of Contra. It is amazing, especially the randomizer mode.
Date 2024-01-07 Playtime 12h 1m Rec Negative Lo que empezó muy bien se vuelve repetitivo, anodino y a veces un poco obtuso. El backtracking es aburrido y tedioso, nunca he echado de menos tanto un sistema de transporte rápido. Porque además el mapa solo puede ser marcado 2 veces, por tanto no puedes ir marcando zonas no explorables con diferentes colores para al menos ahorrarte paseos innecesarios. Hay 5 zonas secretas generadas proceduralmente en cada partida, por tanto pueden estar en cualquier lado, y básicamente para encontrarlas tienes que ir pegando tiros a todas las paredes del juego. Esto tampoco te lo dice, o yo no me he enterado, lo he leído por ahí. Tampoco tienes un indicador de % de mapa explorado para deducir que te quedan cosas por descubrir.  El apartado visual empieza siendo resultón con ese aire Metroid original pero al tercer bioma en el que casi la única diferencia es el color de los bloques y los fondos ya pierde gracia. El diseño de enemigos es poco agraciado, los bichos bola/donut son la tónica en todo el juego, bastante insulsos. Los jefes muy fáciles, nivel que en un par de ellos casi te podías quedar estático y matarlos. Aunque bastante espectaculares visualmente, eso sí, con la cámara alejándose para poder encuadrarlos. Con los efectos sonoros parecido, algunos como el de daño a enemigos o el que recibimos nosotros son bastante poco agraciados. Y especialmente una canción con voz femenina que me ponía de los nervios cada vez que entraba en la zona.  El control en general bien pero el comando para hacer dash poco afortunado, doble tap en una dirección en el dpad. En ciertos puntos donde se necesitaba precisión era horrible, y en el jefe final que es impepinable tener que usarlo para poder dañarlo casi acabo sin dedos.  Una pena, la verdad, hay docenas de metroidvanias de espadazos y dark fantasy y me apetecía uno de disparos, pero me ha parecido que le ha podido más el componente retro (paleta de colores, crudeza en el gameplay) que el hacer un juego divertido de verdad. O es que ha envejecido mal, quién sabe. Dicho esto, para un solo dev que ha hecho todo, trabajazo que hay que reconocer.
Date 2024-01-07 Playtime 19h 28m Rec Positive 类银河战士的佳作。    这款游戏最突出的点是它带给我的探索欲是其他同类作品所无法比拟的。虽然有迷路，也有拿到新能力之后却忘了之前需要能力通过的地方在哪的情况，但这些所有的所有并没有令我感到焦急和枯燥，十小时左右的流程令我满足探索欲望的同时乐在其中。    游戏难度适中，虽然我初见选择的是困难难度，但并没有受苦，boss基本试错一到三次就可以通过。剧情虽然没有优秀到值得夸奖的程度，但堪称合格。加之游戏的bgm十分优秀，得益于此，游戏的气氛烘托相当到位。独具一格的密码机制令人眼前一亮，是加分项。全成就略显繁琐，但游戏本身优秀的表现让人并不会抵触重复游玩。    总体而言是值得尝试的优秀作品。
Date 2024-01-07 Playtime 19h 36m Rec Positive Axiom Verge - это не просто игра, являющаяся духовным наследником серии игр Metroid, это портал, отправляющий игрока в загадочный, запутанный и совершенно недостижимый нашим разумом мир,который интересно исследовать и поглощать всеми рецепторами организма. Пробивающий эмбиент до дрожи цепляет своим гнетущем звучанием. А образы. словно картины Рихарда Гигера, пугают и оставляют в лёгком восхищении. Также поражает тот факт,что это всё создал ОДИН человек. В общем, кто когда-то в детстве любил играть в Metroid, Castlevania и другие подобные метроидвании, тот обязательно оценит. Моя личная оценка: 10/10

Date 2024-01-05 Playtime 17h 25m Rec Positive A NES-era metroidvania from a modern indie studio. As a fan of pixel art this game delivers.  The most unique selling point of this game over others of its kind is the weaponized glitches. Corrupted textures, familiar to anyone that tilted an NES cartridge, can be cleaned up to reveal new paths. Or glitches can be created to create new platforms. Enemies can also be glitched, usually changing their behavior in a way that allows you to navigate them more easily.  I recommend this game for anyone looking for a new metroidvania to play.
Date 2024-01-05 Playtime 43h 54m Rec Positive I never played Metroid when it was first released but I suspect this is what it felt like at the time. I loved every minute of this game. The difficulty ramp was smooth and my terrible reflexes was still able to beat it.

Date 2024-01-02 Playtime 8h 51m Rec Negative I really liked this game at the beginning but after a while the gameplay just became annoying, especially the double tap thing. As someone who loves both Ori and Hollow knight but have not played something like Metroid i thought i would give this a go. + Pixel art + Story + Relatively short + Secret areas to discover + Lots of weapons  +/- Music - Super Spongy enemies at the later stages of the game - Gameplay (Especially platforming later on) - Backtracking across the entire map, eventho its not that big.
Date 2024-01-02 Playtime 32h 47m Rec Positive I got stuck in like 3 places for hours because I didn't have the right abilities to backtrack and I couldn't find the one door I needed to get to so I could progress. It wasn't even a hidden door, I am just braincelln't. After finding that door and getting abilities which allowed me to explore more of the 3 places I was in, I backtracked as far as I could to discover new things in these 3 areas. I got to the one I kept wanting to leave through earlier. I still had no way of going that way. I jumped just as a last ditch effort. Coincidentally, an enemy jumped into me at the same time, PUSHING ME INTO THE AREA I PREVIOUSLY WANTED SO BADLY TO GO BACK THROUGH to escape the hell of 3 regions. So now I was able to backtrack to where I initially came from, the area that led to the 3 areas I was stuck in. I used this opportunity, obviously.  While going back as far as I possibly could, trying to reach the starting region of the game, I noticed a shiny wall. Mostly inconspicuous, just that it looked breakable. I broke this one singular wall in particular. There was nothing. I proceeded to decide to walk into the hole, still with a bit of wall left at the back of it, for no real reason. I then PHASED THROUGH THE WALL at the back of the hole, discovering a secret door.  I discovered this so quickly. It took no time at all. I was stuck for hours trying to find a door that wasn't even hidden. Then proceeded to accidentally find a way out anyways without needing said door to begin with. And then found a HIDDEN door without even intending to find anything. This game makes me feel so stupid. Exactly as stupid as a metroidvania should make you feel. Play it

Date 2023-12-30 Playtime 25h 26m Rec Positive Отличная игра для своего жанра, годный сюжет, играется приятно, местами правда кровь из ушей течёт от саундтрека, но в целом звук хороший. Игра своих денег стоит.
Date 2023-12-30 Playtime 32h 39m Rec Positive Думаю, стоит начать с того, что Axiom Verge - это игра, бюджет которой, по некоторым оценкам, составляют сотня баксов и пачка дошика. Это, впрочем, не помешало ей стать весьма популярной в кругах любителей метроидваний. Я должен признать это весьма впечатляет, как и тот факт, что вся игра была сделана одним человеком. Однако назвать игру лучшей в жанре я не могу. А почему так, сейчас постараюсь объяснить. Проще всего описать эту игру двумя словами "вдохновлена metroid". Для этого достаточно взглянуть на скрины в стиме. Взять хотя бы сюжет. Происходит несчастный случай, а после герой просыпается в неизвестном месте, непонятно где, непонятно когда. Походу игры ты начинаешь получать ответы, однако что мне нравится, так это то, что ты вплоть до конца не будешь уверен, что есть ложь, а что правда, а может вообще всё это - матрица. И даже после прохождения остаётся большое количество вопросов и возможностей для построения теорий. Всё было бы хорошо, но большая часть этого сюжета, или скорее лора подаётся через записки. Проблема в том, что при таком подходе игрок скорее узнает сюжет из видео на youtube, чем из этих записок. Впрочем, это можно списать на вкусовщину, да и как я сказал, итоговый сюжет мне зашёл, и ради него возможно даже стоит покопаться. Атмосфера тут, подстать сюжету, мрачная и, простите мне мои англицизмы, сайфайная.   Как будто бы открыл какую-то антиутопичную научнофантастическую книгу про далёкий космос. Признаться честно, сюжет у меня никогда не был главным, что я ценю в играх, поэтому перейдём к геймплею. Тут у нас метроидвания до мозга костей. Идёшь, идёшь, наткнулся на дверь, идёшь в другую сторону, нашёл ключ, вернулся, открыл дверь, идёшь дальше и так далее. И вот тут моя первая проблема с этой игрой. Потому что геймплей игры в своей основе предатсавляет как раз то, что я описал выше. В других метроидваниях у тебя есть некоторая неленейность, ты сам выбираешь, куда идти и что собирать. А тут всё максимально линейно, от апгрейда к апгрейду с перерывыми на боссов и наворачиванию кругов по всем локациям для сбора доступных усилялок. Реирабельность - это вообще несильная сторона игры, ибо кроме основной игры здесь нет ни дополнительных концовок (кроме расширенной сцены после титров), ни опциональных апгрейдов (ну технически есть 2, но можно считать, что их нет), ни опциональных локаций и боссов. Да, никто не говорит, что метроидвании должны быть реиграбельны, но у этой игры есть штуки 4 ачивки, требующие повторного прохождения, и делать это было не очень интересно. По этой же причине и спидранить эту игру было весьма скучно. К тому же причина отсутствия реиграбелтности - отсутствие большой вариативности, что уже можно считать проблемой. Ну да ладно, давайте о хорошем. Несмотря на то, что все апгрейды собираются строго друг за другом, сами эти апгрейды весьма нетипичны для жанра. Здесь не будет классического рывка, двойного прыжка, хватания за стен и так далее. Большинство апгрейдов неплохо меня так удивили и заставили посмотреть на препятсятвия встреченные ранние с другой стороны. Можно сказать, что они были основным моим источником интереса в этой игре. К слову, под апгрейдами, я имею в виду именно те предметы, которые дают персонажу новые способности. Кроме них, тут также можно собирать стандартные усилялки хп, урона и дальности, упомянутые выше записки и оружие. На последнем остановимся поподробнее. Видов этого оружия тут много, прям очень много. Чуть ли не больше чем видов врагов. И вот с этим количством у меня тоже проблема. Из всех пушек полезные можно по пальцам одной руки (ну в лучшем случае двух) пересчитать. Первые несколько используются, как элемент метроидвании, плюс несколько действительно сильных пушек, а всё остальное не использовалось большую часть прохождения. И получается автор игры просто потратил время и ресурсы бессмысленно. И не сказать, что пушки сделаны на отвали, они все необычны и могли бы иметь свои сценарии применения, но использовать их нет смысла, кроме как ради веселья. Однако если бы у них ещё и применение было, веселья бы меньше не стало. Однако, даже несмотря на то что, большинство предметов были мне не особо интересны (потому что половина из них это пушки и записки), исследовать локации и находить эти предметы было всё ещё интересно. Игра тебе весьма изобретательно намекает, на то, где они лежат. "О, это что моб через стенку прошёл?", "А зачем здесь эти 2 платформы, на них же ничего нет?", "О пачка мобов, которые замурованы в стене, что же с ними делать?" и так далее. Само собой всё не идеально, и тут есть пара секретов, ради которых нужно пройти в рандомную стену, но это скорее исключения. Некоторые штуки у меня получилось достать раньше, чем подразумевалось, уж не знаю, насколько такого было много, но сам факт возможности получения некоторых плюшек за сообразительность радует. Ну и парочка интересных головоломок для сбора отдельных предметов также имеется. Я уже заикнулся о мобах, так что давайте продолжим. Их тут действительно немного. Не сказать, что их прям мало, но могло быть и больше. Сами они в целом не плохи, но какой-то глубины в них нет. А вот будь у них чуть более сложное поведение, можно было бы разные пушки под них подбирать и интересных игровых ситуаций было бы больше. У меня подобный опыт был только в начале игры и в секции с галюнами. Вот это и вправду было интересно, ибо приходилось придумывать стратегию под разных мобов, с сравнительно небольшим арсеналом оружия. Ну а под конец игра натурально ломается при сборе достаточного количества хп и урона, а также нахождении пары имбовых пушек. И это на сложности hard, на normal даже стараться не надо. И даже финальная локация с не очень честными мобами и боссами не спасает положение, ибо ты стираешь их в пыль. Ах да, в этой игре есть. Ну они хороши, с визуальной точки зрения. С точки зрения геймплея, у каждого как правило по две атаки и на этом всё. Хорошо хоть способы убийства варируются от одного к другому. Ну то есть, понятно что во всех надо стрелять, но вот куда стрелять не всегда очевидно. Пару раз пришлось немного посидеть и подумать. Ну что, игра хрень, переоценена, 0 из 10? В этом то и дело, что нет. Потому что это вообщем-то все мои проблемы с этой игрой. Отсутствие челенджа и большой вариативности. Всё остальное, о чём я не говорил, у меня не вызывает вопросов. Ост, дизайн локаций, левел дизайн и так далее. Всё это сделано как минимум неплохо. К тому же я пишу этот отзыв спустя 3 месяца после полного прохождения этой игры, поэтому в памяти в основном остались лишь сильно негативные и сильно позитивные события. И в целом в моё первое прохождение я весьма кайфовал с атмосферы и в целом с метроидвании. Ничего не могу с собой поделать, уж очень люблю этот жанр. Когда-нибудь у меня дойдут руки до сиквела, а пока могу порекомендовать эту игру как минимум ради ознакомления.

Date 2023-12-29 Playtime 9h 10m Rec Positive If you're looking for that perfect Metroidvania game, this is it. Full stop. This game has the aesthetic, audio, game play, and retro feel to be a game from the SNES days.  The weapons you can find are probably the most "modern" part about this title. Mainly just because their functions act in a much more loose/fluid manner than I can recall from all the 2d Metroids that I've played.  This game is worth full price without a doubt.  10/10 A Perfect Game that absolutely should be studied for anyone else making Metroidvania games.

Much more Metroid than Castlevania, meaning exploration is boss and combat sort of exists - the last few bosses are literal upgrades checks. Story is evocative but ultimately about the worldbuilding - expect bread crumbs, not a saga.

Date 2023-12-24 Playtime 17h 12m Rec Positive Как фанату метроидвании мне очень зашло это произведение игрового искусства. Сюжет простой понятный и местами даже оригинальный. Гейплей понятный и вполне легко усваиваемый. Графика для 2Д платформера очень достойная. Очень понравилась адекватная отзывчивость контроллера на персонаже. Я бы сказа, что прям влился в игровой процесс и прям чувствовал каждый прыжок и выстрел. Баланс уровней слегка местами перегружен, но это не придирка, а скорее вариант разбавить игровой процесс. Так же есть рандомайзер и спидран мод, что повышает реиграбельность проекта. Короче если скучаете по платформеру метроидвании эта игра явно вас заинтересует.
Date 2023-12-24 Playtime 6h 4m Rec Positive Feels like I'm playing Metroid on the NES again.  Solid Metroidvania overall, though learns more toward it's roots in design.

Date 2023-12-23 Playtime 11h 57m Rec Positive Excellent metroidvania. I really like the pixel graphics that are somewhere between 8-bit and 16-bit style. The OST is very good.
Date 2023-12-23 Playtime 13h 3m Rec Positive This is one of the few "Metroidvania" games that feels more like Metroid than Castlevania. If you're a fan of Metroid, especially the older games, than I'd highly recommend playing this at some point.
Date 2023-12-22 Playtime 10h 49m Rec Positive приемлемо
Date 2023-12-22 Playtime 46h 51m Rec Positive A great Metroidvania game.  Fun to play and lots of hidden locations and items.  Bosses are not difficult in normal mode.  However if doing hard mode and low % items at the same time , the last three boss could be quite a challenge.  Normally I play platformer with joystick.  This game taught me D-pad could be better.  Double tap direction key is just something I cannot perform reliably with a stick.  Performs perfectly on deck.  The game draw very little battery so could last very long time on deck.     Achievements are reasonable.  I got all in three runs.  First run about 25 hours in normal for 100% maps and items.  Second run hard + low items % which is not recommended.  It’s just unnecessarily difficult.  Last one speed run normal within 2 hours.
Date 2023-12-21 Playtime 16h 59m Rec Positive Jogo maravilhoso em pixel art, metroidvania e tudo mais. Vale a pena!
Date 2023-12-21 Playtime 19h 47m Rec Positive One of my all-time favorite Metroidvanias. The powerups are often very unique, not the typical stuff you'd find in one of these games. But what really sold me less than 5 minutes in was the music. It's one of the only games I've played that genuinely feels.... *ALIEN*. And weird. The music does a great job of this, as does the general atmosphere of the game. This doesn't feel anything remotely resembling earth. Love this game.

Date 2023-12-16 Playtime 13h 15m Rec Positive Was für ein geiles Spiel! Das PC Metroid^^
Date 2023-12-16 Playtime 1h 28m Rec Negative I had a bad experience with this game, which is unfortunate, because I really wanted to enjoy it. Maybe I'll come back to it one day, but I'm not sure I want to anytime soon.  First of all, I booted the game and my controller didn't work. I had to enable Steam Controller Support in the launch settings. Annoying, but I was still optimistic.  The combat is clunky, I think because I don't personally vibe with the old-school-Metroid style gun play. The way my character crouched when I wanted to shoot downwards was annoying; I found myself bunny hopping to circumvent it rather than click LB, which besides being an annoying button also locks your motion, which I didn't want to do. The weapon select is atrocious. It should be a time-slow and a wheel select that selects when you release the stick. The stutter from pausing and unpausing to select my weapon was immersion-breaking as well as difficult to track enemies through.  [spoiler]The first alternate weapon is in my opinion worse than the first one in almost every way as far as I can tell; I think I would like it better if the projectiles were hold-and-release-to-detonate; the press-twice-to-detonate caused me to accidentally detonate earlier or later than I intended to almost every time.[/spoiler]  I did actually like the boss fights and [spoiler]the third weapon[/spoiler], the exploration, and the lore well enough that I was going to play the game all the way through just because...  and then I practically softlocked myself. Totally on accident, not playing in what I felt like was an unreasonable way. My character is stuck between an impassable obstacle and enemies that demolished me. I can't get back to the rest of the map I was playing in before, and I can't go deeper into the new area because I die (died like 4 times) against enemies that I only get to attempt to fight after a tedious gauntlet of also fairly difficult-to-fight enemies.   I don't want to have to use a guide to play a game based on exploration. I'm really annoyed that this happened to me, and while I'm willing to play through the entire 90 minutes I already played to try something different at the other branch from the path I went on, I am so worried that I'll accidentally do the same thing that it's seriously off-putting.  Overall, I'm disappointed. Maybe there is a simple solution to my problem, but a quick google search didn't show any suggestions and I don't think a game should do this to a player; there should be some communication.  I really wanted to like this game. The music is awesome, the textures were solid, the story was interesting, the monsters were cool, and the vibe was great, but there were so many little problems that I'm going to have to put the game down indefinitely until I can muster the courage to try again.
Date 2023-12-15 Playtime 12h 40m Rec Positive Finally picked this up and loved it on my first playthrough. Didn't 100% areas and items yet but I plan on going back to get a taste for all the weapons.  As an old Metroid 2 and Super Metroid player, I was undoubtedly going to make some comparisons on initial playthrough. The initial thing I noticed (or I missed) was the player's immediate X movement. I remember Samus in SM having an acceleration kind of movement which made her feel more robotic and heavy, starting slow and then picking up speed over time. After about 10 min or so, I no longer cared about making comparisons.   A couple nitpicky things I might mention is I wish there was maybe a different color or obvious style between the health and power pickups. They're both red with slightly different art. I also wish Trace's animation while using the grappling hook was a bit smoother as it feels a little janky.  The number of weapons (at least the ones I got) were awesome. The soundtrack was cool. Boss explosions were metal with kibbles flying all over the place.  Overall, really enjoyed this title a lot. Will grab AV2 eventually.
Date 2023-12-15 Playtime 0h 55m Rec Positive Hard to believe there are overwminds who got all 100% achievements in this game. But, from my side, I have to say - for each award of this review I will:  1) buy any DLC for this game 2) get any achieve in this game 3) eat a spoon of mayo  I will choose an option randomly. If a specific needed, please comment on my wall on DM. The game is nice and addictive.

Date 2023-12-14 Playtime 18h 51m Rec Positive Best Metroid like game ever. You can explore and explore this game more and more to find more secrets than you think. When you find a weapon or something else, you will ask before how do you get in that. And with some reading and thinking, you will find a way. I already played this game on psvita but I was too busy to dev some games at that time. After my crew was broken, I fininsh this game on switch and now on steam. Now it's time to see if second opus is the same satisfying way. I really like the dynamic gameplay and mechanics to unlock maps and things, It's a really complete solo dev game and it's really something.

Date 2023-12-12 Playtime 27h 12m Rec Positive 个人主观评分：9/10 冷门但十分优秀的类银河恶魔城游戏，绝对的宝藏游戏。更令人难以置信的是，这样的游戏据说是由一个人独立制作的。奈何本人没文化，只能送作者一句“牛逼”了。  由于我本身就是像素游戏爱好者，那么游戏的美工方面自不必多说，虽然用色和像素运用的风格属于复古风，但是看到大型的boss和npc的时候还是得赞叹一下美工的确是蛮不错的。音乐与各个场景boss战也搭配的很好（可惜boss战貌似我只听出来两首音乐），尤其是个别场景的赛博风音乐配合时不时出现的的回音女声，完美的呈现出了一种生物科技的诡异感（？）  游玩体验方面还是不错的。虽然手柄的个别键位设置总感觉有点变扭（尤其是武器快捷键感觉不太好用）按键调整也比较局限，但是基本上不影响游玩，手感还算丝滑。游戏另一个值得一提的点就是其丰富的隐藏要素，虽然游戏地图在同类型游戏里不算大，但是却塞满了隐藏的可搜集物与装备(即使很多不看攻略根本找不到就是了）。能看出作者的确是用心制作的这款游戏。里面的武器的确很丰富，但实际上大部分连玩具都算不上。。。常用的也就两三把（确信）。游戏的难度曲线也较为合理，我上来直接选的困难难度一直玩到通关也没有遇到什么特别恶心人或者难打的地方，除了疯狂的迷路跑图（悲）。没错，这款游戏不看攻略的话简直对我这种路痴玩家及其不友好，首先不提他的抽象地图界面，单就一点就足以我吐槽一下的。。。那就是这游戏竟然没得传送点（悲），虽然我前面说这游戏地图不算大，但是里面充斥着大量需要在不同地图来回跑，获得新装备再回去通过的设计。这种设计本身还好，但是往往获得了一件拥有新能力的装备，可以通过原来无法通过的地方的时候，却找不到之前被卡住的位置了（悲），只能一点点的从头跑到尾去寻找曾经无法通过的地方。要是游戏能加上快速传送点就好了，这也是我对这个游戏唯一想吐槽的地方了（确信）。  总之这是一款喜欢横版卷轴，像素控不容错过的佳作，虽然冷门但 内容丰富，制作完善且评论区就能找到汉化补丁十分贴心（顺便感谢有人愿意翻译这款游戏）。这游戏的续作似乎比这一代知名度要更高一些（我在网上一搜攻略出来的几乎都是2代），等后面有时间肯定也是要去品鉴一下续作的（确信）。

I personally love the amount of weapons and gadgets and the exploration required to find them all. It's not packed with difficulties, but it has a built in speedrun mode that I enjoyed after my first playthrough. Overall, great work. The sequel is also great and a whole new unique adventure.
Date 2023-12-01 Playtime 19h 27m Rec Positive Los jefes son muy fáciles, al menos en modo normal, supongo que la etiqueta "difícil" aquí en Steam viene por el mismo modo difícil o por lo enrevesado del mapa y lo escondidos que están la mayoría de los objetos y secretos. Algunos enemigos "normales" son más complicados que derrotar a cualquiera de los jefes.  Por lo demás es un metroidvania -más Metroid que Castlevania- bastante bueno que me ha durado casi 20 horas porque soy lerdo y no tengo sentido de la orientación.

Date 2023-12-01 Playtime 12h 32m Rec Positive This is quite a good metroidvania, the power-ups were interesting and unique
Date 2023-12-01 Playtime 22h 11m Rec Positive Literally a classic metroidvania. Art / story S+  High difficulty though, possibly even B.S. difficulty, this game is ONLY for pure metroidvania fans honestly.   Bosses are bad, and enemies / movement are annoying af. You have to be down with it.   Still a fire game.

Date 2023-11-30 Playtime 12h 19m Rec Positive I just finished the game and I just wanna say that the final boss is such a rush compare to all the other bosses(in a good amazing way), there are so many thing happening and you have to try your best to pay attention to all of it while you try to attack the boss.  I love how massive this game is and how massive some NPCs are, you really get to feel small compared to some machines you'll find in here, and the graphics are really pretty to be based on 16 bit-like game.  If you love sci-fi stories like machines taking over the world and multiverse/multidimensional worlds you are probably gonna love this as well.   The soundtrack of this game is amazing, I wish more people got into intense boss music like they used to.  The only thing I want to say is about the controllers there are too many buttons so I suggest you play with a controller and even then you'll find yourself doing some weird movements to press all buttons necessary for some sections, however this is not gonna be a problem for the boss fights only to traverse the map.
Date 2023-11-29 Playtime 14h 42m Rec Positive Great simple metroidvania all done by one dude. Great indie game. Would recommend !
Date 2023-11-29 Playtime 12h 15m Rec Negative Axiom verge - посредственность в красивой обертке. Натыкаясь на эту игру во всех возможных списках "лучших метроидваний", я откладывал ее на на потом, так как люблю больше готический сеттинг, хотя с большоим удовольствием прошел Metroid Fusion и Metroid Zero mission. Разработчик захотел сделать свой метроид, но удалось ему это лишь процентов на 20. Игру есть за что хвалить. Музыка здесь великолепная и атмосферная, темная и холодная. Задорный бит с мрачным звучанием. Внешний вид игры тоже радует - стильный пиксель арт, красивые задники, ничего не режет глаз и не превращается в кашу. Сам игровой мир интересно исследовать, но лишь в самом начале. Потому что автор забыл про такие вещи в метроидвании как прогрессия и разнообразие.   Да, локаций(или биомов) в игре несколько, однако они все плюс минус одинаковые, различие только в музыке и доминирующем цвете. Есть буквально 2 места за всю игру которые отличаются радикально от бесконечных пещеро-коридоров покрытых регенирирующими блоками растениями-патогенами.  Выключи музыку и сложно будет понять где ты, в самом начале игры, или ближе к концу, настолько все одинаковое. А раз все одинаковое, то бэктрекинг, важная часть жанра тоже становится невыносимо скучным. В игре отсутствует любая форма фасттревела, бегать от точки до точки всегда нужно в ручную.  В хорошей метроидвании получение новых способностей и доступ в ранее недоступные области награждает игрока новым опытом как визуальным так и игровым, но не здесь. Потому что помимо однообразных локаций здесь есть еще одна большая беда - враги.  Все враги, ВСЕ абсолютно, это раздражающая летающая хрень, стреляющая каким нибудь лазером. Если оно не летает то оно прыгает. Если оно не прыгает то оно ползет по потолку. Попасть по этим тварям можно, но сложно. Ближе к концу игры, когда эти твари начинают жучить тебя нон стоп, убить их не получив урон самому просто физически невозможно. Доходит до абсурда - перед финальным боссом летают три диско шара которые лупят лазером во всех направлениях, летают по рандомной траектории и убиваются с 10 попаданий. Главная эмоция которую я испытывал за прохождение это раздражение. От очередных жуков, которые стреляют лазером на пол карты, от летающих золотых роботов которые стреляют без остановки, от того что я как игрок полностью беспомощен против этих чертей. Почему? А потому что оружие в игре бесполезный хлам.  К концу игры, если вы внимательно худо бедно все обследовали, у вас в распоряжении будет арсенал из 9+ разных пушек. Но вот беда, из них применимы от силы 3. Остальные - неюзабельный мусор, который вас никогда не пригодится. Хорошо что я нашел спрейган где то в середине игры, как люди проходят с тем из чего реально надо целиться ума не приложу. Более того, даже если вы будете пылесосить карту и собирать все усиления урона, все равно в каждого врага надо будет попасть раз 5-10, роста силы персонажа не ощущаешь вообще.  Апргейды и способности. Про урон уже было сказано, очень слабо влияет на персонажа. Есть еще апгрейд дальности стрельбы и здоровья. Последние два вам пригодятся, чтобы расстреливать нечисть с расстояния и чтобы собирать весь урон который вы физически не можете избежать. Способности в Аксиоме оригинальны, но плохо реализованы Вместо дабл джампа у вас будет просто высокий прыжок. Но его тоже будет мало, поэтому вам дадут дэш по направлению движения, который активируется не на отдельную кнопку, а на двойное нажатие по направлению! НО И ЭТОГО БУДЕТ МАЛО. Еще у вас есть дрон, который запускается на отдельную кнопку. К дрону еще можно будет телепортироваться, и в итоге к концу игры, просто чтобы запрыгнуть на платформу вам придется исполнить вот такую комбинацию - прыжок, на пике прыжка дэш в верх, после дэша, нажать на кнопку запуска дрона( и не дай бог вы его кинете в бок а не в верх, тогда все заново) подождать пока дрон долетит, и потом снова нажать на кнопку телепортации. Это даже звучит как вторая работа. Раз-дра-же-ни-е. Забудьте про мобильность и скорость из Hollow Knight, Bloodstain, здесь у нас оригинальность. Ах да, вместе с этим вас будет жучить очередной летающий дрон.  В игре приятно нарисованные боссы. Сами они не сложные, но интересные. Приятные заставки, их мало но они есть. Сюжет присутствует. Проходить эту игру на 100%  желания у меня не было, поэтому я посмотрел тру эндинг на ютубе и не пожалел, какая же чушь.   Метроидвания это мой любимый жанр, и даже эту вещь я прошел до конца. Но вам не советую В Стиме есть множество куда более приятных представителей жанра. Можете сыграть в это если вы фанат Метроид, и вам срочно нужно что то похожее.

Date 2023-11-28 Playtime 13h 10m Rec Positive 想起来一直没给这款游戏写过评测…… 很喜欢这作的音乐和美术风格（比2代更喜欢），有一些小缺点，但是瑕不掩瑜。 2代刚出的时候在Epic通了，无人机和时空切换的地图设计挺有意思的。 虽然玩这两作的时候都有一种折磨和快乐并存的感觉，但是真的又很爽，，推荐喜欢银河城的朋友玩！
Date 2023-11-28 Playtime 16h 55m Rec Positive Ich habe dieses Spiel mal von einem Freund Empfohlen bekommen und muss sagen dass es sehr Viel Spaß macht und gleichzeitig Sehr interessant von der Story ist. Ich kann es Jedem Empfehlen der auf Herausforderungen und Metroidvanias steht.
Date 2023-11-27 Playtime 4h 48m Rec Negative [h1]Бесконечный бэктрекинг. Ад, которому нет конца [/h1]  Я осознаю. что бэктрекинг является неотъемлемой частью метроидваний, Да, но. Хоть кто-то когда писал отзыв о том, как ему же классно ему было побэктречить по 10 раз туда-сюда, или может был такой отзыв: "че-та мало бэктрекинга было, хочу еще, игра говно". Нет. И не будет. Это паразитная механика. Метроидвания для меня - это много интересных боссов, обследование локаций, секреты. Обычно чем меньше разработчик тратит впустую время игрока - тем игра лучше. Обычно разработчик  понимает, что это одна из самых слабых и душных механик игры, поэтому старается как-то смягчить этот компонент, но не гении из Thomas Happ Games LLC   [h1]В "лучших" традициях Sony [/h1] Прошёл ты в одну сторону, убил условно босса, нашёл на его трупе новую пассивку и фигачишь в другой конец карты на своих двоих. Это так похоже на японских мастеров, которые приложили руку, например, к Horizon, Spider-Man, Days Gone и другие. Всё по классике: огромная карта, открытый мир, квесты на самом дальнем от игрока конце карты. Ну а что? Художники зря старались что-ли? Иди смотри, что нарисовали  А быстрое перемещение между кострами? - Ха, забудьте! Я запрещаю вам перемещаться.  На отметки также положен болт  А если вы еще слепой и тупой, как я, по этой великолепной карте вам придется бегать туда-сюда раза 3, чтобы наконец-то увидеть, куда же всё таки нужно примостить вашу новую пассивку.   Во многом и сам дизайн локаций здесь решает не в пользу игрока, он сам по себе плох и ужасен, все локации на одно лицо, так еще и местами задний фон сливается с платформами, на которую можно запрыгнуть. Я раза три с новой пассивкой пробежал мимо нужной мне локации именной по этой причине. Но всё таки я нашёл это место, получил новую пассивку, все те же самые локации пробежал, но уже 4 раза, не нашёл куда идти, сгорел и дропнул игру.   [h1]Сюжет. Пытка табличкой [/h1] Я хоть сам душнила, но душные игру на дух не переношу. При сюжетном диалоге появляется табличка, где появляются слова главного героя или NPC. И первой же диалог меня чуть сума не свел. Вот появилась табличка, там, условно, одно переложение, я прочитал, нажал на кнопку далее, табличка исчезла, думаю, ну ок, пора идти, нажимаю на стрелочки. Герой стоит. Проходит секунда. Я начинаю нервничать, думаю, может игра зависла? Нажимаю на стрелочки сильнее. Проходит еще секунда. И тут случилось то, что я никак не мог ожидать - появилось еще одно окно с продолжением диалога. Здесь просто нет никаких маркеров конца диалога. Ты уже хочешь бежать и крошить морды инопланетянам, но бац тебе еще окно через 2 секунды. Бесит нереально. И после первой такой трепки мозга сюжет для меня и кончился, так как я вырос на играх с SEGA, где сюжета либо не было вообще, либо он был на английском, а ты еще мелкий звездюк, который еще в школу ходить не начал, так что я всегда ориентировался только на геймплей, а к сюжету относился посредственно, мол нет и нет, а если есть, ну ок  Из плюсом можно отметить разве что:  - интересный дизайн боссов, как никак биотехпанк вышел из моды в тех же 90х и не так часто его увидишь.  - музычка неплохая на фоне  - да и метрошек со стрельбой крайне мало, чаще всего они про мечи и магию  Вывод напрашивается сам собой: Играть в это стоит только по гайду, чтобы вас кто-то водил за ручку и рассказывал куда идти, чтобы не терять время. А если Вы, как и я, не любите, чтобы вас водили за ручку и любите сами исследовать локации - то не стоит на это тратить своё время. Годных метрошек крайне мало, но это тоже не значит, что надо играть во всё подряд. 
Date 2023-11-27 Playtime 18h 16m Rec Positive 公理边缘基本上就是老派密特罗德的感觉。所谓的老派密特罗德，就是融合之前的密特罗德，以三代最为经典。导致到手感、优缺点这方面完全是与老派密特罗德的感觉是一样的。我算是个重度密特罗德爱好者，密特罗德的作品我都基本上玩过而且通了不止一次。有人说这个地图没有引导，其实我觉得密特罗德这一系列的不太需要地图的引导，因为其实前期你看着是很多条路，但往往也只能跟着主路走，别的路都是后期有能力才能探索的。包括空洞、密特罗德都是，往往其实只需要往前走就行了，有很多人说会迷路，真的迷路了吗？还是没有按照主路走？老派密特罗德的玩法就是这样的，融合之前的作品都是没有游戏的引导提示，但说白了就是刚刚开始很多游戏能力没有，就算你看到了有路也没有能力过不去，大体其实也是一条路走到底的。传送也是，我看到有人说没有传送也算缺点，但在我眼中这不算什么缺点，因为玩密特罗德的都习惯了跑图去收集能力的。如果说懒得跑图，那为啥玩银河城啊……直接玩线性游戏它不香吗？说回游戏，这个开发者，我觉得大概也是重度的密特罗德玩家，做出来的东西真的很像啊！但这样做，优点缺点都很明显，有些时候太过复杂的操作很难做，例如游戏的中期，玩家可以拿到闪现的能力，但闪现的操作是按两下想要闪现的方向，例如两下左就是向左闪现，利用闪现能力解决迷题的确很好玩，但是，如果是需要跳的场合，闪现就不太好实现了。多数情况下跳也是有方向的，这会与闪现的键位冲突而导致到不能精准操作。其实吧，要是闪现换了个按键，解决了和起跳时的方向键位冲突就能更好了。优点就是原汁原味的密特罗德而非恶魔城那种RPG设计，缺点上也继承了老派密特罗德，因为这些缺点在老派密特罗德中也有的。本作的OST方面也出色，有些密特罗德一代的感觉，编曲也算是十分精良和优秀了。所以，这玩意推荐那种老派密特罗德的死忠粉去买。一般人从公理边缘入手接触银河城的话，稍微难一些。
Date 2023-11-27 Playtime 96h 35m Rec Positive great game, brings me right back to metroid
Date 2023-11-27 Playtime 16h 40m Rec Positive Highly-polished "metroidvania" style game. Story told thru dialogue/few cutscenes is OK, but the hidden notes tell a spectacularly twisted tale! Gameplay is super tight; you start off feeling like a weakling scientist (which you are), and end up well equipped to deal with anything the game throws at you, especially with all of the pickups. The one nitpick I have is the graphics, they're kind of a weird blend between eight and sixteen bit styling with a corrupted data and scanline effect thrown in for "glitched" areas. Still, I would highly recommend this game to anyone interested in 2d platforming and exploration. Side note: I played the game completely on a controller and I'd recommend you do the same
Date 2023-11-26 Playtime 10h 4m Rec Positive güzel güzel ama artık fiyatı da tuzlu
Date 2023-11-26 Playtime 12h 15m Rec Positive Pros: - Weapons are designed quite nicely, even though many of them only see use once or twice - Power-ups are fun (especially the drone) and spice up how you approach each zone - Controls and game plays well, no issues on my end - Able to damage the environment is a cool twist not commonly used in many metroidvanias  Meh: - Level design isn't bad, but there's not many areas i really enjoyed from an aesthetic point of view - Collectibles exist, but i didn't find that i needed every single one to finish the game - Debatable, but "hard" is actually hard. If you're looking for a metroidvania that leans on the difficult side, this is certainly harder than most, but it isn't the hardest one i've played  Cons: - Enemy design is generally just annoying to deal with, especially the later half of the game - Bosses (on hard) are boring as the best strategy is usually to cheese a mechanic on the fight - Some bosses (SENTINEL) are just horribly designed and had no reason to be in the game. I don't know why in the world you made a boss like that - Final boss was meh, the execution was pretty bad  Overall, i'd give it a 6/10. It's a fun game for a first time, but i don't think this game does anything amazing that warrants playing it over something like hollow knight or blasphemous. That being said, if you've already played those games before and want something new, i would recommend this game.

Date 2023-11-24 Playtime 11h 20m Rec Positive 8.5/10 Axiom Verge has succeeded in creating a very good Metroidvania title with a classic structure by mimicking the classic Metroidvania games. Of course, unlike the best games of this genre, the game has not been able to prevent the repetition of exploring because it becomes difficult to find the main goal at some points. But in other areas such as music, environment design and most importantly gameplay, Axiom Verge has excellent performance just like classic games. These qualities are what make Axiom Verge a good Metroidvania title. +: Designing a good and coherent Metroidvania environment Challenging gameplay thanks to a good variety of weapons and enemies Good soundtracks and well done sound effects Beautiful pixel art Excellent story -: Dashing could have had a better button to make it easier Exploring the game map becomes tedious because of the difficulty in locating the main objective

Date 2023-11-21 Playtime 0h 7m Rec Positive 10/10
Date 2023-11-21 Playtime 10h 57m Rec Positive Very good experience. I hear it's replicated its entire identity from Metroid, but having never played those games I can only say it stands very well on its own. There is a lot to appreciate, although for each great decision there is a baffling one right around the corner. The story seems really interesting, but it's told in a very strange way that makes it feel very boiler-plate sci-fi at first. All movement items work great, except for the grappling hook which is janky, extremely short and never feels smooth or intuitive at any point in the game. The bosses are a mixed bag, but I thought the combat generally complimented the wide variety of weapons (even if I didn't use most of them).  There are just two things about this experience that strike me as unconditionally great. The atmosphere is perfect, with weird music and gorgeous pixel art that creates a brilliant alien world to compliment the lore built into it. The other genius idea is a bit more spoilery, and while it is an early-game spoiler that people discuss a lot I'm still going to warn you that it's a super cool thing to figure out on your own, so don't read ahead if you're already hooked on the game's premise.  Here's the slight spoiler: you get a device that lets you digitally corrupt entities and some tiles on the map. This happens in a video-gamey way that perfectly compliments the graphics while feeling true to the sci-fi genre. Every enemy can be corrupted and there are so many creative ways this is used that I'd feel wrong mentioning any of them here, so just know this is one thing Axiom Verge does incredibly right.

Date 2023-11-08 Playtime 14h 21m Rec Positive Axiom Verge'ün Super Metroid oyunundaki birçok unsuru ödünç aldığını söyleyebiliriz. Sanat stili, bilim kurgu ortamı, harita tasarımı, savaş sistemi, özel yetenekleri vesaire... Hatta odalar arasında geçiş yaparken görülen animasyon bile aynı. Kısacası Super Metroid'i kaynak eser olarak alma seviyesinde benzerlikler görülüyor. Bunun iyi mi kötü mü olduğunu isteyen uzun uzun tartışsın. Ben Super Metroid'i oynamadığım için metroidvania türünü yaratan oyunlardan birinin bir çeşit replikasını oynamaktan keyif aldım. Belki orijinal oyunu oynayanlara manasız gelebilir Axiom Verge.  Fakat bu tartışmanın dışında Axiom Verge'ün büyük bir günahından bahsetmek istiyorum. Oyun Super Metroid'in sadece iyi yanlarını değil kötü yanlarını da kopyalamış. Şimdi çok fevri davranıp Axiom Verge'ü yerden yere vurmak istemiyorum belki de Super Metroid'in  bazı kötü ve eski kalan yanlarını törpüleyip Axiom Verge'ü geliştirmiş olabilirler. Ama bunu yapmış olsalar bile hala o eski oyunların hayvani düzeydeki kriptik yapısını değiştirmediklerine eminim. Metroidvania türüne az çok aşinaysanız bu türün doğası gereği oyun boyunca [i] backtracking'e [/i] başvurmanız gerektiğini bilirsiniz ve bu ön kabul ile girdiğiniz oyunlarda hayal kırıklığı yaşamazsınız. Ben Axiom Verge'ü oynarken "hayal kırıklığı" denecek kadar büyük bir kırılma yaşadım diyemem ama eski görünen ve yeni hissettiren bir oyun beklerken, eski görünen ve eski hissettiren bir oyunla karşılaştığımı söyleyebilirim. Çünkü oyun HER AN [i] backtrack [/i] yapmanızı bekliyor. Bazen bu anlar her zaman can sıkıcı değil hatta eğlenceli olsa bile harita genişledikçe ihtimaller arttığından oyun takibiniz kırılıyor ve kayboluyorsunuz. Bunun sonucunda da oyun deneyimi sekteye uğruyor. Bunlar üst üste geldiyse -pek mümkün- daral gelmesi muhtemel. Böyle durumlarda ben internetten yardım aldım tabii ki. Eğer "ben her şeyi kendim çözerim" takıntılı biri değilseniz siz de yardım alacaksınız seve seve. Bununla alakalı bir derdiniz yoksa ne güzel ama benim var. :)  Akılma Gelen başka kötü yan ise oyunun genel zorluğuyla alakalı. Bu oyun zor, her açıdan zor. Az önce haritada kaybolmanın ne kadar gıcık olduğundan bahsetmiştim ya. Bir de o yol bulma sekansları sırasında sürekli öldüğünüzü düşünün. Ayrı bir gıcık. Eski oyun zorluğu var bu oyunda. Oyun biraz daha merhametli davransa tadında bir zorluk dengesi kurulabilirmiş.  Combat çeşitlimsi, yani seçenek bol ama hepsini ayrı ayrı kullanma gereği duyar mısınız bilmiyorum. Mesela oyunun başında attıktan sonra patlatılabilen bir mermi tipi açıyorsunuz ve birkaç odayı bu özelliği kullanarak geçmeniz gerekiyor. Ama o odalar bittikten sonra o mermiyi bir daha hiç işlevsel olarak kullanmıyorsunuz. Aynı şekilde diğer silahların aksine duvarların arkasından vuran silah ile geçebildiğimiz odalar veya puzzle'lar oyunun devamında yok. Dolayısıyla başta çeşitli gelen silahlar gittikçe anlamını yitiriyor. Hala savaşmak keyifli ama silah seçenekleri "yakından çok mu vurmak istersin, uzaktan az mı?" seviyesine inmiş gibi hissettiriyor.  Boss savaşları gördüğüm kadarıyla oldukça tek düze ve mermi süngeri olarak tasarlanmış. İleride değişir mi bilmem ama şimdilik hiç boss savaşı olmasa belki daha iyi bile olabilirmiş diyorum. İyi olmadığı sürece hiç olmasın daha iyi.  Biliyorum olumlu inceleme bırakmama rağmen oyuna biraz sert girmişim gibi oldu fakat beklentilerinizi ayarlamak adına bilmenizde fayda olan şeyleri söylediğimi düşünüyorum. İşin sonunda oynarken gıcık olduğumdan çok eğlendiğim bir oyun Axiom Verge. Metroidvania sevdalıları buyursun oynasın, türe uzak olanlar daha soft metroidvania'lara hemhal olsunlar Axiom Verge'ün kaçtığı yok zaten.  Dipnot: Oyunu bitirdikten sonra incelememi tekrar gözden geçirdim. Gereksiz gömdüğüm bir kısım olmaması için. Yokmuş, hatta boss fightlar ve silahlar hakkında söylediğim şeyler hakkında daha da gıcığım. Ama oyun hala iyi
Date 2023-11-08 Playtime 71h 40m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvania available.
Date 2023-11-06 Playtime 13h 13m Rec Negative Axiom Verge, created independently by Thomas Happ over many years, is an homage to the games of old, particularly Nintendo's Metroid series. The game is a truly grotesque, avant-garde, dystopian art piece, that would make H.R. Giger smile from ear-to-ear, but as a modern game it falls flat in a few areas, possibly on purpose.  [h1]PROs[/h1] + Incredible Graphics And Environmental Storytelling + Solid Lore (when you find it), a Great Story and a genuinely fascinating word, that kept me playing till the credits + Interesting mechanics (like [spoiler]hacking enemies and the environment, as well as a remote controlled drone[/spoiler]) + Great Music, especially the more experimental, avant-garde tracks really get under your skin + Some Awesome Atmosphere And Horror  [h1]CONs[/h1] - Cryptic and obtuse Secrets - Terribly designed bosses, the first ones are too easy, the latter ones terribly unbalanced, none of them particularly fun, beyond the visual spectacle. - Lore hidden behind layers of obtuse secrets - Some painfully rigid movement controls, and certain abilities - Foreground and background blend in, at times, sometimes intentionally, for secrets, that require the player to hug every wall in the game. - Unfun, annoying enemies (this type gets more plentiful as the game goes on), which make any attempt to backtrack annoying and sluggish (yes – backtracking is a chore in this Metroidvania)  [h1]Review[/h1] Axiom Verge is a love letter to the games of old, or rather an almost complete emulation of them. This comes with issues, as the improvements that have been made to the Metroidvania formula over time are largely absent here. No vague clues as to a couple, final, pesky secrets, the secrets themselves having little to no indication in many instances, with only a fraction of them genuinely making you feel smart and engaging you with the game’s world in any exciting way. Overall, it feels like the game wants to waste your time. It engrosses you into a stellar story, with great graphics and animation and an eclectic array of soundscapes, creatures and environments and game design ideas, only to leave them all gated behind a less than stellar movement system, of precision platforming, with imprecise controls, obtuse secrets, a tiny map and a few stiff or otherwise unimaginative mechanics (like an upgrade that makes your character jump higher). Waking up as Trace and following his journey through what looks like an alternate reality, pixelated H.R. Giger exhibition is incredibly fun, but the game’s peculiar design choices, like locking interesting, in-game notes, which are already hidden obtusely, behind a second hidden decryption key, which is required to uncover two separate alien languages in the game; or bloating the player’s inventory with weapons over half of which they will never use and another half, with some supposedly very useful weapons, not ever being found by players without a chronic wall-hugging fetish, end up making the game feel underwhelming and the annoying achievements are just a cherry on top. I recommend this game for those, like myself, who are open to not finishing a game, or playing something very flawed, and just being along for the ride while reflecting on the game design, visuals, sound and narrative. But for the less reflexive, who simply want a good Metroidvania, I would look elsewhere.  [h3]Thanks To Thomas Happ, For Sharing His Fascinating Vision With The World![/h3]

Good plot, a unique and dense atmosphere, a f*ckton of weapons, interesting mechanics ("corrupting" enemies and environment is the top-notch idea), good graphics (although pretty eye-soring at times), and last, but not least, great music (with some minor exceptions - I'm looking at you, Inexorable).

Date 2023-10-29 Playtime 28h 46m Rec Positive Interesting story, well-developed world, awesome atmosphere, and solid gameplay
Date 2023-10-26 Playtime 19h 29m Rec Positive I love this game
Date 2023-10-21 Playtime 30h 31m Rec Positive After completing many of his game's achievements including speedrun mode and hard mode, I was quite satisfied with this incredibly tight-controlling platform exploration metroid-like game. Coming back to scratch an itch on the first game before going on to the second I was delighted to find more modes of play, a randomizer, and that the game still looks sounds and feels as impressive as it was on launch. 10/10 metroid-like.
Date 2023-10-19 Playtime 47h 58m Rec Positive メトロイドリスペクトのメトロイドヴァニア。マップが凝ってて、シーケンスブレイクポイントや、インディーゲームならではの理不尽な隠し要素も多数ある。ストーリーについては、独自用語が多く理解しづらい(続編で明らかになる要素も多々ある)。独力で制作されたゲームのためか、良くも悪くも作者の癖が強く出ている。BGMが印象的。
Date 2023-10-15 Playtime 20h 12m Rec Positive FUN! Remember: If you get stuck: look at map for doors that you haven't passed. Try not to look for help online because of spoilers.  Fun.
Date 2023-10-13 Playtime 16h 32m Rec Positive If you want metroid you came to the right place. Except this is Axiom Verge, where you will be mystified like you've never been before. You will develope so many questions, and if you go on to play the second, which I highly recommend, you will probably dislike it at first because it plays different, that being said, both are extremely fun to play, movement feels good, and the abilities you get are really cool and fresh. But the story is why you really come here, because this madman has this mapped out for 6 games and the first two give you so much information to chew on while you rack your brain on wtf is going on. Please play both and pay attention to the story unfolding before you. We need more stellar examples of what a true metroidvania is. I would even say the genre should be renamed to something like axiomvania, maybe castleverge lol.
Date 2023-10-13 Playtime 17h 59m Rec Positive This is a great spiritual sequel to the metroid series that does it's own unique spin to it. Highly recommended.
Date 2023-10-11 Playtime 35h 41m Rec Positive I slept on Axiom Verge for years, and I don't know why. This is a phenomenal game. One of the greatest Metroidvanias I've ever played, maybe even the best altogether. Level design is right on, the graphics are perfect, the music [i]bangs[/i], and there's a really cool sci-fi story with a rich lore base tying it all together.
Date 2023-10-09 Playtime 7h 6m Rec Positive hi
Date 2023-10-07 Playtime 12h 22m Rec Positive Esta mas bueno que comer asado un sábado a la noche con birra faso y amigos! O mas o menos eso.  Compralo no seas botón!
Date 2023-10-06 Playtime 23h 57m Rec Positive excelent game!!
Date 2023-10-03 Playtime 164h 17m Rec Positive Good
Date 2023-09-29 Playtime 30h 24m Rec Positive Totally awesome Metroid homage. Excellent graphics and sound, controls are sharp. Very lightweight, start the game and you're in.  None of that game studio logo crap. Stop the game and you're out.  Nice and clean.
Date 2023-09-28 Playtime 29h 12m Rec Positive Супер игра
Date 2023-09-28 Playtime 12h 9m Rec Positive Great almost Geiger-esque art, wonderful music and sound, and just an all around fun game to play. I would be surprised if you didn't think the game was worth the money paid for it.
Date 2023-09-26 Playtime 28h 26m Rec Positive Joa....
Date 2023-09-26 Playtime 14h 36m Rec Positive Solid. A few soft locks, but a good game.
Date 2023-09-25 Playtime 14h 57m Rec Positive Um bom metroidvania, com temática sci-fi com um universo e monstros "tecno-orgânicos", dando um ar sombrio ao jogo. Jogo elaborado por somente uma pessoa, bem polido, movimentação fluida, trilha sonora que caracteriza muito bem o ambiente (exceto a área onde tem uma Yoko Ono gritando sem parar), upgrades inovadores (o raio disruptivo e o drone são sensacionais!), combate simples porém com diversas armas, e uma história mediana (quis inventar muito e acabou ficando meio inexpressivo no final). Zerável entre 5 e 10 horas. Apesar de algumas pequenas falhas, recomendo o jogo pelo esmero do seu criador.  .Prós: - Trilha sonora envolvente (exceto a música da quarta área, onde a Yoko Ono testa seus ouvidos); - Alguns upgrades inovadores. O drone e o raio disruptivo são o DNA do Axiom Verge. Muito divertido; - Duração justa, jogo sem enrolação, zerável facilmente se explorar normalmente, com pouco backtracking; - Movimentação e controle fluidos.  .Contras: - Uma boa parte das armas é fraca, ou só serve para um determinado momento. Perdeu-se muito tempo e level design para obter diversas armas fracas. Deveriam ter focado em upgrades úteis em uma quantidade menor de armas; - História com DNA de Tetsuya Nomura (Squaresoft) do início dos anos 2000: o criador quis complicar além do necessário, que no final ficou desinteressante. Os créditos sobem e você não se simpatiza com os personagens e motivações; - Para quem quer platinar, será muito frustrante, pois tem itens e segredos sem qualquer embasamento, onde a única solução é pesquisar na internet (passwords e mecânicas fora do normal); - Sequência final de chefes (os últimos três) foi meio anti-climático, sem inspiração.
Date 2023-09-24 Playtime 19h 33m Rec Positive one of the best metroidvania.
Date 2023-09-23 Playtime 12h 56m Rec Positive Very great metroid-like game. Great retro arts. Nice progression. Good puzzles for hidden rooms. Got stuck once or twice though. Could have slightly better hints.  Story and settings fits the gritty Contra-like world and character progression.  Perfect to play on the Deck.
Date 2023-09-23 Playtime 32h 44m Rec Positive 一个人开发的游戏能有这个体量，相当不错了。
Date 2023-09-20 Playtime 14h 0m Rec Positive Correte Scorn, que están H.R. Gigeando.    Considerando que fue hecho por 1 persona, SIN DUDA es una obra maestra audiovisual. La escala y la calidad de los sprites 8-bit es única y la historia te engancha de principio a fin. El OST pega perfecto con el ambiente alien, con el que se puede interactuar de varias maneras al igual que los enemigos.  El gameplay es muy similar a los Metroid retro, aunque sin viaje rápido y con mas habilidades e items. Nadie lee las reviews largas así que redondeando diría que rasca el 4.5/5 FÁCIL.  
Date 2023-09-16 Playtime 5h 46m Rec Positive Amazing art direction and gameplay for a single dev. Love how you can find so many weapons in a single playthrough. Well worth playing if you like Metroid.
Date 2023-09-16 Playtime 10h 34m Rec Positive A nice metroidvania with a lot of fumbling around for next upgrade lol. The story is told quite concisely, but reading notes (which is very hard to find) will give you the overall lore and secrets of this world. Looking forward to playing Axiom Verge 2 next for both new gameplay and more lores.
Date 2023-09-14 Playtime 9h 9m Rec Positive 8.5/10
Date 2023-09-13 Playtime 9h 54m Rec Positive A heavily flawed, modern classic.  Pros: +++ Very art, good variety of music. Feels like a truthfully alien world [Thanks Geiger] +++ LOTS of weapons and abilities ++ When you are progressing at a decent pace you are ALWAYS finding something + Intriguing story even if it doesn't feel like it's the focal point at all +++ Retro to the bone. It feels like it's ripped straight out of a SNES  Cons: --- Controls feel particularly bad. Double tap to teleport which makes teleporting mid jump feel like a trial of attrition and not a thing you purposefully do. You also spend so much of this game MASHING the X button to fire when most enemies can take 5+ hits to kill, meaning you can and will get a sore thumb, or worse, playing this. Why you can't just HOLD with practically all the weapons is beyond me, given that only ONE of the weapons has an alternate action when you push fire mid travel. - Sound effects, in particular, are very grating to the player's ears and can get extremely repetitive - World layout needs work in consistency as what you CAN hack and what you CAN'T feels like guesswork, blocks you CAN mine are also look the same as blocks you CAN'T. This alone can massively hinder your progress and makes the game come to a literal crawl as you inch around trying to hack the one piece of geometry that you need to turn from this into that. [Pink lava can be hacked btw, but only the one, in the one place you can't go forward in. Trust me, tis dumb] - Many of the weapon are bad. Weapon #9 is just straight up an autoaim, autofire weapon which is the only weapon I've been using since I got it, since every other weapon is a literal chore to use, and prior to that it was the weapon that would just hit everything on screen via green lightning cause having to finagle the protag into the RIGHT spot so I can shoot an enemy felt like crap. - Generic enemies are typically  harder than bosses and put in some of the worst spaces with little to no cooldown on their attacks, making most encounters feel like you're just trading hits with zero thought into what you are actually doing. - There's a LOT of pickups that feel like they don't do enough or you can't quantify whether picking them up even matters.  Overall I thought the game is really good, it's just that the pain points just hit worse and worse the longer you play the game. In a metroidvania, if I have to backtrack, I should at least feel power when going backwards but because of how annoying the enemies are it always feels awful.
Date 2023-09-12 Playtime 15h 5m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a gem, which I'm revisiting after my initial play through on the Nintendo Switch, and during my play through of the sequel. This game falls under the genre of Metroidvania, but the deck is heavily sided on the Metroid side of that equation. There's a lot of spirit of the original NES Metroid, and it draws heavily from the same inspiration like Aliens and H.R. Giger, which gives the game a very ominous setting.  One of my favorite aspects of Axiom Verge is the diagetic use of NES glitches that are intentional, and show the world of Sudra in a corrupted and broken/apart place. Moreover, if you want a game with Lore, this game has it. I'm surprised (as of the time of this review) there aren't more lore diving videos on Youtube on this game, as it questions the philosophical concepts of self-evident truth and what we actually perceive as reality.  My minor quibbles with the game is that one of the later abilities requires double tapping the direction to use. When I get that far, I'm going to try using Steam's overlay to see if I can make that input easier on myself. Also, while there is a large selection of weapons that you can find in the world, the main Axiom Distrupter and the Kelvar weapons are by-and-far the best weapons (maybe the laser too...)  I recommend this game, especially if you like Metroid. I will give one caution, this is the kind of Metroidvania game that expects for you to get lost, so if you get frustrated when you are lost, follow a guide.
Date 2023-09-12 Playtime 11h 22m Rec Positive Really nice atmosphere and fun gameplay. Amazing soundtrack! Enemies attack mechanics is a bit boring, especially when it comes to bosses.
Date 2023-09-11 Playtime 8h 46m Rec Negative Why did this guy think that binding the dash to a double tap is a good idea?
Date 2023-09-09 Playtime 0h 38m Rec Negative this game has worst control, I regret buying this
Date 2023-09-07 Playtime 11h 53m Rec Positive Pretty good metroidvania. Good music and fun weapons.
Date 2023-09-07 Playtime 17h 23m Rec Positive sublime
Date 2023-09-07 Playtime 21h 17m Rec Positive Acid. Drugs. Lack of Wall Chicken. These were the ingredients chosen to create a game that I still have yet to understand.
Date 2023-09-06 Playtime 24h 32m Rec Positive Just finished my first playthrough. I liked it enough that I'll buy the sequel if I can get it on sale.  Overall, it's a worthwhile experience if you like Metroidvanias. The world isn't engrossing like Symphony of the Night or Hollow Knight, and the level design isn't as tight as Super Metroid or even Batbarian, but it's still a good game for fans of the genre. If you don't like the genre, it's probably not for you.  Pros: + Well-made game + Tight controls + Neat extra features that increase the replay value + Interesting plot, and the cutscenes never last too long. + Some super-cool choices for power-ups -- subverted my expectations  Cons: - Cheap deaths in the early game due to enemy placement + minimal enemy attack "telegraphing" - No fast travel hurts the game's pacing at times - More than most Metroidvanias I've played, it's really, really hard to distinguish between "I don't have the required power-up to obtain the item" and "I haven't found the bomb-able wall yet". - Aesthetic feels a little bit sterile - Idk why but the main character's mutton-chop sideburns just make me uncomfortable
Date 2023-09-06 Playtime 15h 19m Rec Positive One of the truest love letters to classic Metroid I've ever played. I get the hype. It's quite a wonderful game, despite being just a tad too short.
Date 2023-09-02 Playtime 14h 11m Rec Positive I binged this whilst staying home with covid - resulted in some pretty weird fever dreams. In all seriousness, a very fun metroidvania - feels similar to super metroid, but with enough difference to be worth playing. Pleasantly mysterious, with lots of secrets and hidden details, letting you piece together the lore and story as you play. Excellent visuals and sound design, with an annoyingly catchy soundtrack.
Date 2023-09-02 Playtime 9h 44m Rec Positive Bom jogo, só é chato não ter uma forma de transporte rápido, varias vezes quis largar só de pensar em andar td o mapa novamento. Fora isso, é mt divertido
Date 2023-08-30 Playtime 7h 57m Rec Positive classic
Date 2023-08-30 Playtime 8h 0m Rec Positive Solid metroidvania. Captures a lot of what made super metroid and similar titles great, with some polish to make it stand up in the modern day. If you enjoy any of the 2D metroids you'll likely enjoy this as well.  Gameplay and exploration is solid. Aesthetic is well done. Sound and music are good as well, except for a couple of tracks.  However, I have a few critiques: that there are a few points where its very unclear as to how to progress, and a lot of the weapons you unlock feel underwhelming and marginal compared to already unlocked weapons, also the platforming with mobility upgrades can take a bit of getting used to.
Date 2023-08-29 Playtime 17h 17m Rec Positive This game reminds me of playing Super Metroid on the Super Nintendo as a child so much and I love it! The weapons are fun to experiment with and the boss fights have made me want to play the game even more!
Date 2023-08-28 Playtime 17h 16m Rec Positive Es chido. tiene mi total aprobación. el diseño de sus jefes son muy espectaculares. 
Date 2023-08-26 Playtime 17h 1m Rec Positive Vale a pena, principalmente se você curte os Metroids mais clássicos.
Date 2023-08-20 Playtime 21h 15m Rec Positive As the personification of Metroidvanias in general I must say this game was pretty good Not like a big immediate recommend but a pretty cool Metroidvania all around  I give this game 2 Circle of the Moons/Order of Ecclesia
Date 2023-08-20 Playtime 0h 59m Rec Negative This game was disappointing given the hype. I'm abandoning it after only an hour because so far everything has been boring, uninspired, and/or frustrating. I've only died once- it's not a challenge issue. The music and sound is grating, and the environments and enemies so far just feel like a mish-mash of retreaded ideas. Two of the early weapons seem worthless except to unlock more areas, and every single area is a dead end that either needs a jumping or other movement upgrade (why have I found five weapons and no movement upgrades?) or is arbitrarily corrupted and impassable at this time. Just dead ends everywhere. The game lets you mark exactly two spots on the map- why bother? either let me take unlimited notes or don't bother, two markers is an insult. Just lots of signs that there's no artistry to the game design. Things like "the destroyable blocks look the same as the non-destroyable blocks" existed in old games to artificially up the difficulty and replay length, they aren't actually good design. This game feels like all the rote parts of Metroid with none of the fun.
Date 2023-08-19 Playtime 22h 56m Rec Positive Stunning, fantastic, and commendable.  It has been a long time since last I "100%"ed a game.  This is such a delightful action and exploration experience, made all the better because the creator was not afraid to add creative content just for the sake of trying it out: perfectionists may find some of the weapon choices to be redundant and without special contribution to gameplay, but I hardly cared when their addition meant I got to see something that I wouldn't see anywhere else.
Date 2023-08-17 Playtime 20h 46m Rec Positive Fantastic Metroidvania with items that alter the gameplay more radically than I've ever seen in similar games. Also the whole retro biomechanical horror vibe is on point!
Date 2023-08-16 Playtime 20h 37m Rec Positive 広大なマップを探索するのが楽しいゲーム。 BGMも中毒性がある。
Date 2023-08-15 Playtime 15h 31m Rec Positive Great music, intriguing story Interesting metroidvania items
Date 2023-08-13 Playtime 18h 36m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a cool 8-bit style metroidvania with a lot of unique weapons and abilities. It takes place on an alien world; however, most areas look too generic for my taste. While the pixelated graphics aren’t bad, I’m not a huge fan. The enemies and bosses are varied enough while still feeling alien. The story is nothing special but gets the job done. The soundtrack was also alright, with only a few memorable tracks. What the game does really well, though, is implementing the metroidvania elements. Gameplay is inspired by Metroid, with a focus on gunplay. And there’re a ton of unique guns to find. Some are better than others, but trying them out and choosing the ones to use is part of the fun. Although most are optional and not required to progress, they have a ton of variety. Ability upgrades are what you need to find to progress, and they’re also fun and unique to use. Also, a lot of them can be used offensively and even benefit from weapon buffs. The game encourages exploration, with a classic tile mini-map to help. There’re a lot of optional items to find, some more obvious, some well hidden. Some are upgrades, but there’re also notes that contain extra lore. There’re no indicators to where to go next, so you need to explore and take notes of obvious gatekeeps. There’s no fast travel, but there’s an area in the middle of the map that connects most zones. The map layout seems well-designed, with a good balance between immediately accessible items and gatekeeping. There’re also small indicators if you collected all items in an area or uncovered the entire map of that area, which are nice touches. On top of that, there’re 5 hidden mini-zones, with randomized entrances and layouts. They contain some extra items, including an extra weapon, although they’re not required for 100% completion. But they’re a nice touch and should be mentioned. The game isn’t too hard, but you’ll die a few times. It also depends on your exploration and the number of weapons and upgrades you find. There’re some additional achievements for beating the game under extra conditions, but they’re doable with guides. It also includes some in-game leaderboards and extra modes, like randomized items. While the game doesn’t bring anything new to the table, it’s a solid metroidvania experience, building on what this genre does best. A good recommendation on sale, and a must-buy for fans of the genre.
Date 2023-08-11 Playtime 17h 5m Rec Positive Bought on sale.  + 2D Metroidvania + Large range of weapons + Excellent story  - Underwhelming last bosses  Final Note: 8/10  A gem in the world of Metroidvania, Axiom Verge is what you would like in that kind of games. Each weapon and ability you find opens new doors to the world and each weapon is not only upgradeable, but also powerful in the right situation. The two las bosses are sadly a simple DPS rush that feel a bit underwhelming next to the reste of the fights, but they are a good conclusion to the story overall.
Date 2023-08-11 Playtime 13h 17m Rec Positive Опять потерялся и дропнул
Date 2023-08-06 Playtime 10h 43m Rec Positive GOOD
Date 2023-08-06 Playtime 22h 38m Rec Positive 整體遊戲滿不錯, 用特殊武器改變敵人性質, 我覺得不錯.  BOSS 敵一般, 由於武器眾多, 對特定BOSS 可以無腦戰勝, 事後有點空虛.
Date 2023-08-05 Playtime 17h 57m Rec Positive 10/10  Metroid like game that's awesome, just buy it.
Date 2023-08-03 Playtime 13h 25m Rec Positive Great game, fun to play and quite odd :)
Date 2023-08-01 Playtime 24h 47m Rec Positive Buy. Now.
Date 2023-07-30 Playtime 10h 42m Rec Negative It's gameplay is great it deserves the hype, but not for me
Date 2023-07-30 Playtime 14h 2m Rec Positive great game
Date 2023-07-29 Playtime 27h 23m Rec Positive Whoever likes metroidvanias will immediately feel like home!
Date 2023-07-28 Playtime 24h 17m Rec Positive Finally, Another metroidvania game that I could get into.  I have always been keen on the open world-ness of Super Metroid and the story of the later Castlevanias.  Axiom Verge combines both with amazing visuals and hypnotizing sound tracks.  A knock out of the park for Mr. Happ and company.  I liked it so much I had to get Axiom Verge 2.
Date 2023-07-28 Playtime 18h 8m Rec Positive !
Date 2023-07-27 Playtime 27h 41m Rec Positive <3 - Super game.   So many fun weapons, exploration never felt like a chore or overly annoying. Straight up wonderful game design.    
Date 2023-07-27 Playtime 9h 22m Rec Positive Boppin' soundtrack and sick alien-weaponry
Date 2023-07-26 Playtime 13h 29m Rec Positive A great Metroid homage. Awesome aesthetics, AMAZING music, alluring shortish-story. Took me 9 1/2 hours to beat on normal; 80% map discovery,  around 75% items found (remaining items are story items/notes).  Criticisms: Uninspired boss fight mechanics. One particular boss fight toward the end seemed more inspired if not a little cheap; a big spike in difficulty that may be unenjoyable for some.
Date 2023-07-26 Playtime 11h 56m Rec Positive What a genuinely outstanding game. Easily places in my top 5 metroidvanias
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 20h 4m Rec Positive Its like classic Metroid. The puzzles are awfully esoteric, but not impossible, I ended up using a walk through during the second half just to keep things straight and love the selections of weapons. Many of them very usefull, and the ones I did not use a lot I could see other people enjoying. I bet the Randomizer mode is really something with the amount of random weapons available. just look up the codes once you get the code machine, as some of the codes are impossible to remember or read.
Date 2023-07-25 Playtime 2h 43m Rec Negative Game looks very metroid, but it didn't really hook me. It doesn't feel like metroid, and its more of its own thing. If you're into Metroidvania then you'll probably enjoy it.
Date 2023-07-23 Playtime 13h 43m Rec Positive O melhor metroidvania indie existente
Date 2023-07-22 Playtime 18h 57m Rec Positive voto 8 - gameplay 9 - personaggi 7 - storia 7 - ambientazioni 8
Date 2023-07-20 Playtime 3h 24m Rec Positive 知道这游戏大名但是因为没有中文一直没想玩，我甚至以为我早都买了，搞到汉化补丁寻思下载玩一下发现我没有买，且这游戏居然出第二部了，一起买下来玩玩，好家伙，太对味了，这银河战士味比那个《洞穴物语》和《兔子必须死》还浓。这不比银河战士生存恐惧好玩
Date 2023-07-19 Playtime 33h 21m Rec Positive Fun, totally addictive game. Very enjoyable, not to hard but not too easy either, it was a good game. I put close to 35 hours of my life into it and when you factor in how affordable this game is you cant go wrong. I'm glad i played it, i love the retro throwback vibes. Looking forward to playing Axiom Verge 2
Date 2023-07-19 Playtime 29h 54m Rec Positive Pensei bastante se deveria recomendar este jogo. Axiom Verge é estranho. A história é esquisita e ele tem essa atmosfera que não se decide se está homenageando Super Metroid ou o Metroid do NES. Demorei a engajar. Na verdade, eu testei o jogo anos atrás quando comprei e só voltei agora, porque não tinha nada melhor para jogar na minha humilde biblioteca. Acabou que caí de cabeça nessa estranheza e acabei gostando consideravelmente. Ainda assim, preciso que colocar um grande asterisco nessa recomendação porque teve um momento da minha primeira run que eu fiquei perdidaço pelo mapa, eu, cara que fez 100% das conquistas de Hollow Knight, Blasphemous e afins; eu, que, por óbvio, já tem intimidade com o gênero. Isso pode lhes ser um grande revés quando forem jogar Axiom Verge, isso se eu só não panguei especificamente nesse jogo. No final, acabei usando um guia e cheguei no final do jogo de boa (apesar de odiar ter que fazer isso). Mas vou falar alguns pontos positivos aqui também, afinal, estou recomendando o jogo: 1 - os controles são ótimos. 2 - a variedade de armas é absurda de grande 3 - tem uma curva de aprendizado muito bacana 4 - ele fica bem desafiador da metade pra cima 5 - trilha sonora muito boa 6 - mapa grande 7 - segredinhos canalhas que tu jamais imaginaria que estaria onde está  Axiom Verge é um jogo que a maioria dos aficcionados por metroidvania vai gostar. EU achei esquisito. Mas isso tem muito mais a ver comigo. Além do mais, cheguei a conclusão de que os jogos esquisitos também precisam existir. Nem tudo é descolado e style. O weird também tem seu charme.  OBS:. eu fiz 100% desse jogo também. É o que me ajudou a engajar com mais mais vontade no jogo. Passei um sufoquinho com os achievements de speedrun e no death run, mas é possível fazer, caso se interessem. Espero que curtam. Valeu.
Date 2023-07-17 Playtime 12h 52m Rec Positive This is a great game. I've never played a game with such a focus on this type of movement. It made for a very unique experience, and a very good one.
Date 2023-07-17 Playtime 11h 54m Rec Positive I am 8 hours into the game at the time i am writing this review and I must say I am more than happy to have bought this game. Visuals are just gorgeous. sfxs are nice, and the gameplay is very engaging.  It kept me hooked for far longer than i expected given that i am very short on sleep. My biggest gripe w the game so far is the lack of fast traveling, which I have found none at this point. That and the inability to use a certain ability as a macro. I hate double tapping directions while trying to aim where I wanna go. The game feels very well paced, and the powerups found are mostly great. I would highly recommend this game to any metroidvania fan in a heart beat.
Date 2023-07-16 Playtime 25h 36m Rec Positive Un jeu pour que tu te retrouves dans ton lit a te demander si tu vas pas te transformer en insecte mutant au réveil du jour suivant
Date 2023-07-15 Playtime 14h 44m Rec Positive Après 8 années de retard je me suis dis : "Faut le tester !" Du coup Axiom Verge, que dire... Et bien Pour un Métroidvania en pixel art très chouette rappelant l'époque de la NES on est sur un bon jeu même si quelques trucs m'ont fait péter un câble comme le fait de ne pas pouvoir se tp ou encore la carte que je trouve très mal fichue MAIS on rappelle qu'il est sorti 2 ans avant Hollow Knight qui est aujourd’hui une référence en terme de metroidvania. En ce qui concerne la musique c'est très cool même si certaines OST sont étonnante au vu de l'ambiance générale (ce qui n'enlève rien à la qualité de l'OST) En bref si vous avez envie d'un metroidvania avec une difficulté bien doser (meilleur point selon moi) et bien Axiom Verge est pas plus mal qu'un autre ! Je ne peux vous le conseiller ;) Je vous laisse sur ces belles paroles et qui sait Peut être nous reverrons nous quelque part entre Sudra et la Brèche !
Date 2023-07-15 Playtime 11h 56m Rec Positive Axiom Verge, developed by Thomas Happ Games, is a breathtaking and meticulously crafted metroidvania game that pays homage to the classic titles of the genre while delivering a unique and mind-bending experience.

Date 2023-07-13 Playtime 21h 29m Rec Positive EDIT 31/05/2024 Ok, I was goddamn wrong. In the end I did give it yet another try and found out I used to stuck at this game and that was the reason I couldn't get its potential.  This time I fully enjoyed it and can confirm all the enthusiastic reviews I read here and there.  I played it in my Steam Deck which I honestly think is the best way since it gives you that feeling of a dear old portable platform game.  I'm gonna play the sequel ASAP!     I gave more than one try to this game, which I really wanted to like. After 7 hours of total fun-free playing I think I can give it up and not come back. Sometimes I forget it's the game that should captivate me and no me trying hard to appreciate something I simply can't.  So, what's the problem here? The game is just not rewarding; the art and soundtrack are beautiful but when I play a game I would like it to be engaging, to experience some kind of satisfaction when going to the next room; here everything is so completely random you can't even feel the progress, even the abilities can or cannot work following an obscure logic so you end up repeating and trial-and-erroring every 20 steps and thanks no thanks.

Date 2023-07-11 Playtime 9h 29m Rec Positive My playtime doesn't seem like much but I played it already on the Switch when it had just released.  I enjoyed this game a lot, it's the game that got me into 2D Metroidvanias. I love the second game even more but I think this one's very good already.
Date 2023-07-10 Playtime 9h 32m Rec Positive コアなアクションゲーマー向け。 昭和後期～平成初期のような世代のメトロイドヴァニア系が好きならおすすめ。 そのためアクションが増えて探索できる幅が広がり、新たなアイテムを見つけたり行ける場所が増える、という点は楽しいが、悪く言えば利便性において不親切で面倒に感じる部分もある。 ただ値段分は楽しめることは間違いない。
Date 2023-07-10 Playtime 12h 11m Rec Positive This game reminds me of my childhood and I love it. I've already started the second game and it is even better than the first, but they are unique in their own way and playing the first game gives you more appreciation and understanding for the second. The mechanics work really well together in both games. There is a nice challenge with puzzles, fighting, platforming and using a map.

Date 2023-07-07 Playtime 160h 42m Rec Positive Danke Thomas Happ für dieses tolle Spiel. Kaum zu glauben, dass das ein Ein-Mann-Projekt ist. Sie sind ein kleines Genie. Für mich als "Metroid Fan" ein ganz großartiges Spiel, in welchem man die Liebe in jedem Pixel spürt.   Wir haben sogar als Kinder in der Schule mal ein Metroid Brettspiel entwickelt. Schade, dass ich mich daran so wenig erinnern kann, wie wir es damals aufgebaut haben.   Auf jeden Fall hat dieses Spiel tolle Gegner, das Setting weiß zu gefallen, ebenso die Geheimnisse, Waffen etc. und auch die Musik passt in jedem Gebiet. Und dann ja sogar noch die Möglichkeit es direkt im Spiel zu "Speedrunnen" und zu "Randomizen". Für mich hätte es das Spiel durchaus noch bisschen länger sein können, aber zum "Speedrunnen" hat es denke ich genau die richtige Größe bzw. Umfang.   Ich werde es garantiert noch zehn Mal (+) durchspielen. Schade ist eigentlich nur, dass der zweite Teil in so eine komplett andere Richtung geht und das Kampfsystem dort eine große Schwäche ist, sonst hätte ich den zweiten Teil auch gleich noch mit rauf und runtergespielt. Ich hoffe, dass da nochmal ein dritter Teil kommt, der mehr wird wie der Erste.
Date 2023-07-05 Playtime 1h 24m Rec Negative great art and music hindered by slavishly retro gameplay. the bosses take too long, also falls into the classic metroidvania trap of did you miss something? yes. are you doing it wrong? also yes. the fact that i bought this twice and returned it twice should tell you plenty about the lasting impression this game made on me which is utterly forgettable.

Date 2023-07-04 Playtime 26h 33m Rec Positive Un Metroid como la copa de un pino. Es un juego sólido de principio a fin, con un trasfondo muy intrigante y misterioso. El backtracking está bastante bien y consigue engancharte hasta el final. La banda sonora es una pasada. Como punto criticable, hay una variedad enorme de armas, pero terminas usando realmente pocas.  Lo considero un must-have para amantes de Metroid.

Date 2023-06-25 Playtime 13h 8m Rec Positive Late review, but a fantastic Metroidvania game.
Date 2023-06-21 Playtime 12h 16m Rec Positive rly cool stuff ! definitely better at channeling the Unknowable Alien Semi-Lovecraftian vibes in the actual play then in the writing...i didnt have much patience for the way the protagonist's Normal Dude-ness was expressed thru early 2010s type quips tho at least those phase out. and rly the whole thing is carried v well by not only the atmosphere and map design, but also the fact that this is one of the only indie metroidvanias ive played where i had Genuinely No Idea what kind of abilities i was gonna unlock...rly rly admirable for that alone, the sense of discovery thats so important to this genre is harder to achieve when yr following super metroid So Closely as a template. bangin tunes, and rly awesome boss fights too, even with an unaccommodating difficulty spike in the ending stretch. i genuinely treasure every moment i can in these games where i have no idea where to go, thats what video games are all about
Date 2023-06-21 Playtime 26h 18m Rec Positive Крайне необычный образец жанра,сделанный одним человеком.Игра отличается многими вещами от собратьев по жанру,на самом деле просто иная форма достижения того или иного результата,например тут нет двойного прыжка,но есть дрон которого можно выкинуть вверх и телепортироваться вслед за ним(но это все еще надо найти), преодолев нужную высоту,есть короткий телепорт чтобы узкое препятствие преодолеть,есть бур которым можно определенное препятствие пробурить чтобы достать что-то,.Здесь бои в основном на расстоянии,то есть не бьете врага а расстреливаете,такого мне еще не попадалось в метроидваниях.Визуально кажется будто в этой игре против тебя ВСЕ и ВСЁ,в том числе окружение которое частично также находится в движении.Музыкальная составляющая тоже на высоте. Боссы после соулс-лайк метроидваний кажутся скучноватыми(ни таймингов коротких которые надо подгадывать,ни стамины) к ним нужно только подходящее оружие подобрать и все. Система лечения также необычнакя,подлечиться можно только или в месте сохранения,или найдя фрагмент увеличения здоровья,или в бою из врага красное вещество выпадет. Каких-то серьезных минусов не заметил,но мне не хватало телепорта между точками сохранения,и именно это отбило желание облазить все места снова после получения всех возможных способностей.Ну и не совсем разобрался как быть с паролями,их надо где-то находить,и они открывают какую-то определенную зону с оружием или улучшением,но мне попался только один из пяти за все прохождение.Также на последних 2 локах неплохо было бы ввести снижение урона,или энергетический щит который перегревается и восстанавливается со временем. Ну и непонятно какой из стволов наиболее эффективен,какой больше урона наносит. Субъективно кажется наибольший урон у Килвера и у Поля Искажения,но это местный дробовик,лупит почти в плотную,а летающих врагов немало. В общем охренительная игра.

Date 2023-06-20 Playtime 18h 1m Rec Positive The story is what I love about this game.  The game layout can leave you lost at times, but I just YouTubed it when I got lost or couldn't figure out what to do next. Is it perfect? No. Is it fun, Yes.  When it's no longer fun turn it off and come back to it when you're ready.
Date 2023-06-20 Playtime 6h 16m Rec Positive Decent
Date 2023-06-19 Playtime 6h 7m Rec Positive Axiom Verge es la primera obra de Thomas Happ y es increíble. Es un 'metroidvania' en scroll lateral tradicional que coge lo mejor de cada uno de ellos y lo lleva al siguiente nivel.  El apartado gráfico es un verdadero deleite visual que presenta un pixel art retro detallado y hermoso, mientras que la música chiptune evoca la nostalgia de los clásicos y complementa perfectamente el juego.  Probablemente de los mejores metroidvanias de los últimos años. Un juego con identidad propia que nada tiene que envidiar a los padres del género.   Para los aficionados a las franquicias de Nintendo y Konami es una compra obligada.
Date 2023-06-19 Playtime 14h 32m Rec Negative This game was kinda cool, but mechanically it was a bit too annoying for me to recommend. Maybe if you like the sequels and want to come back to this one for context, it's worth struggling through it.
Date 2023-06-14 Playtime 15h 10m Rec Positive [h2] Compétent, mais... [/h2]  [h3] Le négatif [/h3] Axiom Verge est très bon, réalisé avec compétence, et mine de rien prend plus de temps que je ne le pensais (15h actuellement, et probablement 20h pour le compléter). Il n'est néanmoins pas exempt de défauts, ce qui a pour moi créé une expérience alternant entre un bon jeu et une corvée. Ça m'a pas mal retenu de le finir, et j'ai quelques fois abandonné l'idée de lancer le jeu à cause de ça. Si vous pouvez faire avec, ça sera je n'en doute pas une très bonne expérience, mais de mon ressenti : [list] [*] Le backtracking : il y a bien une espèce de tram/hub qui permet de voyager plus facilement entre les zones, mais cela reste quand même assez long... et en fonction, il n'est parfois pas tout à fait accessible. [*] Le sound design : en grand fan de musiques chiptune/8-bits, je suis très surpris, mais le sound design m'a agressé. Je ne vois personne en parler donc je suppose que c'est un problème d'audition, mais malgré l'option pour "désactiver les sons métalliques", certains ennemis surtout vers la fin du jeu émettent des sons insupportables quand on les attaque. Et certains sons utilisés dans les musiques m'empêche de les apprécier autant que j'aimerais. [*] L'originalité : je pense malheureusement que j'en attendais trop du jeu. Soyez avertis, pour moi, on peut en gros résumer l'expérience comme "Super Metroid créé avec les moyens de 2015." En effet, il y a de l'exploration, certes il y a des idées novatrices, je veux bien comprendre que certains me jugent injuste sur l'originalité... mais pour moi, les rares nouvelles mécaniques ont été soit ensevelies sous la routine, soit trop peu importantes pour composer une véritable différence. Ça se joue, mais en termes de mécaniques, je n'ai pas suffisamment trouvé de quoi véritablement m'accrocher au jeu. L'atmosphère est bien faite, mais s'il n'y avait pas eu le scénario, je pense que je n'aurais jamais fini Axiom Verge. [/list]  [h3] Le positif [/h3]  En prenant ces points négatifs en compte, j'étais à deux doigts de mettre une revue négative, avec comme ressenti global « [i]J'aurais aimé apprécier mais je n'ai pas pu.[/i] ». Cependant, le jeu a été réalisé par un solo dev, et mine de rien... [list] [*] La diégétique : [b]incroyable[/b]. L'histoire racontée est probablement le meilleur point de jeu, pas pour son originalité, mais par la manière dont le narratif se déroule. C'est un jeu vidéo qui utilise ses mécaniques pour porter l'histoire. C'est peut-être con dit comme ça, mais je vous jure que TROP PEU de jeux le font. Ce jeu mérite sa revue positive ne serait-ce que pour deux scènes en particulier qui utilisent le narratif intra-diégétique à merveille. Et ça prouve qu'on peut faire un metroidvania classique avec un scénario qui compte. [*] Les musiques (malgré le point négatif plus haut), sont très bonnes, surtout vers la fin du jeu. Et si on oublie certains sons gênants, le sound design est globalement adapté et assez varié. [*] Le level design : il m'a parfois embêté un peu, mais il faut bien admettre que finalement, les zones sont plutôt réussies, et que ce n'est pas un travail bâclé. Les secrets sont partout, tantôt juste hors de portée pour ne pas qu'on réalise qu'ils sont présents, et tantôt juste assez proches pour nous faire comprendre qu'il nous manque quelque chose ; parfois ça rend le backtracking un peu long... mais en comparant avec des jeux de moindre qualité, on peut réaliser à quel point le jeu est solidement ficelé. [/list]  [h3] En bref [/h3] Je pense que j'en attendais trop du jeu et malheureusement il y a eu des problèmes subjectifs qui m'ont repoussé, mais en-dehors de ça, le jeu est très solide. Si vous aimez les metroidvania, et surtout les Metroid 2D classiques (SNES/GBA), foncez.

Date 2023-06-09 Playtime 14h 33m Rec Positive the wasps are bullet sponges, which is just rude
Date 2023-06-08 Playtime 14h 31m Rec Negative Ум, довольно интересный опыт в метроидваниях. Но меня все ещё бесит кривая сложности, непонятный урон у оружие, непонятные тайники (когда стенка либо разрушаемая или вообще проходима), карта где можно поставить только 2 метки (в метроидвании, блять) и сама структура задач (когда ты не понимаешь куда идти). В общем у меня положительные ощущение в плане самой игры, как метроидвания с олдскульным дизайном, и сюжета.  Но этим можно насладиться и не играя в саму игру. Я лучше порекомендую посмотреть сюжет Axiom Verge, чем играть в неё.
Date 2023-06-08 Playtime 34h 48m Rec Negative The game has at its core potential, but this potential gets almost crushed because of the unbelievable annoying weapon controll of the rigth analog stick. You just always switch every ten seconds the weapons with your right thumb because of this. Also the map is relativley bad structured and confusing.
Date 2023-06-07 Playtime 9h 54m Rec Positive I sincerely do not understand why the recent reviews of this game have been so negative, so allow me to share my thoughts on what is honestly one of my favourite gaming experiences from the past 5 years.  Axiom Verge is a game that challenges you by providing the player minimal guidance in what to do, or where to go. The story itself is self emergent, and lore can be gleamed through discovering secrets, which often require the use of new abilities the player will unlock throughout the game, which can be found throughout the large, sprawling world of Axiom Verge.  The gameplay itself is difficult, and utilizes many common tropes from older retro-games whilst also putting unique twists on them to make them feel both modern and unique. The platforming, combat, and use of abilities in Axiom Verge are very fun, and often provide the player with unique challenges and puzzles that are surprisingly rewarding to solve.  However, what carries Axiom Verge the most is it's story. It is simply a delight unlike any other, and if you are a fan of Sci-Fi narratives you would be doing yourself a disservice by passing it up. Combine that with an absolute masterpiece of a soundtrack, and you've got yourself an experience you won't soon forget.  That is, if you're up for the challenge.  Also, I just want to note that Axiom Verge was made almost entirely by a single, extremely passionate developer. No game should be exempt from constructive criticism, but there are logical limitations to what a single individual could possibly accomplish on their own with limited funding.  I just pray it won't take another 6-7 years for Axiom Verge 3...
Date 2023-06-06 Playtime 11h 49m Rec Positive Overall a great metroidvania. Finding new weapons and other collectibles was always fun and the soundtrack is damn great. Worth your money 100%
Date 2023-06-06 Playtime 24h 33m Rec Positive Jesus Christ, what a game. Recommended for any fan of Metroidvanias. Backtracking can be a pain to some, but I personally enjoyed it quite a bit. The soundtrack is haunting and ambient, the bosses are fun, and the maps are stunning. It's incredible that one man alone made this fantastic game. What a feat.  Please pick up this game!
Date 2023-06-05 Playtime 7h 26m Rec Negative Guess I don't like super metroid combat. Also the lack of any indication as to where to go with no reliable teleportation system doesn't help. Its definitely unique but a chore to get through.

Date 2023-06-02 Playtime 38h 34m Rec Positive good game. great action, great world, maybe a little big, great and unique move tech.   what's with so many damn weapons though, lol
Date 2023-06-01 Playtime 16h 58m Rec Positive Excellent game. The atmosphere is pretty immersive, the story flows pretty well, the game mechanics are pretty smooth and there are a ton of secrets to find, if you're a completionist. The difficulty is pretty average. A little challenging, but far from frustrating.
Date 2023-05-27 Playtime 15h 41m Rec Negative I have mixed feelings on this game. I enjoyed it at first. It has excellent pixel art for backgrounds, characters, and cutscenes. I used a controller to play and was able to customize the controls. The way the character moves feels good. The game has a number of unique abilities that I haven't seen elsewhere. I've seen that the developer made some changes to the low health sound based on player feedback which is not something you'd see from most. With that said, I did have issues. First off is the sound. I found some pieces of music and a lot of the sound effects grating on my ears, the laser from the laser urchin especially, and I heard that one a lot. I tried a number of different volume combinations, but found it best to play muted. It does mean I miss the way the low-health sound blends with the music, which was cool. Difficulty felt very inconsistent. The enemies gave me way more trouble than the bosses. The brown ghoul is introduced early and is very dangerous. They're fast, mobile, have high health, and deal decent damage. I was able to beat the first two bosses without dying, and the third boss is an absolute pushover. The red flying krill were particularly annoying. They hide in lava and when they jump out they shoot projectiles that explode. The explosions on the projectiles seem larger than they look and they last a while. Progression was difficult at times because the game would be inconsistent on terrain interactions. Pieces of terrain would sometimes be destructible, and sometimes not. At one point you have to corrupt a piece of lava that looks no different from every other piece of non-corruptible lava. So overall, I like the way the game looks and controls, but sound and gameplay turned me off of it.

Date 2023-05-17 Playtime 17h 18m Rec Negative Una pena. Axiom Verge es un buen juego, tiene tintes que recuerdan a Alien o a la obra de Giger en general, y en lo personal, con esa música, también me recordó a System Shock. Un lore que resulta muy interesante.  Lamentablemente uno no tarda en verle las costuras, enemigos y jefes muy poco inspirados que resultan esponjas de balas, jugabilidad y controles toscos a mas no poder, una OST que, aunque muy original, se empalma de mala manera, dejando al juego sin música por momentos para que vuelva a arrancar el tema. Encima jugarlo de primeras en díficil sólo infló los problemas de jugabilidad que tiene este juego. A no ser que tengas sueños humedos con los Metroid de NES o SNES, andá a jugar otros metroidvania que los hay a patadas y mejores que este. Por cierto, mucha inspiración en Metroid y me ponés notitas esparcidas en el mapa en una de las maneras más aburridas y sosas para contar lore que han existido en los jueguito
Date 2023-05-17 Playtime 9h 44m Rec Negative Unfortunately...this game really needs a "maybe so" option instead of just yes or no on recommending the game.  There is a lot of interesting elements of this game, but sadly the game suffers from maximum effort/minimal gain. The abilities either sound really cool on paper (like phasing through walls), but come out as severely clunky in play. Also there is a lot of "I got this item and I think I know what I can do with it" but you can't. And it isn't an obvious "you can't". Most likely you will find out you can't when you try...every single time you think you can. It sounds confusing, so think of it this way: if you get a gun that does double damage on blue enemies, but then find out with each dark blue enemy that they are dark blue, because the gun doesn't do double damage to them for being a slightly off shade of blue than necessary.....that is the best way I can describe it without spoiling what items you really get.  But that is not the worst of the maximum effort part of it. I love old school Metroid games. Super Metroid is a masterpiece because there is so much hidden, and rewards for really exploring. Even picking up a pack of missiles in Super Metroid feels like a reward. This game doesn't have the same feeling. Either the items found are not really interesting, or worse....in parts. Like Zelda's pieces of the hears....there are items you have to find 5 or 6 of them to boost your life or weapon damage up one. Thats.....simply not cool in a game like this.  So I give it a neutral rating really. If you like the 2d Metroids, then wait for a sale and get it. There are a lot of frustrating parts in it, difficulty spikes, and a lot of not knowing what to do. If this is a deal breaker...then skip it. There are tons of these games out there. Find the right one for you.
Date 2023-05-16 Playtime 15h 14m Rec Positive Как же она хороша... Из за этого ещё жальче становиться, то, как долго я её откладывал. Всё что могу сказать, она напомнила мне, почему я так люблю метроидвании. Такие уникальные способности, такие отличные пушки, такой приятный бэктрекинг, разве что боссы слегка подкачали, но... они и не главное в этой игре. 
Date 2023-05-16 Playtime 35h 6m Rec Positive [h1]メトロイドヴァニアと言うよりメトロイドライクなゲーム[/h1] GWセール中だったので２作品バンドルを購入。 前評判が高かったが思っていたより楽しいとは思えない出来だった（少なくとも１は）。 ゲームは正統型のメトロイドライク（ヴァニア要素は薄い）。  １と２ではシューティング型と近接型に分離されている。 内容はそんなに悪くなく、シナリオは面白かったがゲームバランスは今ひとつだった。  以下評価 [h2]良かった所[/h2] [list]  [*] 豊富な武器の数 　 使い勝手が良いのが多く、新しい武器が出ても火力アップが出来るため 　長く使える（序盤の武器は除く）　  [*] アイテムの応用力の広さ 　最初は大したことは出来ないが、アイテム自体もグレードアップするので 　後半は思いもよらない高度なアクションが出来る様になる  [*]ゲームの背景のドット絵の細かさ 　最初はジメジメした洞窟の中を進んでいくが、途中から外に出られるように 　なり様々なバイオームやギミックを楽しめるようになる  [*]ユニークな敵の動き 　通常、こちらが近づくと突っ込んできたり、攻撃してきたりするが、 　何もない場所からいきなり現れるやつもいる。 　時には敵を利用して先に進むギミックもある。 　敵の強さも理不尽に強くなく、こちらが考えて行動を取ればどうにか出来る 　相手ばかりなので、ストレスは溜まりにくい(特手の武器を使うとあっと 　ゆう間に撃破できたり）  [*]たくさんの隠しアイテム・マップ 　とにかく広い！思いもよらない場所に配置されていることも多いから 　探索のしがいがある。　  [/list] [h2]今一つだった所[/h2] [list] [*] mapが見づらい 　一応拡縮できるのだがその倍率が極端に低く高解像度だと殆大きくならない    一応、マーカーが設置できるのだが１mapに２つしか配置できず、しかも 　直接目的の場所に行かないと配置できなかったりする 　（この仕様のせいで、隠しアイテムの存在を見逃すことになる事も多い）  [*]マニュアルプロテクトのようなギミックがある 　殆どは積むことは無いのだが、一部英語圏の人にしかわからないギミックが 　ある。 　パスワードを利用して先に進むギミックがあるのだが、特定の場所にある、 　何気ない文字が実はヒントだったりする（英語に変換する必要があるとか）  [*] キーコンフィグの柔軟性 　ゲームパッド使用時（PC系、Xbox系、PS系を選べる）、全てのキーに配置 　できるのだが、無効にするという操作が無い（アナログとデジタルを個別化 　は出来るが）。 　この性能のせいで、アナログ操作がやりづらい（アナログのLRボタンにも 　設定されているから誤爆しまくる）  [*]キーコンフィグの影響による特定のアクションの誤操作 　最初は特に気にはならんが、ゲームが進むと、壁を掘れるようになったり、 　高いところに登れるようになったり、ダッシュが出来る様になる 　（ワイヤーアクション・壁抜けも出来る様になる）。 　だが、ダッシュの性能が最悪なレベルで、前を２回入力するとでるのだが、 　高度なアクションが必要な場所でも発生するほど入力が甘いので、余計な所で 　ダッシュが出て落下してやり直しなんてことも（穴に落ちて死ぬことは無いが）  [*]ワイヤーアクションが使いづらい 　天井・天板にぶら下がる際に使用するのがメインだが、角や斜めにしか反応が 　無く、また足場の上によじ登ることが出来ない。 　しかも連続で使用しないといけない場所が多いのにちょっとした動作ですぐに 　落ちる位よく外れる（距離感が非常に分かりづらい）  [*]死に武器が多い 　攻撃力を上げることが出来るが、新しい武器（特に終盤）が手に入ると 　それがつよすぎるため、他の武器が全く使い道がなくなる  （結局、終盤で手に入る武器のみになる）。 [/list]  他にも色々あるけど、長くなったのでこの辺で。 ゲームとしては面白いが、粗が多く、良くも悪くもメトロイドなんだなぁ と思った（要は古臭いｗ） 尚、続編は評価は今ひとつだが、個人としては別ゲーレベルの面白さ だと思った（一部理不尽なものもあるがｗ） （評価としては、今作は60点くらいかな）
Date 2023-05-15 Playtime 10h 24m Rec Positive Great atmosphere and some really well-hidden secrets. Traversing the world becomes more satisfying after every upgrade.
Date 2023-05-14 Playtime 28h 18m Rec Positive the game is alright, especially considering the resources available to the developer. the artstyle is great, music is good too. the story is ok. i really dislike the way the main character talks. it is immersion breaking if he uses swear words and comes across as slightly arrogant while i want the world to appear as full of wonder, waiting to be explored. also... way too many weapons. no game needs over twenty weapons! most of them are awful. the world also lacks structure. the backtracking doesn't feel rewarding because you literally go everywhere with your new upgrade trying to make progress. i won't get the sequel though.
Date 2023-05-13 Playtime 30h 14m Rec Positive I never played the Metroid series but thanks to Axiom Verge I got a good idea of what it's like. It's fun, I like it. At some point I'll definitely buy the sequel and play that too.
Date 2023-05-13 Playtime 43h 49m Rec Positive Joguete massa
Date 2023-05-11 Playtime 9h 42m Rec Positive 68% items, 91% map completion. Took me about 9 hours. A fun game, with some really cool and unique items and a great atmosphere. There's very little context and detail to areas. This, along with many things, makes this game very close to a Metroid game. 100%ing seems just as, if not more, impossible to get without a guide. Items aren't marked at all.  For the main game, this is certainly worth picking up, if you're into Metroid.
Date 2023-05-11 Playtime 22h 18m Rec Positive Excellent retro platformer. Big map, lots of exploration, lots of stuff to get.
Date 2023-05-10 Playtime 10h 58m Rec Positive Recommended, with some caveats.  Graphics look pretty great, but the music grates (especially Kur underground; I dreaded having to return to that area).  It's not bad, per se, just a bit too high energy considering you have to listen to it loop many many times as you hit every block in every area with every tool at your disposal.  Speaking of which, about 80% of the weapons you pick up will be used once at most, including one that you're forced to use to progress early on.  Despite these complaints, the story's really fun and engaging; I always felt myself getting pulled back in to try to find out what was being hidden from Trace.  Unfortunately, that just made it even more frustrating during many times I had to feel around for clues that never came (including one especially-frustrating instance where the solution turned out to be simply returning to an area I had just been forcibly removed from by the story).  I'd say this game is worth a shot for people who like a good mystery in a game and want to experience it themselves rather than absorbing it through an LP.  Otherwise it'll likely prove too frustrating.
Date 2023-05-09 Playtime 16h 6m Rec Positive This has turned into quite possibly my favorite metroidvania. The story, the characters, the atmosphere and the weapons and tools are phenomenal. Extremely well done game, couldn't give it a high enough rating.
Date 2023-05-08 Playtime 6h 9m Rec Positive m
Date 2023-05-07 Playtime 13h 41m Rec Positive If you’ve played Super Metroid and came here looking for a spiritual successor/spinoff, you may have found it. There are caveats, though. This is an impressive game if you consider the fact that it was entirely created by one guy. Nearly everything is there–lots of new abilities, power and health upgrades, weapons, a gigantic map, and some new cool things that weren’t in the games that inspired Axiom Verge. But I have to say that, even though the game is a quasi-clone of Metroid, it somehow doesn’t feel as good or engaging.  Some reviews say the game starts a little “slow”, then picks up later on. I did notice that it wasn’t super interesting right off the bat, but kept playing, looking forward to when it was supposedly getting better. Towards the end (after uncovering about 70% of the map), I just got tired of playing. I kept waiting for that something that would spice up the game, but it never came. At this point, I looked up a guide and rushed to finish the game.  This being a metroidvania, backtracking is a big part of the game. Maybe this is me, but I got lost way too often, not knowing where to go next. The map is extensive–there’s a lot to explore. However, if you don’t have the time or patience to visit areas a hundred times and memorize every little thing you need to come back to, you’ll quickly get tired of playing. I also had difficulty figuring out the way to reach certain places since the map is broken down by area. There is an overworld map, but since the area exits are not named, it’s difficult to figure out how to get from one area to another if they’re not next to each other.  The graphics and music are pretty good, but not spectacular. Some areas barely feel any different from the previous one. They don’t have a strong, remarkable identity. I’m not saying they are bad–they just don’t stand out.  You’ll get a variety of weapons by the time you get to the end of the game, but they don’t really feel like upgrades. I finished the game with 12 or 13 and realized I only used 2 or 3. It seems like they all cause the same damage per shot. You’re better off using one that shoots the most projectiles per unit of time.  It wouldn’t be fair not to recommend Axiom Verge just because it didn’t do it for me. Maybe I had my expectations set too high. It’s still a great game–it just didn’t feel special to me.
Date 2023-05-06 Playtime 27h 10m Rec Positive Love the music, serviceable story, fun weapons, fun genre.
Date 2023-05-06 Playtime 33h 46m Rec Positive Hace un año jugué solo 3 horas y me aburrió, no estaba preparado para maravilloso juego. Me encantó, es hermoso lo que ofrece cada habilidad y arma. La historia está interesante, me intriga.   Cuando lo acabe editaré con más reseña.  EDITO:  El juego es un 10 de 10, pero con un final abierto, espero que Axiom Verge 2 cubra lo que falta.
Date 2023-05-04 Playtime 11h 25m Rec Positive Прекрасный метроид, купил в коллекцию и перепрошел случайно. Второй раз удалось попасться на сюжетный твист, клевая задумка
Date 2023-05-03 Playtime 19h 9m Rec Positive Axiom Verge é um jogo que impressiona em vários aspectos, a começar pela história. Um cientista que após um estranho acidente em seu laboratório acorda em uma outro planeta, povoado de alienígenas e paisagens muito estranhas. A estética 8bits consegue misturar influências como o visual das criaturas de H.R. Giger, artista responsável pela direção de arte da série Alien, e a estranheza biomecânica dos filmes do diretor David Cronenberg. Tudo isso em um gameplay profundamente inspirado na grandiosa série Metroid.  Mas o fato que impressiona mais é que tudo isso foi feito por apenas UMA PESSOA.  Thomas Happ assina a história, direção de arte, level design e trilha sonora desse que é um dos melhores jogos do estilo metroidvania que jogo em anos. Absolutamente envolvente, interessante e divertido, tudo que um grande video game tem que ter. Imperdível! 
Date 2023-05-03 Playtime 6h 27m Rec Negative After 6 hours of playing I can't force myself to finish this. There are some good elements to the game and I was having fun in spots - the enemies are pretty well designed, the music choice is good and catchy in spots, and I absolutely love the atomizer weapons that changes what an enemy can do - that's probably the most interesting/entertaining part of the game. However, there are way too many issues I have with the game. The weapons are mostly pretty generic and boring as are the level designs. The bosses are incredibly easy and the standard enemies while interesting provide little challenge. However what absolutely annoyed me was the grappling and teleporting aspects. They're clunky as hell and the teleporting should've been done differently - I found myself accidentally teleporting a lot, and times when I wanted to teleport unable to do so with inconsistent results when trying to go upwards or downwards through a platform. That plus no fast travel and I'm ready to stop. I don't want to have to go through the same area 12 times trying to reach another part of a different area. It was a good effort but I think there are much, much better options out there and I don't want to spend anymore time with this.

Date 2023-04-30 Playtime 45h 21m Rec Positive Great for Metroid fans. Although this game falls into the category of a metroidvania, it's a lot more metroid than vania. If you come to the Metroidvania genre for Castlevania-style games, you probably won't love this game as much as I do. That being said, I do, in fact, love this game. Great story, great soundtrack, great gameplay.
Date 2023-04-29 Playtime 69h 41m Rec Positive 
Date 2023-04-27 Playtime 16h 8m Rec Positive Classic gameplay with lots of guns and an intriguing science (fiction?) story inspired by some thought-provoking concepts. Controls are precise and feel good. The music is great! The map is big, but not overly complex. It's pretty easy to map out how to get from where you are to where you want to be. I found the bosses pretty easy on normal difficulty.
Date 2023-04-24 Playtime 9h 58m Rec Positive This one - is good metroidvania. Pretty intresting abilities for metroidvania. Well made hideout for items and lore stuff.

Date 2023-04-23 Playtime 12h 40m Rec Positive Um dos melhores do estilo.
Date 2023-04-22 Playtime 28h 20m Rec Positive [i]---see where this game landed on my metroidvania tier list beneath this review!---[/i]   It's a metroidvania, and one of the ones that helped renew interest in the genre when there wasn't a lot of games like this out there.    I like the immersive and classic Metroid-inspired world, though many of the earlier screens (level design) are comprised of those samey, annoying verticle platforms in the style of the earliest Metroid games.    Music was fitting.  There's a plethora of ability upgrades.  Gameplay just feels a bit uncomfortable and "cagey" early on.  Lot's of stop-start moving around as you have to navigate quite carefully.  This combined with the constant verticle-platforming rooms that has you jumping up or down a lot makes it feel a little uncomfortable to play compared to many modern day takes on the genre, at least at first. This problem persisted for a few hours until the game opens up more and starts to get more enjoyable.    Later on you will encounter another problem, which is the 'double tap forward to dash' control scheme.  This control scheme is antiquated and leads to a lot of frustrating moments, both when you are trying to dash, and when you were only intending to be edging in a direction and instead find yourself dashing into danger.  A dedicated dash button would have saved a lot of frustration.  The game has a randomiser mode which can add some replayability if you're the type for that.  It's an impressive game, I'd rate my enjoyment of it a C+  ===================== [b]My Metroidvania Tier List[/b]    [i] (excluding Metroid & Castlevania titles)[/i] =====================  [b]S+[/b]  Aeterna Noctis | [b]S Tier [i](Truly Special)[/i][/b]  Astalon: Tears of the Earth | Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom | Hollow Knight |  [b]S-[/b]  Blasphemous 2 | Cathedral |  [b]A+[/b]  Doomblade^ | Afterimage | [b]A Tier [i](Amazing)[/i][/b]  Elderand | Ori and the Will of the Wisps | Environmental Station Alpha | [b]A-[/b]  Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights | Depths of Sanity |  [b]B+[/b]  Blast Brigade | Haak | [b]B Tier [i](Really Enjoyed)[/i][/b]  Alwa’s Legacy | Steamworld Dig 2 | Islets | Blasphemous | After Death | Pronty^ | Mortal Manor | Escape From Tethys | Monster Sanctuary | Elliot Quest | [b]B-[/b]  Haiku, the Robot | Rabi-Ribi | Outbuddies DX | Treasure Adventure Game | Chasm |  [b]C+[/b]  Lone Fungus | Ghost Song | Death’s Gambit: Afterlife | Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night | Kunai | Kingdom Shell | Momodora: Reverie under the Moonlight | [b]Axiom Verge[/b] | [b]C Tier [i](More or Less Enjoyed)[/i][/b]  Aggelos | Plague of Yamorn | Sheepo | Infernax | MF-01 Aerostrike^ | Xanthiom Zero | Carrion^ | Wuppo | Iconoclasts | Catmaze | Omega Strike | HunterX | [b]C-[/b]  Rusted Moss^ | Moonscars | The Messenger | Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth | Ato | MindSeize | Grime |  [b]D Tier [i](Liked some things, but had issues)[/i][/b]  Castle In The Darkness | Alwa’s Awakening | Pharaoh Rebirth | Yoku’s Island Express | Guacamelee! 2 | Shantae and the Pirate’s Curse | Beholgar | Clunky Hero | Headlander | Strider | Minoria | Souldiers | Bone Appetit | The Witch & the 66 Mushrooms | Transiruby | Destroy Space Aliens | La-Mulana | Guacamelee! | 8Doors | Gato Roboto | Super Panda Adventures | Phoenotopia: Awakening |  [b]E-Tier [i](Didn't like)[/i][/b]  Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap | Ginsha | Dandara | Vernal Edge | Blaster Master Zero | Medusa | Sundered | Salt & Sanctuary | Valdis Story | Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet | Touhou Luna Nights | Chronicles of Teddy | B.I.O.T.A. | Shadow Complex | Timespinner | Rex Rocket | Aquaria | Nyaruru Fishy Fight | Apotheon | Gungirl 2 | Bad Pad | Lootbox Lyfe | Angel’s Gear | Fearmonium | Magicians & Looters | Dust: An Elysian Tale | ===================

Date 2023-04-16 Playtime 1h 22m Rec Positive It's not a Metroidvania. It's almost literally Metroid with a different skin. You can tell the love Thomas Happ has for the series. Badass soundtrack as well.

Date 2023-04-16 Playtime 18h 1m Rec Positive Interessante.. gameplay muito boa e upgrades que mudam completamente como você joga o jogo, mesmo que achei que nas partes de bossfights poderia ter sido melhor, recomendo pra quem gosta de metroidvanias pq é muito facil se perder nesse jogo. Tô ansioso pra jogar o 2.
Date 2023-04-16 Playtime 16h 56m Rec Negative Not too much of a fan of this one.  The secrets are way too obscure and I've spent many hours backtracking just to see if there's now something accessible that I passed 10 hours ago.    There's too many bricks in the wall that look identical to thousands of other bricks, but these are destructible, hiding a secret behind it.  I tried to give it a good effort, but crossing back and forth across the entire map multiple times has completely burned me out.

Date 2023-04-14 Playtime 52h 1m Rec Positive Super gra
Date 2023-04-12 Playtime 9h 6m Rec Positive Great metroidvania with retro graphics. The map is HUGE so some of the back tracking can be daunting bordering on a pain in the ass.  There are enough weapons and items to keep things fresh and no grinding. A few very tough bosses and a few easy ones and two gimmick bosses added into a good story for a metroidvania.  Not the last of us story but more than serviceabl.  I would recommend this, especially to fans of the genre.

Date 2023-04-04 Playtime 15h 13m Rec Positive Juego cada tanto Metroidvanias y Axion Verge cumplio su fin de entretener, sin brillar pero sin decepcionar.  Lo recomiendo y comento que me gusto y que no tanto:  Me Gusto:  - Estilo retro  - Estilo casual: No es un juego dificil ni demasiado profundo. Si bien tiene muchos secretos por descubrir, no llegue a sentir la necesidad de encontrarlos todos por mi cuenta.  - Música: Hay mapas que vale la pena jugar solo por la música.  No me termino de gustar:  - Armas: Termine usando 2 como mucho. El resto es mas un desafio a coleccionar que algo que vayas a usar.  - Historia: Me resulto un tanto intrascendente. Podrias omitir las escenas y pasar el juego sin mucha vuelta.

Date 2023-04-01 Playtime 21h 55m Rec Positive If you liked Metroid you will like it,
Date 2023-03-31 Playtime 13h 32m Rec Positive En lo jugable recuerda mucho a Super Metroid, logra algo muy parecido dando soluciones bastante distintas a las mejoras que te permiten desplazarte por el escenario. La trama está bien, sin grandes alardes. La banda sonora es pegadiza. Y los controles son muy precisos. Además, desarrollado por una sola persona, tiene un meritazo tremendo.  A lo largo de su desarrollo mantiene muy buen nivel, salvo por el último tramo, en que tienes que probar cosas bastante contraintuitivas para continuar, como salirte mucho del mapa, sin darte ninguna pista sobre a dónde ir. Es un recurso que se ve en bastantes juegos del género, pero aquí destaca particularmente porque es posible avanzar en todo momento con solo probar a ir por zonas a las que previamente no habías podido acceder, y tan solo se introduce ésto cuando el juego se está terminando, causando bastante confusión. Por lo que he leído, llama bastante la atención a quienes lo juegan.  Muy recomendable para todas las personas a las que les gusten los metroidvania.

Date 2023-03-27 Playtime 13h 3m Rec Positive Hard to believe this game was made by a single person -- Art, music, sound, programming... everything.  This is an excellent Metroid-like with a killer soundtrack. There's more backtracking than I like, and I got stuck on a few exploration areas. Still, this game was awesome.

Date 2023-03-25 Playtime 61h 49m Rec Positive I find it almost impossible to say anything bad about AV1. The argument "It was made by one guy  who is supporting his family, not to mention his son needs special care." is enough to trump anything bad you have to say about it.Axiom Verge is an action-platformer and the gameplay is just fun. There is little else to say, it was made in reminiscent of retro NES games, but stands alone as its own thing.The added Speedrun/Randomiser modes are very well polished, and give the game immense, if not infinite replay value.The soundtrack is elite, you will be popping bubbles and shooting along to the beat before you even realise it.My favourite part of Axiom Verge is the story. It kept me puzzled, confused and happily dumbfounded for years. If you like Sci-Fi settings with strange and beautiful worlds alongside fun 'pew pew blasty' gameplay, this is the hot date you always wanted.Axiom Verge is one of my favourite games of all time and you should definitely give it a chance.10/10 Thank you Thomas Happ <3

Date 2023-03-23 Playtime 12h 15m Rec Positive Классная игра с ломающим голову сюжетом.
Date 2023-03-23 Playtime 11h 10m Rec Positive Axiom Verge es un homenaje con mucho amor y cariño hacia Super Metroid. Gran ambientación y diseño tanto de armas y escenarios como de enemigos y jefes. Mucha variedad de secretos y zonas por explorar.  La dificultad tiene un salto algo brusco a la mitad del juego. Ya que te sostiene de la mano por gran parte del inicio pero cuando te deja solo, uff.  He jugado varios metroidvanias y debo decir que me perdí bastantes veces. A menudo no tenía idea de a donde ir o donde utilizar la nueva habilidad de turno. El juego no tiende a guiarte por el buen camino tan de vez en cuando. Es exploración pura y cruda, para bien y para mal.   Y aunque me irrite bastante no saber hacia donde ir cuando todo encaja en su lugar se siente de maravilla. Que se jodan Nintendo y sus remakes, ¡el heredero de Super Metroid está aquí! ¡Y puedes jugarlo!
Date 2023-03-22 Playtime 45h 45m Rec Positive Muito bom o game, ótimo metroidvania, jogabilidade excelente, trilha sonora memorável.
Date 2023-03-21 Playtime 21h 0m Rec Positive So I was on the fence for Axiom Verge for an awfully long time since I saw it on GDQ and I never could see myself getting into so it got wishlisted. Steams spring sale happened and I have jumped at the chance to play this game at long last and i'm not disappointed in the slightest, Loving Metroidvania and the retro stylised games, Axiom Verge is the perfect pick up for me.  Axiom Verge is a fantastic Metroidvania set in a strange world that seems to make little to no sense, After a couple of hours and areas/regions explored things start to shape up in a way i've not seen in a game before I don't think and it really made me want to keep coming back for 2-4 hour sessions at a time either because I had to go explore somewhere new or I had now gotten an item to go and backtrack to all the areas from before to now open the secret or to progress the story.  The worlds are set up amazingly and they seem to fit really well into the strange world you are on, The weapons are widely available having found all of them my weapons dial must have been close to 20 weapons at least and they're all unique and have their ways of either opening doors or dealing damage to the enemies.  Having played on Normal the game wasn't too difficult there was only the one boss in region 7 AKHU? ( I think ) I just couldn't for the life of me beat this guy so I had to see what I was doing wrong with a quick guide and from there again it was smooth sailing, The mobs of enemies were the biggest threat in this game I think.  If you're a Metroidvania kinda person I would 100% recommend you pick up Axiom Verge and give it some time to settle you in and let it take you from there, the in game items alone for exploration felt so unique to me I just had to use them everywhere until I found literally everything and I loved that about this game. It's honestly brilliant. The soundtrack is fantastic, I can't get some of the regions tunes out of my head they're so catchy.  10/10 brilliant game, can't fault a thing about it!

Date 2023-03-20 Playtime 7h 57m Rec Positive Its just as fun as metroid
Date 2023-03-20 Playtime 9h 43m Rec Positive Great art and Music, Boss fights were mostly great with a few frustrations. Basic enemy encounters range from minor obstacles at best and spongy, a few hits and you're dead, and there are 3 attacking you at once at worst. Basic enemies, that can sap your total health in an instant, that are hard to hit with the given methods are so damn frustrating and not very engaging, I resorted to just damage boosting thru a lot of areas to the next health room instead of engaging with that nonsense. You get a ton of weapons but most feel redundant, even the "gun power up" upgrades don't feel like they do anything with the enemies stated above.  Blights on otherwise a great game. If you have patience for this kind of "challenge" I recommend. I ultimately powered thru cause I read the game was good, and for the most part it is.
Date 2023-03-19 Playtime 19h 34m Rec Positive Good game , what stands out the most is the music.Music being 10/10
Date 2023-03-19 Playtime 11h 56m Rec Positive More Metroid than the original Metroid.
Date 2023-03-17 Playtime 19h 48m Rec Positive Voilà un Metroid qui intéressera ceux qui sont en manque. -Graphiquement rien à dire, c'est pixellement propre. Quelques environnements aux couleurs assez moches tout de même. Mais en général, c'est bon. -Scénaristiquement, moui, il y a ce qu'il faut, sans plus. -Monstres: difficulté bien dosée avec quelques pics bien durs si on y a sans méthode. Boss sympathiques demandant de réfléchir pour certains. -Mécanique: le bât blesse ici. Trop d'armes dont on ne se servira jamais. Et surtout ce saut éclair infâme au joystick qui se déclenche quand on n'en veut pas, ou qui ne se déclenche pas quand on le veut. Difficulté à viser vers le bas quand on n'appuie pas sur les boutons dans le bon ordre. Ce n'est pas un bon point pour un jeu de plateforme comme ça. -Dommage qu'on n'ait pas de bestiaire pour chaque zone, cela aurait aidé à la complétion. Mais un bon jeu.

Date 2023-03-11 Playtime 32h 20m Rec Positive Fantastic game. One of my absolute favorites. Begs to be speedrun.
Date 2023-03-11 Playtime 13h 17m Rec Positive Metroidvania bem daorinha. Me diverti um bocado. Boa variedade de inimigos. Armas são ok: tem muitos tipos, mas que você realmente usa predominantemente ao longo do jogo são umas 3 só, as outras são legais nos primeiros minutos apenas. História é ok. Recomendo pra quem curte o gênero e quer uma pegada mais semelhante com Super Metroid. Eu zerei o jogo, mas não senti vontade de pegar o 100% , fiquei com uns 87% mais ou menos.
Date 2023-03-09 Playtime 23h 11m Rec Positive The core game mechanics leave a decent amount to be desired. Something like 20 weapons, but I personally only used about 4 of them for anything (most are niche at best.) Some of the control mapping makes moving around odd when you get powerups, but it's not too bad. Mostly, this game has excellent atmosphere, 8-bit style music, great art, a weird story, and a truly alien feel. Recommended, but with the caveat that it has quit a few mechanical flaws and obtuse decisions that can make progressing difficult at times.
Date 2023-03-08 Playtime 11h 47m Rec Positive I have to backtrack so much because i cant pay attention. I feel like small baby gamer again. I kinda like it tho. each boss has a gimmick if you cant beat them you'll likely find it fast after a few failures. I don't recommend playing without a guide, but i am and its fun.
Date 2023-03-08 Playtime 32h 34m Rec Positive One of the best games of its kind, with an incredible aesthetic and perfectly matching score to go with it
Date 2023-03-07 Playtime 31h 3m Rec Positive Game is dope. Cool story, dope soundtrack, alot of weapon variety.
Date 2023-03-07 Playtime 15h 39m Rec Positive If you're a fan of classic Metroidvania games, then this is a must-play. Feels very familiar, yet fresh at the same time. Lots of exploring, tight controls and gameplay, plenty of powerups and items to find, and a great soundtrack to boot - what's not to love?  The only caveat I'll throw out there is that this game can be on the challenging side at times, even on normal mode, but definitely not unfairly so or "cheap", as I like to put it. For me, this is a plus, but consider this more of a heads up if you're seeking an easy game or more casual experience.
Date 2023-03-06 Playtime 18h 23m Rec Positive Good, but not great metroidvania.  Pros: - cool world, enemies, weapons - Decent amount of game to play through - some really interesting mechanics (the drone, the address disruptor to change the world and enemies)  Cons:  - the game really lacks good ways to traverse the map, especially in late game. And it expects you to double-back ALL the time. - sound & music aren't very good, even within the theme of 8-bit retro. I turned them both way down after a while because it was just an annoyance - the backstory seems intricate but it's only partially delivered, in very small doses. By the time you finish the game you don't even know much about the characters you've met. - The UX is pretty lacking. There are a lot of weapons, most are forgettable, but selecting between them requires pausing the flow of the game.  As metroidvanias go, if offered something new, but the annoyances are very present.  I beat the game in about 18 hours (and like 94% map completion, so fairly thorough), and I think I spent at least a third of that in the "oh, I have item X, now I have to double-back to that place I remember and it's going to take me forever to get there" mode. It's pretty much the majority of the late-game playthrough since there isn't much in the terms of rapid map transit or shortcuts to make the Nth trip somewhere much faster than the first trip.  The game is worth paying for and playing, but overall I can't sing its praises.
Date 2023-03-05 Playtime 4h 35m Rec Positive é muiito legal de atirar
Date 2023-03-04 Playtime 30h 17m Rec Positive You know a game is good when you can't wait to see what's next, and Axion Verge is just like that.  Truly worthy of the "Metroidvania" tag, the gameplay and mechanics are simple enough and just like in the old classic Metroid on SNES and Castlevania SotN: You explore different areas jumping around shooting enemies to find weapons and tools required to progress to the next section and deal with new enemies and threats, which might require a specific item found beforehand or sometimes a different approach than mere brute force altogether.  However, unlike in Metroid and Castlevania, your character is not a badass, at least not from the start, but instead a young scientist who found himself in some unknown world after regaining consciousness from an unrelated accident in the lab he used to work in. Obviously there is more than just a rogue accident and find oneself in some random place with seemingly no logic or reason, but there are more pieces to the whole puzzle, all of which are scattered thorough the game world and give a bigger and richer lore to the whole story beyond the characters themselves, even delving into space-time paradoxes and multiverse theories.  The game world has a considerable size for a 2D action game, with many different biomes and environments from underground caves to an industrial complex and even mountains and fields featuring ancient ruins from a civilization long gone, all of which are accompanied by different and fitting music scores, and visually designed in a way that feels definitely as surreal as advertised. I would say, most of the visuals seem to be especially inspired by the works of H.R. Giger, nailing down the biomechanical designs to the point of giving a sometimes unsettling feeling to be actually more bio than mechanical. Moreso, the biomes themselves can even feature different sub-biomes that not only change the enemy types but also how the player has to navigate through them, from simple platforming to swinging around with a grappling hook and teleporting thorough walls, all within a door and a couple screens distance.  While being seemingly perfect in the gameplay and visual department, the game does have one major issue, which it can be summarized as being "overly cryptic". I don't think a game should hold the player's hand outright showing where to go at anytime or just spit out the secret locations, but while encouraging exploration and experimentation is one thing, another is to expect the player to just stumble upon the solution by itself, and that's the big issue of the game. A lot of the pathing and certain directions feel like just being dropped in and expected to be found by mere testing without an actual reason to do so, almost as if the concept of experimentation alone would be enough to find the way.  I'm not kidding when I say at somepoint I got stuck until I found I could "hack" an acid pool into solid terrain BY ACCIDENT, and that's what I mean with the game being "overly cryptic". I'm not saying you cannot beat the game without a guide, but if you are going for completion, you will need one, especially considering how the game got really carried away with fake walls and fake walls within the fake walls.  To sum it up, Axiom Verge is a great game certainly worth of it's fame, maybe overly cryptic, but full of nostalgia for the old classics and always awesome to come back and play.
Date 2023-03-04 Playtime 14h 37m Rec Positive Well, if you are looking for a metroidvania, this one certainly feels really close in music, style and feeling to the original NES Metroid.   The start of the game is certainly a bit dull and the story seems to not make much sense, but as you progress to get abilities and learn a bit more the game starts to feel more fun and by the end the story at least makes sense and you understand the environment more and the machines that surround you.  If you enjoy exploration, secret finding and collecting all you can collect then challenging yourself with a speedrun you will certainly enjoy it and will have lots of options to replay it, it even has a randomizer.   But for me one play through was enough.
Date 2023-03-04 Playtime 13h 42m Rec Positive es un buen juego de metroidvania aveces salen bug o el enemigo spamea mucho
Date 2023-03-03 Playtime 20h 13m Rec Positive Great metroidvania style game.
Date 2023-03-03 Playtime 11h 51m Rec Positive It's one of the Metroidvaina style games that really checks all the right boxes. It'll fix that craving, if you've got it. It will bring your parents back together, and even get your coffee order right - every time. It's basically just there, waiting for you when you're ready; waiting to absolutely obliterate your every need or want.  It's a great game. Fun story and exploration - plus the sequel is pretty rad. Enjoy, if that's your kind of thing!
Date 2023-03-01 Playtime 15h 48m Rec Positive A beginner firendly Metroidvania with some difficulty spikes along the way to test your tolerance for frustration - but not nearly as much as other metroidvanias do. The sounddesign is nice, the art style is amazing!
Date 2023-02-28 Playtime 10h 44m Rec Negative I actually don't get why this game is so loved by many players.  - levels are put together almost randomly without love - controls suck (dashing with double tapping in one direction??! who in this world though that would be a good idea?) - weapons all feel uninspired and allow no switching without entering a stupid ring menu that breaks the gameplay flow - however, you never need to switch weapons because there's no different damage types or anything, they all just...do damage. some less, some more, some with different visuals. - bosses require no tactical approach at all - the graphics and audio make your eyes and ears bleed. i mean, even if you're into this 16 bit stuff this is definitely not good. some stuff in the foreground looks like background sprites, sometimes enemies are barely visual  Just play any of the original metroid games and you will be better off :)  
Date 2023-02-27 Playtime 25h 22m Rec Positive nice game 
Date 2023-02-27 Playtime 0h 25m Rec Negative ranged metroid-style combat just isnt for me dont get me wrong, its a great game, but im just not a fan of this style of combat. i like melee combat like hollow knight, haiku the robot, and the second ori much more. plus, you cant aim up-diagonal without moving sideways, unlike a game such as AM2R. also, although i didnt test this much, i didnt see much coyote time, jump buffering or some corner correction, but i play celeste so im a bit used to this stuff  might buy it again later when i actually have a job (not old enough yet), but for now im going to refund it so i have money for silksong  tl;dr good game but personal preference makes me not like it
Date 2023-02-26 Playtime 0h 14m Rec Negative (((((
Date 2023-02-26 Playtime 40h 15m Rec Positive I'd strongly recommend this to anyone who loves Metroidvania type of games or are fan of Metroid games.
Date 2023-02-26 Playtime 12h 4m Rec Positive Had tons of fun with this one despite never playing metroid before (I'm excited to play those classics now), I unlocked 100% of items in the game (not all achievements because some of those require beating the game again multiple times and that's just too tedious for me). I didn't really get any of the super secret rooms as well because of the randomness associated with finding them, it doesn't really seem all that fun. But still I enjoyed everything else except for the grapple hook which felt super janky and annoying to use.
Date 2023-02-26 Playtime 2h 59m Rec Negative idk the guns, the levels, the sound feels just not entertaining for me
Date 2023-02-25 Playtime 0h 48m Rec Negative It is probably physically impossible to come up with a worse control scheme than this game has. It is blindly infuriating to use this game with a mouse and keyboard. Well, there is no mouse interaction to speak of. The keyboard binding defaults to the worst I have ever seen anywhere. You might think that the ESC key could be used to go back or close a menu. Nope. How about backspace? Nope. It's Q... naturally. Or, sometimes TAB. By default you fire with F and jump with space. This is about as ergonomic as a trap from a Saw movie. Trying to change the bindings will likewise drive you insane. Do yourself a favor, do NOT buy this game unless you have some sort of joystick/keypad. It might be semi-usable with something like an XBox or PS4 controller but you will not be able to stand this game for even 2 minutes with the keyboard controls. The developer should be absolutely ashamed at producing such a horrible control scheme. Any other metroidvania game you can think of has MUCH MUCH better controls than this game. I am absolutely floored that such a completely useless control scheme has ended up in a game of this age. I might expect this out of a first year software developer who has worked on their first game for only a week so far. But, a finished game that has been out several years?! This is unacceptable in the extreme.
Date 2023-02-25 Playtime 10h 59m Rec Positive pretty good metroid clone
Date 2023-02-25 Playtime 0h 36m Rec Negative It's really cool for what it wants to be but its too low tech to suffer through.  Axiom is faithful to a fault where it carries forward the cool but also the jank;  if you can handle a bumpy ride it will get you to a cool version of an ancient memory but if you enjoy anything remotely recent generation like hollow knight or ori, then it will be hard to stomach something so low rez and painfully stuck in the past.
Date 2023-02-24 Playtime 60h 49m Rec Positive awesome game with awesome music
Date 2023-02-23 Playtime 13h 6m Rec Positive Amazing game, on the same level as Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night.
Date 2023-02-18 Playtime 22h 5m Rec Positive sencillamente genial!
Date 2023-02-16 Playtime 15h 4m Rec Negative Jesus f*ck me the gameplay became so stale and grindy I don't know why I even finished it. Clearly a game made by a fantastic pixel artist. But wow everything else is just so extra medium at best. Take the music for example, it's got some solid tracks, especially at first, but when you’re in an area and it loops for the 10th time you just start to hate it. Oh god, also, umm what’s up with the main character, is this an attempt at humor instead of writing a serious story? I did play this game right after super Metroid, so maybe that's tinting my view of this game. And maybe this game is better than something like Chasm, or Astalon to someone else? But no, not to me. I can't see myself even trying Axiom Verge 2 as it's just made by the same guy and not the team he needs, sorry gamer.  2 / 10 All points earned by the pixel art.  Oh! How could I forgot, the mechanic of tap tap a direction to dash is a very sloppy control input. Please hire a game designer, tragic to see this art go to waste.

Date 2023-02-15 Playtime 14h 9m Rec Positive Gameplay's good, visual style is good, soundtrack is great, story is pretty cool, it's a really great Metroidvania... except for one big BUT:  When you unlock new abilities, you might spend a very long time looking around the map to figure out what area you can access with them. This really kills the pace of the game. I wandered around being confused for over an hour at times. If only the in-game map were more detailed, or allowed you to make more granular notes, this problem would be mostly fixed.  There is a reasonably quick method to travel across the map in the game, [spoiler]a long corridor called Indi[/spoiler]. But it's not actually explained properly to the player how to traverse this thing quickly  so you'll likely end up walking the whole thing, slowing down the game even more.  80% of its problems could really be alleviated with a small update imo.
Date 2023-02-12 Playtime 8h 39m Rec Negative This game is okay, not particularly good, it's just okay. The map is quite poorly designed and very difficult to navigate, so with all the backtracking involved in this style of game it just really kills the pace. The boss fights are somewhat overly difficult and not much fun. It's a shame because the game has some really cool and unique mechanics, and a great soundtrack, but as it got closer to the end I just wanted it to hurry up and be over. If you were really desperate for a metroidvania I could tentatively suggest it, but for me this game just felt like a waste of time.
Date 2023-02-12 Playtime 19h 47m Rec Positive Good music
Date 2023-02-11 Playtime 20h 8m Rec Positive Fairly mediocre Metroidvania held up by amazing music and a novel story. The music alone is worth buying this game for.
Date 2023-02-11 Playtime 22h 19m Rec Positive The Bad: Overall good game, but has flaws such as unclear visual design of the levels. Some things you find out are drillable seemingly by accident. Enemies being not very fun to battle against, since they easy to cheese, but hard to evade in a fair fight. Game has a lot of weapons, but only 5 of them useful. I used kilver for the most of it Locking you out of starting area for a while it is certainly a choice The Good: I love the lore and concept of the game. Move set is very unique and well executed for the most part. During progression you do feel more powerful, especially when confronting enemies that were giving you hard time in the starting area.  Overall I'm glad I played it. The flaws I mentioned I mainly noticed on the second playthrough right after playing Hollow Knight :P
Date 2023-02-10 Playtime 17h 44m Rec Positive Que jogo maravilhoso, muito metroid e pouco castlevania, COMPRA E JOGA MALUKO!
Date 2023-02-10 Playtime 23h 29m Rec Positive Это самый ближайший аналог игр серии Metroid. Я же заинтересовался знаменитой серией игр от Nintendo только после прохождения Аксомы. Не хватало мне того количества разнообразного оружия, что есть в этой игре. За что ещё могу похвалить Аксиому так это за отлично переданную атмосферу чужеродного и запустевшего мира. Я вообще большой любитель странной и мрачной атмосферы в играх... Это, как обычно, большая заслуга музыки и звуков. Помню как нам с другом приходилось, по началу, отдыхать от напряжения, создаваелого музыкой. Потом втягиваешься, привыкаешь и даже очаровываешся необычным миром. И уже оторваться сложно. А когда я в первый раз встретил полностью собранную русалку...
Date 2023-02-08 Playtime 38h 9m Rec Positive Must-play for fans of Metroid.  Sci-fi metroidvania with hauntingly beautiful pixelart graphics and a bopping soundtrack. Phenomenal exploration and truly well hidden secrets.
Date 2023-02-07 Playtime 30h 50m Rec Positive It's an amazing game. Good leveldesign, great story, fun weapons and mechanics, bossfights feel nostalgic but not too challenging. It's one of my favourite games and easily worth its asking-price.

Date 2023-01-29 Playtime 9h 46m Rec Negative 伝統的なメトロイドヴァニラといった作品。 プレイ感はスーパーメトロイドという感じです。 スーパーメトロイドが好きな人はお勧め…ですが、 ワープなし、敵はマップ移動で復活、高速移動スキルも特になし等、 古いゲームにありがちな不便な部分もそのままリスペクト元のままです。 そのあたりを承知の上でプレイするのであれば問題ないと思います。
Date 2023-01-29 Playtime 12h 46m Rec Positive Базированная метроидвания, что еще сказать. Не фанат подобных игр, но порой хочется чего-то такого индюшного, чтоб и секретиков было много и поисследовать локации и улучшения, куда же без них. Забавно, что первая часть это прям такой закос под ретро, а во второй от этого концепта практически полностью отказались, сделав что-то более современное. В игре большое разнообразие оружия, при этом стрельба максимально деревянная, нужен ли был такой закос под ретро в данном моменте? Систем телепортации как во второй части очень не хватает, поэтому приготовьтесь бегать на своих двоих. Минусов у игры достаточно, при этом она все равно довольно хороша, особенно концепт с Русалками мне очень зашел. Хочется, конечно, еще подушнить в паре моментов, но в целом игра приятная.

Date 2023-01-27 Playtime 10h 57m Rec Positive This game has an amazing otherworldly art style that is backed quite well by its soundtrack. It has some great concepts for abilities that it pulled off decently well. There are a variety of unique weapons but I found that most of them were not terribly useful, especially in the second half of the game.  Speaking on the second half, this was the most disappointing part of the game for me. Instead of facing more unique and interesting enemies you mostly face re skinned ones that are faster and more punishing, which I found to be obnoxious. The storytelling also takes a nose dive as they drop a big exposition dump towards the end and in the final boss which ruined the suspenseful and mysterious atmosphere of the game for me. The actual content of the story was good but was held back by how it was told.  I still think it's worth the experience but it's  in between a 'meh' and 'recommended' for me.
Date 2023-01-27 Playtime 33h 48m Rec Positive Love this game!
Date 2023-01-27 Playtime 15h 19m Rec Positive It's a good metroidvania with some caveats. I like how getting to new areas requires actually unlocking new traversal mechanics and not just shooting at doors with new weapons. The problem I have is that some of the moves you have to do to reach some areas are hard to reliably pull off (my experience with an xbox controller and move mapped to left joystick, maybe the analogue control made it harder). So you'll be trying out something at the edge of an area, you'll maybe do it 5 times and not get it, and conclude that you're not actually supposed to be going in that direction. Looking up a guide later though confirmed that it was the right direction, I just wasn't getting it right. There's also a pretty big difficulty spike in the final act of the game. Maybe if you have picking up all the damage upgrades it would be better but they're easy enough to miss.  Otherwise I enjoyed it. It has a neat story and I like that none of the gating mechanisms feel really trivial.
Date 2023-01-25 Playtime 24h 59m Rec Positive 非常有趣的像素類惡魔城遊戲。非常推薦。 一開始機體能力不高，但地圖很有探索感，會很想到處走走拿到新能力。 有一些隱藏道路也蠻有趣的。 組合包沒有扣掉已擁有項目，希望能改一下
Date 2023-01-24 Playtime 14h 33m Rec Positive Axiom v3rga es un Metroidvania con temática de Scifi de horror donde tenes que hacer v3rga todo. Se me hizo algo denso el juego, pero pude terminarlo, es muy solido. Al igual que los juegos de estas características, tiene un apartado artístico muy bueno en 8bit (pixel art), una muy buena banda sonara y muy buen gameplay. Solo extrañe algún tipo de teleport para avanzar mas rápido entre los mapas una vez descubierto, pues al no tener un sistema de teleport, tiene que pasarte todo el mapa hasta llegar al área que deseas ir (ya sea porque es para seguir avanzando o porque hay algún secreto en ese lugar)  La historia es media meh, pero safa. Los niveles y los enemigos son fáciles, salvo algunos finales. Como todo metroidvania, tienes que ir consiguiendo mejoras para poder ir desbloqueando diferentes partes del mapa y seguir avanzando o descubrir áreas secretas.  Una vez terminado tienes diferentes formas de jugar, ya sea speedrun o con algunos cambios que mejora o dificulta la jugabilidad (al igual que tiene diferentes modos de dificultad) pero eso ya se los dejo a los "expertos" en estos tipos de juegos. Recomendado para los que les gusta estos tipos de juegos.  Nota: 8/10
Date 2023-01-24 Playtime 8h 2m Rec Positive a fun and nice metroidvania to romp around an explore in. it is a game i wish i could recommend more, but sadly think i cannot. it nails the metroid feel of the metroidvania, but i kept feeling that some control decisions left a bit more to be desired. a good metroidvania to me requires smooth and seamless movement, and axiom verge did not quite meet that for me.
Date 2023-01-22 Playtime 16h 50m Rec Positive WORTH. Gameplay is gold. The OST is a serious Banger. And the Story is one of the best stories i have ever seen in a videogame. Just buy it if you like metroidvanias.
Date 2023-01-21 Playtime 12h 58m Rec Positive [b]Sights & Sounds[/b] - Excellent pixel art all around. Gave me warm fuzzy memories of playing Super Metroid as a kid and Zero Mission on GBA in high school - Similar to those games, you'll be fighting weird biomechanical monsters and giant bosses (most of which look pretty cool) - The music runs the gamut from good to stellar. The music from Kur is going to be stuck in my head for a while - Even the menus are nice. All in all, the presentation feels well-crafted  [b]Story & Vibes[/b] - The music and visual style do great job setting the tone of the game, which is largely mysterious and a little ominous - To give anything away about the story would do a disservice to the game. Let's just say that it's heavily sci-fi with some parallel universe/time travel elements, and is decent enough on its own - What really makes the world feel more interesting is the environmental storytelling. You'll find yourself clamboring over and shooting bad guys on a bunch of weird scenery. Stuff like piles of skeletons, corridors of cages, and weird incubation tube looking things. If you take the time to explore for notes and pay attention to the dialogue, you'll figure out why most of it is there  [b]Playability & Replayability[/b] - The game's Metroid inspiration obviously bleeds into the gameplay - Exploration is the centerpiece here. Drill everything, jump everywhere, and use the glitch mechanic on anything that looks slightly out of place. If you can't access a location yet, note the room. You'll be rewarded with some cool stuff - That "cool stuff" is indeed really fun to use. The drone teleport and labcoats were notable highlights that really open up movement throughout the environment. Some of the weapons are also very fun to use, even if some are only situational or gimmicky. - The equipment and upgrades are almost enough to balance out all the backtracking they require to obtain, but not quite. Enemies respawn if you move more than two rooms over, and there is no teleport option to speed up traversal in the huge world. This is really my only gripe about the game, though  [b]Overall Impressions & Performance[/b] - I played the game on the Steam Deck to up the GBA Metroid nostalgia factor. Also, it's way easier to play with the d-pad on the Steam Deck, which is great for 2D games - Ran very well the whole way through  [b]Final Verdict[/b] - [b]9/10[/b]. I know "metroidvanias" have saturated the indie game scene for several years, but this is definitely one worth playing though (especially if you lean more towards the Metroid side of that portmanteau)

Date 2023-01-15 Playtime 2h 48m Rec Negative The game softlocks easily. DO NOT BUY.
Date 2023-01-15 Playtime 9h 34m Rec Positive Solid Search-Action, extremely fun. Only complaint is the lack of fast travel in the late game.
Date 2023-01-15 Playtime 69h 44m Rec Positive pleasantly metroidvania. nice world building, too. playing again because the sequel came out.
Date 2023-01-15 Playtime 4h 27m Rec Negative Honestly, the game is functionally excellent. It feels great to play, the mechanics are fun, and it very well made. With the sole exception of the map design. Not that its intrinsically terrible, but this game suffers far more from  a problem that was evidently improved upon somewhat in the second game; it is extremely confusing. It may be fun when you are actually playing as intended, but most of my time was spent trying desperately (to no avail) to figure out where the fuck I'm supposed to go next. Even after looking up walkthroughs, I continued to struggle even at following them. Maybe I'm just fucking stupid, but I usually have a perfectly fine time navigating metroidvania titles. I had a relatively easy time with Axiom Verge 2, Hollow Knight, any of the Metroid games, and even You Have To Win The Game, which doesn't even have a map! The frustration in navigating the game was simply too much for me, and I'm surprised it didn't impact anybody else as much.
Date 2023-01-15 Playtime 14h 22m Rec Positive I always heard good things about Axiom Verge for such a long time, until recently I finally bought the game. Boy, I was really surprised with the game. It is a Metroidvania full of charisma and really original. The weapons are nice, the drone exploration was fun, and what a soundtrack! Really pleased with the game and huge kudos for the sole creator/developer of the game. You are truly an inspiration.
Date 2023-01-14 Playtime 5h 26m Rec Positive I love this game
Date 2023-01-10 Playtime 15h 4m Rec Positive not only a good metroidvania in all blazing glory, but also an excellent game that you couldn't believe it was just made by just one person. variety of weapons, progression, and of course, secrets, a lot of secrets to uncover. the only thing that i can say it can be a negative, but not at all a hindrance, is that even the game runs smoothly 100%, it seems the engine is a little too outdated to handle everything that is happening at once at some times.
Date 2023-01-10 Playtime 66h 16m Rec Positive Une déclaration d'amour à "Metroid". Une aventure riche soutenue par des graphismes et des musiques trop cool. Je ne peux pas en dire plus pour l'instant; je n'ai pas encore terminé le jeu. Mais j'espère le faire.

Date 2023-01-09 Playtime 12h 30m Rec Positive Really well-done Metroidvania type game, superb soundtrack and beautiful visuals. Highly recommended
Date 2023-01-09 Playtime 14h 51m Rec Positive This is a Metroidvania where you don't just explore the world, you hack and change it's very existence  Axiom Verge has hot jams, a collection of interesting weapons, and an interesting story to piece together (or just watch a Youtube video on)
Date 2023-01-09 Playtime 9h 13m Rec Positive Good metroidvania. It goes with all the aspects of it - great design, slick movement, intriguing plot. Exploration balances between game lightly leading player where to go by level design and secret hunting - just like GBA Castlevanias.
Date 2023-01-09 Playtime 28h 19m Rec Positive Overall rating/recommendation:  10/10, absolutely wonderful, a must play if you like 2d Metroidvania side-scrolling exploration games.  Summary: If fun nostalgia could be distilled into a form of alcohol, this game would be the equivalent of everclear. This game takes all the interesting aspects that defined the old school NES games and distils them to near perfection. The music, the aesthetics, the gameplay, even the “buggy” glitches and occasional flickering textures all feel like this could have been played in an NES cartridge. This game will likely take 8-12 hours to complete on the first playthrough, but also has replay value in the form of hard mode and unique challenge modes like Randomizer and Speedrun.  The Good:  -The Music.   The music alone is worth the price of this game.  The very first song that plays when I first booted up the game sent chills down my spine.  The wide array of intense soundtracks really makes this game what it is.  There’s creepy music that intensifies the dramatic tension and atmospheric melodies that make the world exploration far more engaging. There’s jammin’ beats that I found myself unconsciously bobbing my head to, and the battle music matches the rhythm of the action happening in the fights.  -The Story.  You follow the adventures of a scientist named Trace who gets whisked away into an alien world after a freak laboratory accident. Yeah you probably heard this setup before, but then it gets more interesting as you learn more about the world of Axiom Verge, and how profoundly instrumental the protagonist is even before he ever set foot in the place. There’s a few intriguing plot twists that happen as you work to uncover the mysteries of what happened to this place and why you of all people have such a crucial role in shaping its fate.  - The Gameplay.   It’s a very intense hit of nostalgia, giving off very strong Metroid vibes, but also taking a few of the old themes and doing new things with them.  For those who have played the aforementioned NES game, the exploration will feel right at home with the room layouts, minimaps, and item upgrades.  The different areas each have a distinct theme to them, and have lots of detail in the spritework tiles.  The game also uses a passcode system, but instead of having it save the game progress, it’s used to enter secret messages you might pick up from reading notes or observing your environment, which unlocks hidden pathways to explore. There’s “secret worlds” that you could glitch into like in the old NES games, but this time its deliberately implemented in ways that are very appropriate for the callback to the retro games they reference.  The Bad:  -Sound effects.  Whereas the music of this game feels like smooth peanut butter, some of the sound effects feel like nails on chalkboard.  The noises used for some enemy screams and weapon attacks are incredibly loud and abrasive, sometimes even completely drowning out the music I’ve been enjoying.  Thankfully it’s only some weapons and some enemies that have this problem.    -Completionist woes.  If you’re like me and need to 100% collect all the items and explore the map, this game is going to be an absolute miserable pain to finish without consulting a guide.  Some of the puzzles you need to solve in order to reach certain items are so ridiculously contrived that there would have been no way I could have figured it out within several hours of dedicated playtime.  Also, the icons indicating what regions have been fully explored or have all items collected are vague, just an oddly colored dot for each.  Thankfully, none of the really important items are locked in this manner, so this is more or less a minor gripe.  -Excess beam weapons. You have over 20 different main weapons to choose from (if you can find them all), each one having a unique gimmick or quirk. At first this doesn't sound like a bad thing, but a lot of them end up being completely unused.  I found I only really needed or had fun using 4 or 5 of them, with maybe  a few others for very niche situations.  It would have been cool to have the game set up so that it encouraged you to utilize some of the other weapons, either through exploration or combat. As it stands, I stuck with the default blaster for the early game, then the lightning rod mid-game to easily hit small or agile targets, and finally the flamethrower for its ability to shoot through walls and multiple enemies. Again, this is a minor gripe.  Conclusion: The amazing level of detail poured into every aspect of this game is made even more impressive by the fact that this was all developed by a single person.  Despite its minor flaws and simple scope, Axiom Verge feels like a very well polished game, one that I would recommend without hesitation to anybody that likes classic style games akin to the NES / SEGA Genesis era.
Date 2023-01-09 Playtime 21h 52m Rec Positive Otímo jogo, um metroidvania que vai quebrar a sua cabeça, itens bens escondidos. Um jogo que é simplesmente bom história muito interessante. recomendo
Date 2023-01-08 Playtime 12h 35m Rec Positive Axiom Verge мне очень понравилась, она пытается копировать ретро стиль, но при этом не такая "жестокая" по отношению к игроку как игры тех времён. Да и к тому же в ней есть механики которые редко можно встретить в других продуктах. Из плюсов можно выделить: - Графическая составляющая - Музыкальное сопровождение, меняющееся вместе с локацией, треки взяли меня за душу - Дизайн уровней - Интрига и загадочность - Игра награждает за поиск секреток - Трудно заскучать во время прохождения - Лёгкие боссы, особенно если нашёл подходящее оружие - К каждому врагу нужен свой подход Минусы: - Иногда поиск нужной комнатки в большом пространстве начинает сильно бесить и тебе не хочется полчаса а то и больше думать куда надо идти и ты тупо смотришь прохождение данной части. Но таких моментов у меня было немного. - Неинформативная карта, часто пытаешься найти место где ты не был или определить где вход пока что недоступен или же какая труба ведёт в то место куда тебе надо. Было бы круто если карта показывала куда надо идти по сюжету, не говоря уже о подсказке в расположении секретов. Итоговая оценка: 7 из 10. Игра определённо стоит своих денег !
Date 2023-01-08 Playtime 12h 1m Rec Positive A dónde chucha tengo que ir ahora?: El juego
Date 2023-01-08 Playtime 35h 18m Rec Positive Strong game, and one you probably ought to buy. Pulls together many of the tropes, visuals, and ideas of Metroid & co to create an island of great content. The varied sci-fi ideas were a real treat, as someone with  love for the genre I found a lot of joy in uncovering the notes scattered across nooks and crannies.  Not intensely long or of intense difficulty, I think this is a great casual play that embodies highlights of predecessors without being bogged down with baggage. This game stands tall and does so with inspiring vigor.  Great music to boot, but the main exploration track as soon as the player enters Kur is a particular stunner. Alien and wonderful, you will know it when you hear it.
Date 2023-01-07 Playtime 12h 50m Rec Positive Es literal Metroid pero con otro protagonista.  Buena variedad de enemigos, habilidades creativas, y lindo diseño de niveles.  Le hubiera venido bien una forma de avisar donde tenes que ir para progresar, porque hubo un par de veces en las que me perdí y no sabía por donde ir para progresar. Pero bueno, no es algo que pueda suceder tan frecuentemente.  Lo recomiendo bastante.

Date 2023-01-05 Playtime 11h 29m Rec Positive .
Date 2023-01-04 Playtime 20h 34m Rec Positive Remove the vania part from Metroidvania, I would call it an unofficial Metroid spin off, with plenty of additions and cool differences, and missing parts like a sexy Samus. As in a Metroid game I got lost and stuck and that kept me away from it for a while but then I did what I do with Metroid games, I get a map (found on the steam guides), and then I was able to enjoy this reimagining of one of the greatest games imo. I found it ideal for lightweight machines such as cheap laptops, and has kept me busy for hours long, specially battling bosses.
Date 2023-01-04 Playtime 16h 35m Rec Positive Пиксельная метроидвания? - Да, снова она, ну и что, их много сейчас. - Но не таких.  Thomas Happ это человек, который может быть примером для каждого кто захочет выпустить свою игру. Томас сделал свою игру в одиночку, от текстур и музыки, до геймплея и уровней. Речь идёт о Axiom Verge, погнали!  Безумно крутой визуал в стиле «биопанк», где стены живут, где всё движется и колышется под разнообразный бит красивейшей эмбиэнт музыки. Визуал биопанка, например можно увидеть на работах Гигера, в кинофильме «Чужой», игре «Scorn», или в современном кинофильме «Преступления будущего» (очень рекомендую). Графика игры по большей части состоит из тайлов на манер всем известной «Terraria». Но текстуры пола, стен, платформ и почти всего что окружает героя – анимированы, и хочется поверить в реальность происходящего, и что учёный в белом халате это и есть игрок.  Так вот - герой оказывается на планете Судра из-за неудавшегося научного эксперимента, и там нас встречают живые боевые машины, которые в общих чертах рассказывают герою что произошло на этой планете и ради какой цели главный герой должен взяться за оружие. В итоге как оказалось боевой машиной с телом из нанороботов стал и главный герой, и взяв пушку, которая имеет пару десятков режимов стрельбы, герой сталкивается с разнообразной монстрой населяющих планету. И если монстры в общих чертах будут знакомы опытному любителю платформеров по играм серии Metroid, то вот дополнительный режим боя встречается впервые – Disruptor. Она же глюкопушка, позволяющая как бы перекодировать биомеханическое днк созданий, населяющих мир. Одни монстры начинают стрелять в своих же, другие что были наземными – становятся воздушными. Третьи вообще замирают в нерешительности рассыпаясь на пиксели и заглючившие текстуры. Это весьма оригинальный режим, в котором можно заглючить монстру не просто для удобства боя с ней, а ещё и ради интереса, - что же будет вот с этой прыгающей розовой хренотенью если её заглючить. И учитывая, что весь мир вокруг героя живой, (даже стены!), то и для этого сгодится глюкопушка. Она позволяет пройти в секретные места, а также продвигаться по сюжету набираясь мощности после подбирания особых предметов в разных нычках. К слову о нычках, помимо дисраптора, у оружия героя есть режим лазерного бура, позволяющий крушить камень и прокладывать себе путь в различные тайнички, схроны и нычки. В них по всем канонам жанра герой находит предметы открывающие новые режимы стрельбы из главной пушки. Модификаторы, увеличивающие здоровье или урон, ну и всё такое, вы поняли. Axiom Verge в плане прокачки персонажа ближе к метроиду чем к кастлевании, поэтому у нас нет RPG образной прокачки главного героя, но есть особые предметы, которые делают его сильнее и влияющие на разнообразие игровых механик.  Так вот, игра представляет собой классическую метроидванию с бектрекингом, но геймплейно очень сбалансированную, поэтому играть в неё можно и новичкам. В игре практически не будет мест, где придётся стивнув зубы умирать снова и снова. Достаточно использовать механики там, где они необходимы. Но для любителей пострадать есть всё самое необходимое. Усложнённый режим, задротские ачивки, а также куча различных нычек, которые ещё стоит найти чтобы обчистить, плюс приходится подумать, как в них попать. А это и пиксельхантинг, и платформинг, и банальная инстуиция. Не говоря уже о том, что в некоторые места можно попасть только после нахождения определённых предметов, влияющих на механику.  Подведу итог. Потрясающая пиксельная графика с не менее потрясающей музыкой. (Которую мои коллеги по офису слышали под сотню раз за прошедший год) Отличный платформинг и разнообразный мир с населяющими его биомеханическими аборигенами. Отличная кривая сложности – пологая как Казахская степь. Играть в конце игры чуть сложнее чем в начале, но это не значит, что в начале игра возмутительно лёгкая. Впрочем, после Hollow Knight эта игра можно сказать для детей. Но это уже другая история 😊 Прошёл дважды, на свиче, и на печке.
Date 2023-01-04 Playtime 34h 24m Rec Positive A damn fine video game if ever there was one. I own this game on multiple platforms and it is an absolute joy every time. This is, without a doubt, the finest Metroidvania that is neither a Metroid or a -vania, although it VERY strongly channels the vibe of og Metroid. The visuals are great, the mechanics feel great, and the music absolutely slaps at every turn.  Absolute 10/10 video game. I give it my strongest recommendation
Date 2023-01-04 Playtime 12h 4m Rec Negative Charming platformer with a lot of potential that sadly falls flat.  This game has a lot of things going for it. The weapons, spritework and parts of the soundtrack are great. i do however have two major complaints.  - The enemy design. Some enemies are in my opinion unfairly designed. They move super quick, have small hitboxes and spam projectiles. It just doesn't feel fair. I get that it's suppose to be a throwback to the old school nes days, and I don't mind hard games, but I hate taking hits that feel unfair.  - The progression and lack of guidance. I get that you will  have some backtracking in a metroidvania game, and that is fine, as long as you don't leave the player completely in the dark. Once you've made some progress and discovered most of the areas, the game just leaves it up to you to find the next bosses and progress. You simply have to know that your latest power-up needs to be used halfway across the world in a very specific room for the game to continue. It's just tedious. Even though you have a map, it doesn't (unlike the metroid games for instance) say which particular powerup you need to enter into a specific area.   The game for me was running around lost whilst every now and then getting swarmed by small and frustrating enemies. No thanks.
Date 2023-01-04 Playtime 11h 13m Rec Positive THIS GAME IS SO AMAZING!!!  I was almost literally sucked into the game. The artstyle is sweet, most of the music tracks are bangers, and there are so many guns to collect!  If you are a Hollow Knight fan, or a fellow Metroidvaina enjoyer,  you must play it.
Date 2023-01-04 Playtime 6h 38m Rec Positive can go middling speed 5/10
Date 2023-01-03 Playtime 8h 43m Rec Negative After completing this game, I can say that this was not a very good game. The  enemies were too fast to avoid and to chunky to kill (I was playing on hard mode). The grapple mechanic was super clunky because letting go doesn't carry momentum and it will automatically let go when you hold a direction. The bosses were fun but repetitive as the best strategy for every boss (except one) is to camp one spot and hit the weak point.
Date 2023-01-02 Playtime 15h 29m Rec Positive One of the best metrovanias I've played. would say its a clone of super metroid. between 10-20 hours if you find every power-up/collectible
Date 2023-01-02 Playtime 20h 13m Rec Positive metroidvania with some interesting mechanics not available in other games
Date 2023-01-02 Playtime 7h 51m Rec Positive Enticing story, great visuals and a creative soundtrack. Those are the 3 main strengths of Axiom Verge in my humble opinion. The hub map is also a good quality of life feature in a game that lacks much in that area.  Many weapons are useless from the start, most of the bosses are not a challenge and backtracking feels worthless if you're just going after some health/power nodes.  You might get lost, but I don't think it was that bad. Having more reminder slots would be nice, especially because you sometimes need to cross the whole map to get an item that'll be used in the first area. Those minor pains accumulate a bit, but it doesn't hinder the sci-fi mystery experience of the game.  Solid experience, a bit above the average (considering current industry standards). Amazing that was made solely by one game developer. A true feat and well deserving it's cult status.
Date 2023-01-02 Playtime 19h 58m Rec Positive Super Metroid but different
Date 2023-01-01 Playtime 23h 52m Rec Positive In general its a very nice game if you like metroid(-style games).  I think the story has a nice atmosphere. But here it starts for me to get a little bit annoying: We have a game here, where you run up and down and there and back and collect tons of stuff and upgrades anyway. I dont also need even more riddles to find out the whole story. Even worse, you have to (if u wanna finish the game as perfect as possible) pick passwords from the hidden notes to open hidden passages to get all the items and upgrades. This is killing the fun for me to perfect the game. ...or even discover the whole story behind it.  I think the game would be better without all of this "hardcore hidden objects", since I am not a quantum physicist, but only a guy who wants some simple fun playing a simple metroid-style game during his little free time.  So I finished the game, but will not perfect it.   Another thing are the controls. They are not overcomplicated, but more complicated than they would have to be. There are a few thing that would REALLY need some improvement. Like the quickselect is not very intuitive. The Markers can only be removed on the spot where they are set or (my most hated favourite) you cant change the volume during the game. ...  So, yes. Alltogether the game is nice. But I am happy, to have bought it on sale. ;)
Date 2023-01-01 Playtime 12h 19m Rec Positive To the point, retro metroidvania. Interface and gameplay, all retro. Nothing new there. Game is fun, not amazing, but solid. Wacky story, which I enjoyed. Music... it keeps pulling me in...
Date 2023-01-01 Playtime 4h 8m Rec Negative A game that went too retro and picked up many of its flaws. Terrible navigation system, no fast travel, pointless weapon upgrades, oversimplistic bosses.
Date 2022-12-31 Playtime 12h 1m Rec Positive Un excelente juego metroidvania que toma inspiración de otros clásico e innova en la fórmula, aporta una experiencia claustrofóbica en un mundo alienígena corrompido.  Con múltiples secretos, armas, habilidades y mejoras en un mapa bastante extenso. Su historia comienzo de un modo intrigante y ofrece un par de finales. Una experiencia recomendable para cualquier amante de los metroidvanias.
Date 2022-12-30 Playtime 17h 10m Rec Positive If you like Super Metroid, you're going to really enjoy Axiom Verge. This was recommended to me by a friend right after I finished my umpteenth playthrough of the SNES classic, Super Metroid. A lot of elements are quite similar, but there's a very interesting story and a lot of cool items and weapons to pick up. I estimate I'm only halfway through, but I would recommend it. UPDATE: Finished the game in about 17.5 hours. Thoroughly enjoyable and there's still items to find, map to uncover, and speedrun and randomizer modes to try. Fully recommend, great game.

Date 2022-12-29 Playtime 16h 36m Rec Positive Juegazo. Es un metroidvania orientado a la acción, dejando un poco de lado el plataformeo. Realmente no lo pude soltar aunque al final casi dropeo.  Tiene un par de pifies que le impiden ser una joya. -Sobre el final la curva de dificultad empuja el juego al límite de ser un bullet hell, género que no disfruto y que sumado a sus controles toscos puede sentirse injusto. -No tiene indicador de salas completas, es decir, nunca sabemos cuando descubrimos todos los secretos de una zona. Esto hace que completar el juego al 100% sea una odisea, prácticamente imposible sin una guía.  Espero hayan corregido esto en la secuela. De todas formas lo superrecomiendo porque logró parecerse mucho a un Metroid pero implementando casi todas mecánicas nuevas, amalgamadas con una excelente ambientación y una muy muy buena historia.
Date 2022-12-29 Playtime 6h 22m Rec Negative 0/10 because of the Trenchcoat keybind. The game becomes nearly unplayable at that point. It's impossible for me to understand how there isn't harsher criticism about this.
Date 2022-12-29 Playtime 19h 34m Rec Positive Audiovisualmente es espectacular, acompañado de una historia interesante y un gameplay similar a los Metroid 2D. Diría que las primer mitad del juego es la más divertida, y de ahí va decayendo. Las zonas se empiezan a sentir repetitivas rápido, y personalmente ya la última (sobre todo por su exagerado pico de dificultad) se siente muy tedioso y se quiere terminar rápido. Lo recomiendo más que nada por su precio, porque me parece un buen juego que es más grande de lo que debería.

Date 2022-12-26 Playtime 19h 2m Rec Positive Good metroidvania, especially considering it was made by a single person, it seems. Graphics and music are very cool. The story is pretty interesting, once you get a bit into it.  As I said, a good game.... but not great. Here are a few specific things that bothered me.  - There are too many tools and bound keys you have to juggle. Some of the early tools get completely overshadowed by later tools that serve the same purpose. They could have pared it down. - The rope tool is pretty janky - Graphical design doesn't serve the story well. Various notes and lore talk about epic alien civilizations and tragic events, but all levels look like pretty generic dungeons with different tiles. Needed more flavor. - Most weapons you find are pretty lame, your first gun remains your best gun almost all the way through  Etc. Everything is there, but not quite the best it could be.

Date 2022-12-24 Playtime 14h 57m Rec Positive This game is definitely inspired by Metroid and games like it. If you're into games in that style, then you're going to love this game.  I know I love Castlevania and I'm having a blast with this.
Date 2022-12-24 Playtime 15h 16m Rec Positive An impressive display of talent from a solo dev, this is a lovingly made (albeit at times tedious) tribute to the games that came before it, particularly the original Metroid.  Starting of with the positives The games style and atmosphere is fantastic, spritework is surprisingly fluid, filters are applied when you're near secrets, the glitched atmosphere ties into game mechanics and the music is just real great!  Weapon variety is very impressive, since the vast majority of weapons are entirely optional, this provides a ton of incentive to backtrack, and man there's a lot of weapons. I'm genuinely amazed at how useful most of them were too, I may have had my favourites but I would only call a small selection of these worthless/invalidated. It's just real good.  The controls are also pretty solid, multi-directional aiming, crouching, lock in place to aim, as well as upgrades to increase your mobility option such as dashing, swapping, grappling hook. It's nothing ground breaking, but for the general gameplay purposes, felt pretty alright.  The map is absolutely full of secrets, with the filter/glitch places always being a fun surprise to stumble upon. With tons to find, I never really felt that backtracking resulted in nothing gained. The game also has some additional rewards for those who go the extra mile to bump up the completion percentage, nothing too absurd but it's always nice to see.  Now onto the less good stuff. The map is sometimes too big for its own good, or perhaps the player needs more mobility options, something to make getting around way faster/more convenient. While backtracking is an important part of this game, it just takes way too long to go back to places, especially when you find that you're missing an upgrade and you'll need to trudge along elsewhere. An easy fix to this would've been having save points or Rusulki acting as fast travel points, the one large hallway never felt like enough.  Bosses were pretty lame, and at points just tedious, with the worst example being a certain scorpion and where their hitbox is located.  And lastly, some "meh" points Story was, alright? Feeds into the general atmosphere quite nicely, but I didn't really care that much about the main struggle going on, or its conclusion, but it's not terrible.  And in regards to the movement options mentioned earlier, the grapple feels pretty horrible, the way it moves and detaches you feels at odds with how smooth the games spritework usually is, and the way you need to use it to get some upgrades, in conjunction with teleportation/swapping [spoiler]which had their own issues[/spoiler], made it my least favourite upgrade from a gameplay standpoint.  Overall, this is a very solid game which if you're looking for some real solid Run n' Gun action, and a lot of incentive to explore, I definitely think this is worth your time. Very nice.

Date 2022-12-16 Playtime 10h 44m Rec Positive Axiom Verge have a simple but solid metroidvania gameplay, the old school graphics are very well done, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing and the story will keep you hooked until the end. This is totally worth the full price.
Date 2022-12-15 Playtime 15h 29m Rec Positive Fun metroidvania that doesn't require "young" reflexes to solve. The story is fun, the challenge is manageable, it looks great, and plays well.  I had a lot of fun in all the different worlds, and it's a magical moment when the world and the story start clicking together.   The protagonist is an interesting character, although all the twists in the story are fairly obvious if you're a sci-fi buff - but they're still handled well. Combat is satisfying, though, and there is a clear power progression that makes it satisfying to find secrets, upgrade your skills/powers and get places.  There are some drawbacks; I needed a guide to finish the game in some spots, as some of the continue points aren't obvious (well, not to an oldie like me).  Some of the puzzles are really apocryphal and geared to people replaying the game all over again. Also, this game has too many guns. There's like 20 of them, and they're mostly equally ineffective or effective.  You'll find a couple you like and stick to them, meaning that your weapon wheel eventually becomes packed with rubbish.  Overall, though, an easy recommend for something you'll finish your first run easily in 10-20 hours.

Date 2022-12-14 Playtime 0h 28m Rec Negative Tedious, boring and not fun. I get it - is is a tribute to Metroid, but just so clunky and retro-in-a-bad-way. Very overhyped.
Date 2022-12-14 Playtime 8h 50m Rec Positive Bosses are a joke in comparison to other Steam metroidvanias. Game is otherwise great though. The weapons and tools are wildly unique and it was super engaging to hunt down and find out what the next one does. No fast travel, but the map design was good enough that there's a thread of sorts going through all of the zones. This is one of my favorite genres and this one's style ranks it higher on my list.

Date 2022-12-10 Playtime 18h 14m Rec Positive A great metroidvania with a cool story.  I wish it were longer though.
Date 2022-12-10 Playtime 20h 26m Rec Positive Это игра в жанре метроидвания, кто не знает что это за жанр, бегом гуглить. Но axiom в этом плане далеко не однозначный представитель в своём стиле. К примеру возьмем другие метроидвании - в них отчетливо видны механики Castlevania — с упором на ближний бой, экипировку и рпг элементами. Вдохновителем Axiom Verge все же послужила начальная серия игр метроид, меня как старого фаната Super Metroid на SNES это не могло не порадовать, отсылок и пасхалок завезли целую фуру. Пройдемся по сюжету: Некий учёный-физик по имени Трейс, как и положено многим учёным, создает прорывное изобретение, в результате работы с ним все идет по одному месту и происходит катастрофа. В процессе он телепортируется на другую планету, где с ним выходят на связь гигантские машины Русалки. Им нужна наша помощь: на мир надвигается «Ужасное Неотвратимое Зло», и только Трейс способен всех спасти. Герой нехотя соглашается помочь и на этом наши приключения только начинаются. Теперь про геймплей: С ним тут все более менее понятно. Бегаем по карте, подбираем все что плохо лежит, приобретаем новые способности чтобы пройти в ранее недоступные места, ищем секреты, в общем все по канону жанра. Арсенал вполне разнообразный, есть пушки на любой вкус и цвет. Помню, в метроид Самус сворачивалась в шарик, чтобы протиснуться в узкие туннели, в аксиоме Трейс вызывает крохотного управляемого робота, который может преодолевать узкие препятствия. Еще есть бур, с помощью которого можно пробиваться сквозь каменные преграды и грунт, а ближе к середине игры герой получает скалолазный крюк. Применение специального излучателя на противнике может открыть новые тропинки, активировать подъемные платформы или превратить опасного врага в станцию восстановления здоровья. Игра дает хорошую базу для экспериментов на локациях.  Чем дальше вы двигаетесь по игровому миру, тем чаще видите пересечения между разными этапами и находите срезки для активации специальных элементов или получения новых предметов. История развивается по мере вашего исследования давно пройденного окружения с новыми артефактами и уничтожения опасных боссов. Причем, бектрекинг здесь не является чем-то занудно-обязательным. Скорее, вы с удовольствием возвращаетесь на ранее пройденные уровни, чтобы узнать, что скрывается за ранее неприступной стеной или скоплением сиреневой слизи.  Хотелось бы так же напомнить, что эту игру разрабатывал один человек, Том Хап, в течении пяти лет! Его работу можно с уверенностью назвать подвигом. Не только потому что автор сделал и написал всё сам: музыку, дизайн, код, а потому что, всё это, у него получилось очень хорошо, аплодирую стоя товарищ!  Лично я проходил впервые эту игру примерно 10 лет назад, и решил купить её в знак уважения к автору!) Спасибо!)

Date 2022-12-02 Playtime 18h 21m Rec Positive Un apartado visual hermoso con una música genial, una historia bien escrita y un world-building increíble. Por supuesto eso es secundario si la experiencia es aburrida, lo cual, les adelante que, no es el caso.  Axiom Verge es un metroidvania y un gran proyecto creado por una sola persona con mucha pasión (y eso incluye aspectos como lo música y la historia). El juego es muy disfrutable y dejará al jugador satisfecho y con deseos de conocer más de su mundo.   Si hay algo negativo tal vez sea la gran distancia que se debe recorrer entre ciertos puntos sin tener muchos atajos, algo que puede resultar algo un tanto molesto para algunos y el hecho de que algunas mecánicas se vuelven redundantes a la mitad o el final del juego. No obstante, esos son inconvenientes menores en lo que es un juego excelente con el que pasarán un muy buen rato.  Lo recomiendo en gran medida y espero que disfruten su experiencia si se animan a probarlo.
Date 2022-12-01 Playtime 11h 36m Rec Positive Cool, Slick and a love letter to Metroid.
Date 2022-12-01 Playtime 33h 20m Rec Positive Amazing game, very VERY similar to retro metroid games, especially zero mission, the overall game design is amazing with really unique and fun upgrades for a metroidvania, but the bosses weren't that great, half of them were extremely easy or can be cheesed, one boss in particular you can stand in the corner and spam attack with having to jump to dodge something every 30-40 seconds, but a great overall experience nonetheless.
Date 2022-11-30 Playtime 13h 8m Rec Positive This is the game from the guy who loves games and understands them. It emerged straight from the primordial juice of Super Metroid and Castlevania, you can feel it in every pixel. It was surely made with love, and almost flawless - very impressive for one man. Soundtrack is also worth buying, absolutely gorgeous tracks, every one of them.
Date 2022-11-30 Playtime 13h 46m Rec Positive Yes, I'm very late to the party. I don't care.  [h1]tl;dr[/h1] This is an excellent entry into the metroidvania genre, with heavy emphasis on Metroid. It doesn't quite reach the polish of Dust: An Elysian Tail, nor the genre-defining originality of Super Metroid, but it's a good 10 hours of solid platforming fun.  [h1]The Good[/h1] [list] [*]As far as metroidvanias go, this one has some fairly unique/innovative movement tech. Of the 9ish different non-weapon tools you unlock by the end (several with uncounted upgrades), only 2 of them are stolen from Super Metroid: a high jump and a grapple beam. My favorite is the glitch dash, which gets upgraded over the course of the game from "slowly glitch through a 1-tile wall" to "mad dash in any direction for around 5 tiles and damage tiles and enemies in the way." I haven't seen anything quite like it in another metroidvania. [*]It has lots of weapons, with very few "replacement" weapons which just have upgraded capability compared to a previous weapon (e.g. your regular buster shot, but now it pierces!). By the end, I had 2-3 favorites out of around 20 weapons. [*]The setting and storytelling are appropriately grim, with the mood ranging from "serious face" to "casual conversation," but never diving into outright humor (which can ruin a story like this). [*] The pixel art is beautiful and consistent. [/list]  [h1]The Bad[/h1] [list] [*]The controls are finicky and clearly not designed with accessibility in mind. I'm fairly adept with both 2D and 3D platformer conventions, but I frequently found myself struggling to glitch dash when I wanted to and accidentally glitch dashing when I definitely didn't want to. You see, the glitch dash is accomplished by double-tapping a direction. There is no option for a button-triggered version. Aiming vertically or diagonally is also quite fiddly, but it wasn't as much of a concern most of the time. This is the main thing I'm hoping was fixed in the sequel. [*]Most of the weapons are ridiculously situational, to the point that I rarely changed away from my favorite 2-3. There is also no way to remove junk weapons from the weapon wheel, or even reorder them, so getting a new weapon and having them all shuffle around can be disorienting. [*]Despite having far more characters involved in the story than Super Metroid, the total amount of storytelling is roughly the same. This isn't a huge problem, but the setting was unique enough that I really wanted some lore to dig into. [/list]  [h1]Conclusion[/h1] I'm going to dive straight into Axiom Verge 2 and see if any of my complaints were preemptively addressed. It's clear that a lot of love and care went into this game and if the sequel shares that aspect, then it will elevate both games in my opinion. For now, I'm giving Axiom Verge a 5/7 (solid game, play if you can) with a conditional score of 6/7 (cream of the crop; prioritize playing it) for any aspiring platformer developers; it provides many examples of both good and bad design.

Date 2022-11-22 Playtime 41h 57m Rec Positive Excellent combat, cool world to explore, intriguing story
Date 2022-11-19 Playtime 115h 25m Rec Positive At first, I didn’t want to buy this game by its esthetic, but something —and a good discount— made me give it a chance, how wrong I was of not buying it before.  I played briefly Super Metroid before, and I could feel its essence throughout Axiom Verge. I really enjoyed the game mechanics —such as glitching enemies and the environment—, the upgrades, and the wide variety of weapons.   The bosses are easy once you learn their patterns, just a little few are complicated —Ukhu, I’m watching you—. The enemies are easy to beat, just a few are annoying, but not impossible to defeat.  The locations in game are quite impressive, although at the beginning I didn’t like the esthetic of this game I found myself loving it by its simpleness and the way each element composes astonishing landscapes; and with the great soundtrack composed by Tom Happ accompanying the mysterious sceneries of Sudra, you can really feel you are in an alien world —I liked the soundtrack so much that I'm always listening to it from time to time—.  I liked the story, and how the protagonist is struggling to understand his surroundings and his purpose in that unknown world. I adored the NPC’s design especially Oracca —my favorite Rusalka—, Elsenova and Katrahaska.   PS: I still can’t believe this game was entirely developed by only one person. At first, I thought Thomas Happ Games was a company with a whole team of developers —LOL—, but after watching the making of I can guarantee Thomas Happ is a great game developer after playing both Axiom Verge 1 & 2.  I absolutely recommend this modern masterpiece.  Score: 10 out of 10.

Date 2022-10-24 Playtime 6h 23m Rec Positive confusing and frustrating game you might think it's a metroid clone. It's (kinda) not. you can be surprised on many aspects of it, and disappointed on others. Some upgrades your character gets can blow your mind and make you see the game in a totally different way. it's different from the usual "you can now open blue doors". But on other points, I kinda wished a little more. Also it terribly suffers from the metroid-like syndrome: when you get an upgrade, you want to try it on every inch of the whole map, while it's acutally useful on some small cases. and if you dont play for 5 days in a row, you forget everything, and should be better off by starting the game over. good game. 6.5/10
Date 2022-10-22 Playtime 27h 1m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a Metroidvania worth checking out.   Obviously the game is inspired by Metroid (As metroidvanias should be) and takes a lot from the series overall. What I do find to stand out about the game however is the upgrades and weapon variety. The game has plenty of side paths and upgrades and a tonne of areas to explore. The exciting part is that the game shys away form your typical double jump, ground pound, dash etc in favour of more sci fi gasgets such as a gun which glitches enemies and terrain to produce a variety of effects. Don't like getting hit by lasers? Glitch the enemy and now it will damage other enemies instead.   One of the issues the game has is that you tend to get lost. Whilst that is expected of the genre due to side-paths, it's very apparent that after a portion of the game where you have been on a linear path that you must go back through some areas to find the place where you can progress. Unfortunately because of all of the sidepaths and lack of direction that the game gives you, you wind up spending far logner than you would like missing the one area you need to go in and instead go insane checking every little corner of the map. It's not a major problem as exploring is useful but this could be frustrating for players.   The controls are also worth mentioning for good and for bad. The game controls well up until a point where it stops controlling well. Initially the game feels tight. You can aim easily in set angles and you can move whilst shooting or lock your position. This all works well. What doesn't work well is that once you upgrade one of your items to enable a teleport esque dash, some idiot opted to map it to double tap a direction. So if you're moving back and forth or attempting to scooch to the edge of something, you're now going to teleport 2 feet ahead and fall off. Why this didn't get a set button is beyond me. Absolutely baffling.   Other than the previously mentioned gripes, this game takes a lot of steps to be an enjoyable scifi metroidvania full of strange creatures and even stranger weapons. The bosses are decent and the overall story is a little predictable but fitting of the game and I had a good enough time to play the game and grind out all the achievements (Which meant playing the game three times) so if it looks like something you're into, give it a whirl.
Date 2022-10-22 Playtime 12h 22m Rec Positive The progression/upgrades for it are pretty different from other games. The game in general has this whole weird/alien atmosphere nailed.  It is pretty unique for a Metroidvania game, it is worth it if you want to play a more Metroid focused game of this genre. 
Date 2022-10-21 Playtime 19h 30m Rec Positive Que experiência maravilhosa, é um jogo desafiador e divertido com um enredo cativante e estaria mentindo se dissesse que não me pegou desprevenido algumas vezes. Se você gosta de Metroidvania, você vai gostar do jogo e mesmo que não goste ainda é provável que goste, fiquei bem surpreso ao descobrir que um jogo com tamanha qualidade é falado tão pouco. Axiom Verge é um jogo bem atmosférico e com um design sonoro fenomenal o jogo te prende de uma maneira que você não quer parar de jogar e é ótimo o quanto ele te recompensa por pensar de forma experta como lidar com inimigos. Estou super para jogar Axiom Verge 2, teria pago esse preço e até mais pra jogar um jogo tão bom quanto esse.

Date 2022-10-04 Playtime 13h 42m Rec Positive It's really good. Great art, great music, feels mostly solid mechanically. It does Metroid(vania) very well.    Maybe a few too many weapons. The weapon wheel is huge and unwieldy. The dash mechanic is aggravating. I've turned off the game after accidentally dashing off a ledge. Would much rather have it tied to a button than double tapping a direction.   Solid 8/10
Date 2022-10-04 Playtime 38h 16m Rec Positive Fun platform experiencethat harkens back to the good ol' days.
Date 2022-10-03 Playtime 24h 52m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a very cool take on the Metroid action-platformer genre, with some new concepts and a pretty dark, gritty, icky atmosphere. It's really cool and great for scratching the itch of Metroid games if you've already played most or all of them, and it certainly feels a little bleaker and more atmospheric than Metroid.
Date 2022-10-03 Playtime 11h 23m Rec Positive A fun Metroid style game but the directionless backtracking put me off from finishing it. It deserves a like more than dislike though.
Date 2022-10-03 Playtime 10h 7m Rec Positive Really fun Metroid style game.  The discovery feels good and organic.  It has a very well hidden guiding hand, as any good Metroid style game should.  Definitely worth the time if you enjoy exploring and discovery in your games.
Date 2022-10-02 Playtime 17h 17m Rec Positive This was a great old school metroidvania game.  I spent around 13 hours with a 91% map completion rate.  A few hours was me being lost and unsure where to go, and there are segments of the map that are really well hidden.  I have a complete play through playlist over on my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AbawM8Q0ys&list=PLyeI2ySvSX8cNNoJyOZIGh3jszOEBpqdr
Date 2022-10-02 Playtime 14h 53m Rec Positive Great atmosphere and perfectly executed as a metroivania
Date 2022-09-30 Playtime 16h 47m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a pretty typical but very solid metroidvania and it sure wears its influences on its sleeve. It's very Metroid. This is great if that's what you want. It's not going to change your mind if this sub-genre isn't up your alley already, or if you're looking for something very unique. It's made very lovingly though.  It plays great, looks great, sounds great, has great level design and an interesting and fittingly atmospheric and sparsely told story. The one semi-unique aspect of gameplay is the hacking/glitching ability. You can glitch all enemy types in the game which changes the way they behave. Sometimes they get a new pattern, sometimes they heal you, sometimes they open up a secret in the environment etc. It's not a game changer in the genre but it's a welcome addition nonetheless and makes for some interesting changes in gameplay.   All in all a quality product, and the fact that it's made by one person is impressive as all hell. It's well worth the money in my book.
Date 2022-09-30 Playtime 31h 33m Rec Positive just like super metroid
Date 2022-09-27 Playtime 5h 14m Rec Negative I've seen many people post positive things about Axiom Verge, but only got around to playing it once I got my Steam Deck.  Honestly it's massiively overhyped.  With good Metroidvanias, where to go is, if not obvious, at least following a bit of logic and/or common sense.  For instance, in Super Metroid, where to go after getting the bomb isn't spelled out super brightly, but most people will figure out that the wall in the first cavern room looks a tad bit suspicious.  Axiom Verge utterly fails at this, as in the short time I've been playing I've already hit MULTIPLE Guide Dang It moments where I needed to look at a map.  And I'm currently completely stuck in what seems to be a No Win Scenario, because I've gotten every upgrade before the first outdoor cliffside area, and there doesn't seem to be any way to get further.  Even with a map I have no clue, as every path that would lead me to an item that would in theory allow me to progress further is behind a locked gate or an impassable jump, and I can't evenn go back to earlier areas as there's an impassable jump blocking the way to the earlier areas, which I presume is bypassed with ssome item I haven't gotten yet.  In short, I'm hopelessly stuck, and even if I did figure out how to go forward I honestly don't care as the game just isn't fun enough to warrant going through this song and dance multiple times.  Movement wise it feels like a SIGNIFICANT downgrade from Super Metroid.  Seriously, even the NES Metroid had a better feel than this crap.  Graphics wise I honestly have to say it looks pretty ugly.  That may be the point, but it still feels really half-baked, like it wants to be a ZX Spectrum game but an NES game simultaneously, while using graphical effects that an N64 would have a hard time running (mostly the fake scanlines).  Sound wise it's a mess.  First zone feels NES like, but further in the sound gets really frickin weird.  Honestly none of the tumes really were memorable, and were mostly ear-grating.  In short, if you're in the mood for a Metroidvania...keep shopping, this one's trash.
Date 2022-09-25 Playtime 6h 58m Rec Positive I don't usually like to leave reviews for games. Most of the time that I leave any sort of a review, it's because a game was so unbelievably insulting that I want to make sure no one else ever buys it. Axiom Verge made me want to leave a review in the first 15 minutes. Not for the reason that I normally leave reviews, no. For the opposite reason.  I want people to SPEND their money on this game.  If you're anything like me, someone who has played through most of the 2D Metroid games a few times and loves them, you might agree that many of the Metroidvania games made by indie developers are a bit too little Metroid and a bit too much Vania. That's not a bad thing - Symphony of the Night is a beautifully crafted masterpiece of a game - but so is Super Metroid. Axiom Verge does not have this problem.  No amount of conversation, no amount of behind-the-scenes information, nothing would EVER convince me that Axiom Verge didn't start as a Super Metroid ROMhack. This is the most Metroid Metroidvania game I have ever played that is not an official Metroid title. If you love Metroid and you're craving some more, or if you just want some really incredible exploratory platforming, please, please, please buy this game.
Date 2022-09-25 Playtime 19h 3m Rec Positive Um dos melhores Metroidvanias que seguem a base do Metroid
Date 2022-09-25 Playtime 10h 46m Rec Positive Pros: * Variative level and weapon design. * Simple but fine/interesting background music (adjust volume sliders, 8-bit tones can be painful). * Upgrades that really have an effect on your game. Both progress-mandatory (spoilers) and optional like, again, weapons and HP boosts.  Cons: * Lack of difficulty settings. * A ton of backtracking with respawning enemies without teleporting to bluntly double the gameplay time. * [spoiler]Pointless 1-2 seconds delay on an attempt to retrieve your drone.[/spoiler] * Pointless absence of weapon autofire mode on button hold to... try break player's finger? It can't run out of ammo anyways so again what is the point? * [spoiler]Very comfortless teleporting on gamepads set on the double click. Once again, in metroidvania(!) the movement skill(!) is set on the double click(!). I insistently request in the next game (3rd, as of today) the character to be moved only with the help of the gamepad gyroscope and no other way. Dream game, no less![/spoiler] * Failing to understand the reason of having separate "add 1 cell to your HP bar" and "find 6 of these to add 1 cell to your HP bar" collectibles. Make these relatively hard to find but significant.  Conclusion: test this game personally if you are okay with the pixelated visuals and 8-bit sound (the price is low). Having fun? Congratulations. Got bored or angry? Throw it into the bin. I personally got bored because of *read above*, switched on the trainer, got my save broken, uninstalled the game and marked it as "Completed".  Update: switching the recommendation from No to Yes since the game is cheap ($7.5), or on frequest occasion of discount, very cheap.
Date 2022-09-25 Playtime 4h 12m Rec Negative I see this game recommended a lot when people ask online about Metroidvanias. This game might've scratched the itch when MVs weren't as popular in 2015, but as of today, it isn't a very good example comparatively to what's out there now.  The sound design and music alone is enough for me to not recommend this game. After the 5th time hearing AHHHH ahhh AHHHH in Kur, you'll want to turn it off too.

Date 2022-09-20 Playtime 14h 15m Rec Positive Коротко и прямо - Игру крайне рекомендую, она великолепна, но есть свои нюансы.  Расширенное, личное мнение ниже:  Итак, спустя 7 лет после релиза, я наконец-то смог купить и поиграть в эту знаменитую игру! Я слышал о ней столько всего, но даже после достаточно большого прочитанного и увиденного материала, данная игра смогла меня сильно удивить. Вам знакомо выражение - "Дорога ложка к обеду"? Так вот именно это можно смело сказать про "Axiom Verge". Дело в том, что "Axiom Verge" , говоря сразу и прямо, это изумительная и увлекательная игра, но она здорово вдохновилась другой культовой игрой - "Metroid", и это стало ее огромным + и таким же огромным -.  Я огромный поклонник жанра "Метройдвания" и за свою жизнь прошел:   "Castlevania: Lords of Shadows", "Darksiders" 1, 2 , "Hollow Knight", "Ori" 1,2, "SteamWorld Dig" 1,2, "Guacameele" 1, 2, "UnEpic" (и наерное еще целую кучу подобных игр, если как следует покопаться в памяти). В общем с данным жанром я знаком очень хорошо и тут при запуске меня поразило то, что по моему первому впечатлению все предстало так, словно передо мной вновь 1997-8 год, консоль (приставка) "Сега" и все те новшества и находки жанре, которые были достигнуты за эти годы - откатились туда же, на 25 лет назад. Однако к счастью это чувство было лишь вначале и оно очень скоро улетучилось.   В общем, если кратко, то после вышеперечисленных игр я начал играть и сильно в начале разочаровался, так как -  Карта в игре есть, но она неудобная и метки или заметки ставить нельзя. Также сама карта не информирует тебя, где и, что может быть. Прокачки почти нет (есть, но она минимальная, однако это в целом для жанра норма и не проблема). Дизайн уровней не очень удобный и все приходится запоминать. Не поймите неправильно, когда голова работает в играх это прекрасно, но когда ты получил новую способность и вынужден вспоминать тучу всевозможных проходов и путей через 2 часа игры и задавать себе вопрос - куда мне блин идти?! Это не очень хорошо и сильно сбивает темп. Точек мгновенного перемещения тоже нет. Есть одна общая локация, где можно перемещаться, но лучше бы сделали возможностсь перемещаться между камерами сохранения. В общем и целом все сделано классически и в начале, лично у меня интерес почти отпал. Добавьте еще , что опять таки в начале - не очень интересные противники и оружие, все надо держать в голове, разбираться и как-то первые пол часа , что и как. В какой-то момент я задумался - может это не метройд вания, а линейный платформер, но с элементами метройдвании? Так как хотя у тебя есть ввыбор некоторый куда идти, но в целом игра +- линейна.  Однако пересилив это не очень интересное вступление, началась действительно занимательная, увлекательная история и игровой процесс начал раскрываться. Начали появляться новые способности, оружие и как я сказал выше, все начало раскрываться и наполняться цветами. Отдельно хочу отметить то, что история в игре очень классная и чем-то похожа (в хорошем смысле этого слова) на ту крутую научную фантастику, на которую опирается основной сюжет Рика и Морти. В оьщем все здорово и достойно анимационного фильма или сериала. Саундтрек также выполнен хорошо, а местами отлично.  Вердикт:  Великолепная игра, которой надо дать время, чтобы раскрыть полновесно себя перед игроком (но если вы никогда ранее не играли в подобные игры, то вас определенно может сразу зацепить). Графически и визуально все стильно и отлично. Кстати, немного напоминает стиль фильма "Чужой".  Музыка классная, но ее мало и она со временем слегка приедается. История очень интересная и как я написал выше, я бы с удовольствием посмотрел бы анимационный фильм по этой игре. Боссы слишком простые. Все работает как часы и я встретил один единственный баг с контроллеров в конце игры. Игра регулярно обновляется и прекрасно работает с ИксБокс Уан контроллером на МакОс Биг Сур и запускается на Сонома (64 битные МакОС).  Обективно: 7.5-8.0 из 10. Субъективно это 9 из 10, так как игра сделана целиком и полностью 1 человеком и в целом она очень крутая. Лично я получил огромное удовольствие.
Date 2022-09-20 Playtime 23h 18m Rec Positive This game is awesome. I absolutely loved this game. This literally plays so much like metroid and you can tell the dev put a lot of love and work into this game. It does enough different to very much be its own game from metroid but still feel like your playing metroid and I love it. The graphics, play style, and the soundtrack feel like im playing on a NES/SNES in between. If your looking for a game thats metroidvania and has the difficulty level of a classic metroid game, that is THIS game!  I have played a large array of metroidvanias some are just too hard and sucks the fun out of it for me, but this game is actually good. Highly recommend.
Date 2022-09-19 Playtime 8h 25m Rec Negative I hate this game.  I hate the unsatisfying sound mixing that only gives sound cues when it's annoying you about your low health.  I hate the wonky controls.  I hate the enemies that are super tiny and colored to blend into the environments.  I hate the questionable checkpoints.  I hate having 7 weapons (so far) and ALL of them feel not fun to use.  I hate the miserable giant head fast travel.  I hate how unsatisfying finding new items is.  I HATE BEING LAUNCHED UPWARDS PAST THE VISIBLE PART OF THE SCREEN INTO ENEMIES I DIDN'T KNOW WERE THERE WHO TAKE POTSHOTS AT ME AND THEN FLY OUT OF RANGE FASTER THAN THE BULLETS GO.  It is clear this is meant to be a tribute to Metroid.  I knew Metroid, and you sir, are no Metroid.

Date 2022-09-17 Playtime 11h 30m Rec Positive available on Mac !!!
Date 2022-09-17 Playtime 13h 0m Rec Positive Played here and on Playstation. I beat Metroid and Super Metroid back on both their respective systems and time periods. There is a reason the genre is called a Metroidvania.  This is probably the closest feeling I've had in a long time to this genre to those titles. The gameplay is flawless. While it takes a bit of getting used to the controls, the actual response and ratio of speed (You vs Them) is almost identical. The movement feels just right, no over/understep on the direction swap or fall. The weapons in this game are very unique, as are the upgrades which is a VERY refreshing thing to see. This doesn't give you the feeling you're shooting the same gun meta. Their interaction with the environment feels like this team took what the essence of Metroid's exploration system and went further.  The sound engineering and songs are amazing (Not gonna lie, the YouTube account has this soundtrack playlist pinned somewhere). Effects added in, it's very atmospheric. The graphics are a beautiful nod to what this genre started from, but don't push you to far in style to make if feel "modern".  A must have if you find yourself love being absorbed by Metroidvanias. You know this team does too.
Date 2022-09-15 Playtime 9h 50m Rec Positive I've heard a lot of good things about Axiom Verge. It's a decent Metroidvania, but it has a lot of design choices that annoy me. Some examples include: No Quicktravelling System, arbitrarily hidden items/weapons and puzzles you need to solve outside of the game. (Like translating a language) - I'm not a fan of hiding items/upgrades in walls, especially if there's no scanner item to find these without guides. I'm really big on completing games without needing to google, and this just wasn't feasible for this game, so I've deducted a lot of points. I'm also not a fan of double tap to teleport into a direction, it was really clunky, just like the grappling hook. It's a shame, too, because the game is gorgeous, the atmosphere is incredible, the story is intriguing and the music is great, too.  7/10

Date 2022-09-10 Playtime 10h 37m Rec Positive Action platforming at its finest! I give it a solid 8.5 out of 10. I haven't got that far yet so I can always give it a higher grade later. Controls well, plays well, average music compared to other games in this genre. Havent came across much story in this game which is hurting its score at the moment.
Date 2022-09-10 Playtime 49h 2m Rec Positive [list] [*]Good Exploration [*]The Metroidvania routing is pretty good, and doesn't let you get extremely lost if you keep pushing into new territory, for the most part [*]The optional side upgrades are meaningful, but not so much you'll need all of them to tackle the final boss [*]Satisfactory combat [*]The music does a good job of setting the tone IMO [*]Decent Lore [/list]

Date 2022-09-02 Playtime 26h 20m Rec Positive Nice, fateful recreation of the old school metroid games.  Made a bit better with the weapon variety.  You only need like 2 or 3 to progress that you get really early, the other 10+ weapons are just bonus stuff.  Some are kinda meh, but depends on how you use them.  Got a boss that shields his weak point?  There's a weapon that pierces, if you can find it.  Story isn't bad either.   Even a passcode system where you more or less unlock secret paths and notes.  The world is immersive and feels alive, really makes you want to explore and find more. 10/10, buy the damn game

Date 2022-08-26 Playtime 17h 17m Rec Negative 还好吧，玩着有点累的游戏。不是很推荐，原因： 1，没有指引，需要反复跑路尝试，容易烦躁，而且有的关卡推进，会需要一些极限的操作，在成功之前会让人疑惑这里是不是现在该来的地方，可是又没有其他地方能去了。 2，操作有些复杂，能力太多了，手柄按不过来，瞬移需要快速连晃摇杆，都快赶上玩格斗游戏了。 3，很多武器意义不明，那么多武器，只有两三把好用的，要么伤害高，要么范围广，怼着怪物打。其他的要么伤害低，要么意义不明。 4，如果能标注下可收集物品就好了，打通游戏地图探索93%，物品收集77%，但实在没动力在挨个角落去挤去钻去试隐藏空间了。
Date 2022-08-25 Playtime 1h 13m Rec Negative Very underwhelming experience. What spoiled the fun for me was the insane amount of backtracking which very quickly felt like a chore, lack of any indication of progress and direction where I should be going, and enemies that are just annoying instead of challenging.
Date 2022-08-25 Playtime 12h 49m Rec Positive I'm 9 hours in and I'm so hooked. The gameplay is so fun, all the bosses so far have had awesome desings (although they where kinda easy, I haven't played any boss more that 5 times and I'm playing on hard mode) The abilities are so unique and very different from other metroidvanias. The art is gorgeous, and the music is amazin. Just play it, it aint that expensive of a game.  
Date 2022-08-24 Playtime 17h 0m Rec Positive Si
Date 2022-08-24 Playtime 12h 39m Rec Positive This game delivers on being more than just a metroidvania, with a wealth of inventive weapons and bosses that seemed to be just the right amount of difficulty I found myself almost always having a good time. Exploration is rewarded and Axiom Verge is great at keeping you remembering about areas you couldn't get to before that you can after getting that one upgrade you needed. Most weapons are versatile while simultaneously allowing for certain weapons to excel in certain combat scenarios. Amazingly crafted experience, 100% recommend playing.
Date 2022-08-21 Playtime 11h 3m Rec Positive Классный сюжет, музыка, интересные механики. Рекомендую!
Date 2022-08-17 Playtime 25h 25m Rec Negative Ok so like this totally has that old school Super Metroid vibe. Nails it.  The issue is that it's just not all that fun to play.  Lots of pew pews and cool upgrades, but after a certain point it just became a chore to play.  More of a neutral review than negative, but it didn't hold my attention to complete the entire game. So can't personally recommend but you may disagree. I don't care. 5/10 :)

Date 2022-08-16 Playtime 7h 15m Rec Positive Fun game with some depth in the weapons and story. Playing it so I can play the sequel released last week. Playing on the Deck so its smooth as butter. 9/10 would recommend.
Date 2022-08-15 Playtime 13h 38m Rec Positive Really great game for fans of Metroid and other games in a similar vein (Hollow Knight, Ori, etc).
Date 2022-08-15 Playtime 4h 56m Rec Positive Sure.
Date 2022-08-15 Playtime 9h 53m Rec Negative ok, i love this game, but whatever made the dev think a ten second respawn animation was a good idea deserves a thumbs down, cos seriously, it is annoying as fuck.
Date 2022-08-14 Playtime 24h 10m Rec Positive I do not get to have an opinion and if I do, it is to be rejected.
Date 2022-08-13 Playtime 22h 14m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a game that I’ve come to love and has gone on my list of legendary games that I would go back and play years later. I’ve enjoyed this game thoroughly from start to finish, and I appreciate the amount of effort and care put into several aspects of it. It’s a Metroid Vania style game that has everything that I would have wanted in the genre. You have a large, alien world to explore with tons of items and powers to collect, a lot of secretes to uncover, and a lot of very cool upgrades! If you are a fan Metroid, I think this game will be right up your alley.  The above is pretty much my TL:DR, because this review is VERY long. Sorry, I had a lot to say about the game. Feel free to skim it if you want to.  The Story:  I liked the story and the characters. What I really like about the story is that not too much is thrown at you to start. The game allows there to be a sense of mystery that has to be uncovered as you progress. Your main character is an average guy named Trace who gets thrown into a peculiar situation after an accident in his laboratory.  As Trace goes on in his adventures on an alien world called Sundra, he also makes friends with some strange, monolithic machines called Rusalki who help him out on his journey. The Rusalki are friendly, but they still give you this uneasy feeling because of how otherworldly they are. It puts Trace in an odd situation because these Rusalki seem to want to be allies, but you’re never sure if you can entirely trust them at the beginning. I think the relationship between the Rusalki and Trace was well done. Trace also maintains a sense of humor even considering the strangeness of his situation. I found him to be an enjoyable character overall and he provided a decent amount of comedy relief.  The Gameplay:  The gameplay is also solid and very fun. It nails the feel of a Metroid Vania quite well and, as a huge Metroid fan myself, I feel right at home with how the game plays. The controls are tight and responsive. There was never a time that I felt like I had died unfairly due to poor controls, and that is very important to a Metroid Vania. The shooting is great and feels powerful. I enjoyed blasting away at the baddies that Sundra throws at you.  The game also introduces a lot of interesting mechanics and super cool upgrades. I was going to talk about the specifics of what those upgrades are, but I decided not to spoil them because discovering them is really fun. Basically Axiom Verge introduces a lot of mechanics and upgrades that goes against the grain of what you would expect in Metroid. For example, how you would go about getting through small, tight spaces is different than what you would expect if you’ve played Metroid before. Once again, not spoiling it. Honestly, I thought the upgrades and mechanics were super cool and unique. I had a lot of fun playing around with them, doing a bunch of cool tricks and getting to places that I’m not suppose to. There was even one instance that I got stuck in a pocket somewhere and couldn’t get out. I had to reset the game to get out lol. Don’t worry though, there was only that specific instance. The areas are well designed, so you shouldn’t be getting stuck like I did. :P  Art and Music:  Likely my most favorite part of the game is the art direction and the music. And absolute stellar job was done on the pixel art. I really dig the look and feel of the game and love the NES style pixel art. The music is also good. Both the art and music combined help drive the unnerving, strange, and alien feel of Sundra. Each area of Sunda also have their own unique look. They feel alien and unsettling. I’m very happy that special attention was put on this part of the game, because I don’t think Axiom Verge would have it’s unique identity without it. The world of Sundra is very dark and strange, and I absolutely love it.  The Bosses:  The bosses overall were good. Their designs were really cool and like everything else on Sundra, they were unsettling and alien looking. I also felt that fighting them was fun overall. However, there is some things to be desired. For one, they weren’t very difficult. I never had much issues taking them down on hard difficulty, except maybe one particular boss. I think the reason for this is because their attack patterns were very simplistic. They never really attacked you in interesting ways, so they were very easy to predict. Also, the final boss was kind of disappointing. I won’t spoil what the final boss is, but I took the final boss down easily without loosing hardly any health. Overall kind of disappointing, but I can’t complain too much more about it. The bosses were ok.  The Collectables:  Axiom Verge provides you with a lot of items and powerups to find. The world of Sundra is packed full of them and there are plenty of hidden areas and secrets to find. This is yet another aspect of the game that I really enjoy, and it simply wouldn’t be a Metroid Vania without an expansive world to explore and secrets to uncover. I really enjoyed scouring the world of Sundra to find as many hidden powerups, weapons, and notes as I could. Unfortunately, I didn’t manage to find all of them haha.   Among the powerups you get, there are also a lot of weapons to collect. When I say there are a lot, I mean there are A LOT. Axiom Verge just throws them at you, and you end up with a very impressive arsenal by the end. I didn’t manage to collect all of the weapons either, but I didn’t really want to. Unfortunately, this is one of those instances where too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing. It might seem awesome to have this huge arsenal at your disposal, but after experimenting with all these weapons and using some of them for certain niche situations, I’ve found that when it boils down to it, only 2 of them are worth using in most cases; the Axiom Disruptor and the Kliver. The Axiom Disruptor because it’s your bread-and-butter weapon that works well in the majority of situations and does a ton damage once you collect a lot of the power nodes. It’s possibly the best weapon in the game imo. The kliver because it’s a short-range weapon that dishes out a lot of damage, and you can hit things through walls with it. I used this weapon a lot when dealing with those annoying zombie enemies and used the walls and platforms as cover when hitting enemies through them. Besides those two weapons, the rest of the weapons are either niche, redundant, or just flat out useless unfortunately. Cool idea, but I think Axiom Verge would do better without most of the weapons. They became difficult to sort through and I eventually had no desire to use most of them. Its disappointing but oh well.  If you managed to read my ridiculously long review, I congratulate you! Axiom Verge is a fantastic game. Certainly not a perfect game by any stretch, but it still has won a special place in my heart. I really enjoyed it, and I highly recommend it if you like Metroid Vania style games.
Date 2022-08-13 Playtime 14h 7m Rec Positive One of the best games you'll ever play, right up there with best Metroidvanias like Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night. Enjoyable from start to finish, very replayable too. Honestly the best game to come out in the last 19 years.

La ambientación es excelente y perderse es un gusto, totalmente recomendado a cualquier amante del genero pero dificilmente a casuales.

Apenas alguns dos efeitos sonoros podem ser irritantes, por ter um estilo 8-bits, mas é um dos melhores Metroidvanias que já joguei! Quem curte jogos com o estilo do Metroid, vai gostar muito desse!
Date 2022-08-05 Playtime 1h 50m Rec Negative I didn't play enough of it to get the game a rating.  I'm not a fan of Metroidvania games and this one didn't turn me. Too much running back n forth for my taste. I must have run down the same hallway 40 times, which isn't fun.  Other than that is seemed like a good game. Different weapons and abilities, different looking environments and cool bosses. If you love MVania games, this is probably for you, just not for me
Date 2022-08-02 Playtime 9h 25m Rec Positive Puts the metroid in metroidvania
Date 2022-08-01 Playtime 11h 36m Rec Positive Great!
Date 2022-07-31 Playtime 21h 37m Rec Positive La mayoría de la gente compara éste juego con Metroid, no he jugado ninguno así que pondré mi punto de vista de haber jugado otros Metroidvanias... el mapa es largo pero no da la sensación de inmensidad como puede dar "Hollow Knight" por ejemplo.  La lucha es más fácil que la media por tener armas a distancia con munición infinita y corto alcance potentes, aun así es desafiante por los tipos de enemigos y su complicada localización sin llegar a ser un hardcore que te deja atascado en una pantalla 1 hora (Lo cual te podría pasar por buscar secretos o la forma de continuar a veces).   Los jefes son desafiantes sino tienes el arma adecuada, sino excepto el antepenúltimo son fáciles de hacer sin daño.  La Música es muy buena, se queda de inquilino en tu cabeza y no en el mal sentido. La traducción no es exacta, conociendo inglés sé que hay notas que indican cosas completamente distintas pero no llegan a afectar negativamente a las pistas para pasarse el juego. (Si acaso la falta de guía) Para mi tiene mucho atractivo y ha sido una experiencia que me ha animado a acabarlo en una sentada (de un par de días), espero que la reseña sea útil.
Date 2022-07-31 Playtime 75h 26m Rec Positive Fun metroidvania. Endgame gets a bit boring.
Date 2022-07-30 Playtime 6h 59m Rec Negative думал, что axiom verge -- это ностальгическая научно-фантастическая метроидвания в вызывающей мурашки эстетике некроготики, но оказалось довольно таки противно... неприятное управление с абсолютно дрянным откликом на геймпаде; пропитанный истасканностью недосюжет; дурацкий левелдизайн, как и процесс босс-файтов; аутентичная, но впивающаяся с пагубностью паразита своей монотонностью музыка: извечно пикающая, приторная, гудящая сyка по ушам. Единственное что дóлжно признать славно проделанным -- это чёткая, подходящая и адекватная эксплуатация тематики олдовых 2d платформеров; но в остальном видеоигру хвалить не за что; за недалекий гейм-дизайн и бестолково однокнопочный геймплей? мы в 90-ых что ли?   4/10
Date 2022-07-30 Playtime 12h 52m Rec Positive Very nice metroidvania that can get quite intense and quite hard at times. Lots of secrets to find and stuff to figure out. Multiple ways to pass through walls which makes it rare to be blocked and not know what to do. Music is very good, controls are tight. You really feel your character becoming more powerful as time goes on and it feels good to explore the map and fight items!
Date 2022-07-27 Playtime 6h 38m Rec Positive Metroidvania that kicks your butt. Love it!

Date 2022-07-24 Playtime 9h 50m Rec Positive [h1]Explore and explode things in this strange alien world[/h1]  Plus you'll get good pixel graphics to keep things simple and crisp, a basic mysterious story and some extra bass in the tunes to get you pumping and going.  Best of all is the exploration. They really nailed the concept here especially for a 2D game. At first, level discovery is at a minimum but it will become a bit more complex up around a quarter of the way through the game. The level design is great, going deep in caves, finding ruins of long lost civilisations, you will find a lot of secret areas and hidden items. Upgrades and skills can be found frequently and those can emerge new paths in the levels. For example one of the items is called an "Address Disruptor", it will clear glitch debris that blocks your path or it can glitch the enemies in weird ways like shooting super slowly. Enemy variety is also quite diverse.  Like I said it doesn't get old, well until you get near the end of the game that is. During that time it can be frustrating hunting those tiny areas in the map that are left. Sometimes you can traverse the whole map for a small upgrade that is not worth your time. There are no quest markers included, no logs, this is an old school game after all. You just have to figure where to go next.  Axiom Verge is short at about 10 hours for the first playthrough. It can be a challenge to finish this and there's even a hard mode for the pro players out there. While it's not replacing the classic Metroid, this is a game that I can recommend especially if you like or are curious about classic metroidvania type games.

Date 2022-07-22 Playtime 0h 8m Rec Positive I don't want to play through this again just for the sake of acquiring Steam stats, but the game itself is great, and a fairly perfect example of what Metroidvania can be.   My main reason in writing this? It definitely works great on the Steam Deck. Just thought you should know.

Date 2022-07-19 Playtime 14h 47m Rec Positive Fantastic game, to me it felt exactly as what a good metroid game is similar to super metroid, probably going to have to try the randomizer mode some time as it seems really fun.
Date 2022-07-19 Playtime 4h 44m Rec Positive Intriguing story, nice art direction, solid weapon gimmicks  fun to play if you like metroidvanias
Date 2022-07-19 Playtime 43h 22m Rec Positive I played the game and I still don't remember what the axiom verge is.  oh yeah and the music goes hard
Date 2022-07-18 Playtime 1h 6m Rec Positive It can be due to me being an 80's kid and growing up playing Metroid. But this game I REALLY liked ALOT!! It brought back so many memories. Thank you SO VERY MUCH!!! Being able to get them feelings back when I thought I would never play a game again that would bring all them feelings back ever again. Pls update it to like add more to the game. Like maybe a new area with new levels and designs and add some new enemies. That would be so great. Even if you dont its still such a fun game for me. So if you like stuff like the Metroid games and castlevaina then this is a must have for true platformer gamers like myself
Date 2022-07-16 Playtime 30h 55m Rec Positive A little bit weird but the metrovania design is fantastic.
Date 2022-07-16 Playtime 34h 55m Rec Positive As experiências que tive com jogos Metroidvania foram poucas (principalmente jogos Metroid para GBA e Hollow Knight), mas sempre foi um estilo de jogo que me interessou. Assim, sempre ouvi falar de Axiom Verge. Sempre que me deparava com o pouco que conhecia do jogo, tinha a impressão de que seria algo mais voltado ao terror, algo mais sóbrio em geral. Para minha surpresa, nos primeiros minutos de jogo, encontrei um jogo sem medo de ser "bobo". Não há medo, até mesmo, de brincar com glitches do jogo, que são integrados à gameplay. A história consegue navegar bem entre um épico e um mistério sobrenatural em que você se sente apenas mais uma engrenagem. A gameplay é fluída, o que pode até incomodar em dados momentos; não acho que sempre combine com o estilo retrô do jogo. No quesito Metroidvania popriamente dito, o jogo investe muito na exploração, e num estilo que não tenta guiar o jogador. Muitas descobertas e conquistas completistas só tem pistas discretas espalhadas pelo jogo. Pode ser irritante, mas tem um charme incomum que já não se vê mais hoje em dia.  Em geral, uma ótima experiência; um feito e tanto para seu desenvolvedor, alguém que aparenta ser tão criativo e obstinado quanto o protagonista de sua obra.  Nota: 8/10.
Date 2022-07-16 Playtime 8h 6m Rec Positive people compare this to metroid but this has so much more texture and flavor that it's really its own thing 0/10 too hard
Date 2022-07-15 Playtime 5h 18m Rec Positive For some reason my hours are not accurate and it might have to do with the fact that I played this game on offline mode, however know that I did beat this game fully. I really enjoyed this game, I always recommend it to anyone I know that likes Metroid or Metroidvanias for that matter. I usually dont tend to play a lot of these kinds of games because they are not my most favorite genre ( I do like Metroidvanias however I rather play different styled games) but this one really got me sucked in! I think its amazing that it was made by 1 person because this feels like a multi team effort, this game borrows from the metroid franchise more than any other game since It was made by a person that worked on Another Metroid 2 Remake however this game stands on its own totem. The Map Layout is very well designed and a pretty good size, you have multiple different weapons to choose from which all have their use depending on the situation you run yourself into, you get different abilities as well. The story is pretty good too [spoiler] with an unexpected twist at the end that I didnt really see coming [/spoiler] The soundtrack in the game is amazing and really adds to the atmosphere too! Speaking of, the atmosphere is pretty damn good! The sound design is also very good! You can really tell this game was made with a lot of passion. Before the rise on Metroidvania style games (and lack of a new 2D metroid game), I used to call this game the modern Metroid. If anything this game established the standard to all other indie games of how a metroidvania should be made. Buy this game! Either on sale or full price! Its honestly worth the money IMO.
Date 2022-07-14 Playtime 26h 34m Rec Positive Probably one of the best Metroidvania's I've ever played.  Story is really cool, mechanics are insanely creative.  The randomizer is also extremely fun and gives the game a lot of replayability.

Date 2022-07-04 Playtime 13h 15m Rec Positive it gud
Date 2022-07-03 Playtime 11h 10m Rec Positive I'd recommend the game, but I would only recommend it if you have a high BS tolerance. The game is super fun until you get to late game then it becomes unbelievably stupid. The sentinel boss fight is what pissed me off. It shoots homing projectiles and while those projectiles are still out the boss shoots some more. Meaning that you'll try and dodge it but end up getting hit by the one that just spawned. Combine that with the dash that requires you to double tap a direction and you will end up accidentally dashing into a projectile. The dev also thought it would be a good idea to not have a save room right next to some of the difficult bosses. I got so pissed I turned on god mode, because screw getting achievements. This game truly feels like the dev was the only one who playtested this game. It also feels like you'll only have a rough time unless you get all the hidden upgrades, which would only be possible on a first playthrough if you asked Mr. Google for help. late game completely ruins the fun. 6/10
Date 2022-07-03 Playtime 8h 8m Rec Positive Is it basically the original Metroid? Obv, but with enough twists and improvements to make it great.
Date 2022-07-03 Playtime 18h 48m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvania games
Date 2022-07-02 Playtime 7h 23m Rec Negative The bosses are goddamn garbage, trapping the player in a pit without the possibility to escape until they find the next movement upgrade is annoying and frustrating and even though humans can see roughly 200 million different colors, the devs seemed convinced that monotonous colorschemes for rooms are nice. Pink rooms with pink enemies that shoot pink projectiles neither help your survivability nor increase your fun while playing but I guess it looks...interesting.  I seriously don't know what went through their heads while making this game but I'm pretty sure it sounded a lot like static noise.
Date 2022-07-02 Playtime 18h 28m Rec Positive One of my favorite metroidvania. Good story, good music, good control, great pixel art. A must pick.
Date 2022-07-01 Playtime 27h 59m Rec Positive good game

Date 2022-06-30 Playtime 57h 30m Rec Positive One of the best games I have played. I find no fault with. The gameplay is amazing, fluid and responsive. The story and narrative are absolutely amazing, the world building and the data/material/reality themes deep. I only have a small pet peeve with the game: it lacks a fast travel system and the large chamber at the middle of the map is clunky at best. Other than this, it's a 10/10 for me.
Date 2022-06-30 Playtime 15h 50m Rec Positive ta cheengon
Date 2022-06-29 Playtime 12h 9m Rec Positive Extremely awesome both in terms of aesthetics and exploration. The game gives you a ton of weapons which is both a blessing and a curse. it's cool that you get so much. But the amount of diversity is impossible to balance around and the gameplay suffers as a result. The level design is also kinda questionable. Not every room has a purpose or felt carefully placed. Also giving the player a drill is a very bad idea. the game would have been a lot less tedious if not for the possibility of hidden walls. In AV2 I hope the developer learns from these to elevate one of the most stylish metroidvanias to the heights it belongs
Date 2022-06-29 Playtime 16h 22m Rec Positive If there is one word to describe this game, it would be beautiful. The artwork is stunning, and each area in the game is very distinct and interesting. It's a really well-made Metroidvania, and seems to be closer to the original Metroid and Castlevania games than some of the other recent Metroidvanias (like Hollow Knight or Blasphemous).  Literally the only gripe I have with the game is, and I'll try to explain this without spoiling anything, double-taps. One of the abilities you get later on is triggered by double-tapping the joystick in a direction, and I personally find it a bit finicky.  Other than that, the game is both extremely fun and visually stunning. Its story is intriguing, its enemies are varied, and its locations are interesting. If you're a fan of Metroidvanias, I'd recommend picking this one up.
Date 2022-06-27 Playtime 53h 59m Rec Positive As good as a metroidvania gets.
Date 2022-06-26 Playtime 9h 7m Rec Positive Well, the metroidvania indie scene starts here, and for good reason.
Date 2022-06-26 Playtime 8h 2m Rec Positive Definetly my favourite Metroidvania of all time, the atmosphere and vibe are just immaculate. The visuals, soundtrack and story bits do so much to deliver the world of the game. The first time i played the game and picked up my weapon, i got the chills when the music kicked in and the world started looking alive and organic I have played a lot of this on my switch already and now got it on PC too cuz of the summer sale and its even better. There's a few things that aren't perfect of course, like for example the Grapling Hook which feels really uncomfortable to use, but for 98% of the Game everything is wonderful. It's not really difficult, beside 1 or 2 moments in the game, at least imo but difficulty is pretty subjective. Exploration also feels really rewarding because of some hidden weapons being especially effective in certain situations or bossfights. Every area in the Game has visually and mechanically unique enemies, soundtracks and backgrounds that really sell the world for me. Completing the game is kind of difficult because you wont know where items are missing, beside knowing in which of the big areas an item is missing. I strongly recommend playing with a Controller because it just doesnt work really well with Keyboard because its probably intended to be played with a Controller. The built-in randomizer (the fact that the dev did this is just crazy to me) provides a lot of replayability and also comes with 3 difficulties for Casual players, Experienced players and People that know close to everything of the games exploits and secrets. Side note: All of the backgrounds animations and the line or "heartbeat" on the HP bar are in Sync to the area's respective Soundtrack which is just beyond satisfying. I would rate the Game: 10/10 Visuals 10/10 Soundtrack 9/10 Mechanics 9/10 Replayablity For a total of 9.5/10 
Date 2022-06-25 Playtime 47h 10m Rec Positive Insanely good! Amazing story, amazing gameplay, and a great sense of achievement once you finish it!
Date 2022-06-24 Playtime 16h 3m Rec Positive I’m really not too big on metroidvanias, as they often leave me overwhelmed and stuck in a state of ‘choice paralysis’ on which area to explore next. To be honest with you, that’s exactly how I felt with Axiom Verge for the first few hours. The progression felt slow and I became easily frustrated by the lack of direction.  Despite that, the longer I stuck with the game, the more fun it was. I came to appreciate the interconnectedness of the areas, along with the superb soundtrack, which has been stuck in my head ever since I started playing. The variety of weapons and tools is also a treat, and it’s really fun to find all of the health, damage, and range upgrades scattered throughout the map and hidden in the most inconspicuous places.   One of my favorite parts of Axiom Verge is how it much rewards you for backtracking and visiting earlier parts of the game by using your newly acquired abilities to discover areas that were previously out of your reach. I loved this aspect of Axiom Verge so much that I had apparently traversed 95% of its entire map by the time I reached the end, according to the personal statistics shown after beating the game.  Whether you’re a big fan of metroidvania games, or are just looking for a retro side-scroller to sink your teeth into, Axiom Verge is pretty alright. I am looking forward to Axiom Verge 2 being added to Steam this August, and I hope it meets the standards of this game :^)  9/10
Date 2022-06-23 Playtime 5h 51m Rec Positive Not my favorite Metroid, but well put together with great visual style.
Date 2022-06-23 Playtime 9h 41m Rec Negative The grapple beam just really did this game in for me. Push the control too far left or right? Disconnect. Fall. Lose your progress. It's absolutely infuriating. You want to make a Super Metroid game?  Use Super Metroid mechanics. Grapple beam holds you to a specific point until you let go of the button. Here I am trying to climb *insert anything at all* and my beam shuts off and I plummet 100 meters. Either add grapple points to where you want us to climb (without the *dink* sound effect after i'm already up there) or fix your grab angles.

Date 2022-06-16 Playtime 25h 7m Rec Positive Metroidvania AF. It's short, fun, has backtracking. I love the music and the designs. It left me wanting more content to play and the Randomizer mode scratches that itch nicely. Sequel comes to Steam in Aug '22 and I'm stoked.
Date 2022-06-15 Playtime 4h 37m Rec Negative Gets boring after a while, and I say that as someone whose favorite game series ever is Metroid. You should honestly just go play that instead.  Music is good though.
Date 2022-06-15 Playtime 27h 30m Rec Negative I can only recommend this game for die-hard Metroid fans.  I have to admit that my opinion of this game has softened since my initial playthrough, over 5 years, ago, but I still don't like Axiom Verge.  I want to acknowledge the positives of this game first. The basic controls, movement and button inputs, are fluent and precise, which works for the platforming challenges in some of these areas. I also like most of the different weapons you can unlock, most of which helped me in creative ways. The best one was definitely the flamethrower, which took down even the toughest enemies in just a split second. Also, if we're looking at the graphics from an ARTISTIC perspective, I like the how the pixelated art-style and cold, muted color scheme create a bizarre alien planet. Then, of course, the music is fantastic, which I can only describe as disco with an edgy mood, in a good way.  However, the rest is too advanced for anyone other than a Metroidvania expert. First off, the graphics, from a GAMEPLAY perspective, keep copying and pasting the same blocks and patterns throughout an entire area, making it difficult to figure out where you are. On top of that, there's many road-blocks where they expect you to get upgrades in order to progress. They allow your character to either "hack" areas of glitchy, static space, or phase through walls. Sound cool? Well, here's the kicker: these abilities need to be upgraded at least 2 or 3 times, so while you can go to some areas, others require that you go out of your way to make your abilities stronger. This kind of design leads to a lot of back and forth, as well as frustration that you STILL can't explore certain areas after getting the proper upgrades.   Next, while the weapons are good for attacking enemies, it doesn't take away the fact that most of them just blindside you out of nowhere, which always results in taking damage. So if you're low on health, and you get jumped by an enemy, you die and get sent back to the last checkpoint. Also, the game gives you about 20 different weapons, but some end up inferior to others, so there's no reason to use them, except for the small tutorial sequences.   Then, you end up having TOO many abilities at your disposal, which leads to a lot of hand cramps. You see, other upgrades you can get include a grappling hook for swinging on ceilings, and bombs that essentially replace your hacking gun, another example of redundancy. The problem is this control scheme gets so crowded with all of these different abilities, that it goes from comfortable, to "fingers in pretzels." The grappling hook requires all of these complicated button combinations to maneuver your character in this or that direction, and the timing is too pixel-perfect to avoid falling back to the ground. The bombs are assigned to pressing down on the control stick; so if you're pressing down to enter a pipe on the floor, ducking, or even aiming your gun downwards, you end up unintentionally using the bombs and running out of them before the segments where you NEED them.  Finally, the story is good, but the structure is not straight forward at all. It's an interesting plot and cast of characters that explores deep ideas, and the cutscenes do a lot to carry the intrigue. However, if you've played Metroid Prime, this game makes the same narrative choice of putting all the important backstory in hidden data-logs. Even if you manage to find all of them, you're expected to stop and basically read a glossary every 20 minutes. Another annoying addition is that some of these data-logs are written in alien languages, so you have to go out of your way to find passwords just to translate them. This ends up leaving the main story feel unfinished and too vague to get invested.  If you love the Metroid series, or Metroidvania action-adventure games in general, and any of this sounds fun or interesting to you, then give it a shot. This game caters to that crowd so much, that I'm sure many of them would consider this another great entry in the genre. But anyone outside of that demographic is going to get either bored, frustrated, or confused in the first 2 or 3 areas, because Axiom Verge does not take newcomers or casual players into consideration.
Date 2022-06-12 Playtime 16h 0m Rec Positive This game looks like a metroid/castlevania game as per usual.  HOWEVER !!! The plot, story & general reality of this game quickly evolves/devolves into a world unlike anything you've ever seen before. In this game there's a item you eventually get that lets you "HACK REALITY"  It's not a cheat, IT'S PART OF THE GAME! There is no fourth wall to break. You actually have to "Warp Reality" to cause enemies to do thing they're not supposed to be able to do. This and lots more, all while actually redefining what it means to actually define "A.I". It's a ride that will warp your very mind !!

Date 2022-06-06 Playtime 17h 21m Rec Positive solid metroid replacement, the environment feels eery and exploration is difficult the controlls are snapy and the upgrades are creative and unique  sometimes the hitboxes feel unfair
Date 2022-06-05 Playtime 16h 55m Rec Positive For everyone that has never played the metroid series and has wondered what it would be like. This game is as close as you get on PC. I played metroid before and I gotta say it is just as enjoyable. Lots of powerups, lots of bossess and lots of exploring. You won't be disappointed. If you are into platformers this is for you.
Date 2022-06-05 Playtime 12h 16m Rec Positive loved the lore and unique storyline, environments sometimes felt cookie cutter but some of them were very engaging. compared to super metroid, it comes close, it's not as polished as that one was though, but I certainly see how that's really the only game worth comparing it to. the hack/scanner tool implemented in it was a fresh idea that really made gameplay stand out.   would have liked to see some upgrades to movement mechanics outside of 'jump higher', something like a roll or back dash like SOTN would have made combat much more enjoyable. one of the final items in the game really did a lot for this cause, but wish there were others that were like it.   loved the effort, played through my first time very quickly and enjoyed it throughout.
Date 2022-06-04 Playtime 14h 40m Rec Positive 8/10
Date 2022-06-03 Playtime 21h 48m Rec Positive A superb game capturing the feeling of the original Metroid.
Date 2022-06-02 Playtime 18h 17m Rec Positive An engaging little sci-fi yarn wrapped up in a good Metroid-esque puzzle platformer with some decent background music. Some of the pixel art is not very good, but some of it is stellar, and the ending is a bit of a damp squib, but if it sounds like it would interest you, it almost certainly will.
Date 2022-06-01 Playtime 10h 27m Rec Positive A very solid Metroidvania platform game.  Some very interesting use of progression tools, with a couple of unique ones I haven't seen elsewhere, which was pretty fun.  If you enjoy games like Hollow Knight, Super Metroid, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (or Aria of Sorrow, etc), you'll most certainly enjoy this one.  The controls are tight, enemies are satisfying to blast, the map is interesting and well-tied together, all the important things for an A-tier game in this category are here.  Random thoughts: [list] [*]The weapon variety is actually quite impressive.  Almost [u]too[/u] impressive, some of the weapons aren't super useful, or have such narrow use cases that they're often nearly always an inferior choice.  Still, this isn't strictly negative, as there can be interesting challenge run ideas with the variety, and you're never forced to use a weapon a weapon you don't like for prolonged periods of time. [*]The plot is pretty in the weeds.  I understand that this is a game in a series and there will be unanswered questions, but there's a difference between "mystery" and "is this vague because it's bad?" [*]The pixel art in the game is pretty great, and the scanlines/glitch stuff is all great, as are all the interactions with the address disruptor item. On a visual level, nothing was ever (unintentionally) vague or hard to parse.  [*]The music was solid.  A couple of sweet tracks had me going "yeah, this is sweet" and a couple had me going "I can't wait to leave this zone."  Your mileage will vary. [/list]
Date 2022-05-31 Playtime 1h 39m Rec Positive Axiom Verge es un juego indie Metroidvania con un estilo retro, ofrece una experiencia increíblemente fluida y sorprendentemente entretenida.   No esperaba mucho de este juego ya que está desarrollado únicamente por Thomas Happ, pero este señor ha logrado crear un juegazo, quizás la historia sea un poco cutre pero su jugabilidad es muy buena, ignorando algunas mecánicas obsoletas como puede ser el bloqueo de apuntado que recuerda a los Metroid originales, en general es un muy buen juego.
Date 2022-05-31 Playtime 10h 32m Rec Positive Welcome to the first installment of what may or may not end up being one of many "you're only now getting to this? reviews. This one on Axiom Verge. I don't plan on making this one too long but we'll see. Soooo Axiom Verge, I've known of this game since it came out, I've owned it across 3 platforms (Xbox One, PS4, and PC) but only played it recently on PC, as the other times I bought the game when it was on sale and just never got around to it. Axiom Verge is a Metrodivania. Almost stereotypically, you know the drill, explore back and fourth between environments, discover secrets, upgrades, and power ups, fight bosses, etc. Axiom Verge is by no means unique in this genre of games but it makes up for it with it's great game play feel, & interesting world. The weapons in here are really fun to use, although combat isn't the greatest here I find it at the very least functional and you shouldn't really have trouble taking care of simple enemies. I find a lot of the weapons really fun to use even if I mainly stuck with the primary disruptor throughout most of the game. That was until I found the flamethrower which pretty much shits on all the other weapons. It can shoot through walls, its short range really isn't a hindrance, it deals damage fast, and it's powerful. You don't get this weapon until the very end of the game mind you (through normal play at least I'm sure there's a sequence break to get it early) but once you get it kiss those other weapons goodbye because the flamethrower is all you need. Aside from that though I find the weapons balanced and ultimately up to the player's preferences. The map design is good but I feel like it could've been more cleverly designed as to subtly guide keen eyed players on where to go next sort of like how Super Metroid does it. While I found my way through Axiom Verge's map well enough throughout most of the game by the end when I was growing a bit impatient I found myself consulting a guide if I got stuck, but I'm willing to chock that up to a degree of burnout. Graphically the game looks really nice. It's obviously a call back to the NES/SNES era but I really like how this game looks. It manages this perfect balance of being colorful but being dark and ominous, environments look distinct from one another so I at least knew which room I was in at all times. The soundtrack is freaking kick ass though, I love it. It's chiptune greatness albeit without console compression used on actual NES games back in the day. But still the songs are catchy, hummable, and fit the environment so no complaints from me in that department. The boss fights are ok, their main flaw being that there's always a save point in the area right before them. Which isn't a bad thing mind you, but because Axiom Verge isn't very punishing if you die (on normal at least) if you die to a boss you just respawn and try again which takes away a bit of the tensity and mild frustration that comes with boss fights. Again though, this is very much preferable to having the save point be like 3 rooms away or something. One thing I definitely like about this game is that say you grab an upgrade and die, you just go right back to the save point and keep that upgrade. The story that I almost forgot to mention is kinda forgettable to me tbh. I remember a few things and there is an actually decent plot twist that I won't spoil but by and large I found myself uninterested whenever dialogue boxes would pop up, I just don't find the characters in this game super compelling. But that's Axiom Verge. It's a great Metroidvania that's very much worth playing and easily worth recommending if you're a fan of the genre (though I'm sure most Metroidvania fans have played this game already). This game won't blow your mind or anything but it's a great solid fun time.
Date 2022-05-31 Playtime 12h 22m Rec Positive Suggest following walkthrough
Date 2022-05-30 Playtime 23h 39m Rec Positive Really great game! Core of the most regular metroidvania, with cool glitching motives. Nothing revolutionary, nothing precisely hard (even on hard). I was lost two times near the end and had to backtrack through every place once more to find my main task. Weapons are fun, I found almost every one useful in certain circumstances. Controls are quite stiff, I had problems with dashing and aiming all the time. Also, I had problems with telling a difference between locations, all of them were similarly disturbing, weird, but later I learned them better. One of the best metroidvanias on the market!
Date 2022-05-30 Playtime 10h 6m Rec Positive An excellent metroidvania in just about every way. Tells a light story, with mystery and intrigue that will keep you curiously engaged until you've seen the finale. NameBrand.  Picked this up lately because I realized my experience in the metroidvania genre was almost exclusive to the Metroid games, which I adore, but I was pleasantly surprised by this game! The collectible weapons and items were fun to use and interesting, the areas were unique in theme and design, and the environmental storytelling was perfectly coated in mystery.  I was really impressed with the "glitch" mechanics... corrupting enemies to make them into some additional variant, was super fun, and getting a new reaction was cool every time. I also think the game glitching out every so often was a nice touch, making me feel like I was playing something forbidden to our reality. Really cool stuff!  The story is serviceable enough, I think more than anything it paves the way for interesting and unique world building exposition, which gets continually built on with little lore notes and small cutscenes throughout the game. I didn't find myself particularly attached to the main character, and while I'm pretty sure the "odd speech" from the machines is intentionally done, it comes of more like I'm playing a game with a bad translation.  The movement in this game feels good enough, traversing the environment calls for a lot of engagement from the player, so learning how to optimize your route through the world helps you feel a bit quicker with each pass. I did find myself quite lost at points, which made me do the thing where I go to every part of the map over and over and over again just to find the one point of entry to the next area that I'm missing... And while I think that's a staple thing of the genre (I did find a lot of power-ups and upgrades because I got lost), It definitely added a few hours onto my playtime that really didn't need to be there. I think had there been just a quest marker or something that would have shown me the right direction (not necessarily the exaction location) to go, that would have incentivized me to explore the map on my own, rather than accidentally exploring the map and feeling relief that I was finally going the right way in the new area. That is my one major critique of this game.  I think a few minor critiques I could say would be: Some of the bosses are really easy (got em on the first try), and some enemy attacks feel absolutely unfair and unavoidable, even with a full arsenal and knowledge of where they are and their move sets... The last thing is, is that I don't really think it pushed the genre in any way... It had unique powers and abilities and mechanics that set it apart, but nothing completely wow'd me like I thought might happen, the way I've heard about this game.  Overall though, I really liked this game! I think it's a perfect embodiment of the original metroidvania formula, and as such I am happy to recommend it to anyone who may be itching for that kind of fix. It doesn't break the bank with your money or your time, and with its options to randomize, become more difficult, and speedrun, I think it definitely has its fair share of value under the hood.
Date 2022-05-30 Playtime 20h 13m Rec Positive A great example of a modern Metroidvania that manages to evoke the original Metroid while not being an outright clone. Only nearing the end of the game it started to become a bit of a chore.
Date 2022-05-28 Playtime 13h 52m Rec Positive Ive only played for five hours and all the dying isnt even frustrating
Date 2022-05-27 Playtime 17h 0m Rec Positive Gud Game
Date 2022-05-24 Playtime 13h 34m Rec Positive This is only the second Metroidvania type game I've ever played and I enjoyed it immensely...until the second half where I kept getting lost. Not only that but the enemies became way more annoying and harder to kill which made the game less enjoyable if I'm being honest. I was glad it was over when I beat the final boss because that whole last section really made me mad.  With all that said, I'm looking forward to playing Axiom Verge 2!
Date 2022-05-24 Playtime 10h 42m Rec Positive Un metroidvania très sympa. Je ne l'ai pas poussé à fond mais honnêtement, regarder un guide ou le wiki vaut le coup d'oeil.
Date 2022-05-23 Playtime 10h 52m Rec Positive I'm on the verge of giving this game a positive rating.
Date 2022-05-23 Playtime 10h 47m Rec Positive Fantastic music, plot, and gameplay mechanics that think outside of the box compared to traditional metroidvanias.  The only con if you're into sci-fi plots is that it leaves you wanting way more.
Date 2022-05-22 Playtime 13h 42m Rec Positive Awesome metroidvania, incredible musics.
Date 2022-05-21 Playtime 11h 48m Rec Positive Pra mim, um requisito que separa um metroidvania bom de um excelente é que este último dá aquela vontade de explorar o jogo inteiro, justamente por ter uma história cativante, jogabilidade fluida e cenários bem feitos. E é totalmente o caso desse título. Pra quem é fã de Metroid, Axiom Verge vai lembrar muito a jogabilidade e desafio, sem copiar nada e utilizando-o apenas como referência, literalmente uma inspiração, pois mesmo que o gênero seja bastante explorado, este jogo tem sua própria identidade, prestando honrosa reverência aquele clássico. Recomendo muito pra quem gosta desse tipo de jogo. Parabéns ao desenvolvedor (sim, só uma pessoa fez esse jogo).
Date 2022-05-21 Playtime 1h 26m Rec Negative 第二ボス撃破後少しぐらいまでプレイ  設定やストーリーなどは面白そうだったしメトロイドヴァニラは好きなのだが、プレイしていて面白いと感じなかった 現代的なビジュアルやアクションに馴れている人には向いてないゲームかもしれない
Date 2022-05-20 Playtime 19h 28m Rec Positive Great love letter to Metroid, with some very interesting story, lore, ambiance, music, and tight game play. Be prepared to get lost and wander the labyrinthine corridors for several hours. Abilities that would normally lead to progression in other Metroidvanias are absent, or defy expectations in some way. For instance, instead of a double jump, Trace gets the ability to launch a drone and then teleport to it. This subtle, but engaging subversion of expectations really adds to the experience. All the support to Tom Happ for creating this masterpiece of the genre by himself. Do yourself a favor and pick it up!
Date 2022-05-19 Playtime 14h 28m Rec Positive jogo nostalgico, uma delicia para quem gosta do metroid classico.
Date 2022-05-17 Playtime 16h 7m Rec Positive its very metroid. unfortunately there is a lot of backtracking and slow/clunky movement to get around. secrets can be very difficult to find, i think at least 4 hours of gametime i spent running around drilling every possible wall for a secret.   however guns and abilities are fun. finding new stuff gives me a big serotonin just like metroid. there are a couple bosses at the end that i didn't enjoy as much as the rest but overall very nice metroid(vania). i give it a 2 thumbs up and a smiley face
Date 2022-05-17 Playtime 13h 58m Rec Negative Honestly, I've never really played Metroidvania's so I excepted pretty much nothing from this game. Where to start. Imma split this review in 3 parts: story, gameplay and art/ambiance  Story Honestly, I feel like the story is just random science bullshit thrown at you and the game tries to make sense out of it. Heck I didn't even understand who was who. They just try to justify a lot of the story and question with science i don't even if it exists which makes it very hard and uninteresting to follow. At the end, i simply skipped dialogue. Also, dialogue feels very robotic (even if u are talking to robots most of the time), it feels like your character doesn't have a soul and is just a scientific guy who only speaks in science, it doesn't really feel human.   Gameplay: The gameplay was probably the most controversial in my opinion as, I do admit, it was pretty fun. However, major flaws and annoyances really counter balances the fun part of the gameplay. The fun part is that the game offers interesting mechanics such as teleportation and grapple but most of the fun mechanics are at the end, thus not really being that useful anymore. Also, this game has wayyyyy too much weapons and upgrades for the size of the game. You have a total of 20 weapons for a 10 hour game. Also you have to find these weapons whom most of the time are less useful than the weapons that were given to you which can be really frustrating. But the biggest flaw, is probably the constant back and forth you'll do, its out of this world. Out of the 15 hours of game I have, I would say a good 7 hours is just me doing every single fucking zone to figure out where to go next. The game doesn't indicate you where to go and so you gotta find your way most of the time. Sometimes, its even counter-intuitive like the two last zones you discover in the game their literally at the opposites of each other. I frequently looked up on Internet to find my way or just to find upgrades which is something u aren't suppose to do.  Art/ambiance Honestly, art was alright it wasn't bad neither was it good. However, they don't assign a texture to certain blocks which is frustrating too. Let me explain. Usually in video games, when there is a destroyable block it has a certain texture. So when u see that texture in game, you know its destroyable. This game doesn't give a single fuck about this rule and says fuck it sometimes this block destorys sometimes it doesn't. Also, sometimes background art tricked me into thinking it was blocks which is a no. Ambiance is well done just the music can get repetitive after your 10th time in the same zone. But except that its good  In conclusion, the game has soo many flaws its exasperating. Honestly, what made this game fun was when I had tutorials that showed me where to go to get items or when I was in a new zone and started exploring. However, the game has great potential and it could really be super nice if it tweaked certain mechanics or added indications. Even hints would be nice.  If u love constantly going back to zones you've already explored, this is your game.  6/10

Date 2022-05-14 Playtime 8h 36m Rec Positive 진짜 잘 만든 메트로베니아 게임이니까 그 장르를 좋아한다면 그냥 구매해서 플레이 하면 된다.   혼자서 이 정도 만들었다는데, 진짜 대단하다. 정말 자기가 이 장르를 좋아한다는게 게임을 해보면 너무 많이 느껴진다.   추천.
Date 2022-05-13 Playtime 13h 3m Rec Positive It's a very good Metroidvania with an enjoyable atmosphere and narrative and really fun weapons/abilities. Definitely helps scratch that Metroid itch if you haven't played those games in a while. Others have since surpassed it, but this game still holds up.
Date 2022-05-12 Playtime 28h 8m Rec Positive Отличная, олдскульная (как и в хорошем, так и в плохом смыслах) метроидвания. Не без минусов, главный из которых: на кой хрен нужно было делать столько оружия, ваще чтоли? Лечит ноугамез.  Ах, да. Иногда эта игра ебет ваши глаза и уши. Порой намеренно.
Date 2022-05-12 Playtime 7h 56m Rec Positive Extremely well-designed Metroidvania. The world design is super intuitive, and the upgrades are fantastic. The boss fights are very fun and have a good amount of challenge to them. This game is difficult, but it never felt overwhelming. It was always clear where to go next. I can't wait for Axiom Verge 2 to release on Steam.
Date 2022-05-11 Playtime 36h 42m Rec Positive For me, with no context of classic 1980s/1990s platform adventure games I was quite concerned I wouldn't pick up easily on the 2D platformer mentality but to my surprise Axiom Verge was incredibly easy to learn through trial and error. Playing the game felt like I was enjoying a Metroid game, which is fair since everyone compares the two.  Weapons come in two basic forms, that being weapons and tools. Weapons come in a huge variety and the real skill isn't learning how to use them but simply finding them! Axiom Verge treats it's universe almost like a computer simulation where you literally "Glitch" the world to your bidding. This makes it easy for the player to understand exactly what their weapons/tools are doing and how it impacts their environment. There's several tools to do this from simply changing block types to exploding huge sections of the map cut off at early game. This gives replayability because it allowed me to loop back several times across the entire map again and again each time I get a new tool, and respectively making my character stronger with each loop.  Enemies in the game are all very good and are designed to match their way in the environment, from gooey hellish creatures to grass moss monsters or steampunk robots it can be a real breath of fresh air to explore different areas whenever you get tired of each enemy type.  The glitching can be a little tricky to master, and the Lab Coat item and subsequent upgrades can be rather glitched itself not registering your movement properly though it more often than not is a life saver. What's more interesting is how glitches affect enemies, it's genuinely impossible to tell what can happen! This super fun because it's like a box of chocolates you never know what's inside!  Aside from a few areas in the map which are utter nightmares to which I will never return to (I'm looking at you "Ukkin-Na") it was incredibly fun and I'm definitely considering getting the sequel!
Date 2022-05-11 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive Dużo broni, dużo ulepszeń i większość ukryta za ścianą metroidvanii ...a ściany trzeba lizać.')  Dodatkowo: przypomniała mi starą grę - Contra.
Date 2022-05-11 Playtime 35h 23m Rec Positive 한글 지원이 안되지만 전혀 지장 없음. 메트로베니아 장르에 아주 충실하지만, 길 찾기 부분에서 직관성이 떨어지기 때문에 방향을 잘못 잡으면 길찾기가 조금 험할 수 있음.  필수적인 수집요소가 전체 수집요소 수에 비해 적은 편이지만 게임의 난이도를 정하는 요소와 직결되기 때문에 가볍게 즐기기에는 조금 빡센 게임.  고전풍 픽셀 그래픽은 컨셉인 줄 알았는데 일부는 아니었는지 버그도 꽤 있음. 그러니 세이브를 충실하게 할 것을 추천.  게임을 전부 핥고 지우자마자 든 생각은 몹100% 도전과제가 너무 치사하다는 것 뿐이었음. 몹 100% 도전과제를 하려면 하드모드 보스전에서만 나오는 몹이 있으니 하드모드로 도전과제를 시작할 것.

Date 2022-05-07 Playtime 16h 4m Rec Positive The game is obviously a faithful clone of the original NES Metroid game. For me that's a good thing, because I loved Metroid, although I'm not a huge fan of pixel graphics. The theme is a bit darker than Metroid, cyberpunk, similar to System Shock. Axiom Verge can be a bit difficult to get started. The game doesn't tell you where to go, although most of the time, there is only one obvious route to go. First couple of boss fights are actually quite difficult. I've read it gets easier, if you do exploring and make sure to find all the powerups. I do like some of the creative mechanics, such as glitching blocks and enemies.

Date 2022-05-04 Playtime 8h 6m Rec Positive I played Axiom Verge years ago by torrenting it, I loved it and told myself I'd buy it when I had the money. 7 years is pretty ridiculous to wait to buy a game, but here I am. It's a great game, worth every penny, on sale or off sale. A great metroidvania, beautiful pixel graphics, great soundtrack, just a great game; if playing Metroid Dread rekindled your love for metroidvanias, this is a good one to give a go.

Date 2022-04-28 Playtime 16h 20m Rec Positive A solid homage to the Metroid series with some fun abilities and traversal mechanics. Not the best metroidvania on steam but well worth playing if you enjoy the metroid side of metroidvania.  Check out https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41559946 for more recommendations!
Date 2022-04-26 Playtime 2h 32m Rec Negative Не знаю за что хвалят эту игру. Но как метроидвания оно полное днище. Карта гов_но, противники гав_но, совершенно безвкусные уровни и левел дизайн. 8-bit никогда не была чем-то выдающимся, тем более красивой пикселизацией, вот 16-bit другое дело. Можете со мной не соглашаться, но этой игре во всех смыслах до Метройда как до луны. Есть куда круче игры данного жанра.

Date 2022-04-24 Playtime 9h 47m Rec Negative 我不推荐购买这款游戏，因为它画面精神污染，没有汉化，没有传送，跳跃手感狗屎一样，把隐藏道路当正路，不看攻略玩简直是灾难。尤其是这个精神污染的画面和特效更是直接穿透了我的电脑屏幕给予我的眼睛百分百真实伤害，都快给我闪出光敏性癫痫了 总之，如果你不是银河恶魔城类游戏的忠实粉丝那就不要购买它 如果你不是银河恶魔城类游戏的受众，那么打八折也不要购买它
Date 2022-04-24 Playtime 15h 49m Rec Positive Most likely the best metroidvania game you could possibly play. if you have any interest in these types of games then this is the game for you. 
Date 2022-04-22 Playtime 34h 18m Rec Positive A good Metroidvania with a good story and gameplay.   Maybe the color palette is a bit repetitive for my taste but it's a minor detail. If you're familiar with Metroid there's nothing more to say except what I've already said about the story.  8/10.
Date 2022-04-21 Playtime 21h 21m Rec Positive A very solid metroidvania. Unlike most of other metroidvanias I played, sometimes it's not so obvious where to proceed in Axiom Verge. From the graphics perspective though not a big fan of pixel graphics, this game looks good. Cool music, but sometimes it could be too annoying. Controls could be handled a bit better. I played using XBOX Controller and its sticks, though the author wanted me use D-Pad. A LOT OF times I had useless weapon change, invalid navigation and other "awesome" things at unexpected time.  8/10
Date 2022-04-20 Playtime 16h 42m Rec Positive Man, this game is awesome. Look, there isn't much to say here, it's like metroid but better, WAY better. Buy this  game right now. Buy it and experience this amazing gameplay and wrighting. I might be acting a litte hyperbolic here but seriously, buy it.

Lo malo es que es muy complicado, a medida que vas avanzando, los obstáculos aumentan su dificultad y se vuelve muy tilteante. Además, otro punto negativo es que el único punto de guardado que tiene es volviendo al punto de inicio, me hubiera gustado que pulsando Esc tuviera uno o varios slots de guardado (como cualquier otro juego).

Date 2022-04-14 Playtime 5h 16m Rec Negative At first glance, this was the game I'd been looking for forever. I really love the Metroid games, and I'd always wished they leaned more into their sci-fi horror roots. Obviously, this is very influenced by Metroid, Alien, and H.R. Giger's work. Unfortunately, Axiom Verge is lacking in a number of important areas, which ultimately supersede its interesting aesthetic.   First, though, for the good stuff. The visual aesthetic is great. Sometimes it's a bit overwhelming, but since it's attempting to emulate Giger's style, it makes sense. All the enemy designs are cool and unique. I also really love the Elsenova's design. Basically, Axiom Verge achieved its aesthetic goals in a great way.   Generally, the controls are good too. It can be very fun at times. It's always fun to try out new abilities when you get them. Also, the abilities are very creative. The glitch ray, the ability to walk through wall - all good stuff. It makes Axiom Verge stand apart from Metroid.   Now for the bad stuff.   First of all, the main character is annoying. There are [b]A LOT[/b] of story moments, so you become very familiar with the Trace's personality. He's basically your typical snappy, inept nerd who thinks he's clever. Every time you encounter a boss Trace has to make an annoying comment like "Ah jeez not this crap again!" Just shut up, Trace. Unconfident main characters are fine, but it doesn't work here. Trace is just unlikable. To me, this creates a disconnect between myself and the game. Because I don't like Trace, I don't really want to see him succeed.   This leads into my next issue - the story. There's way too much story. It takes the opposite approach of the original three Metroid games and delivers a very complex science fiction story. Again, this can work, and it can work in retro side-scrolling format, but it doesn't work here. Of course, this is just a personal thing. I haven't made it all the way through, so it might get better, but I was not hooked from the start. I would have preferred much less story.   Like I said, all the abilities you acquire over time are great, but few of them help is discovering the game's secrets. There's no Super Metroid scope or Symphony of the Night ferry equivalent . Basically, that means you'll go around drilling into every possible wall to see if there's a hidden item or something. If you ever reach an impasse and don't know what to do next, you'll feel overwhelmed because the map is so huge and there's no way of knowing if you accidentally missed a hidden block or something. The items you need are in plain sight, but the extra stuff that makes the game more playable is too hidden. It makes the game tedious.  The boss battles are a huge problem in this game. They're so easy it's painful. You can literally just duck in a corner and fire away until it's over. There's a story reason for this, but the story shouldn't compromise the gameplay. I don't feel like I've achieved anything when I beat a boss.   The small enemies sometimes have the opposite problem. They're not exactly "hard" per se, but they can be annoying. I'm not exactly the best at video games, but I found that I'd die more often on annoying relentless enemies than I would on bosses. As the player, you're always just thinking "oh they're hard now, but they'll be easy later." Basically, it's just a slog until you find the next upgrade. It's tedious, not fun.   Finally, the music. It's too "2010s." It's too 8bit epic. This is just a personal preference, though.   Basically, this game is just a good-looking slog. You have to slog through the story bits, you have to slog through all the secret passageways, and you have to slog through all the annoying enemies, all while slogging through the bombastic music. I feel drained every time I play this game. 
Date 2022-04-14 Playtime 12h 30m Rec Positive [i]Review originally on [url=http://www.dragon-quill.net/axiom-verge/]Dragon Quill.[/url] Comments are enabled there.[/i]  A Metroidvania that’s further to the Metroid end of the scale than the Castlevania one; I haven’t played many of those, so this was interesting. This game had a really great plot and aesthetic: You play as a physicist who, after a lab accident, wakes up in a creepy machine on an alien planet. A voice in his head tells him he needs to grab a gun to defend himself, and then he’s off to explore a bizarre world that’s equal parts biological and mechanical. Compounding the weirdness is that you are quickly told the world’s present state is the result of a deadly pathogen that mutated all life into monsters; you are suffering from the pathogen as well, and this occasionally manifests in bizarre hallucinations that force you to doubt your senses. The gameplay mechanics are diegetic as well, with the main character explicitly remembering every time he dies and returns to a checkpoint, further blurring the lines of reality.  The story’s got some interesting plot twists, characters, and moral nuance. Most importantly, despite the mindscrewy setup, I found the reveals very logical and easy to follow while still being satisfying. I particularly like how [i]nice[/i] the main character is, a rarity in video games — he repeatedly states how horrible he feels about killing the monsters, no matter how terrifying and repugnant they look, and tries to negotiate the moment he hears one speak, even though it’s just to babble nonsense about kill orders. He genuinely feels like an ordinary guy thrown in over his head rather than an unflappable action hero. I wasn’t particularly pleased by the use of the “the women helping you are secretly evil manipulators” cliche, but it’s tempered by the fact that [i]everyone[/i] seems to be evil manipulators, so they’re not really singled out.  The game mechanics fit with the mindscrewiness of the plot by being glitch-themed, except not in any way that actually lets you break the game like some other offenders I could name. The most “glitchy” ability you get is the ability to clip through walls… provided they are of a certain length and in a particular configuration, so you can’t use it to actually break the game. You also gain the ability to “glitch” certain enemies and tiles, but mechanically this isn’t actually different from similar state-changing abilities in other games. Some might find it a little disappointing, but after how badly I've seen other titles break with their glitch powers, I’m honestly pretty grateful they’re so self-contained here. Glitching enemies is still pretty cool, and you often unlock interesting unusual behaviors by doing so, such as turning objects that spawn enemies into objects that spawn health pickups.  The soundtrack was also outstanding, not that that’s surprising for indie games these days. The ambient tracks all felt wonderfully alien and creepy, and I love how the boss music incorporates alarm sirens to make it feel like a real alarm sequence. One thing I particularly appreciated is that, while the game uses a “critical annoyance” beeping noise when you’re low on health, it syncs it to the background music, preventing it from becoming jarring. I’m frankly amazed at how effective yet simple that solution is — how did it take video games this long to figure that out?  My biggest criticism is one the game shares with Metroid: Invisible hidden passages everywhere, no indication they exist, have fun blasting and teleporting into every single tile in the entire world if you want to find them. This is compounded by the lack of a proper fast-travel feature — there is one central “hub” area that functions similarly, but it only connects to the edges of areas that can be quite large, and doesn’t even reach every area in the game. Backtracking to a specific location takes a frankly unnecessary amount of time.  But otherwise, the game is very good, and I highly recommend checking it out yourself, especially if you’re a fan of sci-fi and biological horror.
Date 2022-04-14 Playtime 9h 29m Rec Positive Kind of an odd one, but it's a solid Metroidvania. I kind of let myself get overhyped about people talking about massive twists and the code device in the game, so by the time I reached the end everything felt a little underwhelming.  Honestly, the game plays every standard game trope pretty straight.  But as long as you go in without expecting any big revelations, it's a great game with lovely visuals.
Date 2022-04-14 Playtime 18h 27m Rec Positive Very good metroidvania with a modern twist,buy it if you enjoy the genre.  PROS  +good variety of biomes/abilities/weapons, a lot of unique stuff. Its not your usual double jump,dash,fly all over again. Biomes are also different,so dont expect the customary sea/forest/sand/magma/etc. levels +surprisingly good plot that is actually interesting +nice and various soundtracks +a lot of content. It took me 18h to 100% the game,including secret areas  CONS  -the great variety of guns is mostly useless,since only a few of them are actually convenient to use -annoying control scheme/options menu Ofc you can change it,but even so i had to actually look in Q&A to understand how to exit options menu when i first launched the game -no option to fast-forward dialogs/cutscenes

Date 2022-04-08 Playtime 11h 36m Rec Negative Worum geht's? Metroid-Klon   Positives:  - Story ist über dem für das Genre üblichen Durchschnitt  Neutral:  - Steuerung weitgehend präzise (mit Gamepad), aber manche Designentscheidungen führen zu Ungenauigkeiten, die nicht hätten sein müssen.  - Viele verschiedene Waffen und Extras zu entdecken. - Atmosphäre (Grafik, Sound) ist manchmal gut eingefangen, oft aber auch nicht.  Negatives: - Nerviges Leveldesign mit Überdurchschnittlich viel Backtracking  (Folgendes passierte viel zu oft: Du brauchst Extra A um an einer Steller weiterzukommen, du findest es am anderen Ende der Map, du gehst zurück benutzt Extra A, um an besagter Stelle weiterzukommen, nur um eine Tür später festzustellen, dass du jetzt Extra B brauchst um weiterzukommen, was du nicht hast.)  - Langweilige Standardgegner (Da ist wirklich sehr wenig Kreativität da gewesen) - Langweilige Bossfights (Da hat man im Grunde alles schon mal irgendwo anders besser gesehen)   Fazit: Ganz ehrlich, es ist nicht extrem schlecht, sondern in vielen Belangen eher extrem durchschnittlich. Wenn ihr z.B. Metroid-Kenner seid und mögt die Spiele, dann werdet ihr hier nichts finden, was dieses Spiel besser macht, als die alten Dinger (außer vielleicht die Story).  Meine subjektive Wertung: 6/10

I really enjoyed my whole experience in finishing the game, along with the challenge of collecting the huge array of items. The added speedrun and randomizer modes really drive home how involved the developer is with the community which is great to see!

Date 2022-04-03 Playtime 20h 19m Rec Positive Are we dead? Is this the afterlife? What is real or virtual? Is this a dream or a nightmare? You are in a thin line, called Axiom Verge. A new classic to this fantastic genre, welcome to another sci-fi metroidvania where Trace, our protagonist, dies and wakes up in a surreal world, where we will have to explore different zones, getting unique items that shapes the plot, like the glitch weapon or the lab coat.  Unfortunately I can't tell you what is so captivating about this game without spoiling the plot, there is a particular reason for you to be the one in this adventure and only one way to find out.  Even though the synth music contributes to the game genre, it may be a bit shrill, so I recommend lowering it a bit. The only negative thing that I see is that you cannot teleport to another areas and sometimes it's a bit cumbersome to go from one extreme to the other. So far I didn't found a double jump either, instead you have a double tap dash, it's handy but it happened to me on more than one occasion that I did it accidentally.
Date 2022-04-02 Playtime 26h 56m Rec Positive nice
Date 2022-04-02 Playtime 17h 1m Rec Positive What a game! It captures Super Metroid's greatness in ambiance and exploration, plus a unique set of movement tools and a deep story that's doled out in crumbs throughout the world. I found myself getting 100% items (which I haven't bothered to do in a Metroid game) for the sake of finding more of the lore.   A word of caution: the game is a genre piece. If you like retro games and Metroidvanias, there's a lot to love. I wouldn't recommend it as a first entry into the genre, though, because so much of what it does is pay homage to and reinterpret a classic formula. Your expectations need to be calibrated to classic Metroid games to figure out where to go next and find hidden items.   Alternate universe review 1: This game was so glitchy, I couldn't figure out how to get anywhere without walking through walls.  Alternate universe review 2: It's like HR Giger made one of them battleship-girl animes.
Date 2022-04-01 Playtime 18h 6m Rec Positive Un buen juego con muy buenas mecánicas, eso si, al haber tantos secretos y/o caminos ocultos por ahí, me hacia sentir que estaba demorando mas de lo necesario para llegar al final, casi sintiendo que estaba perdiendo el tiempo a veces.

Date 2022-03-30 Playtime 15h 11m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is the epitome of a classic Metroidvania. For me, it was like sitting down with a fresh copy of the OG Metroid for the first time, with all the wonder of a child, but also with the full context of 30+ years of gaming experience at my fingertips. This is quite possibly the most satisfying gaming experience I'll have all year. A++. Highly recommend.
Date 2022-03-27 Playtime 14h 35m Rec Positive I wish I could experience this game for the first time again :(
Date 2022-03-26 Playtime 10h 1m Rec Positive - Classic metroidvania progression - satisfying weapons and upgrades, none of which felt too parasitic or useless. - Inventive mechanics which were intuitively introduced. - Nice retro graphics, reminded me of NES era with the fidelity and pallate.  - Some of the bosses felt a little BS.
Date 2022-03-25 Playtime 16h 57m Rec Positive I have to start by saying, this game is CRIMINALLY underplayed and undervalued. It has stayed in my mind, and after a full year something inside me is itching to go back and play again. That is the sign of a good game.  Now. I will list a a few (maybe frustrating) points to the game that you should know before playing:  1.) There is no fast travel and no warping between save stations. You have to trek everywhere. The backtracking is fun sometimes, but very late when you're trying to find missed collectables it's tedious.   2.) For some god-forsaken reason, the teleport dash was set to double-tapping the move stick in a direction. You cannot remap this function. You will accidentally dash many times, sometimes falling off ledges or dashing into enemies. When it works as expected, it's awesome. Just let us remap it to a primary button PLEASE.... This alone dropped my experience a whole 2 points out of 10.  3.) Some secrets are CRYPTIC and take a LOT of brainpower to figure out alone. If you are a completionist, be prepared to poke around areas and read notes for hints.   4.) "Secret worlds" do not count towards 100% item completion, They're legit just extra glitched areas. Very cool touch but not necessary to beat the game. Just FYI.  5.) Turn your volume down a few notches, the music is blaringly loud haha. It has amazing synth beats, though.  I put off this game for a long time, if you're like me I'd recommend jumping in! You'll know within an hour if you'll like it. The story is pure sci-fi greatness. It's an awesome metroidvania, more akin to Super Metroid than newer stuff like Ori or Hollowknight.   **I give Axiom Verge a solid 8/10**
Date 2022-03-24 Playtime 17h 4m Rec Positive This game was obviously inspired by the early generations of the Metroid franchise, and it lives up to expectations. The world looks like it could be from the same universe as Metroid or Super Metroid. The upgrades are plentiful and interesting, with some really surprising ones that I didn't expect. The designer was also very careful to design gates in the game so that the really unique abilities still don't break the game - quite complicated once you see what the power ups are (trying not to spoil).  The movement feels a bit stiff, which is probably my biggest gripe, but the game didn't really rely on precise platforming as part of its core gameplay, so this wasn't a major issue. It just didn't feel as good to move and jump. The combat was pretty good, and forced you to consciously use different weapons throughout. The exploration was really good, as the different abilities allowed you to access parts of the map in cool ways, and the rewards for exploring a new or secret area were usually worth the effort.  If you grew up on any of the classic Metroid games, you'll definitely enjoy your time with this game.
Date 2022-03-23 Playtime 7h 30m Rec Negative 在類銀河惡魔城作品中，這是一款偏向銀河戰士、設計較傳統、難度稍高的作品，角色的能力提升僅在跑圖探索中尋獲能力，打小怪不會有經驗或掉落物品等回饋，只有隨機的補血量可以吃。  我大約只玩了1/3，卻頻頻令我怯步，一來是小怪的高機動性加上主角只有八方位的攻擊，前期很容易就被撞死，所以被迫要龜著清小怪才能繼續向前探索，而擊殺小怪又沒反饋，導致了探索慾望降低，只想快點找到BOSS房，打完了事。 再則，是地圖的不便利，在遇到還不能通過的地方跟拿不到的東西時，小地圖最多僅能在同個區域標上2個點，標點也只能在你當下的該格做標記。不僅如此，沒有 "快 速 傳 送"是個大硬傷，在後面拿到多種位移技能後，卻還是要冒著死亡的風險往回跑回去，除了可能迷路的煩燥外，也會有跑到點了卻不是對應開路技能的窘境。  我自認是個重探索且喜愛類銀河惡魔城的玩家，但這款實在無法打動我，探索的回饋遠不及難清的小怪和容易死亡的煩躁。 或許我是被近年高回饋、高刺激的遊戲養壞了，若是願意接受早期的關卡設計風格的玩家，這款作品的內容絕對值得好好體驗！  另外，CodeBay.in 有繁中的安裝模組喔！

Date 2022-03-18 Playtime 11h 5m Rec Positive Axiom Verge ist insgesamt ein sehr guter Metroidvania Ableger. Die Story ist recht einfach gehalten. Steuerung ist präzise und gut. Einzig was ich mir gewünscht hätte, ist das man die Schultertasten fürs 45 Grad schiessen benutzen hätte können, ähnlich wie bei Metroid. Vielleicht kann man es auch einstellen. Ich weiß es nicht =) Audio ist in dem Fall nicht so meins. Viele recht schrille Töne prallen auf einen ein. Ich mag auch hier eher das düstere, geheimnisvolle von Metroid. Bugs hatte ich keine. Die Spielzeit lag bei mir bei 10 Stunden, wobei es natürlich länger wird wenn man sich um die ganzen versteckten Items kümmert. Schwierigkeitsgrad ist in Ordnung. Manche Gegner sind recht einfach, andere Nerven. Insgesamt gut ausgewogen.   Ein tolles Spiel. Jeder Metroidvania Fan sollte mal ein Auge drauf werfen.  https://youtu.be/8T7J6fLClwc

Date 2022-03-10 Playtime 14h 9m Rec Positive Este juego salío cuando los primeros indies como shovel knight comenzaron a popularizarse. Intentando ser una especie de tributo a los primeros metroid tanto en gameplay como apariencia.  No estaría seguro si recomendarlo a cualquiera en pleno 2022, el mundo que plantea el juego y la historia es interesante. Pero cosas como el gameplay puede resultar un poco básico si lo comparamos con metroidvanias actuales que son un poco más complejos en cuanto a mecanicas y jugabilidad.  Si creciste jugando metroidvanias de la gba o nes, tal vez este juego sea para ti.

Date 2022-03-06 Playtime 8h 2m Rec Negative One of the worse metroidvanias out there.  - Travelling through the map takes ages because there's no fast travel mechanics or quick movement abilities - Lots of annoying enemies - Nothing looks memorable so you'll almost surely run around the whole map every time you get a major ability - There's so much dry dialogue interrupting you that sometimes it can take a full minute to just skip through it, not to mention reading anything the game spits at you - There's extremely obscure stuff around and most of the map is filled with optional stuff. It's like Ubisoft tried to make a metroidvania - most of it is just open worldy upgrades and bloat that feels like punishment more than a reward.

Date 2022-03-02 Playtime 11h 17m Rec Positive It's a super solid metroidvania, just like everybody says. Some of the controls are a little iffy, particularly the double-tapping and the lack of a direction-lock button that doesn't lock movement. But those are really small issues, the bosses are fun and the music is atmospheric and the sound effects are punchy.

Date 2022-03-01 Playtime 32h 52m Rec Positive Excelente jogo, gente: joguem 'Axiom Verge'. Sei lá, achei o jogo bom, sabe? Tudo me foi constantemente redondinho e agradável: o movimento - pelo menos com o uso de um controle - me foi sempre bom e respondeu bem - menos quando eu precisava usar o cabo para realizar travessias, é verdade: isso foi meio chato de vez em quando -, o visual me foi interessantíssimo - me deu a impressão de que eu estava jogando nas vísceras de um bicho; rola um lance meio H. R. Giger na coisa toda que eu acho estranhamente interessante e hipnótico -, a trilha sonora me foi bem legal - me lembrei da trilha do 'Metroid Prime' direto - e, por fim, achei que a história foi suficientemente louca e abstrata para funcionar e me levar até o final. Jogo louco. Louco, mas irado, ainda assim. De novo: acho que tudo funcionou direitinho. Aliás, tudo me agradou bastante. É claro que isso era um tanto esperado - eu me amarro em jogos tipo Metroid, afinal de contas -, mas a verdade é que eu poderia ter me decepcionado e não me decepcionei nem um pouco. Inclusive, eu não só não me decepcionei como fiz tudo que o jogo tinha a oferecer e exigir: durante as cerca de trinta horas que eu passei com o jogo, eu completei a campanha no modo normal e no difícil, completei o jogo em menos de quatro horas - assim como fiz uma jornada pelo modo com tempo contado -, joguei pegando tudo e pegando menos de quarenta porcento dos itens. Enfim: não tenho mais o que tirar do jogo, a não ser tentar melhorar o meu tempo de finalização. Seja como for, o fato é que gostei do que joguei e acho que não há mais nada a desejar de um jogo. Sinceramente, eu iria com fé nessa compra: acho que ela vale a pena pra caramba. Pelo menos se você é fã de Metroid: não vai haver nada de novo aqui, mas, justamente por isso, não vai haver (provavelmente) nada de errado com a coisa toda também. Eu iria sem medo. Bom jogo!

Date 2022-02-26 Playtime 20h 12m Rec Positive One of my favorite Metroidvanias
Date 2022-02-26 Playtime 15h 11m Rec Negative I struggled with how to rate this game, because it is a lot of fun and has some unique mechanics. But ultimately what drove me to vote "No" was the awful controls. Normally I can overlook something like this if the game is good, but the shear frustration that the bad controls creates ruined a lot of the experience. First, the various weapons can be shortcutted to the left or right thumbstick buttons, so I'm constantly switching to the wrong weapon at the worse time. There is an option to customize the controls, but there is no option to remove a control, so it's just something I dealt with. But then later in the game you gain the teleport ability, which is activated by double tapping a direction. Trying to jump to a small block, making a small mid-air correction, then teleporting a mile away from where you want to be gets real old real fast. In the end, I decided my frustration outweighed my enjoyment, which is too bad because the game is great otherwise.
Date 2022-02-25 Playtime 15h 6m Rec Positive Tom Happ deserves an award for this.
Date 2022-02-24 Playtime 10h 43m Rec Negative It's a good game but I wouldn't recommend it to people who are not that into metroid-venias.  The controls are wonky, specially at the end with all the combinations of movement you have. The shooting is the worst and there are a lot of weapons that are pointless. There's a lot you can cheese, takes the fun out of. You will need a guide, sometimes I just got lost.  BUT if you are into metroid-venias, why haven't you played this? it's a good one.

Le gameplay est assez simple à prendre en main, les commandes sont fluides (à la manette pour moi) et la difficulté est bien équilibrée, ce n'est ni trop facile, ni trop difficile avec quelques passages corsés comme tout jeu qui se respecte. L'histoire est bien ficelée même si elle n'est pas toujours très évidente à comprendre. Les graphismes sont plus que corrects pour sa catégorie. J'ai passé un très bon moment à jouer à ce jeu.

Date 2022-02-22 Playtime 14h 51m Rec Positive 梦回超银。。。。（虽然差别还是挺大的）  [h1]基本情况[/h1] 难度一般，跟空洞奥日不是一个级别的，且收集可以十分有效的降低难度。 游玩时间大概是10h，鄙人困难全收集是11h（不包括额外内容）。 （困难模式貌似只是给敌人加血了，推荐直接玩困难 [spoiler]不知道为什么困难通关成就百分比挺低的 [/spoiler]） 没有中文（可能有汉化补丁？），但剧情不影响跑图推进度。  游戏性上，作为一个类银河战士恶魔城游戏，很明显这个作品的底子偏银河战士多一些， 但它对于敌人的交互设计实在不错，比银河战士好太多了。  [h1]地图与游戏路线设计[/h1] 与超级银河战士一样，这个作品的地图顺序其实是被限制死的，但特殊技巧并不能跳关，关键道具一环扣一环限制了可探索区域（我特地去找了一下速通，没有大的skip，与正常玩顺序一样 [spoiler]散射-电喷-高跳-白衣-无人机-黄衣-传送-红衣[/spoiler]）。这一点略感可惜，不过也没什么问题。 但是这个作品的“单向门”十分阴险，一个平平无奇的高台，跳过去再想回来就要等至少一个BOSS后了，好在并不多。 另外由于没有地区的传送功能，跑路体验比较差。虽然游戏里专门加了一个通道连通大部分地区并配了电车（个人感觉挺蠢的），但一方面这个通道是水平的，这样并没有减少玩家跳平台的困难，另一方面不少跨进度的道具放的地方都挺深，就算借助通道也基本上要横穿整个区域，毕竟玩家没有任何仅靠玩家自己的快速移动的方法（比如超银的加速器、凤凰之舞），因此搜刮（到之前的地方探索）体验并不好。但如果想轻松打BOSS，一些回头探索又是很重要的（道具相关）。 但是由于游戏的关键道具顺序其实是限制死的，所以很容易出现打完了BOSS不知道该去哪的情况（这种事我在打超银时也遇到过，好在只有1次）。这里正常情况下会出现2次需要跑很远的情况。（可能剧情有提示？反正我没找到） 此外具体到地图细节，墙上的隐藏道路并不明显，而游戏里又没有X光（超银）那样的扫描道具，因此需要玩家自己试出来。有一说一有些东西不看地图确实很难找到。 别的地方，小地图功能的设计略显尴尬：因为分辨率不高，小地图并不能显示多大区域，看地图还是得开菜单。不过总比没有强。有的地方需要先输密码才能开，这个设计感觉挺奇怪。  [h1]玩法与道具收集[/h1]  [b]武器[/b] 通关后回头看，这个游戏一共有20种不同的子弹类型（额外区域还有3个，不在讨论范围内），基本上涵盖了所有情况。 大部分敌人用对了武器都是可以无伤击杀的，部分BOSS也是，甚至一些武器十分克制某些BOSS。 [spoiler]抛物线打3区的激光大虫子，分裂弹头（蓝色的）打蹲起的大蝎子，雪花枪（那个散射的）打蜜蜂，喷火器打最终BOSS [/spoiler]用对应的枪打BOSS不说多简单了，基本上没有操作难度，初见无伤都很正常。 而且这些枪都可以在遇到对应BOSS之前拿到（部分需要回头探索）。 由此可见作者特意给游戏经验比较少的玩家提供了通关的途径，也是对玩家收集行为的奖励。 但反观BOSS的设计实在有些差强人意，用对应的武器打起来太轻松，不用又有点刮了，存在感还不如几个恶心的小敌人。 顺便一提后期跑图压力有点大，大部分敌人没有直接的无伤处理办法，需要苟着打。  [b]能力[/b] 探索用的能力方面，一般的高跳（在别的游戏里可能是2段跳之类的）、钻头（破坏部分墙壁）、抓钩（和超银的一样。提一下，手感比较烂）就不分析了。 [u]冲刺[/u] 这里反过来设计了。别的游戏都是冲刺-多向冲刺/长距离-闪现冲刺，这里一开始就是穿墙，穿1格（白衣）-穿2格且可以多向（黄衣）-穿3格且有碰撞伤害可破坏部分墙壁（红衣），比较有新意。 [u]无人机[/u] 发射一个小机器人。这个机制还算少见，而且这个作品里加了一个可以传送到小机器人的位置的道具，给这个玩法增添了许多灵活性，比如管道+穿墙，利用发射把小机器人送到高处再传送到达高处，等等。但操作要求比较高，用起来比较费劲，尤其是上高台（因为没别的办法）。速通里用这个赶路，我也试过但对场地要求比较高。 [u]黑客枪[/u]（改变状态） 个人感觉这是这个作品最大的创新点了。 这个东西涉及2个机制：改变部分格子的状态（破墙/空中搭平台），以及改变敌人的状态。也就是说，实际上所有的敌人种类都有2个形态。 实际用起来的时候，对于不同敌人，这个东西有这几种功能：弱化敌人（降低移动速度/降低攻击速度/减少火力）、变成别的敌人类型（有些时候反而不好对付），特殊的有变成墙壁（那个幽灵，可以踩，且还会运动）、直接消失、碰撞消失且不断提供生命值（珊瑚）、变成友军（激光钻头，转换后攻击不造成伤害且会伤害敌人，还能破坏部分玩家无法破坏的墙壁）、提供炸弹、变得可控制（上下左右和攻击，可惜只用了1次）、屏幕残留（切换房间会在同位置出现，也是可惜只用了1次）。（可能有漏的） 因此部分场景的解密设计十分有意思，解法深度与敌人相关联，感觉十分有新意。（据说2代里着重发展了这个玩法） 顺便一提，最高级黑客能力换成了炸弹，能直接炸全屏。这里很明显是特地致敬超银了吧（虽然这个炸弹没直接伤害）。  [b]道具[/b] 加血、加武器伤害、加子弹大小、加能量。基础的就不说了，这里有一个问题。 这个游戏里，大部分加血都是打完BOSS/几个固定的地方，有一个一次加一格的道具。除此之外别的都是小血包，单个没有效果需要凑够5个才能加1格。加能量也是。虽然这样能确保玩家在进行粗略探索的情况下可以拿到大部分升级，但对应的，道具总数偏少，像超银那样的套娃藏东西基本上没有，大多数情况下一个房间只会有一个道具，玩家花大力气扫墙基本上都找不到任何东西。说实话有点影响玩家探索积极性，尤其是全收集党很难受。  [h1]额外内容[/h1] 游戏里每单个存档一共会有5个“秘密世界”，入口是完全随机的（攻略里可能的入口到处都是），里面是独立的地图，由一些随机的房间拼接而成，会给一些小道具（很少，但藏有彩蛋武器），我寻思这不就是rougelike吗？这作者玩挺大啊。。。 我一遍跑下来发现了俩（这里的道具不会统计在收集率里）  [h1] 总结[/h1] 总的来说，这个游戏还是挺不错的。如果觉得超银难了可以玩玩这个，有相近的感觉。

Date 2022-02-22 Playtime 6h 54m Rec Negative wanted to love this game so much, im a massive fan of metroidvania and I feel like most negative reviws don't wanna bite the bullet and just commit to saying that this is a bad game. Half baked combat and worlds with level design that's so tedious it makes you question why're you're playing. The world is massive, system shock 2's map is more helpful than this map. it's especially bad when you have literally no idea what you're supposed to be doing because there's nothing to indicate progress, you're given many routes to follow before reaching the end and getting stuck because you don't have some random power to continue yet so you backtrack through the entire map and try a different route, if you can even remember where you started. The clunky controls make this even worse, unintuitive on a gamepad and nearly unplayable on keyboard. the retro blocky design leaned too hard into itself to the point where it just looks straight up ugly and not in the way the devs intended. Every area looks exactly the same just swapped with a different color pallete, the enemies are incredibly uninspired bullet sponges that will make you just want to avoid em instead of kill them.

Date 2022-02-21 Playtime 1h 0m Rec Negative boring game
Date 2022-02-21 Playtime 19h 21m Rec Positive Обычно инди-метроидвании больше берут из кастлеваний, чем из метроидов, но тут как раз обратный случай. И дело не только в том, что здесь нужно стрелять, а не махать мечом. Обычно инди-метроидвании — это, по сути, набор коридоров и петель, вы бегаете по ним туда-сюда и в определённых местах видите, что, например, тут раньше нельзя было запрыгнуть, но вы получили двойной прыжок и теперь можете это сделать. Здесь, как и в нинтендовских метроидах, сам игровой процесс меняется по мере получения вами новых способностей. Где вам приходилось прыгать с платформу на платформу и уворачиваться от врагов, теперь можно пройти сквозь стену и быстренько пропрыгать. А потом — пролетать рывками ещё быстрее. Станций телепорта здесь нет (тоже в духе метроидов), и такие попытки сделать посещение уже пройденных мест не таким однообразным и затянутым весьма кстати.  Главная особенность игры — специальная штука, которой можно вызывать глюки у противников и окружения, чтобы что-нибудь в них поменять. Например, противники ослабеют, поменяют поведение или вообще станут полезными. Станут вас лечить или помогут добраться куда-нибудь. Есть несложные головоломки — добраться до кнопок, открывающих запертые проходы.  Сюжет какой-то запутанный и у меня интереса не вызвал. Предполагается, что вы будете узнавать тайну этого мира и того, как главный герой к нему причастен. Персонажи страдают словоблудием, записки тоже подают всё туманно. Встречаете какие-то гигантские головы, которые тут называют русалками (так в оригинале — the Rusalki), они вас куда-то посылают, чтобы в конце справиться с финальным боссом. Сами боссы разочаровывают — простейшие шаблоны атак, стреляй да уворачивайся.  Графика некрасивая. Да что там некрасивая — просто уродливая. Сразу видно — программист рисовал. Что-то нарисовано получше, что-то — похуже, но всё вместе на экране это очень плохо стыкуется. Все квадратики резко выделяются. По виду сразу не понять, какие из них — препятствия и платформы, а какие — фон. Никакого цветового кодирования, когда очевидно, например, где у противников опасное место, а где уязвимое. Будете ходить по зелёным уровням с зелёным фоном и зелёными врагами, фиолетовым уровням с фиолетовым фоном и фиолетовыми врагами, и так далее.  Музыка, с одной стороны, бодрая и цепляющая, а с другой — бьёт по ушам. А в локации, где приходится бывать чаще всего, в мелодии звучит такой раздражающий вой, что хоть выключай. Любителям электронщины зайдёт, людям со вкусом в музыке — вряд ли.  Зачем-то в игру добавили много видов оружия — ОЧЕНЬ много. Оно может круто выглядеть, но действует не лучше стартового оружия, с которым можно пройти всю игру. Найдёте секрет с новой пушкой, опробуете её и забудете навсегда. Такое впечатление, будто разработчик понапридумывал разнообразное оружие, но не смог выбрать, что оставить, или же ему просто жалко было выкидывать свои идеи, и он решил оставить вообще всё. Очень странное решение.  Ещё, по-видимому, разработчик не придумал удобный способ разместить все способности на кнопках, и я постоянно путался в них. Особенно не удались крюк-кошка и рывок.  Если почитать обзоры, то все игру так хвалят, что можно подумать, что это прям шедевр на все времена и 10/10. Я уверен, они просто не видели хорошие игры, в которых всё сделано как надо. Что-то в Axiom Verge сделано хорошо, что-то плохо. Хватает уникальных фич, выделяющих её среди других инди-метроидваний, и я её скорее рекомендую, хотя не уверен, что она понравится. Если вам не доставляет большого неудобства кровотечение из глаз и ушей от внешнего вида и музыки, то можете попробовать. Лучше сначала посоветую поиграть в Super Metroid, а когда пройдёте, то можете вспомнить и про Axiom Verge.

Date 2022-02-13 Playtime 28h 46m Rec Positive I am a big fan of the Metroid franchise, so when I bought this game, I was looking to fill a void. At first, I got bored and did not touch the game again for months because I was being unfair in giving it a chance. However, I decided to really play the game. As I advanced through the story, I was more and more hooked wanting to discover what was going on. I found the game play to be engaging and pleasantly frustrating. Solving a puzzle was not always obvious, and there is quite a bit to master if you want to achieve 100% completion. 9/10 for me.

Date 2022-02-08 Playtime 14h 53m Rec Positive [h1]At-A-Glance:[/h1] [b]Game type:[/b] Action-adventure [b]Genre(s):[/b] Science fiction, Metroidvania, platformer [b]Art:[/b] 8-bit and 16-bit with glitch aesthetics [b]Length:[/b] Medium (7-10 hours) [b]Pace:[/b] Medium-paced [b]Tags:[/b] Surreal, glitchy, [i]Alien[/i], indie, retro, great soundtrack [b]Computer requirements:[/b] Low-end   [h1]Notes:[/h1] [olist] [*] An absolute love letter to the first [i]Metroid[/i] game. When games use the Metroidvania genre, what they're usually looking toward are [i]Symphony of the Night[/i] and [i]Super Metroid[/i]. However, this game looks at NES [i]Metroid[/i], utilizing aesthetic choices that are almost universally seen as bad when looking at old-school [i]Metroid[/i] through modern (2015) eyes. [*] The soundtrack is an absolute bop. Put it alongside [i]Hotline Miami[/i] and [i]Katana Zero[/i]. [*] The game strongly appropriates the less good aspects of NES [i]Metroid[/i], like the long tunnels, repetitive enemies/platforms, and somewhat monotonous environments. But I found the game was very successful in using that as a narrative device and basing the glitch gameplay around that exact type of aesthetic. I’ve never really seen another game do something similar in that way, with the CRT-TV changes in the [spoiler]secret worlds[/spoiler] perfectly hitting my memories. But, I also think that people who don't have that retro-gaming background may still find [i]Axiom Verge[/i]'s oddities enticing, so long as they know this comes from a VERY different frame of reference compared to [i]Hollow Knight[/i], [i]Ori[/i], or [i]Guacamelee[/i]. It's far more hostile. [*] Hardware glitches are a gameplay mechanic. This is a good thing. [*] There are FAR more weapons to be found than you will ever need or use - and I love that. Many excellently-made Metroidvanias impress upon the player the need for all power-ups to beat the game (which is totally fine!), but [i]Axiom Verge[/i] stands out in that the reward for exploring is just different ways of fighting enemies. Not necessarily better - just different. That experimental aspect fits perfectly in the game's halfway-metatextual narrative. Players who are used to getting new items for improvement/betterment might find that less positive. [*] Trace is an annoying protagonist. He has the issue of simply not appearing to have real reactions to gigantic, enormous, terrifying machines and biomechanical hybrids. It's a quip there and a joke here - and I can't tell if this game is supposed to be funny or not. I assume it isn't based on a few characters' oblique statements, but Trace's (understandable) dumbfoundedness gives way to (less understandable) gauche. I would almost recommend first-timers use the speedrun mode and make this a more haunting, lonely experience like its influences. [*] The game tries to give you its twist twice, with the second time supposedly being more emotional... but we already know the twist, ergo it isn't as much. The first time is awkward too, as it comes out seemingly out of nowhere [spoiler]after you go through the somewhat psychedelic challenge run to a cutscene boss[/spoiler]. It's as if the narrative slightly gets in the way of itself because it's worried you won't get it the first time. [/olist]

I wouldn't actually buy it myself, but the soundtrack in this game is worth buying... if you're.. one of those kinda people.  I got lost trying to navigate this game for like 2 months. Its very good and you have to work for the win. Definitely worth the money.
Date 2022-02-03 Playtime 28h 1m Rec Positive Para quem curte metroidvanias é um excelente jogo. tem vários poderes para adquirir, alem de serem muitos divertidos de usar. os bosses não são super difíceis, tendo apenas um que é chatinho pra acertar os ataques nele, o que frusta um pouco, mas de resto é um jogo legal, que levara algumas horas pra vcs completar tudo que pra se fazer nele
Date 2022-02-02 Playtime 12h 36m Rec Negative This is the type of game that makes me wish there was an option between "yes, recommend" and "no, don't recommend." Overall, I think it's just okay. If you love Metroidvanias - Hollow Knight, the Ori series, the Metroid series, the Castlevania series, etc. - and this game is on sale, then definitely give it a shot. Otherwise, I would say it's not worth your time.  Sudra, the world Axiom Verge places you into, is not very compelling. I never acquired a good sense of place, nor was I transported by its atmosphere. Like most elements of this game, the alien world was merely passable. Exploring this world was also nothing special. The pixel art was, for the most part, decent. There were a few moments where it shined - I loved all of the designs for the Rusalki -  but it oftentimes lacked the personality of contemporary pixel art games like Shovel Knight or Celeste.  It was also a pain to traverse. Movement in this game, at least on mouse and keyboard, is far clunkier than other modern Metroidvanias. On top of that, there isn't a fast travel system. Well, there sort of is, but it is extremely limited. For a game that requires extensive backtracking, this seems like an obvious oversight. I was also not a fan of this game's minimalist, grid based map system. The abundant save points were much appreciated, but some of them were also a tad bit out of the way. I hated dying to a boss and then being forced to navigate back to it through rooms full of hard hitting enemies. Why wasn't there a save point immediately outside of every boss room?  Speaking of bosses, this game only has a few of them, none of which were very memorable. Of the eight bosses I fought, I would only consider two of them to be fun and challenging fights. The other six were either too easy or straight up frustrating.  The bosses are somewhat emblematic of the basic enemies. Most of the time, enemies were just mindless cannon fodder. Other times, enemies would bring you down to half health before you even realized what happened. This gap in difficulty is the main problem I had with the game. Somewhere between frustrating and boring lies a satisfying middle ground that most games should strive for. Axiom Verge, unfortunately, rarely hits the mark.  The music in the game was actually quite good. Intense, alien, pounding, and synth heavy. I would only complain about one area's soundtrack, which became really annoying after a while thanks to some loud, warbling, pitched up vocals.   The weapons and movement abilities in this game were actually numerous, interesting, and diverse. However, a weapon is only as fun as the enemy you're fighting, and movement is only as fun as the world you are navigating. Because this game is lacking in both of those departments, the unique move sets and guns didn't redeem this game for me. Unfortunately, this game's combat and mechanics were never given a chance to live up to their full potential.  Lastly, the story was just not very interesting. There was nothing about it that grabbed me. Nothing about it that demanded that I pay attention, latch on to every word, and figure out what's going on. For me, this game lacked a proper hook. Now, I don't think a story is necessary for a game to be good. There are plenty of games I love that have mediocre to nonexistent stories. The difference is that those games have fun gameplay.  Well, that's my review. This game has some standout moments, but the overall experience is rather lackluster. I am sure some people will love this game, and it's very possible you might love this game. However, based on my experience with it, I wouldn't take that risk unless it's on sale.
Date 2022-02-01 Playtime 13h 1m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a very purist take on the Metroidvania style of games, focusing almost entirely on the Metroid half of the equation; which leads to Axiom Verge being easily one of the best indie games to capture what makes Metroid feel like Metroid; the alien environments and eerie atmosphere. Axiom Verge does pretty much everything right as far as world, music, power-up design, and secret/puzzle solving goes. Sudra (the World) is a very enjoyable place to explore with a variety of environments that all look stellar, accompanied by the music that drives home how alien and desolate you are with some real fuckin' bangers in the soundtrack. Power-ups come in a wide variety in Axiom Verge; you have the traditional heallth, damage, range, shot-size increases, simple stat increases that do very simple things - and then you have the wide variety of different gun types and traversal upgrades that give you a ton of ways to deal with almost every situation, it is 100% worth looking for as many weapons as possible, not to mention you unlock the ability to literally hack enemies and change their function to make them easier to deal with. Next up is the secrets and puzzles. A lot of them are very intuitive and well done, making it feel fairly natural when you find out what to do; however some are kind of confusing to imagine as a new person to the game; like the classic Dinger-Gisbar puzzle that unlocks the flamethrower.   Now, onto the enemies and bosses. For the most part, the enemies are fine, but there is a heavy standout being the Sentry enemies, floating machines that rapidly fire twin guns at you. In the games favor, you can teleport through their attacks, and hack them to make them less dangerous; but I feel this enemy design is not very fair in the instances they use them, Small rooms and corridors do not make for a good dodging environment regardless of teleport or not, compounded with these enemies being some of the tankiest enemies in the entire game and you're bound to get hit hard by them. Thankfully a lot of enemies are alright once you know what they are but the sentries stand out as absolute nightmares to deal with.  Now for the bosses. Overall, my opinion on the bosses is a bit weird. On one hand some of them are really annoyingly designed and frustrating, but most of those annoying ones have really exploitable features of their fight. In my first run I had roughly 58-ish deaths, and I'm willling to a quarter of those were to the scorpion boss. I was not enjoying myself with that boss, so I decided to explore elsewhere and ended up getting a gun that had a function that would probably of made him way easier - not very far away from his arena at all. That gun was probably designed to kill him, so I go back and beat him the first fucking try after I get that weapon. Like it isn't even a fair fight. He just fucking dies. Another example is a hornet boss, who is normally a tanky nightmare but if you hack its minions near its face and kill them - boom, boss dead just like that. On one had the designs are frustrating to go up against, but when you exploit their weaknesses they aren't that bad. My favorite boss is probably the second one; just a straight up test of "how well can you control your jumping?" or the third one that is comparatively easy when placed with all the others, but its just a fun spectacle.   Overall, I really enjoyed Axiom Verge; I 100% recommend it if you like the Metroid in metroidvania, it only suffers from a few annoyingly designed enemies but lets be honest; what game doesn't?
Date 2022-01-31 Playtime 18h 38m Rec Positive 类银河战士游戏文艺复兴代表作。非常规范的类银河战士，当然游戏还是非常硬核的（不是怪难，而是地图难） 剧情：https://www.jianshu.com/p/0bdfff4da6ba
Date 2022-01-31 Playtime 15h 44m Rec Positive If you're a fan of Metroidvanias, I reckon you've bought and completed it already. It has a lot of interesting and fun upgrades and a vast variety of weapons (tho you shall find useful ~5 out of 20 of them). Many secrets, great chiptune music, good storyline.   The only thing I ever complained about in this game was grapple mechanics since it tries to be similar to Grapple Beam from Super Metroid but does it poorly. You can get used to it nonetheless.
Date 2022-01-29 Playtime 6h 37m Rec Positive An enjoyable game.
Date 2022-01-29 Playtime 10h 38m Rec Positive Metroidvania More Metroid than vania If you like Metroid and you can look at the graphics and decide you can totally tolerate them, then I can recommend this. I, for one, don't have a problem with the graphics.
Date 2022-01-29 Playtime 14h 28m Rec Positive It starts off a bit slow, so I put it down, came back to and regret putting it down its a great game.
Date 2022-01-28 Playtime 2h 3m Rec Negative It is really special as a single person with a lot of effort, but unfortunately there is no aha effect that I do not already know from playing other metroid games - my assessment is completely subjective - but unfortunately doesn't tempt me to continue playing - it all feels too technical...
Date 2022-01-28 Playtime 11h 4m Rec Positive Axiom Verge takes the weirdest and most alien aspects of Metroid and makes them weirder and more alien. An incredible feat of solo game development from Thomas Happ, it eschews almost every traditional "Metroidvania" movement and access upgrade to create unique new methods for navigating a hostile environment. The hacking and drone abilities gained early on provide fascinating new method for exploring and modifying the world, with a huge number of potential applications – implying an equally huge number of potential secrets to be uncovered.
Date 2022-01-27 Playtime 11h 10m Rec Positive If you like metroidvania games and the aesthetics are to your liking, this is a solid choice. If you love metroidvania games you already bought/played/beat it good for you.

Date 2022-01-22 Playtime 14h 12m Rec Positive Lots of vanias out there and not a lot of metroids! This scratches the latter itch real good. Also made by one dude which is super impressive.
Date 2022-01-22 Playtime 14h 37m Rec Positive "What if Super Metroid sucked a little bit?"
Date 2022-01-20 Playtime 10h 37m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a good metroidvania.....but it is also my least favourite one that I have finished. The game has a lot going for it, especially in the beginning, but by the end of the experience I felt like I've played a lot better.  Structurally, the game is sound. It plays just like a Metroid game (too much in fact in the beginning). The bosses are interestingly designed and the weapons and upgrades are all very fun to use as well. The music is quite catchy as well. One would expect the drab setting to have more unsettling tracks, but that isn't the case here. Also, while I've heard a lot of people talk about the story taking itself too seriously, I disagree. It's an interesting story, especially if you take the time to read into the lore scattered around the world. That's completely upto the player, however. The plot is never forced down your throat.  Now why do I just 'like' this game and not love it? Inconsistency. I didn't find all the weapons to be that useful. While I did find the upgrades interesting to use, I did not like that the lab coat upgrades could not be activated by a specific button. I found it quite cumbersome to constantly double tap the d-pad (or the left stick) to use the upgrade. The game is still being patched to this day, yet this still hasn't been fixed. An option to map the ability to a separate button would have been nice. Moreover, while I did praise the bosses the normal enemy designs are either plain ugly or they are annoying to fight or both. Traversing around the map, as such, is not all that fun due to these annoyances. To combat this, a teleportation function could have been present. Most other metroidvanias I have played have teleportation stations, yet this game doesn't. Finally, I think this game doesn't hold up too well graphically. I know that it is going for a certain kind of style, but the environments, more often than not, feel quite drab and monotonous to explore.  This might have felt like a scathing review, but I still do recommend this game. You may find something here that I didn't. I was just not too blown away by this one.
Date 2022-01-19 Playtime 11h 11m Rec Positive It's like playing the original metroid, with everything cranked up to 11. It's amazing.
Date 2022-01-19 Playtime 12h 43m Rec Positive Good if you like old style metroidvania. You don't have a clear indication to where you should go next, lots of secrets to discover, lots of weapons to choose from based on preference (still didn't find any enemy which requires a specific weapon). But the bosses are forgettable, there is no teleport, so you waste too much time walking around sections you already cleared multiple times. I don't plan playing again once I finish it, but I like it in general.
Date 2022-01-18 Playtime 6h 14m Rec Positive A great SuperMetroid type of game. If you like Super Metroid you will love this homage to those types of games from the 16 bit era.
Date 2022-01-18 Playtime 3h 13m Rec Positive O jogo é um metroidvania que se inspira nos jogos da série Metroid, mas com algumas inovações como o seletor de armas, a broca e o colete de atravessar paredes. Só achei que o jogo dá muitas armas, mas só uma pequena seleção delas é realmente útil em combate, o que torna a maioria dela sub-utilizada.  Teve uma parte que fiquei perdido por um longo tempo, tentando descobrir para onde ir. Talvez fosse noobisse de minha parte, mas o jogo poderia ter dado mais dicas ambientais sobre onde ir, especialmente quando se trata de um jogo com corredores longos e sem teleportes.  A trilha sonora usa instrumentação chiptune misturada com sons modernos. Algumas músicas são muito boas, outras nem tanto. A qualidade da trilha não é tão consistente quanto eu gostaria, mas ok...  A parte que eu realmente desaprovo são as charadas que jogo coloca no meio dos documentos que contam a lore do jogo. Isso faz com que certos itens e upgrades fiquem restritos àqueles que tenham saco de ficar resolvendo charadas. Isso infelizmente fez com que eu zerasse o jogo com menos de 100% dos itens coletados, sendo que só fui investigar depois na internet como pega os itens faltantes. Para mim o jogo deveria estar apto de ser completado 100% sem ajuda de meios externos.  Fora isso, o jogo de maneira geral foi satisfatório. Não é um jogo perfeito, mas ele consegue estabelecer uma identidade visual e sonora própria. Com certeza irei jogar Axion Verge 2 quando tiver a oportunidade.
Date 2022-01-14 Playtime 10h 9m Rec Positive Pros:    1) The game-play is fun as hell and once you get certain power-ups, traversing through the world becomes even more fun. I had a little bit of a issue with how many buttons you had to memorise, but it's not something that really ruins the experience of the game.    2) Speaking of power-ups, they're really creative and help give you the sense that you're slowly getting more powerful like any good metroidvania game. Without giving any spoilers on some of the abilities, I really liked how much effort was put into the special effects on them.    3) This game does a good job at making players discover by exploring. It will tease you with paths that you can't explore yet until you get a certain power-up. Then, once you get said power-up, you can explore those paths, opening the possibilities of where you can go and what you can find even further.    4) The art-style is great and really helps give off the feeling of an unnaturally grotesque world inhabited by creatures of both flesh and metal. I even felt mesmerised by some of the scenery in this game.    5) The bosses are challenging and feel rewarding to defeat if you play on hard mode. Some of these bosses require you to really think about and discover where their weak-spots are.  Cons:    1) The map in this game is less than desirable. It gets the job, but I feel that it's not as useful when you're trying to find out what you're next objective is.    2) I felt that the world-building was done poorly in this game. I didn't seem to care about how each area became the way that it was, and the characters didn't look like they cared either.  Suggestions:    1) For the map issue, one suggestion I would make is to add markers on the map that would display both items and objectives. That way, players won't be wandering around aimlessly trying to figure out what they're supposed to do next.    2) For the world-building issue, one suggestion I would make is to add a few NPCs that would give you small trinkets of lore about what the world of Sudra used to be like before it went to cr*p. Just anything that would make the world feel more alive and less like a sandbox.  Final Thoughts:    Overall, I very much enjoyed this game and what it had to offer. What it lacked in story and world-building, it made up for in it's game-play and challenge. The power-ups were fun to use, the world and it's puzzles were entertaining to solve, and the bosses gave me a real challenge to overcome. I would give this game a final score of 7/10.
Date 2022-01-13 Playtime 14h 3m Rec Negative It's alright for a metroidvania style game, I like the aesthetic and a lot of the guns are fun. My main problem with this game is the bosses are incredibly hit or miss. A lot of the early bosses are a lot of fun and interesting to fight, but near the end the bosses just become really boring DPS races due to the projectiles they shoot being incredibly difficult to evade, bordering on impossible to dodge at some points. Also the main character is not only incredibly unlikable, he feels so awkward from just about every standpoint in this game. He feels out of place and really ruins any semblance of a plot this game has. This game could use a hell of a lot of changes, but it's fine as it is I suppose. Just don't pay full price for it.
Date 2022-01-13 Playtime 17h 20m Rec Negative (I would give this game a neutral score but Steam only lets you be positive or negative.)  [h1]Pros:[/h1] [code]+ OST + Art + Neat ideas + Story[/code]  [h1]Cons: [/h1] [code]- The backtracking because you are lost instead of it being a choice. - No real direction on what to do at some points. - Boss fights made me motion sick. - One boss fight makes you beat it with a specific weapon. (You can find about 20 weapons, so why limit?) - Second to last boss was one of the worst experiences I have had in gaming.  - Enemy time to kill is too high.  - Enemies do to much damage.  - Enemies don't drop enough health.[/code]  [h1]Thoughts:[/h1] [code]I don't know if I would recommend this game or not. I think if you are a hardcore metroidvania fan, and don't mind BS like the [spoiler]fake wall after Ridleys fight[/spoiler] in Super Metroid, or the [spoiler]fake lava[/spoiler] in OG/Zero Mission, then you probably won't mind navigating in this game. I really loved the first 5 hours of the game, but after that I started to get frustrated with the exploration. I love backtracking in metroidvania games, but the difference here is I was backtracking because I was lost. Sure, I was getting more powerful and finding new items as I wandered around, but not knowing what my goal was making the game excruciatingly boring for me. I also feel like having so many weapon choices is a good idea on paper, but in practice impractical. Only about 4 of the 20 or so weapons I ever found were usable. Maybe if the time to kill wasn't so high it would have been more fun to pick and chose which weapon I wanted to use.  That all said, this game did have one of the best sound tracks I have ever heard.[/code]

Date 2022-01-06 Playtime 20h 42m Rec Positive Axiom Verge - что она из себя представляет? [b]Сюжет[/b]  Он здесь есть, и весьма продуманный. Не всё в этой истории является тем, чем кажется, но главная претензия к лору и сюжетной составляющей: игроку напрямую через диалоги объясняют лишь малую часть, фабулу, а дополнительные записки, которые разбросаны по миру, туманны и если не вчитываться и не пытаться их как-то альтернативно интерпретировать, то тоже мало что будет понятно. Хотелось бы видеть больше доступной информации о мире игры. Но зато такие условия создают идеальную среду для создания собственных теорий и додумываний. [b]Визуал и саундтрек[/b] Видно, что на дизайн всего в игре повлияли произведения Лавкрафта с его потусторонними мирами и работы Гигера с его биомеханикой, и именно это создаёт атмосферу гнетущего биомеханического ужаса. Ландшафты, задний фон, дизайн врагов - почти всё здесь представляет какой-то сплав механики и органики. Пиксели как ограничивают восприятие окружения, так и дают простор для фантазии, и игрок сам вырисовывает в голове как на самом деле выглядит то или иное существо. Саундтрек здесь, как и стиль, тоже специфичный, так скажем. Музыка очень странная, под стать самому миру Судры. Это тоже создаёт особенную атмосферу, хотя после долгого прослушивания музыка начинает давить на уши и сильно въедается в мозг, что вызывает дискомфорт. В прочем, может того и хотел добиться автор. [b] Геймплей [/b] В геймплее всё сделано на уровне, но есть несколько претензий к аспектам, которые вызывают сильное раздражение, когда с ними сталкиваешься. [i]Дикий бэктрекинг[/i] - если вы решили собрать все-все записки и предметы, то сочувствую вам, ибо бэктрекинг здесь реализован так себе из-за отсутствия удобной системы быстрого перемещения. Она так-то здесь есть, но большую часть вашего пути вы всё равно будете шагать пешком, оббегая заново все локации, что только утомляет. Думаю это всё можно было решить, просто добавив возможность телепортироваться между точками сохранения. [i]Дикое расположение предметов[/i] - Опять же, если вы захотели собрать 100% всего, то снова сочувствую вам. Самостоятельно я собрал где-то 70% предметов и открыл 80% карты, и это я старался тыкаться в почти каждый угол и искать какие-то намёки на секретные проходы. Остальная же часть предметов находилась ну уж в совсем нелогичных местах, обнаружить их можно было только если чисто случайно или если реально тыкаться вообще в каждый угол и стенку, ибо намёков на их расположение там никаких не было. Поэтому если вы не преисполнены энтузиазмом досконально протыкивать все стены всех комнат, будьте готовы к использованию гайдов. [i]Пляски спрайта персонажа после получения урона[/i] - в пылу битвы получив урон текстура вашего персонажа начинает мигать и пока она прозрачная, вы не можете получить ещё урон, такое состояние часто есть в подобных играх. Но иногда текстура тупо берёт и вообще исчезает, и вы на ощупь пытаетесь поменять позицию, но потом обнаруживается, что вы или упёрлись в стену или персонаж находится совсем в другом месте или вы стоите в гуще врагов. Снова прилетает урон, и вы снова на ощупь пытаетесь выбраться из ситуации, как Велма, потерявшая очки. Всё остальное особых претензий у меня не вызывает. Разве что боссы кажутся слишком топорно сделанными, к каждому можно достаточно быстро подобрать нужное оружие или подстроиться под его паттерн поведения. Ну а если вы более-менее собирали предметы и улучшения на своём ходу, то финального босса можно просто затанковать) Интересной особенностью является механика "взлома" врагов. Так можно превратить их в своих союзников, ощутимо ослабить или вовсе придать им новые свойства (Например некоторые враги получают способность разбивать стены, так можно добраться до некоторых скрытых мест). Также в странствиях можно найти "секретные миры", их вроде всего 5 на каждый файл сохранения, они появляются в рандомных местах и каждый раз генерируются разными, но причём на фоне остальных локаций они выглядят сильно искажёнными. Сами эти миры, механика взлома намекают, что мир Axiom Verge является виртуальной симуляцией, что в прочем, по сути правда) [b]Итог[/b] Я был бы рад поставить нейтральную оценку, но если выбирать из двух вариантов, я скорее склоняюсь к положительной, ведь среднестатистический игрок скорее всего не столкнётся с диким расположением предметов и всё, что сможет его разочаровать - исчезновение текстуры героя в пылу сражения, топорность боссов и если игроку важен лор - его недосказанность. Вместе с тем я получил большое удовольствие во время игры: Axiom Verge обладает необычным стилем, имеет при себе интересные механики и удовлетворяет потребность в исследовании, так что как представитель метроидваний игра является вполне достойным вариантом.
Date 2022-01-06 Playtime 27h 56m Rec Positive This game is soo good that I bought the documentary about it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Date 2022-01-06 Playtime 9h 37m Rec Negative My favorite part about this game is how the annoying beeping sound when health is low matches up with the beat of the awesome soundtrack.  Edit: I actually really was enjoying this game but the boss fights near the end of it all is just lazy boss mechanics. Really made me angry because this has such a great atmosphere and progression for Metroidvania style game.

Date 2022-01-03 Playtime 9h 55m Rec Positive Fun
Date 2022-01-03 Playtime 46h 39m Rec Negative After replaying it, ive gotta say;  This game has a ton of flaws. dont get me wrong, its a good game - but the story is lackluster, the world feels empty and boring and you literally get no guidance.  The story is absolutely nonexistant, apart from the notes/coded journals you find in the game and the cutscenes that happen once every full moon. Like not even "show, dont tell" nonexistant, its literally basically not communicated. it doesnt go deeper than surface level and from the few pieces of dialogue you get you learn literally nothing.  the bosses are, in the nicest way steam lets me say, absolute rubbish because not only does it not tell you where you're suppost to hit; for half of them it changes the camera which literally never happens in the game elsewhere.  The secret's hidden throught the world are partially literally just not normally findable without a guide or you have to do some weird, janky stuff to even get to them that feels completely unintentional. like something you have to (spoilers) grapplehook up to the ceiling, ungrapple and while falling drill, repeat 5 times and then you need to throw a drone into that hole and hope it lands....  its really flawed. i like it because of nostalgia reasons but if i were to play it for the first time today, i wouldnt like it. keep these things in mind
Date 2022-01-02 Playtime 17h 10m Rec Positive Muy bueno, sin más. Es rollo metroid, es accesible, no se pasa con la dificultad, y aunque es fácil perderse, al final encuentras por donde ir. Si te molan los metroidvanias, te va a molar.
Date 2022-01-02 Playtime 4h 36m Rec Positive Un gran metroidvania, el final es un poco enredado pero es muy entretenido, con muchos artefactos y escenarios
Date 2022-01-02 Playtime 9h 28m Rec Positive Se pudiera considerar una copia del Metroid 2D pero este juego va mucho mas allá. 9/10
Date 2022-01-02 Playtime 42h 50m Rec Positive This game is a very highly polished Metroidvania that surpasses it's inspiration in many ways. From level to sound design, story and art direction, this game is a true masterpiece. i give this game a 9.5 out of 10. It felt a bit shorter than i'd like which prevents me from giving it a perfect score, but make no mistake this game is brilliant.
Date 2022-01-01 Playtime 7h 55m Rec Positive As far as Metroidvania games go, this one is VERY close to Super Metroid. In both map layout, power-ups, SNES pixel art (for the most part) and gameplay. So if you liked Super Metroid, you'll like this. Think of it as a bargain bin version of SM.  Some of the power-ups are actually unique (the phase through walls one being something I've never seen before) and the gunplay is quite well balanced. Tie this all together with a MOSTLY excellent OST (there's one area that has an absolutely godawful theme and... you'll know it when you hear it) and you have a pretty good game.  Big downside is the platforming involving the grapple as it controls like shit and the boss fights after the first 2 are pretty awful. If you liked the Kraid fight in SM you'll love about 7/10 of the bosses in this game. Pretty short too at 7 hours for a 75% completion run and the endgame can be quite hard to figure out where to go.  There are better Metroidvania's out there (hell Super Metroid is free if you emulate) but this one is solid and wholly recommendable whilst on sale.
Date 2022-01-01 Playtime 9h 40m Rec Positive Music and mechanics are sweet.

Date 2022-01-01 Playtime 21h 54m Rec Positive [h1]An homage to [i]Metroid[/i]...[/h1]  Overall, a fun sci-fi focused Metroidvania, which definitely leans more toward [i]Metroid[/i] than [i]Castlevania[/i] both in terms of setting as well as combat. The gunplay in [i]Axiom Verge[/i] isn't as satisfying as it could be - I would have rather had fewer types of weapons with more clearly defined applications - but it is good overall. Some of the movement is janky, particularly in using the  [spoiler]grappling hook[/spoiler] which I found to be reminiscent of web-slinging in old NES-era [i]Spider-Man[/i] titles (perhaps [i]Bionic Commando[/i] would be a more apt comparison). I never felt like the movement of the player, particularly with teleporting, phase shifting (for lack of a better word) and jumping had to be frequently combined in ways that made playing with a d-pad preferable vs. an analog stick.  Overall, I got roughly ~20 hours and while I didn't find every secret, I was doing my best as [i]Metroid[/i] is one of my favorite series and this was a clear homage. By the end I was ready to be done. I think if you can get it for < $10 it is money well spent. 
Date 2022-01-01 Playtime 13h 16m Rec Positive Pros:  I like what the game try to present with a sci-fi story and theme. The developer really nailed the aesthetic and overall the exploration was fun and gameplay was acceptable. Every tools and upgrades felt rewarding, although some weapon feels a bit too situational to use. Great soundtrack and atmosphere they had built into this game.  Cons:  What I really don't like is the design and how the game execute the challenges it throws at you sometimes. In multiple points you will face an area with bad enemy placement or simply a spot where you will have to get hurt. It's not a big deal, but there were a lot of these spots that made the game frustrating more than challenging at times and it doesn't felt like a "fun" challenges to overcome at all. In reverse, some enemies are place in a questionable places too, where they effectively are a zero threats because the can't do jack to you. Basically became a pointless obstacle that add no value to the experience.   Then it's the boss. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be what the developer had in their vision but most of them felt flat and too simple to dealt with. I didn't played the game on hard mode but I imagined the difference would probably be something like damage multiplier so I apologize in advance if I got that wrong but if that's the case, even with hard mode the bosses will still as complex as whatever they were, which is not at all. One good position and one weapon then all you have to do is press the same button to shoot constantly and jump or duck a few time.  Last thing I'd like to comment on is audio. As mentioned on pros, the music and atmosphere were done really well and I totally get the retro vibe they are going for. But in terms of sound design for some monster or area it's like earr*pe festival. The ghouls, the boulder, the glitch, etc. I get the point of the bit-design sound to go along with the aesthetic of the game but it has put some areas of the game on a "get this done quick so I can gtfo with my ears intact" feel into it.  Summary: Overall a good game. Despite I noted a lot of flaws but it's still very solid Metroidvania with an interesting story and atmosphere that came with a fun gameplay to hook you through 10+ hours. Worth the money.
Date 2021-12-31 Playtime 17h 1m Rec Positive After owning it for 6 years I finally got around to playing Axiom Verge today. Solid game, not my favorite metroidvania, but I enjoyed the story, art, music and atmosphere.   My main critiques was that I got stuck for a solid hour because I didn't understand exactly what the game wanted me to do to progress, and there was too many choices for weapons by the end and for the most part I just used the lighting shotgun you get near the start.   Minor critiques were having to look up how to translate the alien scripts so that I could see the whole plot, and not have a through quick travel system  In all a great game and I'm looking forward to playing the sequel.
Date 2021-12-31 Playtime 17h 16m Rec Positive Axiom Verge é uma experiência incrível para os fãs do genero Metroidvania, mas existem alguns pontos que me fazem achar que este titulo pode não ser para qualquer um. Seu design e estética são únicos, uma pixel art divina que remete muito a jogos antigos no mesmo estilo como a franquia Castlevania e Metroid. Assim como a maioria dos metroids, explore um mundo enorme e consiga cada vez mais recursos que te possibilitam de avançar em áreas que ainda não podiam ser exploradas, junto dessa caminhada, mate centenas de milhares de monstros futuristas que querem te ver morto. Algo que não me agradou muito e por isso penso que não pode ser um jogo para qualquer um é que: o sistema de exploração pode ser extremamente cansativo e tedioso, uma vez que, diferente de alguns outros títulos do genero como Hollow Knight, Blasphemous e SteamWorld Dig, o jogo não possui nenhum tipo de mecânica relacionada ao transporte entre áreas, logo, você deve sempre refazer caminhos longos e até mesmo estressantes para chegar em um determinado local que você já havia explorado. Além disso, a trilha sonora em 8-bit é algo que agrada de início, sendo uma soundtrack diferente para cada bioma que você acaba encontrando, porém depois de um tempo, esse estilo de música pode se tornar um tanto repetitivo. Considerações finais: Axiom Verge é um ótimo jogo para quem curte metroidvanias e para quem ja esteja acostumado com o processo longo do gênero, porém não recomendo o jogo como um tipo de jogo de entrada para o hobby, uma vez que existem alguns que podem ser mais agradáveis e mais leves do que Axiom Verge. Axiom Verge tem seu charme por apresentar diversas referências e estilos de jogo envolvendo seus antecessores, logo, acho importante experimentá-lo após jogar mais jogos do gênero.

Date 2021-12-29 Playtime 13h 34m Rec Negative 길 찾기 이렇게 좇같은 게임은 진짜 오랜만이다
Date 2021-12-29 Playtime 20h 10m Rec Positive Fun game, very nostalgic. Also VERY disappointed there's NO FAST TRAVEL. I think i'll stop playing it just takes too much time to traverse the whole map trying to find the next progression. I'll cross the entire map then realize, oh, I can't do this part yet, then i have to go through all 4 corners and finally I'll get the thing I need to advance, then I have to go all over in circles again. It's a fun good game, I got very far, but now I'm just over it. If there was fast travel I'd pick it up again.
Date 2021-12-29 Playtime 14h 4m Rec Positive el mejor metroidvania indi que e jugado en mi vida
Date 2021-12-28 Playtime 15h 8m Rec Positive Claro que si.  Si estás buscando un Metroidvania más próximo a Metroid que Castlevania con gráficos Pixel Art y una historia interesante, esta es una excelente opción.  No he jugado aún la secuela pero si la veo en Steam desde luego que estaré interesado en adquirirla.
Date 2021-12-28 Playtime 20h 9m Rec Positive I don't have much to add that has't already been said. It's fun, it's difficult, it's frustrating, and I really enjoy where I think the story is heading.
Date 2021-12-28 Playtime 28h 11m Rec Positive Maravilhoso! Fácil perder várias horas jogando esse game estilo Metroidvania. Recomendo forte!
Date 2021-12-26 Playtime 1h 51m Rec Negative It's not fun nor engaging. if you're expecting Metroid fusion or Symphony of the night you're going to be disapointed. It's more like the Super ness era of metroids.

Date 2021-12-26 Playtime 20h 49m Rec Positive muy buen juego, muy adictivo, un gran tributo a los metroidvanias
Date 2021-12-23 Playtime 5h 53m Rec Positive Томас, спасибо большое за Рандомайзер. Игра и без того была сделана с любовью, и является шедевром и я не знаю, кто и как к чему относится, но мне было бы скучно играть в линейный метроид уже. Может быть я зажрался, а может....я не знаю. Во всяком случае, титанический труд одного человека, плюс поддержка все эти годы, и теперь еще рандомные забеги. Это очень круто. Желаю твоему сыну здоровья, а тебе - творческих успехов, и новых интересных проектов. Может быть теперь, я все таки пройду игру, хотя до этого мне просто было лень...или что то вроде того.
Date 2021-12-23 Playtime 11h 2m Rec Positive I love this game its like Metroid and it's cool check this game out.
Date 2021-12-21 Playtime 11h 36m Rec Positive 我真的很喜欢这个游戏的隐藏要素 爽的不行！！
Date 2021-12-20 Playtime 21h 39m Rec Negative Всё-таки количество народно любимых игр, которые я прошёл в последнее время, на поверку оказывающихся не такими уж замечательными, несколько удивляет. В этот раз будем разбираться, что же не так с Axiom Verge... а что в нём действительно сделано хорошо.  Прежде всего, стоит сказать, что Axiom Verge - это такая классическая метроидвания. То есть, не просто платформер с открытым миром, поделённый на зоны с кучей секретов и маршрутов, которые недоступны, пока мы не получим новую способность, а достаточно консервативный представитель жанра. Хотя это можно сказать, даже глядя по скриншотам - визуально Axiom Verge ну очень близок к своему легендарному предку (Metroid). Как технически, так и стилистически. Прежде всего обращаешь внимание на пейзажи иномирья с причудливыми обитателями, большая часть из которых фактически ваши враги, и, разумеется, с откровенно просматриваемой местами гигеровщиной. Впрочем, есть у Axiom Verge и своя интересная фишка - активное использование глитч-эффектов. Так что по предварительным роликам я ожидал, что по сеттингу тут будет что-то вроде взлома NES-игры, в которой каким-то образом оказался главный герой. Но на самом деле это оказалось просто визуальными эффектами от применения высокотехнологичных механизмов и оружия. По сути же Axiom Verge - это такой откровенный сай-фай с элементами био-панка.  Начинается всё с заставки, в которой игроку представляют главного героя, Трейса, работающего в загородной лаборатории с коллегой. Трейс проводит эксперименты на некой установке, как вдруг, в результате непредвиденной аномалии, происходит взрыв. Придя в сознание, учёный обнаруживает себя в очень странном месте. Не успев толком оправиться от потрясения, Трейс слышит голос, просящий о помощи и направляющий его для этого по определённому направлению. Главный герой пытается завести диалог, но голос смолкает и всё, что остаётся нашему протеже - внять инструкциям и начать свой тернистый путь в этом чужеродном мире. Что и говорить, нотки Another World ощущаются очень явно, но если Лестер оказывается в другом мире случайно, то судьбу Трейса стечением обстоятельств не назовёшь. Однако подробности сюжета излагать я не стану, куда интереснее открывать их для себя самостоятельно. Впрочем, к нему мы ещё вернёмся, пока же сосредоточимся на куда более насущных аспектах.  Консервативный геймплей сама игра поначалу удачно скрадывает своей внешней обскурностью. Кажется, что сейчас и геймдизайн будет выворачивать ваш мозг наизнанку. И очень скоро это впечатление начинает улетучиваться, причём довольно стремительно. Собственно, даже Metroid обладал для своего времени очень смелыми решениями, да и Axiom Verge, конечно, не клонирует внаглую его механики. Однако если смотреть на картину в общем, левелдизайн в игре откровенно посредственный. За причудливой флорой и фауной скрывается достаточно неказистая и местами чуть ли не случайная геометрия. Механики телепортации тут нет, имеется, правда, общая локация-переход, но открывается она далеко не сразу, да и проблему в общем-то не закрывает полностью. А имя этой проблеме - бэктрекинг. Да, это обычная механика для жанра, но чёрт, как же нудно и утомительно она тут реализована. И хотя местные обитатели зачастую действительно странные и необычные, они, как и те же вызывающие нешуточное любопытство при первом взгляде локации, исполнены слишком просто, чтобы было желание возвращаться к ним снова и снова. Секретники, к слову, запрятаны порой так, что нередко найти их можно лишь чисто случайно, просто тыкаясь во все стены. И это, увы, не исключение из правил.  Не лучше обстоит дело и с боссами. Они исполнены откровенно ужасно. Причём если смотрятся они более или менее интересно, то по механикам это просто фиаско. Некоторые из них довольно сложные, факт (единственный раз, когда я подсмотрел в справочные материалы, как раз, когда застрял на одном из боссов, чтобы узнать стратегии борьбы с ним). Примитивные паттерны, практически полное отсутствие второй фазы, малое количество типов атаки у большинства, да ещё и бои с ними смотрятся попросту некрасиво. То есть, это не просто далеко от эталонных босс-файтов Iconoclasts или Touhou Luna Nights, это даже не средне, а прямо плохо. Не отвратительно, конечно, всё-таки под паттерны подстраиваться надо, да и челендж присутствует, но для игры с такой репутацией я, конечно, ожидал большего.  К другим откровенным минусам игры можно отнести её управление на клавиатуре. Выйти из меню через Esc? Ха! Нажмите Q. Что-что? Войти в меню? Да нет же, не Esc. Да какой Q, что вы как маленький? Это же крюк. Жмите Enter. Что-что? Выбрать что-то? Ну разве не очевидно! Разумеется, пробел, на котором привязан ещё прыжок. Короче тут бы я поставил за реализацию откровенную двойку, но благо, что хоть местами есть подсказки и они правильные. Скажем, игра пишет, что дополнительное описание предмета открывается на S. Ну спасибо хоть так. Причём перейти на геймпад у меня желания не возникло ни разу - если не брать навигацию в меню, всё управляется вполне нормально. Есть тут, правда, ещё проблема в том, что для способностей по итогу используется аж восемь кнопок, в которых порой путаешься, особенно в первые минуты после запуска игры, если делал перерыв на пару-тройку дней, но да ладно, простить можно.  Как и в любой метроидвании, важное место в Axiom Verge отводится карте. Тут от неё чего-то особенного ждать не стоит, хотя это общая болячка жанра (в той же Iconoclasts, увы, это сделано ничуть не лучше, остаётся только со вздохом вспоминать удобную "Акварию"). Однако здесь даже есть возможность поставить на карте метки, чтобы не забыть о чём-то интересном и вернуться сюда позже, когда будут открыты новые способности. Но меток всего две на каждую локацию и подписывать их нельзя.  Кстати, о способностях - с ними всё так же неоднозначно. С одной стороны есть довольно интересный разрушитель адреса, испускающий искажающие реальность волны. Благодаря этому можно ослабить некоторых противников или вообще поменять их ключевые свойства. Например, кусты, выпускающие снаряды начнут генерировать здоровье. С другой есть что-то вроде крюка-кошки, который реализован просто отвратительно и крайне не интуитивно. Во фрагментах, где нужно было пользоваться им несколько раз подряд, в сторону разработчика у меня скопилось множество нелестных эпитетов. Крюк из Worms 2 вспоминался как утраченная великая технология, которую в Axiom Verge возможно смогут заново открыть лишь через сотни лет. И такой вот баланс плюсов-минусов проходит через весь список активных предметов.  С оружием ситуация примерно схожая. Впрочем, этой проблемы не избежала и серия Castlevania, когда ушла в сторону метроидов. Та же куча средств уничтожения, большую часть из которого используешь только на пробу, а потом возвращаешься к уже привычным видам оружия. Причём нельзя сказать, что тут что-то совсем уж бесполезно. Просто часто стоит вопрос - а зачем мне это, если у меня уже есть вот такая штука? Думаю, что как бы не четверть всей игры использовал универсальный воранж. Завершил я её, впрочем, с комбинацией инерционного импульса и привязанного заряда. Впрочем, стоит заметить, что даже первое оружие, разрушитель аксиом, вполне эффективно может быть использовано на протяжении всей игры. Да и куда интереснее находить в секретниках что-то действительно новое и уникальное, а не просто "собери шесть чемоданов и получи +1 к урону" (хотя такое тут тоже есть).

Date 2021-12-17 Playtime 11h 19m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania! Has very well designed exploration and interconnected levels. The upgrades are unique enough and rewarding as well. The biggest downfalls are dumb bosses (they all look cool but suck to fight) and movement associated with the teleport ability you get a bit more than halfway through the game. I make a lot of small adjusting movements in games like this and that results in me accidentally double tapping and teleporting off ledges or into enemies. It really should have been its own button, I hope other devs learn from this mistake.

Date 2021-12-07 Playtime 22h 12m Rec Positive Музыка класс, купил даже. Геймплей неплохой, есть интересные моменты и механики, но имхо в целом не на том уровне, чтобы была мотивация перепроходить. На один раз - классная глитч история с шикарным саундтреком.
Date 2021-12-07 Playtime 16h 31m Rec Negative [b]Axiom Verge Score: 4/10[/b] The first half of the game is a solid metroidvania with an extremely unique setting and dazzling art/music. Unfortunately, the latter half takes the worst parts of it, and makes them the primary focus of the rest of the game. Slow, manageable, strategic combat is ramped up to faster movement with a requirement for either specific cheese, or precise movement - yet, the design decisions for the movement options make precision difficult and highly frustrating. The game's best parts are puzzles making use of its very satisfying variety of upgrades and tools - why these weren't made a focus over the aged combat system is beyond me. Strong worldbuilding is shafted by poorly timed shortcut openings and transportation, coupled with one of the worst implementations of a grappling hook I've ever seen. Art is hit or miss, along with the music, but both are exciting and original nonetheless. For a game that acknowledges the obsolete nature of its combat mechanics, it uses them far too much.
Date 2021-12-07 Playtime 14h 25m Rec Positive Beautiful Metroidvania that needs more push in the community. Great movement for a traditional 8-bit style game. Fun weapons and great zones. Lots of hidden items too.

Date 2021-12-01 Playtime 4h 53m Rec Positive The gameplay of this game is something to be experienced. The controls, the design, the music, this game is so well put together. Highly recommend it.

Date 2021-11-28 Playtime 24h 12m Rec Positive Axiom verge has some very good visual design and weapon variety, but suffers from poorly designed bosses and generic music. In some places it copies the feeling of the metroid games it was clearly influenced by, but in others it misses.  [h1] Pros [/h1] [b] Visual design [/b] The games world feels very alien, at all parts of the game, which is impressive. Most narratives in alien worlds will eventually just default to "Normal environment, but with aliens". Axiom verge never does that. Each area is distinctive, throughout its different sections. The only area I find lacking is ZI, about halfway through the game. Its subareas feel disconnected, and the region as a whole lacks a distinctive identity. Other than that, and the very short final area, the areas are fantastic  [b] Core gameplay [/b]  The core gameplay is solid. The upgrades feel impactful and unique, the wide array of weapons means that there is something for everyone (Even if quite a few of them are simply too niche to really use outside of a few situations), and most enemies are fair and dynamic. I don't have much more to say, its just good  [h1] Cons [/h1] [b] Bosses [/b] The bosses are bad. Really bad. Compared to the rest of the game they have noticeably lower quality. Most of them only have one or two attacks, which makes fights feel repetitive. This is keeping in line with older Metroid games, but the newer ones show that it was more due to technical limitations than anything. And most older metroid games fights changed over time, while in Axiom verge the boss simply attacks more quickly, which is a boring way to up the difficulty. More egregious, the bosses are both very tanky, and spend most of their time invincible. Most of the bosses past the third can only be damaged in their weakpoint, which they keep covered most of the time. Which would be fine, if they didn't also have massive healthpools. You can have one or the other. Either have lots of health, or limited vulnerability. Both just makes the fight tediously long. Its telling my favorite boss was the third one, because it had a lot of health, but also had a wide array of attacks and didn't constantly shield itself. The bosses have a noticeably dip in quality towards the end of the game, with the last 2 being nothing but projectile vomiting while you spam attacks at a stationary target. Its a stat check more than anything, and are some of the most boring bosses I have ever fought.   If you can overlook the poor bosses, its a good game. If that's a dealbreaker, then this isn't for you
Date 2021-11-28 Playtime 21h 44m Rec Positive Pros + The Giger aesthetic is a very cool style choice and is well-integrated into the game. + I think the plot is good, but I am admittedly a sucker for time travel / alternate dimension nonsense. + The Disruptor "hack the world" weapon is also incorporated well in the sense that the world is crafted to make you use it judiciously: you feel clever for using it rather than it being an obvious go-to 'get-out-of-jail-free' tool you automatically apply in every situation. + Good execution of the genre formula but with interesting twists on familiar power ups like Morph Ball and Screw Attack. In particular the 'remote drone' is a fun innovation.  Cons - One of the map zones has a baffling audio choice of some kind of tribal yodel track, it feels very incongruous with the rest of the game and is arguably just bad. - The pixel art is not as polished as you would see in something like a first-party Nintendo game. There are bits of this game where it feels like it has bitten off more than it can chew in terms of trying to show too much detail at the low resolution, and the final result is a bit messy. The choice of colours is also rather wild, as the areas with more muted colours work well but later in the game things get more adventurous and there are some backgrounds and enemies with dubious application of e.g. neon pinks and greens. I'm not a professional artist or graphic designer but to my eye it seems like it could have used some extra attention. - Too many weapons: When you got a new weapon upgrade in e.g. Metroid Fusion it was always exciting because it either gave you a notable damage boost or was a tool for exploration ('now you can shoot through the wall to hit a switch' etc). There are a lot of weapons in this game discoverable as hidden secrets, but more often than not these turn out to be disappointing 'novelty guns' that are briefly fun to kill enemies with but aren't very effective in combat and don't serve any other purpose. The game might be a cleaner experience if some of these secrets were just arbitrary collectibles instead (expository journal entries or whatever). - The boss fights are not particularly memorable except for the final one.  Overall I recommend this game for any fans of the older 2D Metroid games but you have to accept that it has a little bit of an indie "rough around the edges" aspect to it in terms of some of the audio and the visuals.
Date 2021-11-28 Playtime 10h 43m Rec Positive Wonderful game, lots of exploration and secrets. Would definitely recommend.
Date 2021-11-26 Playtime 8h 59m Rec Positive It's good. A bit long and starts feeling repetitive about 3 quarters the way through. Too many weapons to choose from- I only used about 3 of them. The story didn't interest me, but I don't think it was bad- just not my taste. I had issue with my game controller being too sensitive for the wall ability, and at first I thought the game was buggy. But it was just my controller. Basically, if you enjoy metroidvania style, you'll probably like this. It's worth playing if you have the time, and it made me excited about games again after taking a long break from them.
Date 2021-11-26 Playtime 5h 46m Rec Positive Игра топчег, попрыгал, побегал, пострелял монстров вот и день прошёл. Советую к ознакомлению.

Date 2021-11-25 Playtime 72h 53m Rec Positive Man, this game is fun.  I know it seems like my hours played in this is pretty low; that's largely because I've been playing it on the Switch lately. It's fun on any platform, and I really have to say I recommend this. It's been out for six years and the randomizer just dropped recently, and that's a great reason to play this great game.

Negative: In my opinion the level and enemies design is really poor, also the lack of teleportation between zones make you lose a lot of time.
Date 2021-11-18 Playtime 14h 31m Rec Positive A nice game. The protagonist for some reason made me think of Okabe (Steins Gate). It was a pleasure to continuously explore, however it got a bit frustrating at the end back-track to figure out where  I needed to go, given the only 2 "markers per map" usable.  The ending felt incomplete. Overall a 7 out of 10

Date 2021-11-15 Playtime 3h 17m Rec Negative A beautiful looking game that is ultimately disappointing to actually play. It is a slog to move and explore through the lifeless levels and the bosses have like 2-3 attacks if you're lucky.  I hear the game was made by just one person, which is impressive, and makes giving the game a thumbs down extra difficult, but it just wasn't fun to play.    The sequel, Axiom Verge 2, is also doing the (limited) Epic Exclusivity garbage every sane gamer hates so much, but in this case you can hardly blame the sole developer.

Date 2021-11-13 Playtime 13h 38m Rec Positive Juego estilo metroidvania, si te gustan los juegos de este genero, este titulo no te decepciona
Date 2021-11-12 Playtime 10h 19m Rec Negative Having great feelings about this game from playing it previously, I decided to purchase it on steam. Unfortunately my rose tinted glasses lead me astray from what I once thought was a great game. With that being said I will start with the good before I hit it with the bad.  Positive(s):  Story-  It's story isn't too original but I don't think it fails in keeping interest and wanting you to unfold the mystery of the game. Music-  The soundtrack has many bops albeit one particularly annoying one (If you played you know the one)  Negatives:  Level Design-  Hides paths within what you would believe to be the map walls. (The lack of teleportation rooms I know for some is fine but  it makes it feel like the devs just wanted to have you walk back and forth to pad playtime or they want you to learn speed run tech) Bosses- The bosses aren't too bad just very boring to fight and easy to overcome. The final boss is definitely annoying but not hard. If you like ads in your boss fights that continuously spawn, then you would have no issue with the final boss and would find enjoyment) Enemy Variety- Most of the enemies you fight in this game are just ones you fight early on just reskinned.  Overall I think it may have been better when it came out but is just over shadowed by what has come out from then to now. I do not believe it has aged well and it has only been 6 years since release.  If you are looking for any metroidvania to play I'd suggest:  Ori and the Will of the Wisps Guacamelee 2 Bloodstained The Messenger  If you are looking for one that the Protagonist uses a gun:  Shadow Complex

Date 2021-11-07 Playtime 0h 50m Rec Negative Played for a little under an hour and it's fantastic so far, with the exception of the 2-3 second character sprite disappearance when you get hit in combat. Solutions posted online don't work for me, so I unfortunately had to request a refund so I can just buy a Switch copy of the game. If you're able to fix the issues or don't have them at all, it's a must buy.
Date 2021-11-07 Playtime 50h 13m Rec Positive Trama y universo increíble, intrigante y absorbente en medio de una experiencia de exploración, desconcierto y descubrimiento.  Toda una obra maestra de los videojuegos y la ciencia ficción digna de un lugar entre los mejores del género de todos los tiempos.  Sorprendentemente fue desarrollado por sólo una persona.
Date 2021-11-07 Playtime 10h 18m Rec Positive don't be stubborn like me and play on hard for the first playthrough, but it was still pretty good. Kept playing for the music alone low key. Very impressive one guy developed this whole thing
Date 2021-11-07 Playtime 10h 16m Rec Positive Buen metroidvania
Date 2021-11-06 Playtime 9h 10m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvania games I've played! I own this on every platform, hopefully the second one is also released on Steam.
Date 2021-11-06 Playtime 4h 52m Rec Positive My new favourite game.  The facts:  it's a metroidvania, it's got a great [modern] 8-bit feel: moody graphics and sound, it's got a decent learning curve, but not at all frustrating (so far!).  Recommend to your friends!
Date 2021-11-06 Playtime 8h 10m Rec Negative meh
Date 2021-11-05 Playtime 62h 14m Rec Positive My 2nd playthrough after waiting a couple of years to play it again, and I'm having just as much fun as the first time. Rediscovering all the secret areas, unique upgrades that aren't found in other games, boss fights that require some actual problem solving, huge range of weapons, mutating enemies to create strange interactions with them, and a story / setting that raises many questions along the way. Easily one of my top 5 metroidvanias.
Date 2021-11-03 Playtime 29h 46m Rec Positive I love everything about it if so fun. The soundtrack is so fire.
Date 2021-11-02 Playtime 28h 26m Rec Negative .
Date 2021-11-02 Playtime 13h 28m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvanias available  Its got tone of weapons options and a surreal world The world building is also fantastic  Totally worth it if you like these types of games
Date 2021-11-02 Playtime 11h 14m Rec Positive This is completely amazing to play. I think it may not hit home as hard for younger people that didn't live and play games through the NES, and SNES era of gaming and the graphics seem to be a middle ground between those. The glitch effects are perfectly recreated of NES glitch appearance and well used as a game play element. There are so many bits of fan service all over this game that come through as elements of feeling. To elaborate on that last bit is difficult. The game has obviously drawn from Metroid and Castlevania but has incorporated elements from other titles in a less obvious way. From time to time it feels of Kid Ikarus, Contra, Megaman, and even Zelda with the extra shooting while at full health from those tentacles.  Overall masterfully made earning my highest praise. I love the gameplay, the graphics, the controls, and the music is amazing as well. It's not far from perfection and the only thing I think was a let down was how limited the various mechanics were relevant in game. Like the gun that splits with a second button press only being needed just a few times before fading into irrelevance.  Thomas Happ..  Well done! My hat is off to you! Thanks so much for this amazing game. It was a joy to play.

Date 2021-10-31 Playtime 1h 3m Rec Positive Metroid like
Date 2021-10-31 Playtime 22h 29m Rec Positive Better than Hollow Knight imo
Date 2021-10-29 Playtime 13h 1m Rec Positive Solid indie metroidvania. Great variety of weapons, powerups and enemies. I found the plot a bit messy and hard to understand. The controller key bindings are confusing, never got used to them. Even though the art and atmosphere is highly similar to classic Metroids, the game is well executed and fun. Recommended for fans of the genre.
Date 2021-10-28 Playtime 17h 32m Rec Negative Not bad, good artstyle and music, but controls are clunky. [spoiler](like the dash, really just let me remap because spamming one direction is annoying as hell)[/spoiler] Most of the time just spam attack in melee and not dodging is easier and faster to kill everything. 🚩 + NOT ABLE TO TELEPORT THE ENTIRE GAME ?! Im too lazy to run for hours to get the items i couldn't get before because the ability to get them is later in the game.
Date 2021-10-26 Playtime 11h 26m Rec Positive Muito legal o jogo depois que tu para de pegar só arma, antes disso é bem chato
Date 2021-10-25 Playtime 26h 25m Rec Positive Hell Yeah!
Date 2021-10-24 Playtime 18h 23m Rec Positive От игры остались ужасные впечатления после прохождения, но вспоминая ее, я все больше думаю, что ошибался. Игра мне не понравилась своими однообразными боссами, пустоватыми локациями, и неудобной картой из-за которой приходилось бродить туда-сюда. Однако интересный сюжет, персонажи, атмосфера и в целом мир делают это игру по-настоящему незабываемой. Я считаю ее однозначно стоит попробовать, как минимум любителям метроидваний
Date 2021-10-21 Playtime 15h 11m Rec Negative didn't like it. story, music, combat and backtracking are all pretty subpar
Date 2021-10-21 Playtime 7h 1m Rec Negative If the gameplay was as incredible as the visuals and music this would easily be a 10/10 Metroidvania, but the moment the awe of the detailed pixel art and atmospheric music wears off all you're left with is linear backtracking, annoying enemies, lackluster abilities, and comatose-inducing boss fights. Only purchase if you've already beaten every other metroidvania and are desperate for something new.
Date 2021-10-18 Playtime 5h 22m Rec Negative I'm sure this game was mind-blowing when it came out, and to some extent it's still great. However, there are some very significant design flaws that make this game a DNF for me. The combat is simply not very fun - most of the time it boils down to brute forcing attacks that you can't see/avoid, and the bosses are awful. The platforming becomes inconsistent and frustrating as the game progresses. The graphics and soundtrack are great, and if you really love stripped down metroidvanias you'll love this game, but it's not for me.
Date 2021-10-16 Playtime 13h 38m Rec Positive Классный сеттинг, нестандартные механики, увлекательный геймплей
Date 2021-10-16 Playtime 9h 28m Rec Positive Really awesome metroidvania game, great music and overall really fun.
Date 2021-10-15 Playtime 10h 46m Rec Positive Easily one of the best metroidvanias on steam.  It's actually a great looking game as you play it, has a bunch of interesting weapons to use, well designed maps and a nice soundtrack.  But the mechanics and skills you get in this game are just some of the absolute best in a metroidvania game. Literally breaking the world through glitching stuff.  The story is actually kinda good. It's not a story driven game by any means, but there's some stakes and plenty of mystery to the world and what is going on, and it suits the overall atmosphere of this game very well.  I know most people say Hollow Knight is their favoruite metroivania, but to me Axion Verge is miles ahead of it and should be considered a classic.
Date 2021-10-15 Playtime 16h 29m Rec Positive Overall enjoyed the game.  I think its strongest elements are the environment and the modification of your environment (as it applies to the in-game mechanics).  There is certainly a lot there to geek out over in these regards.  I found the Metroidvania aspect to the game fairly average.  They don't especially present anything new, either in terms or improving upon celebrated mechanics or by leaning heavily into an original one.  In this way the game is not difficult to learn and master.  I believe with what the game presents it could have gone further in some ways.  The story is possibly the weakest aspect.  Basic sci-fi components which felt barely explored in some cases.  Any predicaments and struggles of the main character didn't particularly capture me in a way that engrossed me.  Most of the in-game lore (almost all doesn't have anything to do with the main character), presented in small 1-3 paragraphs of text here and there, was more interesting than the main character.  While I enjoyed playing, I probably won't be returning to Axiom Verge for replay any time soon.
Date 2021-10-11 Playtime 12h 42m Rec Positive Axiom Verge es uno de los mejores Metroidvania que he jugado en los últimos tiempos, que bebe claramente de los Metroid clásicos. Si eres fan de la saga de Nintendo, DEBES jugar este juego ya que vas a encontrar muchas de las cosas que hace bien dicha saga, y un gran número de añadidos que dan su propia personalidad al juego y lo hacen, para mi gusto, todavía mejor.  Axiom Verge nos ofrece un gran mundo para explorar, Sudra, al que Trace, el protagonista del juego, llega de forma inexplicable tras un accidente en el laboratorio en el que trabaja. Ahí deberemos ir explorando y recopilando información para entender lo que está pasando con ayuda de los Rusalki, una especie alienígena casi extinguida que nos guiarán durante la aventura a medida que vamos avanzando. Para desentrañar la historia, deberemos ir avanzando en el juego y descubriendo información extra en una serie de tablillas que encontraremos por el mundo y que nos darán información adicional sobre el lore del juego.  El mundo consta de casi una decena de zonas de gran tamaño que podremos explorar a medida que vayamos consiguiendo distintas habilidades. En ese sentido, Axiom Verge tiene MUCHA más variedad de armas y habilidades que Metroid, dando lugar a un juego de exploración muy similar pero a la vez mucho más completo y variado, que se te alargará fácilmente hasta las 13-15 horas. Estamos hablando de más de 10 armas y más de 10 habilidades extra del personaje, complementadas por una gran variedad de enemigos y un puñado de bosses. Todo esto viene envuelto en un apartado técnico pixel art bastante atractivo y una gran banda sonora. En definitiva, si te gustan los Metroidvania, Axiom Verge es imprescindible.
Date 2021-10-11 Playtime 39h 58m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvanias I've ever played. I only have good things to say about it. If you like this style of game, you should buy and play it.  A shame the sequel is not available on Steam...

Date 2021-10-08 Playtime 11h 51m Rec Positive verge (bite mdr)
Date 2021-10-07 Playtime 18h 2m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a solid metroidvania, but it definitely has some sizable flaws that I feel make it not for everyone(including some of those hardcore metroidvania fans.) It has a lot of style, but as you get deeper into the game issues arise that some may not be able to look past.  Axiom Verge has a cool bizarre and twisted surreal world to explore that is never really fully explained. A lot of it is up to to the player to speculate over. The controls and combat feel very tight and smooth. You gain new weaponry often and abilities that allow you to transverse further and to new areas. It's very metroidvania... to a fault. The art style and sound is the games strongest aspect. The music sounds like an alien landscape inside of a dream! There's also a very cool, but underutilized mechanic where you can "hack" or "glitch" enemies that allow them to gain new properties or interact differently with the environment. There's even an in-game Game Genie code ability that allows you to literally hack the game if you want. The glitch gun is super fun to use, but the Game Genie code ability is very underutilized. Probably cause it'd just break the game pretty quickly.  Now we get into the games faults and some of them are heavy:  1.) This game has a TON of weapons, but all but 3 are useless. In fact I'd say that one gun you get early into the game that hits enemies through walls is the one weapon you're going to be using the entire game as it offers the best DPS and AOE. All the other guns are just fun ideas that don't amount to much. The other 2 guns are useful for either long range or certain boss fights. It really sucks to work hard to get a new hard to reach gun only to have it fire in some weird way and be totally impractical to use.  2.) Almost every boss fight is super awful. Most bosses just sit there and fire in certain spots meaning they can literally never kill you and you can just stand somewhere and shoot them forever. Almost every boss is like this except a few. Those few bosses that do move are super unfair and extremely hard. The bee boss is probably the hardest boss in the game, although there is a trick to killing it quickly. No boss fight feels very good or fun to fight outside of maybe the final boss.  3.) The story is too bare-bones and doesn't give you any interesting way to learn about the world your traversing. Remember in Metroid Prime where you could scan every item, enemy, or object and learn something about it? You'll get none of that here!  4.) There is one corridor that has music with a lady singing, and man that area gets super grating to play through because of that song.  I know this might sound overall negative, but it is a pretty by the numbers metroidvania in a very cool surreal style that has a lot of game play hang ups or cool ideas that aren't utilized very well. I definitely am hopeful to see a much improved sequel!  Overall 7.5/10

Date 2021-10-06 Playtime 13h 34m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an old school style Metroidvania heavily influenced by the NES Metroid.  Gameplay works like you expect. Run around map exploring and discovering things, shoot enemies with a bunch of different weapons, get new powerups giving you access to new zones or new areas in old zones, fight some bosses, etc.  The game has some notable downsides but nothing big.  The plot is fairly simple and it's not hard to figure out what's going on, but there's a bunch of terminology in it along with parts that are unclear/not well explained. The somewhat poorly translated parts don't help. It winds up being mostly unnecessary.  The environments are lackluster for the most part. A couple of the zones stand out a bit, but the rest feel like the previous ones without any sort of meaningful differentiation.  You fight a couple bosses early on and towards the end, but the middle portion of the game (from 33% - 70% of the way through, there are no bosses. It hurts the game a bit as it leaves you without any significantly stressful fights for a long period. The bosses the game does have aren't anything special either.  One of the upgrades is a grappling hook which can be annoying to use. It feels like it was inspired by the NES Bionic Commando but doesn't function in a similar way which makes it awkward to use.  The biggest issue in the game is one of the upgrades allows you to "teleport" a short distance. This is done by double tapping a direction. You are accidentally going to activate this quite often, and while it's very unlikely that it's going to get you killed, it does get annoying in platforming sections.  Axiom Verge isn't great or anything, but it's good for the most part. I appreciated the throwback NES vibes, especially when I tried out a certain password just to try it and it worked.
Date 2021-10-05 Playtime 13h 54m Rec Positive If your controller doesn't appear to work, try right-clicking on the game in your library and go to Properties > Controller > Enable Steam Input.
Date 2021-10-04 Playtime 1h 26m Rec Positive メトロイドを彷彿とさせる(やったことはない)アクションゲーム。 細部までこだわったドット絵は圧巻。 次にどこに進むべきかが明確に示されないので、私のようなプレイヤーは迷子になること必然。 操作性は特に問題なくDS4でも不自由なく遊べる。 3Dゲームに疲れた時に手を伸ばしてみることをお勧めする。
Date 2021-10-04 Playtime 1h 9m Rec Positive 没什么特别的，就是BGM特难听，建议自己找个歌单放
Date 2021-10-02 Playtime 13h 2m Rec Negative If you like metriod, then youll love it. but just like any given metriod game its really good up until the end when bosses start become infuriatingly difficult/ tedious.
Date 2021-10-02 Playtime 15h 11m Rec Positive En pocas palabras:  Uno de los mejores Metroidvanias que he jugado en los últimos tiempos. Ha tenido la mala suerte de que lo he jugado justo antes que Hollow Knight, nada menos, pero ni esto ha logrado que olvidase lo fantástico que es este juego. Si te gusta el género y el estilo gráfico, Axiom Verge es imprescindible por 5 euros.  ---------------------------------------------  Lo mejor:  * Estupendo a nivel gráfico y sonoro. * Tiene el mejor tema para un nivel que he escuchado en un videojuego en bastante tiempo. Brutal. A la altura de un triple A como Skyrim, o de las mejores pistas de Diablo 2. El resto de la BSO no le va a la zaga. Es fantástica. * Es una carta de amor al pixel art y a los juegos de la SNES, Megadrive, etc, a los que homenajéa y al mismo tiempo supera, engrandece, mejora. * El desarrollo de la aventura fluye de manera sencilla y directa hasta aproximadamente el cuarto o quinto nivel. Hasta aquí lo recuerdo como una auténtica delicia jugable. * Se hace corto.  Lo bueno:  * Control rozando el casi perfecto. * Efectos, sonidos, gráficos: estupendos. * Muy bien en diseño del mapeado, la progresión de la aventura, la variedad de items, las armas, las zonas secretas, etc. * Historia retorcidilla e interesante. * Diría que es bastante rejugable (aunque no suelo hacerlo), al menos para una segunda vuelta en la que completar algunos logros.  Lo malo:  * El desarrollo se atasca al llegar a un determinado punto del mapeado, lo que obliga a dar unas cuentas vueltas innecesarias. Esto ocurre con frecuencia en este tipo de juegos pero es una lástima porque hasta ese punto la aventura fluye de manera impresionante. * La configuración de controles para algunas habilidades (una de ellas de uso imprescindible) es cuestionable. * Se hace corto.  Lo peor:  * Nada.
Date 2021-10-01 Playtime 1h 25m Rec Negative This didn't hook me.  The game seems to be constructed well enough.  The palette borders on soulless, and the flickery "console glitch" gimmick is likely to induce seizures in a subset of the audience.  The soundtrack probably slaps for some folks, but the bass hits right in the chest cavity and made me nauseous after an extended period.  (Assuming hard difficulty)  Most combat is similar to Metroid, with a few cheap shot enemies like the rushing zombie-looking things that are difficult to kill without taking damage when first encountered.  Played the first three boss fights and they're decent if a bit long.  Of the first four weapons, the regular cannon is mediocre (think the regular shot in Metroid without any upgrades), the Nova is clunky AF, the electric thing is only situationally useful for getting cheap kills through walls, and the multi-shot seems to lack a niche entirely.  The "hacking" mechanic is extremely inconsistent--hacking an enemy or block in one area can have a completely different effect in a different area.  Nothing other than the design indicates what will happen, and that design doesn't really message well.  Like Metroid, there is no fast travel.  Backtracking seems to take a lot longer than in Metroid, but that could be Nostalgia and a reflexive memeory of Metroid's map talking.  Movement is average--hopefully there are speed upgrades later because slogging through this game at the default pace sounds exhausting.  All in all, there's stuff here for some players to like, but it definitely isn't my bag, and there are a ton of really good Metroidlike games out there to compete for one's time.
Date 2021-09-29 Playtime 8h 53m Rec Positive The artstyle makes the level design pretty unintuitive for a Metroidvania, the movement powerups feel very weird and everything that isn't a boss or one of the huge robots looks hideous. Still the interesting story, setting and general weirdness make this worth trying
Date 2021-09-29 Playtime 38h 8m Rec Positive Super Metroid with a heavier psychological twist. Beautiful art and music. Escape to another world with Axiom Verge.
Date 2021-09-26 Playtime 22h 23m Rec Positive Axiom Verge est un metroid-like 2D aux graphismes SNES. On explore un monde constitué de plusieurs écrans à défilement, il y a de nombreux environnements différents avec leurs ennemis et quelques boss. Les issues sont débloquées au fur et à mesure de la progression. Graphiquement c'est assez fidèle à Metroid SNES : des gros pixels basse résolution, la palette de couleurs, et même l'animation de transition des sas lorsqu'on change de tableau. Dans l'ensemble je n'adhère pas, en particulier quant au choix des couleurs. Vous pouvez juger par vous même sur les screenshots Le jeu est essentiellement basé sur l'exploration, les zones sont débloquées lorsqu'on gagne des armes ou des pouvoirs. On récupère des objets pour améliorer les armes et la santé, et quelques codes pour débloquer des passages. Il y a du combat avec des armes à distance contre des ennemis variés, et des boss que l'on peut battre facilement si on exploite leur routine. Ces boss ne sont que moyennement réussis, leur comportement est très simple.  Les armes (à distance) sont nombreuses mais chacune n'apporte pas forcément un avantage Le maniement n'est pas très bon ; le déclenchement du "dash" est un peu capricieux et la visée se fait à l'ancienne, avec les contrôles de direction. Le dev aurait pu ajouter des indices sur la carte pour savoir quelles issues sont débloquées par quel pouvoir, au lieu de cela on est obligé de faire des allers retours pour les trouver (sans voyage rapide) Le scénario est basique. Dans l'ensemble c'est un metroid-like un peu au-dessus de la moyenne, mais un peu trop rétro dans son maniement et ses graphismes. La durée de vie est honorable, environ 15H
Date 2021-09-24 Playtime 12h 9m Rec Positive [b]"Sick sideburns bro"[/b] [i]-me who grew sideburns because of him[/i] [hr][/hr]  [b]Axiom Verge[/b], also known as "Better Metroid" (yes fight me) is one of those games that intimately understands its source material and works toward improving it instead of just making a carbon copy.  [h1]X-Factor[/h1] While the limitations of the past made its inspiration look like alien biology haphazardly smashed together Axiom Verge masterfully integrates it in a biotechnological feel that is exclusive to it, as well as having a plethora of effects that recall both novel and retro aesthetic.  The improvements aren't just skin deep, many clucky mechanics were removed in favor of movement-based upgrades, more and better weapons to play around.  On a more meta-level gameplay the game is always guiding you to your next objective while keeping the feeling of being lost in this alien world, there is backtracking, but it is done in a way where you came out of an area already on the right path to explore another.

Date 2021-09-23 Playtime 38h 39m Rec Positive good metroidvania, awesome soundtrack, good weapons
Date 2021-09-23 Playtime 12h 38m Rec Positive Pretty good game, especially if you're a fan of metroid. My only gripe is the controls; some abilities are mapped to double tapping and those never feel good to use, that and the swinging. Otherwise pretty fun and balanced game.
Date 2021-09-21 Playtime 12h 50m Rec Positive Final boss can suck some nuts.  Teleportation kind of lame, dunno why it wasn't mapped to the jump button instead of the directional stick but whatever I guess.  Fun game, doesn't take too long to beat.  I'd say 7/10 on a bad day and 8/10 on a good day. 
Date 2021-09-20 Playtime 17h 20m Rec Positive An outstanding game, worthy of its praises. I only had a select few areas that tested my patience but for the majority, I loved it!
Date 2021-09-19 Playtime 14h 31m Rec Positive I've watched playthroughs and speedruns of this game for years, but only recently picked it up. A true Metroid gameplay clone (in the best way), but with a story, often told through cutscenes in the line of Ninja Gaiden. I love the lore, though it takes a few playthroughs to connect a lot of the dots. Be sure to watch through the end.  Remember that this game was completed entirely by one developer: story, graphics, music, etc. Amazing work. Axiom Verge 2 is out now (I haven't played or watched it yet), but is exclusive to other platforms at the moment.  [h1]The Good[/h1] +Proper Metroid game. Not Metroidvania. Metroid. +Very good music. +Built-in speedrun mode. +Built-in randomizer. +Hard mode difficulty for those that want even more challenge. +A few easter eggs. +A number of secrets. +Some novel mechanics. +A few instances of good environmental storytelling. +Boss rooms are marked.  [h1]YMMV[/h1] ~A deep amount of fascinating lore involved, leaving a tantalizing amount of unanswered questions to talk about at the water cooler. The problem is that most of the meaty lore is buried in well-hidden notes. Even with the notes, you need to figure out who wrote each and then read between the lines to start making sense of things. You'll likely have to watch a 100% playthrough or some commentary to see everything and get a better understanding.  ~Relatively difficult game, even compared to NES Metroid. Enemies hit very hard, are often in unfair locations and drop almost no health. Thankfully, the only punishment for death is being moved to the last save room.  ~The map is a mixed bag. It tells you when you've completed the map and items, but is terrible at marking items you need to come back for.  ~A number of items are hidden unintuitively, leading to running or dashing into, and shooting/drilling/disrupting every wall if you're a completionist. There is no late-game X-Ray item to help you find what you missed.  ~Despite the huge variety of weapons (one of which is semi-randomized each playthrough), most only have situational usage or help with a single boss. You're pretty much going to use the [spoiler]Kilver[/spoiler] the whole game.  [h1]The Bad[/h1] -Some environments are an overkill of animated sprites or an eyesore of colors in violent opposition to one another. There are few smooth transitions of environment like Super Metroid.  -Most enemies are body-checking bullet sponges that you defeat by abusing the terrain.  -There are a number of really annoying/piercing sound effects.
Date 2021-09-18 Playtime 11h 47m Rec Positive Tiene mas del primer Metroid que de cualquier Castlevania. Opresivo, agresivo, raro, y a veces demasiado críptico. Cuando el juego te hace click y entiendes como quiere que lo juegues, llega a ser disfrutable. Las primeras 2 horas son como subir una montaña siendo paradójico, el mayor desafío del juego es llegar al próximo boss, no pelear con ellos. Si lo juegas sin prestar atención a donde está ese obstáculo que vas a poder superar con la habilidad recién adquirida, vas a sufrir con el backtracking Definitivamente no es una experiencia amigable para nuevos en el genero.

Date 2021-09-17 Playtime 16h 1m Rec Positive 16 hr play through. fun game for fans of this style
Date 2021-09-16 Playtime 39h 6m Rec Positive FIRST IMPRESSIONS:  Great 2D action exploration game. Light on story, engaging action, tons of hidden areas. Bio-mechanical retro art style is cool. If you wanted to love the first Metroid game, but just can't get past all its flaws, take this game on.  UPDATE:  Near the end-game and my previous comment holds true. Some additional thoughts and minor areas for improvement in no particular order as I reach the end. Looking forward to finish this one!  Movement/Controls:  I play with an xbone S controller. All the main controls feel good and solid. You can set 3 weapons to quick select which is a nice feature to keep gameplay rolling. Cycling through them is done through a down press of either the left or right thumb stick, which isn't ideal, but serviceable. Setting the weapon quick select is unnecessarily complicated. But once you settle into you favorites, it's fine, just an annoyance.  I preferred the thumb stick for general movement. However, one movement mechanic is triggered by a directional double tap better suited to the d-pad in my opinion. I found myself awkwardly hopping between d-pad and thumb stick, but ultimately fell short of smooth precise execution of this move. Could just be my own lack of ability, but it was a bummer as better execution would open up more combat options and change the speed and way I would move through the world.  Items:  The coolest and most interesting things are the utility items. In the early game, I ran through the world giddy with the sense of exploration as each new screen is revealed. Eventually, I hit roadblocks that made me feel the world closing in on me. Trapped and stifling exporation by limiting my character's mobility. This world slowly opens only as you carve through it's nooks and corners searching for that next find that holds the potential to open up whole new sectors of the map. This is the strongest part of the game.  Wepons:  There are enough variety of weapons to fit your play-style. And they look cool. I rotate through a small handful unless one felt particularly suited to a specific encounter. As a result, some of the weapons are just kinda there. They could perhaps serve as a self-imposed challenge in a future playthrough. Otherwise, there were only a small number of times a weapon felt powerful to use. They looked and sounded different enough to be distinct. But, their feel wasn't much different from one another. Weapon upgrades operate like small stat boosts that offer minor improvements, but doesn't change the way you play or alter the appearance in any meaninful way. Feels like a missed opportunity.  Music:  The areas are all separated by a distinctive look and music, which is great. And most of the tracks dole out a steady rhythm of cyber-wave crunchiness— I definitely have favorites. However, the music for a couple areas feel pretty short and at least one track has a noticeable break in transition when it starts over.  Enemies:  The enemy movement and behavior is varied enough to keep encounters interested though some of  the enemy design lands as lackluster toward the later areas as I continue the playthrough.

Date 2021-09-13 Playtime 24h 2m Rec Positive It is a fantastic Metroidvania game!  It's one of the best in the genre.
Date 2021-09-12 Playtime 19h 4m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a gorgeously written love letter to the original Metroid and the entire genre of beautifully built early 1990s NES games.  I wish you could turn off the mini-map in the upper right hand corner to make it an authentic 90s NES experience.
Date 2021-09-11 Playtime 16h 15m Rec Positive Great game! Only downside: too short and too few bosses ;)
Date 2021-09-11 Playtime 15h 48m Rec Positive 总体还是很推荐的，喜欢探索的可以尝试下。  没有中文的确很头疼，中期有一段时间都是在四处瞎跑，不知道去哪，要干什么。另外，没有传送跑图可太难受了，boss 战没什么感觉。短期内应该是没有再玩一遍的欲望了。
Date 2021-09-11 Playtime 12h 14m Rec Positive me encanta es como jugar un juego de metroid, mi unico problema es que en la version de computadora es muy dificil cambiar de armas pero eso no arruina la experencia
Date 2021-09-11 Playtime 11h 57m Rec Positive This game is fantastic.  I love Metroid, but I'm not a big fan of Castlevania at all, so metroidvanias are usually a mixed bag for me. But honestly I think calling this game a metroidvania is a disservice, because it is very much a Metroid game. And a great one at that. Play it.
Date 2021-09-10 Playtime 15h 53m Rec Positive Nice story and gameplay, but a lot of back tracking that doesn't feel rewarding most of the time.
Date 2021-09-09 Playtime 96h 44m Rec Positive Игра супер!!! Дизайн, графика, музыка, геймплей, всё на высоте. Загадки, запутанные уровни!!!
Date 2021-09-09 Playtime 8h 16m Rec Positive Good game
Date 2021-09-07 Playtime 19h 47m Rec Positive Thank you for making this game. I know o am coming late to the party, but I agree with all of the positive comments made about Axiom Verge. This game is very fun, and has challenges reminiscent of super Metroid (SNES).
Date 2021-09-06 Playtime 30h 19m Rec Positive Отличная игра, крутая музыка (за исключением одной локации, все кто играл знают о чём я :D), приятный геймплей, оооочень много апгрейдов (иногда кажется что игру буквально ломаешь, когда персонаж прокачивается). Автор явно вдохновлялся Метройдом, а я ни в один не играл и решил что Axiom Verge будет хорошим способом "пощупать" дух и геймплейное ядро.

Date 2021-09-05 Playtime 15h 27m Rec Positive A good metrovania game. Awesome music! Not my favourite though. The controls sometimes felt glitchy, especially the high jump. It just felt like I could never get it to work. The lack of a quick travel made moving through maps a bit a a chore (maybe I missed the quick travel upgrade?). Not sure if I would play it again. Still, if you like this genre of games, it's definitely recommended. I'll try the second one as well when I get it.
Date 2021-09-05 Playtime 18h 1m Rec Positive I really enjoyed Not-Metroid!
Date 2021-09-04 Playtime 22h 55m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania. This game is a staple in the Metroidvania Genre! 9/10

Date 2021-09-03 Playtime 12h 29m Rec Positive This game is so nostalgic and amazing! The graphics and music bring me right back to the NES days! Highly  recommend this game to any true fan of the 8-bit ear!
Date 2021-09-03 Playtime 26h 6m Rec Positive Great metroidvania type game if you're into that genre. Story is legit too. Look, feel, mechanics....everything is super tight. I literally don't have a single bad thing to say about this game.
Date 2021-09-03 Playtime 11h 0m Rec Positive Oh hell yeah!  This game is great. As you probably know it takes a lot from games like Metroid and it shows. It has a lot of exploration, a lot of weapons, a LOT of hidden areas and just the right amount of challenge.  I thought the game was going to be short but I was very wrong. There are many different areas and you'll get a lot of reasons to backtrack and find all the power ups you need.  One thing that disappointed me is that some of the weapons are kinda lame. I respect there's a huge variety but once you find a couple of specific ones (you'll know when you get them) you're practically indestructible and you won't change them ever.  It's a very solid title, not much more to say about it. Time and money well spent.
Date 2021-09-01 Playtime 11h 35m Rec Positive  .
Date 2021-08-31 Playtime 12h 59m Rec Positive The game is... fine, I know it was developed by a single person, the credits said that, the art style is great, and the story despite being just weird it got my attention with things like [spoiler]the protagonist becoming the lovecraftian boss after persecuting a clone of himself[/spoiler] but bro, the bosses were just trash, all of them, I can tolerate the first 2 being like that but not everyone until the final boss, the exploration is really good and I would like to play a remade version more focused on exploration and less on combat.  Also, the weapons are more quantity than quality, i just used 4 weapons and wouldn't be surprised if everyone else used the same (1, 4, 9, and laser). I will eventually play the sequel, but for now, this game is just fine.
Date 2021-08-30 Playtime 9h 22m Rec Positive Solid metroid game with lore to deep for me.
Date 2021-08-30 Playtime 101h 22m Rec Positive Way back when I first got this game, I played it for a few minutes, beat the first boss, got bored, and set it aside, feeling underwhelmed. Later I picked it back up and managed to stumble into a sequence break. I have a pretty spotty history with this game. Only recently did I come back and do every achievement and get 75 hours of playtime like a huge nerd.  It has a lot of different guns and a bunch of interesting powerups and many neat-o enemies and secrets? Although the starting basic baby gun is actually really viable throughout the game, funnily enough. I can't really say too much without spoiling the game and I don't want to spoil it.  Oh, it just recently added a built-in randomizer mode for weird obsessed people like myself! Randomizer mode mixes up the item pick-ups while *usually* leaving the game possible to complete. It's pretty neat. Sometimes you end up finishing the game super fast and sometimes it's nearly or actually impossible to finish at all, yay!
Date 2021-08-28 Playtime 10h 8m Rec Positive id recommend  game. I had skipped over it. I liked the atmosphere and the general tone of the game. Challenging but not so much that it takes away the fun. At times I want to hurry up and get it over with. At the same time I was driven to finish... daresay compelled to finish it. SO it grabbed me. It was a fun jaunt. Guess i'm going to give the sequel chance.
Date 2021-08-28 Playtime 14h 8m Rec Positive This is a creative, fun, and well made Metroidvania which hearkens back to games like Super Metroid with an updated look and feel.  Pros: Lots of weapons. Creative secrets and items. Inspiring boss fights. Mysterious story. Cons: Incremental map exploration and navigation can be confusing and non-linear. Boss fights are rarely difficult.  Overall: A must play for fans of the genre. Well worth the price. Inspired and well made.   8/10
Date 2021-08-28 Playtime 9h 3m Rec Positive This is a love letter game from a dev who put a lot of time and effort into the game. I haven't played it since it was first released, but I remember enjoying it a lot, though I have vague memories of being stuck at one point, that was frustrating, I did get past it and finished the game...I would though prefer to see a 16bit era styled game from the same dev.
Date 2021-08-27 Playtime 1h 12m Rec Negative Cluster bomb, saw, shotgun, electricity orb - all LOOK like they should be powerful but have comparatively garbage DPS to your starting weapon. This makes them nothing more than colored key cards - design I thought outdated after oldschool FPS.
Date 2021-08-26 Playtime 17h 55m Rec Positive If you love metroidvanias, you will absolutely love this game. Exactly the kind of thing I was looking for and hope more like it come out some day
Date 2021-08-25 Playtime 16h 49m Rec Positive И так, наиграв 14 часов и просмотрев столько обзоров, могу с уверенностью сказать что игра отличная, прям стоит своих денег! Конечно боссы тут совсем не сбалансированы, но что поделать, может быть это у меня навыков игры нет...

Date 2021-08-24 Playtime 60h 13m Rec Positive I wish it had done more to distinguish itself from the Metroid games, but it's very good!
Date 2021-08-24 Playtime 27h 44m Rec Positive Metroid-like n'ayant rien à envier aux trop rares jeux de Nintendo, développé par environ une seule personne (Thomas Happ). Scénario plein de mystère, laissant la place aux théories et interrogations. Carte assez grande, pleine de recoins, secrets, bonus, améliorations... On a accès à une grande variété d'armes à distance, la plupart trouvables en explorant un minimum. Les musiques sont assez variées (notez que le curseur de la barre de santé se déplace plus ou moins vite selon le rythme de la musique), parfois calmes, parfois plus fortes. Les graphismes un peu pixellisés font référence à Metroid, encore une fois. Un bon jeu.
Date 2021-08-24 Playtime 20h 18m Rec Positive Excellent Metroid-style game. Strange story. Interesting visuals no doubt inspired by Giger.
Date 2021-08-24 Playtime 4h 18m Rec Negative Ко многим вещам в этом мире можно отнестись с пониманием, но не к ПИ ПИ ПИ ПИ ПИ когда остаётся мало хп.  В остальном игра весьма неплохая и я её даже могу рекомендовать, но за этот небольшой нюанс так и хочется со всей силы влепить палец вниз, что я, собственно, и сделал.
Date 2021-08-24 Playtime 63h 34m Rec Positive It's a really creative Metroidvania. Abilities and tools you acquire aren't really like the usual roster of Metroidvania powerups, there are a ton of unique weapons, and the music is fantastic. There's a sequel out on Switch and PS4 now, so you can get that if you love this one!

Date 2021-08-22 Playtime 16h 43m Rec Positive It's pretty awesome. The colors used in this game for the background are pretty hard on the eye but I guess that's the point. Great soundtrack and gameplay overall. Weird silly story. High replay value. Good stuff.
Date 2021-08-21 Playtime 10h 58m Rec Positive 尚且不错的恶魔城银河战士游戏，风格偏向银河战士一点，还有致敬metroid的彩蛋可以挖掘，成就和断层武器需要多周目才能达成，这一点感觉有点强行拖长游戏全收集和全成就的节奏，对我来说不是很理想，毕竟个人感觉这款游戏的重复可玩性不高，是我通关一遍后就不会再去碰的游戏，如果能把所有东西放在一周目里面体验到的话就更好了。--8/10
Date 2021-08-21 Playtime 22h 55m Rec Negative Axiom verge is a very similar action plataformer in the same lines as the Metroid series. The game makes it clear right from the beginning that is inspired by the art of H.R Giger, the artist behind the Alien movies. And the art style here is fantastic, with every scenario, monsters, and weapon looking very interesting and disturbing. Another incredible point is the sound design. Its not common to find indie games with this amount of unique sounds and fantastic music, making you feel the eerie and alien world around you. All add more to the feeling of being alone in this weird world. But unfortunately, beyond the art and sound the game begin to show massive problems. The map design is terrible. Each area is relatively big, with many, many plataforming, but since you have to go back and forth multiple times, one for each new tool, having to do all the plataforming gets obnoxious very fast. Add enemies that are faster than you or just very jumpy and your result is pure irritation in having to deal with the mobs that are quite difficult to skip without the top teleport. And, similar to Metroid or some castlevanias, you need equipment to pass certain blockades in the map. This is another problem, because you have a ridiculous number of upgrades whose sole purpose is to pass those barriers. And not only that, most of them are just a slightly upgrade for a previous upgrade, making the search for where the hell you should use this new thing incredible irritating. In every Metroid-like game the core component is mobility and maneuverability. Those characteristics are crucial for 2D games that require precise jumps or ropes or dodges etc. In Axiom Verge, for some reason, you get very few mobility upgrades, and they all are terrible to work with. The grapple is a nightmare to use properly since it is slow, short, you can't jump of it, it doesn't work good with the teleport and you fall quite easy from it by simply touching ground. The teleport is pretty much useless unless there is a very specific barrier, making it pointless in any combat or mobility situation, also the devs decided to make it a double tap, the worst command possible, so you will accidently use the damn thing some times that you are trying to redirect your movement, making it even more frustrating and unreliable in fast combat. And the drone swap is very late, unbelievable slow and unreliable since you have to eyeball the distance. Also to be used only in few situations that a normal double jump would work perfectly. Those are awful mechanics for a game inspired in Metroid that had great mobility upgrades you constantly used to move around faster or for combat. The game has a very interesting and unique mechanic about glitching things. You use waves from your weapon to glitch terrain and monsters to help you or to make them weak. This change of reality it is a very nice detail on theme with the game, but since the game is designed to use this mechanic on every single enemy, it also becomes annoying after a couple of hours. Because you have to use the mechanic and still shoot the thing, so it is just another step implemented to pass an obstacle. But the worst of all is the passcode mechanic. This game has an internal keyboard that you can use to type strange things. The problem here is that there are plenty of secret rooms that will only appear if you type the correct nonsensical passcode when you are in a specific location. This is incredible bad design, it makes no sense that exploring with your tools is not enough, you actually have to use cheats in order to find all the secrets, and some secrets here are guns and health/power upgrades. Unbelievable that someone thought this was a good idea. I had no idea how one would get those passcodes since the notes didn't help, so I got them online The game offers you a ridiculous amount of guns, 23 as per wikipedia, but they are all trash with a couple of exceptions. The flamethrower is incredible overpower and melts everything, the electric gun is for the annoying moving targets and the data bomb is an area of effect long range. That is it, all the other twenty weapons are complete garbage and you will not use them. Bloating your game with a enormous amount of options when the majority of said options are pointless does not make your game better. The correct approach is something similar with Metroid, that had Samus' blaster being upgraded for a objectively better version. Quality over quantity, always. Maybe this works better with the randomizer option, but after my experience I don't care for that mode. The bosses have very cool designs, monstrous with mechanical parts mixed with some grotesque art style as if humans mutated into abominations, but despite the fierce appearance they are all laughably easy with their slow and short patterns, making every boss fight more of a slog than anything, with the exception of one that gave me a bit of trouble because of artificial difficulty. The fight is not fun when you can only hit a specific pixel, and the player have to wait for the good will of the enemy to willingly expose that pixel. The story is really bare bones and the notes are most likely disconjoined. Nothing impressive but also nothing negative to pull the game further down. After four hours I got bored and lost interest, but pushed through to complete. I have zero desire to replay or to hunt for achievements despite loving this genre of game.
Date 2021-08-20 Playtime 9h 28m Rec Positive I had fun
Date 2021-08-20 Playtime 12h 49m Rec Positive gud
Date 2021-08-20 Playtime 57h 47m Rec Positive Classic Metroidvania type game.  I've played through a couple times and plan to again.  Definitely worth the purchase.
Date 2021-08-20 Playtime 18h 3m Rec Positive yeah i'm late. but this is quite a challenging game.
Date 2021-08-20 Playtime 23h 3m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is easily one of my favorite games of all time. I know that a lot of people seem to have mixed feelings about it, but I genuinely feel like this game is a Metroidvania masterpiece. Doesn't feel like a lot of Metroidvania games these days lean as heavily into the Metroid side of things as this game does, and it's so refreshing to me as a result.  It absolutely nails that isolating, "lost in an alien world" atmosphere and feel while still managing to have a story, characters and dialogue that don't take away from it at all. Arguably the music is probably the absolute most important thing here setting the tone, although the Giger/Beksinski-esque pixel art does a great job too of course. I think Trace is also a fantastic and relatable character, while still managing to be just as capable of Samus at kicking alien ass by the time he's fully powered up.  If I had to really criticize the game, I'd say that the bosses are probably the weaker part of the game. They do the job, but other games in this subgenre have done it better with having better or just more mechanics to them instead of "jump and shoot". Unfortunately, it seems like Tom Happ heard this criticism and instead of improving them in Axiom Verge 2, he just made them optional and kept the sort of more bland, simple boss design. But hey, this is a review for AV1, not 2.  The other thing I'd say that this game could have done better is have a Metroid Dread-style running free aim with the right stick, and have a separate weapon wheel button. Unfortunately, Dread is coming out well after this game released, so this innovation kinda just wouldn't have come to mind when it was made.  To conclude though, Axiom Verge is still an absolutely fantastic game that can last you upwards of a dozen hours on your first playthrough and longer if you care for item completion. I really hope that the next game is more like this, and takes notes from what the series that started it all is doing to innovate.
Date 2021-08-19 Playtime 0h 36m Rec Positive This scratches the super metroid itch I forgot I had
Date 2021-08-19 Playtime 14h 16m Rec Positive Very fun. Music and aesthetic is amazing
Date 2021-08-18 Playtime 0h 17m Rec Negative Все, что написано в отрицательных обзорах - правда. Хотите хорошую метроидванию - играйте в Hollow Knight. А это - переоцененная средненькая игра. Игра больше похожа на клон метроида и многие проблемы перекочевали оттуда. Но эта игра мне понравилась больше чем метроиды.  Проблема №1 - Управление Игра разрабатывалась для PS4. О комфортном управлении на клавиатуре можете забыть - без геймпада лучше даже не садиться играть. Если вы все-таки решили играть на клавиатуре, то первый квест, который вам придется выполнить - это понять как выйти из настроек. Потому что "Назад" повешано не на Escape или Z, как во всех нормальных играх, а на Q. Понять это можно только целиком прочитав управление. Кнопки на клаве назначены так, будто автор никогда сам на ней не играл. Есть стандарт - повесить самые часто совершаемые действия (прыжок и стрельбу) на самые удобные 2 соседние кнопки (например, Z и X). Нетушки - автор решил что Пробел и F будет удобнее. В принципе, перенастроить управление по человечески - можно. Но все равно количество используемых кнопок внушает ужас. Каждая кнопка на геймпаде забита на какое-то действие и на клаве - тоже. В общем, если нет геймпада - придется страдать.  Единственное что работает на клаве лучше и удобнее, чем на геймпаде - это дэш (два нажатия подряд в сторону). На стиках дэш периодически срабатывает случайно, когда не надо. А когда надо - не срабатывает. Ну и это... раз уж автор перенес управление на клавиатуру, то мог бы сделать и ввод кодов прямо с клавиатуры. Но поленился. Так что, играя на клавиатуре, придется вам стрелочками выбирать каждую букву.  Проблема №2 - необходимость постоянно задрачивать кнопку стрельбы Причем почти все враги убиваются далеко не с пары попаданий. Да, есть виды оружия для которых можно держать кнопку. Но что мешало разрабу сделать стрельбу из остальных видов оружия по удержанию кнопки? Или хотя бы сделать 2 кнопки - одна работает как 1 нажатие, а другая - как Турбо-кнопка? Хорошо если вы играете на геймпаде - на клаве постоянно клацать одну и ту же кнопку еще более гемморно. В итоге вам либо придется все время бегать с какой-нибудь пушкой, для которой можно просто держать кнопку, либо натирать мозоли на указательном или большом пальце.  Проблема №3 - большие локации Поначалу это незаметно, но пройдя около половины игры накапливается много мест, где можно пройти используя новую способность. Только вот понять - какой проход ведет к мизерному бонусу, а какой - к продвижению по сюжету (если искать секреты и собирать шарики для прокачки надоело) - нельзя. И тут оказывается что для такой большой карты автор не предусмотрел быстрое перемещение между локациями через телепорты или точки сохранений. Есть только коридор с транспортом, ведущем из одного конца карты в другой, с несколькими остановками. И, если повезет, этот "транспорт" будет стоять как раз на вашей остановке. А если нет - придется идти до него пешком! Вот и приходится обходить всю карту и тыкаться в каждый проход, где еще не дошли до тупика, что приводит только к затягиванию игры. Была бы возможность быстрого перемещения - это бы занимало намного меньше времени и не начинало бы раздражать. Особенно "весело" когда ты прошел всего на 1 экран дальше - а там нужна уже другая способность, которой еще нет. Единственное что может немного ускорить исследование локаций - выход в главное меню (игра сохраняется, а мы телепортируемся к последнему месту сохранения). Разумеется, когда это дело надоедает - приходится смотреть гайды и видеопрохождение чтобы понять в какой именно проход из кучи надо идти дальше. Лучше бы автор сделал так, чтобы проходы, ведущие дальше по сюжету, всегда были переходами в новую локацию, как в Hollow Night. Тогда сразу понятно куда надо дальше идти, если хочешь просто продвинуться по сюжету. Здесь же одни проходы ведут по сюжету, а другие - в тупик с бонусом.  Проблема №4 - местами непродуманный геймдизайн локаций Кто-то жаловался что есть места, до которых трудно допрыгнуть. Я нашел всего 3 таких места, 2 из них ведут к секрету с бонусом, 1 - более короткий путь назад (тут да, следовало поставить платформу ближе). В некоторых местах требуется быстро выполнить сложный кульбит: прыжок, рывок вверх, кинуть дрона и телепортироваться за ним. Приходится временно пересаживаться за клавиатуру, поскольку там это сделать проще, чем на геймпаде. Слава богу - таких мест всего 3 штуки, но они дико раздражают. Еще к этой же проблеме отнесу дрель, которой можно ломать КАКИЕ-ТО блоки. Нет, не какие-то одни конкретные - а именно АБСОЛЮТНО ЛЮБЫЕ какие решил автор на каждой локации. Приходится на всех локациях сверлить каждую долбанную клетку, потому что ломаемые блоки могут выглядеть как угодно. То же самое с "прозрачными" стенами, через которые можно пройти.  Проблема №5 - непродуманные враги Одни враги лениво ползают и летают, даже не стреляя в нашу сторону. Другие - носятся как электровеник и обязательно вас заденут. Либо вы их убьете быстрее чем они к вам приблизятся, либо они вас покоцают. Приходится вставать так, чтобы мы могли их задеть, а они - нет. В некоторых местах враги расставлены просто неудобно.  Проблема №6 - скучные боссы Всегда атакуют вас по одной схеме, надо просто понять куда ему стрелять и запомнить последовательность действий - и все, дело в шляпе. Единственное что меняется - чем меньше у них остается здоровья, тем быстрее они начинают двигаться и стрелять, но не намного. У некоторых боссов есть мертвые зоны, в которых они не могут нас достать. Да еще и половину боссов можно убить тупо зайдя им за спину, потеряв при этом немного здоровья, и постреливать оттуда, поскольку они не могут развернуться. Либо просто стрелять как можно быстрее из самой мощной пушки, игнорируя получаемый урон и надеясь что у босса здоровье закончится быстрее.  Предпоследние 2 босса - странные. В обоих случаях комната с ними не закрывается - можно выйти из комнаты и снова войти. Из-за чего одного босса можно медленно, но верно, убить по тактике "зашел, пострелял, вышел", а другого - вообще не убивать. Многие жаловались на адски сложного последнего босса. Для меня это был единственный босс (после первого и второго), которого одолел с первого раза. Ну да, натравливают на вас сразу 3-х жирных врагов, но когда вы убьете нескольких из них - вам восстановят 1/2 здоровья и вы снова можете спокойно бить босса. И используйте бомбы чтобы замедлить их и заставить стрелять друг в друга.  Проблема №7 - неподходящая музыка Музыка неплоха, но не вся. Такой саундтрек хорошо подходит для трейлера или катсцены, где игрок услышит трек всего 1 раз. А вот для уровней - подходит плохо, нужно что-то более размеренное, спокойное и ненавязчивое. Иначе через 3-4 повторения один и тот же трек начнет раздражать. Либо следовало написать больше дорожек и менять их чаще. Например, есть трек который хорошо подходит для грустной катсцены, рассказывающей о прошлом мира игры. Но вместо этого он играет на уровне, причем совсем не подходит для него. Где-то 1/3 треков очень похожи друг на друга.  Проблема №8 - баги Игре уже 5 с лишним лет, а баги все еще остались. Ползающие по стенам враги - если уничтожить под ними поверхность, то они не падают, а зависают в воздухе и начинают вращаться. При переходе в некоторые локации игра стабильно вылетает если играть на весь экран с вертикальной синхронизацией. Причем без ошибок, сообщений или каких-то записей в лог, будто я просто нажал Alt+F4. Решилось оконным режимом и включением вертикальной синхронизации, при которой игра начинает подлагивать, однако. Но зато в этом случае игра начинает вылетать уже на катсценах. Иногда, при каких-то определенных условиях нажатий на кнопки, персонаж бросает бомбу, хотя эту кнопку я не нажимал (пробовал что на геймпаде, что на клавиатуре). Методом проб и ошибок нашел что это происходит если одновременно поменять направление движения и нажать кнопку прыжка. В некоторых диалогах текст не помещается в окошках - пропадают последние слова в предложениях. 
Date 2021-08-17 Playtime 13h 2m Rec Positive Pros : -Visuals are AMAZING. A must have for any pixelart fans. -Music is very ethereal and alien sounding chiptune -Sound effects are also very alien-like(though sometimes a little too loud) -A big world to explore with many secrets to uncover -As indy as it gets (made *only* by one guy, everything, wow) -Boss fights are intense, huge, intimidating and hard! -Basically a love-letter to Super Metroid. Many similarities. -A central area connects all other zones, with a "train", for convenience -Varied areas with different esthetics and music -You can "hack" enemies to change their behaviors (for better or worse...) -Many cool and/or strange abilities and powerups, some of which are secrets... -There is a neat code input system that does cool, totally optional stuff.  -Enemies die with the most satisfying animations I've seen in a metroidvania -Inventory gives all the info you need on each upgrade you got  Cons -No fast travel. It can take way too long to backtrack from point A to point B. -Not even an option to teleport to last save without killing yourself. -Map is lackluster. Not much info given. Doesn't say if there is an item, not much in terms of pins, etc. -Many weapon types are bad or useless -There is nothing to give you direction if you let the game down for a while and came back. -Character is pretty slow baseline. An upgrade lets you go a bit faster, but not by much. -Some bosses seemed designed to be "brute-forced", instead of having fair attacks you can avoid. -Can get a bit boring at some point. I gave up the game a couple years back after getting lost. -Some abilities are clunky and janky (double-tap teleport) -A bit *too* long -Story is way too cryptic, explained mostly through logs. Even after watching videos on Youtube I couldn't make heads or tails of it. -Ending is meh.  Still, it's a classic that deserves at least one playthrough, especially if you're considering getting the sequel on Switch.
Date 2021-08-16 Playtime 1h 52m Rec Negative This is a very Metroid-like game with nice power-ups, great pixel art and responsive controls. Unfortunately, the story is really lacking, with dialogue somewhat typical for indie games (there are even several typos) and characters I don't care about. Your main character is a pencil-neck scientist who is somehow able to fight very well with no explanation given. The music is also nothing memorable, and sounds kind of amateurish at times.  The world looks nice if retro-style is what pleases you, but the world-building itself is not interesting, story-wise. Every Metroid game is better than this- somehow, even the old ones. In the case of this game, copying the completely silent protagonist Samus would have been actually a better idea than creating this new, annoying character.  Sometimes, good code is just not enough, especially with the asking price. For this reason, I have to give this one thumbs down despite the things it does well. The flaws just break immersion to the point I find it hard to care.  Edit: I tried playing Hollow Knight after this one, and even though my computer couldn't handle it so I had to stop early, the quality shined through. If you have to choose between these two Metroidvania's, Hollow Knight is countless times better.
Date 2021-08-16 Playtime 13h 53m Rec Positive I would recommend this game but also would not rate it as high as some reviews have it. I enjoyed the game overall but there were many sections that had cheap deaths and also one notorious section that required me to look up a guide after wasting an hour running around.

Date 2021-08-14 Playtime 19h 24m Rec Positive Un gran metroidvania. Se nota lo mucho que esta inspirado en la franquicia metroid. Bastente entretenido. Si te gusta la franquicia metroid entonces este juego es para ti.
Date 2021-08-14 Playtime 10h 38m Rec Positive Awesome game. Really brings back good times playing Metroid. The world building I thought was quite good. Story had me compelled.   And so many different weapon mods. Always playing with a new pew pew
Date 2021-08-14 Playtime 20h 6m Rec Positive Esta bastante bien, entretenido si te gustan los Metroidvania. La historia es bastante secundaria, los personajes son bastante irrelevantes. Los controles están piola, los sentí toscos muchas veces pero me imagino que es por la falta de costumbre a juegos como Metroid o Contra, siento que Ori que salio por las mismas fechas cumple más. La variedad de armas y habilidades esta divertida, aunque siento que nunca terminas de hacer mucho daño, lo que le da un toque mas de desesperación si te molesta que los enemigos "no mueren rápido". Si estas pensando comprarlo te diría que lo hagas, ya sea full-price o en oferta.
Date 2021-08-13 Playtime 15h 21m Rec Positive De los mejores metroidvanias de la historia. Es uno de los juegos que marcan un antes y un después en la industria, si Metroid pavimentó el camino, Axiom Verge lo convirtió en una autopista.  Mi review: https://retroorama.blogspot.com/2019/03/indie-review-axiom-verge.html
Date 2021-08-12 Playtime 10h 48m Rec Positive Si tienes ganas de jugar algo como metroid, este juego ofrece eso y algo más, muy divertido pero llega a ser injusto y frustrante  en ciertas zonas.
Date 2021-08-12 Playtime 6h 6m Rec Positive I really enjoyed this game. i only remembered i should write a review when i saw Axiom 2 is coming out.  Just like a lot of the other reviews said, it's a very Metroid-like Metroidvania game. All the levels are well made and gameplay feels tight. I grew up with this type of games and still love them. If you are the same, this game is defo worth getting.
Date 2021-08-12 Playtime 13h 34m Rec Positive Simplemente un perfecto metroidvania, recomendado para los que se inicien en este género. Lore y soundtrack perfectos.
Date 2021-08-12 Playtime 47h 23m Rec Positive Axiom Verge es un juego al más puro estilo Metroid, sobre todo la premisa de un humano perdido en un solitario planeta extraterrestre el cual tiene que sobrevivir con lo único que tiene a mano, el Modificador de Axiomas. Este juegazo me recordó bastante a Super Metroid, sobre todo la estética de otro planeta oscuro y que se siente terrorífico explorarlo pero es lo único que podemos hacer, Por ahora...
Date 2021-08-12 Playtime 9h 53m Rec Negative [h1] 原教旨主义类银河 [/h1] 公理边缘由Tom Happ一个人开发，并于15年正式推出。之前观望了许久，终于在今年开坑一口气通关（碰巧的是玩的过程中公理边缘2发售了）。本作可以说是非常原教旨主义的类银河战士（甚至基本没有城的元素），进房间滚动，格子地图，几乎可以忽略不计的谜语剧情，能力收集，8bit画风——基本可以对标nes上的初代密特罗德，当然对应的便是极为银河（硬核）的游戏体验。  我在normal难度下初见花了9个半小时打通，期间想进行全收集，但最后还是没有坚持下去。整个游戏风格非常电波（甚至有点420），部分地图相当精神污染（尤其是Kur下半区的恶心人激光小怪，搭配上非常鬼畜的BGM（不和谐旋律加上风格化的世界音乐女vocal，可以说是相当诡异）），加上通关流程几乎没有引导，只能在拿到新能力后回忆“哦好像那里可以过去了”。但作为原汁原味的类银河，全作没有传送点，但地图设计上通过一个长走廊电梯连接了整个地图各部分，而且该区域过早的开启导致到游戏中期十分迷惑是能力忘拿还是攻略错了方向。仅仅想通关，就很有可能浪费大量时间走冤枉路，更别说道具和能力收集了。  收集方面体验也不算好。部分道具需要输入Password才能打开暗门，但我没有发现这个password在哪，只能查攻略。对于解锁的能力，一些操作非常反人类。比如射击没法连发（好在手柄可以turbo），冲刺是速推两下摇杆，游戏特色的glitch机使用起来并不是特别直观，一些情况面对隐藏房只能把所有能力都全试一遍才能找到答案，还有在[spoiler]E-Kur-Mah挖石头找钥匙时令人呕吐的体验（我把全房间石头挖开，最后倒数第三块找到了钥匙）[/spoiler]。怪物刷新机制也令人费解，貌似是超过一定地图格数就刷新。但到新房间里旧房间里所有怪物和障碍都定格，包括它们的弹道，有的时候回房间直接被前面跑图时的怪物弹道打死。  说到怪物，越到游戏后期的小怪越阴间。攻击方式难以躲避，跑图相当麻烦。boss战是整个游戏的软肋，前期卡点无伤，后期血条上来了直接站撸，貌似作者在游戏最后也感觉到了boss战的问题，[spoiler]直接让主角成为了和平主义者并可跳过boss战[/spoiler]。  总之，虽然整个游戏槽点很多，但却是近年不可多得的原教旨主义类银河战士游戏。点不推荐是不推荐给大多数玩家，尤其是刚接触这类游戏的玩家，很可能带来很差的游戏体验。当然如果你是银河城教父，本作还是值得一玩。就我个人而言，总体感受痛苦大于快乐。  [h1]BBBB的Metroidvania评分表[/h1] ┌────────┬──────┐ │地图系统▪▪▪▪│ ★★☆☆☆│ ├────────┼──────┤ │战斗系统▪▪▪▪│ ★★☆☆☆│ ├────────┼──────┤ │能力系统▪▪▪▪│ ★★★★☆│ ├────────┼──────┤ │升级系统▪▪▪▪│ N/A▪▪▪▪▪▪│ ├────────┼──────┤ │装备道具▪▪▪▪│ ★★★☆☆│ ├────────┼──────┤ │剧情美术▪▪▪▪│ ★★☆☆☆│ ├────────┼──────┤ │游戏性▪▪▪▪▪▪▪│ ★★☆☆☆│ └────────┴──────┘ [u]总评[/u]  ┌────────┬──────┐ │粪指数▪▪▪▪▪▪▪│ ★★★★★│ ├────────┼──────┤ │fun指数▪▪▪▪▪│ ★★☆☆☆│ └────────┴──────┘  [u]最后祝Axiom Verge 2大卖！虽然目前没上steam loll[/u]
Date 2021-08-12 Playtime 21h 21m Rec Negative Разраб продался Эпикам и вторая часть стала эксклюзивом ЕГС. А они уже накручивают цену. Жадность - это плохо, так что не стоит и эту игру покупать, чтобы у разраба лицо не треснуло от денег.
Date 2021-08-12 Playtime 18h 16m Rec Positive It's literally Metroid with a fresh coat of paint and parallax scrolling. Otherwise, it's pure homage through and through. There's a reason it made a splash when it released.
Date 2021-08-11 Playtime 23h 25m Rec Positive It has everything you'd expect from a good Metroid remake : weird music, smooth controls and well-balanced difficulty. A must buy when on sale as you'll have fun with it for about 20h.
Date 2021-08-11 Playtime 5h 10m Rec Negative Talvez eu tenha ido com muita expectativa jogar esse game, realmente não sei o que houve, mas não consegui continuar jogando depois de um tempo. No início parecia ser pra mim um bom game, tava me divertindo até, mas o jogo não é cativante, não me senti com vontade de ficar muito tempo jogando, a trilha sonora não me chamava atenção e não era empolgante como as de Metroid 3 (a principal inspiração para esse metroidvania). Tenho certeza que deve ser um game que agrada a muitos fãs do gênero, mas eu infelizmente, passo.
Date 2021-08-10 Playtime 20h 32m Rec Positive One of the best Metroidvania I have ever played. Everything is superb, the mechanics, the level design, the secrets and the music.  This one is closer to Metroid than is to Castlevania, but it's way superior to any of the Metroid games. Probably the best game you can find in that playstyle.
Date 2021-08-10 Playtime 25h 46m Rec Positive Great
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 27h 57m Rec Positive amazing. I want to play the sequel soon. if steam doesn't make it available at launch, I'll be forced to buy at Epic
Date 2021-08-09 Playtime 26h 36m Rec Positive buen juego
Date 2021-08-08 Playtime 13h 6m Rec Positive Nice Metroidvania heavily inspired by the first Metroid games with a interesting narrative, that was  [u]developed by only one person[/u]. The abilities / tools are really cool and there are a lot of different weapons. The worlds are great and full of secrets with also great soundtracks. Backtracking is a bit of a chore if you are used to feauters like fast travel in games nowdays. Since it is obviously inspired by the first Metroid games, features such as fast travel are missing. There is a way to travel a little faster between the areas, but it is a bit too slow for one or the other if they want to backtrack to get all items, notes etc. But I liked it because it reminded me of playing Metroid 2 and Super Metroid as a kid.
Date 2021-08-07 Playtime 16h 38m Rec Positive A good, not-too-hard Metroid-clone with some issues and a somewhat confusing story (but I guess that fits to the 80s theme here). If you play the game there will be a lot of back tracing and sometimes you have to search the whole map for the next area to proceed. This can be quite frustrating as well as time consuming. Also the boss fights seem sometimes a bit out of place: Some later boss battles are much easier than the ones before and a bunch of them take a huge amount of your patience and time. My last complainment would be, that in one area the music is just annoying (whilst the other areas are completely fine). All in all I had a lot of fun regardless of those points and would recommend the game :)
Date 2021-08-06 Playtime 12h 38m Rec Positive Props to the dev for being a one-man show, but overall an over-hyped game with mediocre dialogue. Definitely stick to a strictly breadcrumbs narrative and drop the NPC chit chat. The main character is pretty unlikable. I'm here to find secrets and murder everything in my path; I don't care about Trace's pacifistic sensibilities. I also found the music to be pretty grating. Some of the soaring leads leap up in volume too much to the detriment of the atmosphere.  Despite all that, it's worth a buy on sale. A number of cool weapons (and a plethora of lame, useless ones), a good challenge on hard mode that never felt cheap on the first playthrough, unique areas, good world building, and true to the source material, backtracking after finding new items is fun.
Date 2021-08-06 Playtime 12h 37m Rec Negative 类银河城作品很多 但是大多更像城 像银河战士的太少了 很难得 不仅是进门动画高仿 小方块组成的地形 诡异阴暗的环境 大量的隐藏和曲折的路线都在致敬着经典 属于游戏自身的特色 就是glitch了 改变敌人形态和地形 这个设计非常新颖 但是也只是新颖一下 作为解谜要素用到不多 主要用于各种烦死人的敌人 后期不少敌人过于恶心 血高速度快攻击频率也离谱 除了无人机无限莽 只能靠glitch 之所以不推荐 主要在于以下问题 目标的不明确性 虽然前半部分通过地形的把角色限制在了一本道的路径之中 但是还是要像没头苍蝇一样乱转 也没有个地图室类设施 只能纯脸探 每个区域都绕得让人想吐 地图也没有完成度指示 终局前想全收集都不知道该去哪 让人烦躁 没有传送室 地图还傻大 那个横向的缆车地图位置也很偏 存在意义不大 跑图累断腿 武器虽然很多 但大多数是样子货 射程近伤害低甚至还不能连射 作为解谜跑路的重要能力 瞬移竟然是双击方向 不是误触发就是按不出 很难操作 尤其是用摇杆进行跳跃向上穿平台 只能临时改用十字键 不停左上右上斜向攻击时也会莫名触发瞬移 导致撞敌伤血 而流程后期有不少要空中瞬移的地方 操作起来很麻烦 而另一个解谜重要道具的钩爪简直就是临时凑数随便塞的一样 手感一塌糊涂 射爪速度远低于下落速度 想连续钩爪移动只能蹭着天花板一点一点磨  而解谜输出一体的无人机则明显强得过头 能挖石头 攻击自带连射 并且攻击三格宽 体型还极小 用来探路打图不要太爽 死了喘气回血就又是一条好汉 以至于强到被禁止在boss房内使用 boss设计得很失败 弱点制但是没有明显得弱点显示 只能瞎鸡掰突突碰巧发现 甚至有个坦克一样的boss即使已经突突死了也不知道究竟哪里是弱点 并且有的攻击的高度不固定 就差那么几个像素 糊你一脸 有的动作快出招没前摇 更有攻击封屏没法躲只能靠硬拼的 总的体验就是三分惊艳 七分烦躁
Date 2021-08-04 Playtime 24h 3m Rec Positive Awesome game
Date 2021-08-01 Playtime 36h 12m Rec Positive Will Axiom Verge 2 be released on Steam? Also I'd love to see what it'd be like if the series experimented with 3d, and made a game with the Metroid Prime treatment. Plus, let's face it, Metroid's hinted at two games by now, a prime sequal no less, and 2d, neither of which has come out, plus it really felt like Nintendo was too much of a rated E pussy to take the Metroid series to new horizon, like making a rated M Metroid, the series has a sexy female protagonist in a skin tight blue suit, and even sci-fi horror elemets with the Metroid's themselves!!! A rated M Metroid wouldv'e been badass! But Nintendo is basically the lame Disney rated E pussy ass of the video game industry; And It's about time we actually had a REAL hardcore video game developer company like Thomas Happ Games LLC to finally satiate our thirst for a good science-fantasy metroidvania series, and even experiment with the series in 3d if they'd like too! And not just any Metroidvania series, but one that was rated M from the start, this game franchise was made for OUR kind of audience, and that's a really good thing for us because it means we don't need to wait for nintendo's sorry ass anymore, nintendo has failed us by cramming out another Mario game out like fucking clockwork and essentially letting great video game series THAT ARE OWNED BY THEM, Starfox, Megaman, F-ZERO, Metroid, you fucking name it, rot away into obscurity; but we don't need Nintendo anymore, becausewe have a new, BETTER game developer, an INDIE GAME DEVELOPER, the heroic rebels of the video game industry who aren't afraid to make something new and exciting like the Axiom Verge series, which is not only way more awesome than Metroid by being rated M, but because it's also its own thing, Axiom Verge has its OWN game mechanics, and its OWN unique world's to explore, plus it would be really cool if the series experimented with 3d, and the best part is it doesn't necessarily need to be like a metroid prime interpretation of Axiom Verge in 3d, it could be ANYTHING 3D, and rated M 3d! And that's exactly why I'm proud of Thomas Happ Games LLC as they further and further become an ever more powerful presence in not just the Indie game industry, but the video game industry as a whole, and I'm proud that they care about good gameplay and creative, revolutionary, new ways to develop it; I have all the games in the Metroid series, and all three awesome Prime games, if Metroid is dead, that doesn't matter, Nintendo can suck our dicks if they're too stupid to stop acting like some disney rated E baby, and just make something rated god damn M for once, we don't need these boring AAA established video game companies to force microtransactions onto us like were just their consumerist slaves! We have better new games to buy, and those games... ARE INDIE MOTHERFUCKERS!!! FUCKING HELL YEAH!!! START THE REVOLUTION AND DOWN WITH THE SYSTEM!!!
Date 2021-07-31 Playtime 7h 3m Rec Positive Aire retro muy divertido. Recomendable.
Date 2021-07-31 Playtime 30h 43m Rec Positive It's an awesome game; but even if you never play it once, the soundtrack alone is worth the price.
Date 2021-07-29 Playtime 12h 42m Rec Positive If you're craving for some platforming metroidvania retro stuff and has already checked other more polished games (like Hollow Knight or Blasphemous), you should get this.
Date 2021-07-29 Playtime 9h 45m Rec Positive 打完后发现我错了，是有7分的水准的。
Date 2021-07-28 Playtime 16h 20m Rec Positive A Metroidvania Masterpiece. I was immediately sucked in. The gameplay, controls, weapons, upgrades, art, platforming, secrets, music, & story are all great. Highly recommend.

Date 2021-07-26 Playtime 10h 46m Rec Negative There's probably a good game hiding under many of the rough layers that make this game. Some very frustrating sections and the way levels are built don't make this game a very enjoyable experience. I'm trying to force myself to finish it, but I don't know if I'll manage. Story is convoluted and not as interesting as one might think. I'm a huge Metroidvania fan, Axiom Verge isn't a bad game but lacks the polish to make it a good game.  Edit: Uninstalled, really didn't like my time playing this game. Had a look at the achievements, early ones were only unlocked by less than 50% of the players, that is a better pointer than the few people who bothered writing a review for this game.
Date 2021-07-26 Playtime 41h 23m Rec Positive fun
Date 2021-07-24 Playtime 18h 21m Rec Negative 确实是不错的游戏 不过游戏过多的解密跟隐藏 没中文跟传送玩起来太累
Date 2021-07-23 Playtime 8h 42m Rec Positive Cool game, fun ideas. It's a fun metroidvania. It reminded me of old school metroid, castlevania, but also games like hollow knight.
Date 2021-07-23 Playtime 41h 23m Rec Positive This game is just excellent, a true Metroidvania (+ Contra),the graphics, the music. 100% recommended.
Date 2021-07-22 Playtime 33h 20m Rec Positive 100
Date 2021-07-22 Playtime 18h 23m Rec Positive Un metroidvania con un estilo muy particular. Dificultad adecuada. Secretos. Niveles interesantes para explorar. Una historia original hecha con mucha imaginación. Para mí, este juego lo tiene todo. Impresionante, pero lo es mucho más ya que una sola persona lo hizo todo, programación, arte, música. Si disfrutas los metroidvanias, no te pierdas Axiom Verge.
Date 2021-07-22 Playtime 7h 53m Rec Positive Looked up "Metroid like games for pc" this was one of the recommended and gotta say if you're looking for a super metroid type game to scratch your pp itch look no further this game is more metroid than some of the metroid sequels it almost feels like a modded version of super metroid too me sometimes  the only beef i have is i play only the hardest difficulty in games and this ones "hard mode" is kind of a push over sometimes  either way 10/10 would recommend especially if you like super metroid
Date 2021-07-21 Playtime 21h 54m Rec Positive Хорошая метроидвания, определенно стоит обратить внимание тем кто знает что это и с чем есть. А вот остальным стоит задуматься, так как игры пытается в старые игры, те самые что бесчеловечны.  + Звук + Пиксельарт + Какой то сюжет - Никакой навигации, никакой кучи меток, никаких быстрых переходов. Только карта. Всё. - Проходы в стенах не то что бы неочевидны. Они вообще никак не выделяются. То есть совсем. Играя без гайдов вы условный час проходите локации, доходите до некоего апа расширяющий ваши возможности. А потом возвращаетесь и ещё три условных часа долбитесь в стены. - Скучные боссы - Скучные враги - Практически всё оружие не имеет смысла
Date 2021-07-21 Playtime 21h 44m Rec Positive If you like metroidvanias, you're going to like this.
Date 2021-07-21 Playtime 24h 18m Rec Positive A really good Metroidvania game that takes you back to the classic side-scrolling shooter, sci-fi gameplay and story, similar to the intergalactic bounty hunter's game we all know. Totally recommended!
Date 2021-07-20 Playtime 15h 48m Rec Positive This game and Blasphemous, are currently my top tier, most cherished "metroidvania" type games on Steam. There are probably other candidates, but these two really hit the spot. It's been some time since I played Axiom Verge but that exotic,  sci-fi experience was truly unforgettable. A must have for the genre enthusiast. (9.5/10)

Date 2021-07-20 Playtime 21h 21m Rec Positive game gud
Date 2021-07-20 Playtime 2h 56m Rec Negative This is tough to recommend. It's an 8-bit Metroid clone that gets most things right, but can be frustratingly hard. Here are a bunch of things that have managed to irritate me over the past 2 hours:  Some enemies just outclass you in many important ways. There are tongue zombies that move much faster than you and whose goal is to just occupy your position and do damage over time, because they have poision skin and you don't, or whatever video game logic explains this phenomena. You could tell the devs were really proud of this guy because they are all over the place. They are not fun to fight and almost always guarantee considerable damage/death. Health pickups are uncommon so these guys are super annoying.  Some enemies seem completely harmless but kick like a mule; for example, there are these little pink donuts that if you graze up against will take about a full container of health off (you start with 1 or 2, I don't remember). You also get knocked back a moderate amount when taking damage, which can throw you off narrow ledges and lead to more bumping into little pink donuts. Given the verticality of some chambers, this sets you up to transform into a ping-pong ball until your next life. Speaking of lives, there is about a 5-second respawn animation that requires user input about halfway through to continue. You will be seeing this a lot, clustered around boss fights and hidden worlds. It's just unnecessary and feels a bit like the game is punishing you for dying when the devs knew full well what they were designing.  The boss design is uninspired. With the second boss, you stand on a narrow ledge, jump to shoot a vulnerable spot, duck under it's bullets, jump over bullets, duck under bullets, over and over about 50 times. If you take damage you will fall off the ledge and much larger laser cannons will smash you to bits. It might seem easy enough to get back up on that ledge, but there are regenerating blocks down below that can trap you and force you to take more damage from the laser cannons. This is unnecessarily punishing for how basic the boss is. You literally just jump, shoot, duck over and over which isn't fun at all, but if you slip up even once you may as well restart that attempt. They really phoned in that boss design.  Certain hazards on the map feel like attrition mechanics. You simply cannot avoid taking damage from certain steam traps due to the way they are laid out, at least not with the equipment I've unlocked so far. Given how tough the enemies are, this just feels like a cheap way to soften you up for the next bizarrely overpowered pink donut. There are snake things that shoot out of pipes that are only triggered when you definitely will get hit by them. In this unbelievably hostile world, it feels like everything will take your health away and send you back to a save spot 7 rooms back, forcing you to move at a glacial pace through the exact same content just to get cheesed by yet another lame environmental hazard.  You get a bunch of new weapons but some simply don't have much use. The game design is itself at odds with certain weapon archetypes. For example, you get an indirect fire weapon early on in the game, but most enemies you'd want to use this on have been positioned in such a way that you can't damage them with it. Think Mega Man enemy placement where in order to advance, you have to jump onto a platform occupied by an immobile enemy who just fires its gun all day long in a straight line. This forces you to take damage, when the indirect fire weapon could have avoided that if the game was designed with it in mind. This makes certain weapons feel tacked on, as they don't really have a place in the world. I wonder if the game was designed with just a couple weapons in mind, then the rest retroactively added? It feels that way.  You get a glitch gun that makes enemies easier, but it's not always possible to use it on them. Using the tactic of glitching an enemy and then attacking it makes the game very slow paced, given the sheer volume of enemies. In true 8-bit fashion, you face the same enemies over and over again in the same room, so it gets very repetitive glitching them and then fighting them. Some more intelligent encounter design would have made this game a lot more interesting, where multiple enemies could perhaps synergize their moves and glitch mechanics to add a layer of strategy.  This game has a Hard mode for those interested, of which I am not one. My play through is on normal, but it feels hard. I find myself playing extremely slowly, cheesing enemies every chance I get, and it's honestly not much fun.  However, it's not all bad: The exploration can be fun, the abilities are sort of interesting, particularly the glitch gun, and the art is a great throwback to the 80's. The game itself just punishes you too much, bosses can be boring but take a long time to kill, and certain enemies are far too over-tuned and virtually guarantee that you take damage if they are present. I'd give it a "Don't Recommend" because it doesn't feel like it respects your time, but if you like the difficulty of the 8-bit era, give it a go. It's an authentic 80's experience, for better or worse.
Date 2021-07-19 Playtime 23h 35m Rec Positive Muy lindos graficos, musica que acompaña muy bien y en ocasiones pegadizas, me gusto la onda alien/sumeria, si bien es bastante parecido a Metroid, del cual toma inspiración, esto le da una diferencia estética. Las mecánicas interesantes(teletransportacion, la mecanica glitch para desbloquear lugares nuevos o cambiar el comportamiento de los enemigos,un dron que es bastante útil tanto para explorar como para hacer de anzuelo o recorrer lugares sin riesgos...) y armas a lo tonto, aunque siempre terminé usando las mismas cuatro o cinco. Los jefes por ahí eran la parte más floja, aunque no estaban mal tampoco, pero no había mucha plataforma, era esquivar y encontrarle la vuelta a que arma usar para atacarlo, a diferencia de juegos como Iconoclasts, por ejemplo, donde los jefes eran más onda puzzle y muy particulares. Explorar nuevos espacios en Axiom Verge es muy divertido, y la historia, aunque medio confusa y que se calla algunas cosas por momentos, es entretenida. Muy recomendado.
Date 2021-07-18 Playtime 13h 29m Rec Positive un juego con un exelente diseño de niveles, recuerda mucho a los contra clasicos y su banda sonora es buena, tiene un mapa bastante grande lo que me hizo perderme mucho y aveces sin saber para donde ir, pero un juego divertido en general.
Date 2021-07-18 Playtime 12h 10m Rec Positive I'd have a hard time saying it's really my favorite indie metroidvania on steam, but if you're a shut in like me who thinks Super Metroid is the best fucking game ever you'll obviously like it. If you like sci-fi horror or games about collecting power ups and backtracking just fucking buy it.
Date 2021-07-17 Playtime 12h 24m Rec Positive Very fun Metroid-like game, and it is incredible that this was all created by one person.
Date 2021-07-17 Playtime 2h 26m Rec Negative Игра для меня оказалась не посильной из-за одного минуса куда идти. Я убил первого боса получил бур прошел дальше и мне кинули 20 локаций где я везде встретился с тупиком. Я посмотрел на ютубе куда идти и меня бомбануло ибо в начальной локе надо было идти не в низ, а верх. В AV есть плюсы но если вам не нравится блуждать по не самым красивым локациям это не для вас.
Date 2021-07-16 Playtime 11h 21m Rec Positive Para todos los amantes del MetroidVania, este juego es el indicado !
Date 2021-07-16 Playtime 15h 0m Rec Positive I got it for free on the epic store, liked it so much I bought it over here.  Its not perfect, but if you are a metroid/metroidvania fan you owe it to yourself to play this, Its super good.
Date 2021-07-16 Playtime 26h 21m Rec Positive I'm not even into Metroid-like games that much but this one is awesome. Only played it 3 times at this point lol.
Date 2021-07-15 Playtime 11h 23m Rec Positive awesome metroid game  only flaw: didnt like some bossfights, i simply dont have enough time to go through that challenge so i never finished the game, there should be an option for people with jobs and duties, so we do not get stuck in the game and stop playing
Date 2021-07-15 Playtime 3h 51m Rec Positive Inexorable
Date 2021-07-15 Playtime 7h 41m Rec Positive Please describe what you liked or disliked about this product. 
Date 2021-07-14 Playtime 11h 8m Rec Positive The feeling of wonder and despair fill the lands. Such a classic feeling of exploration. I've gotten so lost in the game exploring each time I got a new ability. I'm not finished all the way, but I'm pretty close and so far I can already say this was worth the purchase.
Date 2021-07-14 Playtime 16h 5m Rec Positive dont put 'axio' in the passcodes menu as it will turn on automatically even when its off upon reloading the game, and you wont get steam cheevos, even when the code does nothing other than saying cheats ON at the end. Literally only found it cause i was messing around in the passcodes menu. if you put it in by accident, clear it before you close the game. -------------------- gameplay: aside from that, i like the game, but it was lukewarm 6/10 at best. some of the input commands are cumbersome like the dash (when using analog it seems to go off randomly during platforming), and the way the grapple works feels like it could have just been left out entirely and would have been a significantly better game. By the time you collect a majority of the health upgrades most bosses can straight up be facetanked with minor issue, i feel like mechanically the game is lacking. I feel like giving the same item an upgrade three times to successively open up gameplay areas was a neat idea, but really only serves in forcing the metroid style map design and makes playing the game kind of annoying. too many guns when there are several that are clearly overpowered guns that stand out.  visiting areas early(?) and beating the bosses were fine, but revisiting areas just to hit story checkpoints was confusing and felt odd despite everyone having long range comms with you , probably a just me problem i guess.  I recommend the game as it is good, and i liked it, but its probably not the game for me, i might take a look at AV2 if i can get it on sale after a while.
Date 2021-07-14 Playtime 6h 56m Rec Positive Play this game if you like [b]Metroid[/b] and [b]Super Metroid[/b].
Date 2021-07-13 Playtime 3h 10m Rec Negative The main character looks like something out of "Penny Arcade"
Date 2021-07-13 Playtime 10h 40m Rec Positive I absolutely LOVE the all the gun variations in this game. Each one has a unique use and you will end up using all of them. This game does require you to think before you act, as it is fairly challenging, and careful planning is needed to succeed, rather than just improving your skills. That being said, not a fan of the story, not really the sort of thing that I like in a story, but still a fun game.
Date 2021-07-13 Playtime 41h 17m Rec Positive ２週目始めたついでに、紹介動画つくりました。購入を迷ってる、自分に合うかな？など、気になる方は、参考にしてみてください。 ゆっくり実況　どんな感じのゲーム？最初の１時間をダイジェストで紹介https://youtu.be/0Do4lbCkxXc  １年ぶりにプレイしましたが、当時の印象として残っているのは ①良作メトロイドヴァニア。 「今は進めません」をしっかり見せてからの、スキルゲットで「あそこがすすめるようになるぞ」。この流れがしっかり作られてる。そして、それをメインに据えたゲーム。一ひねり考えられた隠しマップ探し＆７０以上あるアイテム探しでボリュームたっぷり。マップ踏破率100％、アイテム収集100％勢には、たまらん！アクションも変なクセがなくイメージ通りに動かせます。  ②世界観はクセが凄い なんとも表現できない世界観とBGＭ。なんとか表現すると、ダーク・未知の文明の残滓・映画プロメテウスのようなビジュアル。目の前に可視化して現れたデジタル風味のバグ、、、ここは現実なのか、コンピューターの世界なのか？この世界を旅したことは忘れられない体験になると思います。このゲームを唯一無二にしているのは、この世界観。  この２つのポイントを動画内で紹介しています。購入を迷われてる方は、自分に合いそうか、チェックしてみてください。あと、他の方のレビューの中に、バグでアイテムが取れないとの書き込みがありましたが、私の環境ではアイテム取得100％できてます。ただ、なんせPCゲームですので、おま環が発生するかどうかは、やってみないとわからないですよね、、、
Date 2021-07-12 Playtime 42h 24m Rec Positive Se você gosta de super metroid e está carente de um jogo igual esse é melhor ainda.
Date 2021-07-12 Playtime 1h 21m Rec Negative Looks like the developer doesn't care for mac users anymore, controller support is been broken for years and haven't been fixed yet
Date 2021-07-12 Playtime 2h 42m Rec Negative Great music and aesthetics in an homage to NES Metroid; all ruined by those "white jumping zombies" who are clearly in the game only to troll you... What a shame.
Date 2021-07-12 Playtime 15h 7m Rec Positive The music was good. The exploration was a bit overwhelming. It felt a bit too tedious to find all the stuff, and the bosses were a bit too easy, but it was a good game nonetheless.
Date 2021-07-12 Playtime 22h 30m Rec Positive This is a brilliantly designed game! This is definitely a must play title. Can't wait for AV2.
Date 2021-07-11 Playtime 26h 52m Rec Positive Pure metroidvania experience
Date 2021-07-11 Playtime 16h 10m Rec Positive compralo
Date 2021-07-11 Playtime 2h 37m Rec Negative Do you like Metroid? Then don't play Axiom Verge.  It has all the aesthetics of Metroid with none of the game design ingenuity. It would've been better if they just changed the texture and music so it wasn't trying to emulate Metroid at all, and could be judged as its own thing, because it doesn't play or feel like Metroid at all. It just wants to look like it.
Date 2021-07-11 Playtime 26h 45m Rec Positive its pretty cool
Date 2021-07-11 Playtime 48h 21m Rec Positive The game is fun overall, I did have some issues figuring out where to go in the beginning, it definitely has that original NES Metroid feel, once I got past that the game play is good, music is really good, plot is a little silly but it matches the world that's created, took me about 28 hrs to beat and had to look up at specific points where I was going, there is nothing in game that shows my next destination besides.....hmm that part on the map hasn't been explored yet, but there is a way to place markers on the map to remember areas to go back to later when you acquire something new, just have a little bit of patience.
Date 2021-07-11 Playtime 3h 44m Rec Positive Love wandering around and the story is pretty wild in a good way.
Date 2021-07-11 Playtime 23h 51m Rec Positive 재밌긴 한데... 메트로이드처럼 아이템 획득여부를 알 수 없는게 너무 힘들다 나처럼 콜렉터기질이 있는 사람은 아주 괴로울듯  맵 100% 를 달성하는데 있어서도 통상적으론 닿을 수 없는 거리로 이동해야 맵을 열 수 있다는게 힘들다 아직은 얻지 못했는데 스페이스점프같은거라도 있을려나....어쩌면 없을지도? 뭐 여러가지로 난감한 점이 많다 순순히 컨트롤에 의지해야 하는 부분이라던가...  추천은 하겠는데.... 힘들다
Date 2021-07-11 Playtime 16h 59m Rec Positive Axiom Verge had been on my wish list for a while. I finally got it on sale and couldn't put it down for a week (of game time). At first, it seemed simple, but as I kept playing there was more to it and I was was hooked. I liked the music a lot as well.
Date 2021-07-11 Playtime 9h 8m Rec Positive Short and sweet, nicely stylized/themed and a banger of a soundtrack
Date 2021-07-11 Playtime 11h 7m Rec Positive Axiom Verge does a lot of stuff right. It also does some stuff wrong.   Let's start with the obvious: a clear ode to the original Metroid, with the added HR Giger influences that the original Metroid took out from its influence from Alien. The different "weapons" and "abilities" you acquire during the game make it real fun, each of the different weapons you get is sufficiently different to make them interesting in their own right. Some of the abilities feel underutilized, right into the end of the game the code hack feels like you never use it.  Some of the issues I have with this game is that the element of backtracking is not well implemented: the map feels lacking in where to go, and once you find a place in the map where there is a new place to go, it is impossible to remember why you couldn't, so you spend half hour getting from one place of the map to the other.  Even more, there is little to no incentive to actually do the backtrack since most of the enemies do not drop any item or very few drop health, which is completely invalidated by the fact that save points restore your whole life. In this vain, there are too many save points, I get it makes a more forgiving experience, but I think it detracts from the experience if only the enemies dropped health more often. The poor implementation of backtracking could be simply improved by improving the map or even better, add a teleport between save points, this alone would make it a way better experience.  The other aspect I feel lacking are the bosses, which some of them feel "gimmicky" in the sense that once you find their glaring weak point, there are just a chore. Some are just pushovers, kill them before they kill you. Most of the bosses feel like they don´t require a deep strategy in order to kill them.  It also could have some improvements in the controls department: there are many buttons needed to be pressed simultaneously where some ála Metroid "push select" or another method of selection could be used. The dash feels awkward since to double tap to dash in a game where you are constantly "platforming" around enemies and precise jumps you end up dashing accidentally often.  The final aspect I was not completely engaged is the level design. Some areas feel stretched out only for the fact that it is something to add to the game without much thought. This is not every area of the game but is especially the case in ones nearing the end of the game.  In all, I think Axiom Verge does more things right that it does wrong. The Metroid feel, the Giger aesthetic, the kick ass soundtrack are all there well made. The story is pretty good. The gameplay is very fun, and although some times feels kind of a chore to go all the other way of the map to know where to go, it does not have frustrating moments.   This game is for anyone that enjoys Metroid-like games and wandering around the map finding secrets and getting through mazes.

Date 2021-07-09 Playtime 19h 6m Rec Positive If you've ever beaten Super Metroid on the SNES, there's an 80% chance that you'll like this game.   If this is absolutely your very first Metroidvania, this game may ruin your day and make you question your capability to make life choices.
Date 2021-07-09 Playtime 7h 17m Rec Negative I was enjoying the game until the game crashed and reset my entire save. Devs please fix this problem
Date 2021-07-08 Playtime 22h 1m Rec Positive While Axiom Verge is technically a Metroidvania, calling it a Metroid-Like is a more apt description. The game takes clear inspiration from the early Metroid titles, particularly the NES one. The homage is evident, from it's environnements trying to replicate the vibes of the more primitive, low color count graphics, to its tribute to the Secret Worlds of old, turning them into a fully fledged mechanic.  Initially, Axiom Verge may feel like a lesser Metroid, but it starts pulling its weight as it introduces new mechanics like the glitch beam, teleport dash, and remote drone. So it doesn't struggle tracing its own identity as it progresses.  There are a ton of weapons in the game, which is nice on paper, but about 75% of them are overshadowed by better, more practical alternatives. Despite this, there is still variety to find in how you approach and play through different areas. Speaking of balance, the bosses are globally quite easy, which can be somewhat of a letdown.  Overall, the game maintains a good flow with nice variety. However, I got lost a couple times around the early-mid and had to wander around to find the way to progress, but no such thing occurred later on.  The movement tech ends with some nice depth to it in the late game, although it sadly doesn't get utilized to its fullest in my opinion. I expected more movement challenges trying to get 100%.  The story is there, but low-key, it's mostly optional background lore to add to the alien mood, but there is a main story with cutscenes, characters and some nice twists here and there.  The soundtrack is great. It's atmospheric and otherworldy at times, like it should be, with a handful of standout tracks. (Walking into Kur as "Inexorable" started playing for the first time was one of the most memorable parts of the game for me). -  All in all, Axiom Verge is a good Metroidvania/Metroid-Like. It does a particularly good job at scratching an itch for a classic 2D Metroid if you've already played them all, or just being an all-around solid Metroidvania.
Date 2021-07-08 Playtime 10h 0m Rec Positive Excellent. Obvious Metroid-inspired game and that's a good thing. Excellent soundtrack, great art direction. The level designs are mostly good and don't require too much aimless backtracking. I found the enemy design a bit weak. Also most of the guns were dumb and didn't seem to have much purpose and many overlapped in how they functioned.  9/10. Catch it on sale and enjoy shooting space anuses to a thumping soundtrack.
Date 2021-07-08 Playtime 7h 14m Rec Negative Honestly it's great but gets ruined mid-late game due to an awful decision to bind a movement upgrade to double tapping a direction instead of to a button. It immediately makes any kind of precise movement incredibly frustrating because of how sensitive the inputs are, you get tons of accidental dashes when trying to fight stuff.  Baffling to me that there was never an option added to disable this and bind it to a button instead. It really killed my enjoyment of the game.
Date 2021-07-07 Playtime 12h 30m Rec Negative I cant really recommend this game, its not terrible but its also incredibly average and bland. There is a ton of weapons but I felt no need to really use more than about 4 of em. The AI is also so simple that most enemies are just fly at you and shoot, the boss fights never felt interesting and one of the bosses I was able to defeat by just standing still and shooting diagonally.  The game does try to add some interesting fun ideas such as the remote drone and the phase dodge but they are let down by a lack of interesting use of them and the controls are a mess expecting you to double tap A LOT.  Additionally the world is just large for the sake of it which leads to a lot of long/tall areas, think original metroid with the repetitive monotone climbing/walking sections, there's no warping either and its even clear its too large when there's basically a train in the middle of the world to travel on.  You may enjoy this game still for what it is but I got about 10x as much fun from another platformer recently even though that lasted half the time this took me.

Date 2021-07-06 Playtime 30h 52m Rec Positive Metroidvania interessante, sendo um pouco difícil. Não me adaptei bem à variedade de armas e as possibilidades que elas trazem na exploração, achei excessiva. Não gostei também da forma de "abrir" o mapa em certas áreas onde você precisa pular, jogar o drone, se teleportar e dar um dash só para deixar o quadrado do mapa aberto. Mesmo assim preferi comprar o jogo e jogar pela Steam do que usar determinada loja.

Date 2021-07-05 Playtime 20h 9m Rec Positive This game very much is like a cross between metroid 1 and super metroid for the NES.  Darker subject matter, but replicates the exploration and feeling of blasting screeching aliens and running around a weird alien glitched-out world (metroid 1) in a very similar way.  Played on hard mode, it is a bit more difficult than those games, but I didn't feel like it was super difficult. Partly due to the balance of those types of games. IMO hollow knight manages to nail current-day difficulty more. I don't think these style of games are very well served by the hero feeling OP towards the end of the game, the way metroid and the castlevanias that name the "metroidvania" genre tend to do.  Was worth playing and I definitely enjoyed it.  I would recommend someone who hasn't played Metroid 1 or this to play this and skip metroid one. That's a hard sell as metroid 1 was my favorite game of all time for about two decades after its release.
Date 2021-07-04 Playtime 15h 42m Rec Negative Pro's: (+) Artwork (+) Soundtrack (+) Story and worldbuilding  Con's: (-) Poorly designed boss fights (-) Overabundance of weapons to the point where they're just cluttering up your menu (-) Visual design sometimes hinders exploration and discovery  A decent but overrated Metroidvania. Major props for being made by only 1 person though.  I wish there was a neutral option, but since there isn't and by the time I reached the end of the game I just wanted it to be over...that pushed me to a non-recommend.  I hope Axiom Verge 2 fixes all of these issues.
Date 2021-07-04 Playtime 44h 21m Rec Positive Axiom Verge — это Half-Life от жанра Метроидваний. Игровая механика, атмосфера, стиль, научно фантастический сюжет, музыка, звуковой дизайн на высоте!

Date 2021-07-04 Playtime 12h 53m Rec Negative [b]+Artwork[/b] [b]+Soundtrack[/b]  [b]-Weapon selection: [/b]There are loads of weapons you can find and use in this game, but most of them are simply useless. [b]-Keyboard controls: [/b] The dashing/teleporting power up is triggered by double tapping the arrow keys, which are also used to aim. If you're ever in combat and change aim a suddenly by tapping, you're going to end up dashing into enemy fire. This happened a lot in the last area of the map. [b]-Backtracking: [/b]It's unreal how much backtracking you have to do in this game. Travelling between regions is pretty tedious, even with the tram you find around halfway through the game. [b]-Boss design: [/b]All bosses have a certain weak point that you have to hit in order to deal damage. Most bosses have a very big target on them that you can hit, so that's not really an issue, it just sucks that there's no variety. There is one boss, however, whose weak point is the belly and all you can do is spam hits at it and wait for it to die before you do. [b]-Worldbuilding: [/b]There is a story, but it's pretty simple and boring and you find out a bit about the world you're playing in, but there's really not much information given to care about what you're doing.

Date 2021-07-04 Playtime 16h 53m Rec Positive Como uma ótima homenagem aos Metroids de Super Nintendo, Axiom Verge consegue fazer jus e se consagra como talvez um dos melhores do gênero. E sim, apesar da inspiração, Axiom consegue ser bem original, trazendo uma jogabilidade dinâmica com Trace, o protagonista do jogo. Além da gameplay fluida e progressão satisfatória, o jogo que foi DESENVOLVIDO POR UMA PESSOA, conta com uma boa história, sendo ela bem característica e digna do gênero sci-fi.  A variedade de inimigos, itens e armas do jogo é impressionante, que conta com o mesmo sistema do Metroid de mapas que podem ser revisitados a medida que você avança no jogo com novas formas de explora-lo.  Importante lembrar a trilha sonora do jogo, que possui musicas excelentes de 16 bits, elas com certezas fazem tudo se tornar mais épico e divertido, além de ambientar bem o clima sci-fi do jogo.  Axiom Verge é um game indispensável para você que é fã de Metroid, seja a franquia ou o gênero.

Date 2021-07-03 Playtime 18h 49m Rec Positive Урвал на халяву в эпике, решил копейкой поддержать разрабов в Стиме, шикарная метроидвания, от которой местами прям люто бомбит, геймплей, сюжет, - чума. Боссы... Боссы просто есть. Конечно же потрясный визуал! Жду вторую часть
Date 2021-07-03 Playtime 10h 23m Rec Positive While Axiom Verge almost perfectly replicates the style and game design of the first Metroid game, the shortcomings of the first Metroid NES are also here but since this is a much more modern and polished product in a much more competitive market, certain aspects of this game feel dated. I think my biggest issue was by far that the map was too big and each level kind of blended into each other and on seven different occasions I found myself backtracking for over 30 minutes or more to find an arbitrary and poorly pointed out blocked path and that was simply because they were way too many obstructions and dead ends in the map for the mental notes required for good Metroidvania world design making the world feel like a endless corridor of random sprites that weren’t too memorable. This issue is compounded by the terrible fast travel system and the also bad boss fights which made exploration and backtracking feel far less compelling than it is in even bigger Metroidvania games like Hollow Knight. The story, combat, and music were all pretty solid however and the OST was probably the highlight of the game and the strange and bizarre art design really makes it visually different than any Metroid game I’ve played. While I do have a lot more negative thoughts to elaborate on than positive ones, I would ultimately say that Axiom Verge is still good and I would certainly give it a positive review even if my experience wasn’t the best. This game is definitely more Metroid NES than Super Metroid, warts and all. 
Date 2021-07-03 Playtime 16h 0m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is all in all an average quality metroid-like. There's a number of things I will complain about, but I still enjoyed myself a lot, and to think just one person made this is amazing.  I'll start with the positive.  The graphics of the game are very inspired and polished. Enemies look cool, but mostly, I was stunned at some of the zone visuals. AV obviously draws a lot of inspiration from Metroid games, and a large portion  of the zones have that classic mix of futuristic design and frightening, organic stuff pulsating all over to them, which makes for a gloomy ambiance I enjoyed a lot. The soundtrack is fantastic too. It draws from a wide range of influences, and both the classic action-oriented themes and the more quiet ones are very successful at what they're trying to do. Also - and this means a lot, as I typically tend to overlook the story elements and focus on the gameplay side of things -, it has a great scenario. The story can get somewhat cryptic, but just enough, so that you still roughly understand what's going on, and I actually enjoyed spending time going over the hidden pieces of lore I found here and there and thinking about unanswered questions. There's definitely material for a good sci-fi movie in there.  There's also a speedrun mode, with built-in splits, which is something I'd be delighted to see in every game. It's extremely basic and lacks key features, but it's there, so, well done.  Now gameplay-wise, it's a pretty classic platformer. Character's responsive, platforming sections make sense, not much to say here. Now I was a bit disappointed with the bestiary. Enemies are numerous and do look good, but their patterns were mostly uninspired. They're either mostly harmless and free to kill from a distance, or so quick, or placed in an unfitting level layout, that fighting them mostly comes down to a DPS race where you can't really afford to worry about not getting hit. As I said now, it's like, average quality. Definitely not close to a Castlevania genius level, but not horrible either.  Unfortunately, this applies to bosses too. They're mostly underwhelming, due to a lack of interactivity. You mostly don't move away from a relatively safe spot, dodge a bullet or two, fire, rinse and repeat. The game just doesn't hold up to the climactic nature that's to be expected from a boss fight, especially in a retro-inspired platformer.  Now about the upgrades that add variations to the gameplay, the first few are pretty cool and standard, but I wish some of them got worked on a little more. The hook that lets you swing back and forth while suspended to a platform is kind of clunky. It's pretty unreliable in some specific portions, and counterintuitive to use, as it works in a way that's opposite to literally every platformer I can think of. Sure, it doesn't mean it's bad, but I can't help but ask myself why.  I also wish the dash move was remappable to a specific button, instead of a directional input double tap. Double-tapping on an Xbox 360 controller (which is probably the most democratically used controller) is notoriously ineffective, and I had to switch to keyboard for a couple of really tight sections, on top of not being able to speed through large areas as easily as I'd have wanted to.  I was also pretty upset at the final boss, as it's like, the most anticlimactic fight in the entire game. It... [i]is[/i], a DPS race, where you just tolerate nearly unavoidable but hardly-damaging patterns while you stand still and brainlessly fire at the same thing until it's done. No second form, no true final boss, no intensity whatsoever.  Finally, I'd like to point out THE mistake every developer that wants to make a metroidvania makes : secrets. Why is there so often an insane amount of underwhelming items and tiny fractions of upgrades behind breakable walls or invisible paths that are not hinted at ? If you want to even try to get 100% of the items, you have to try and drill, corrupt, and then bump your head in drone form against every single block, which basically makes the game half game, half walking simulator.  It tends to make me lose interest when I have to make a choice between ignoring half the content entirely or spend literal hours doing uninteresting stuff, if not to outright look up a guide, and I doubt I'm the only one. Challenge rooms were invented for a reason.  Now that last bit was probably a little harsh. In the end, this game is no different from the vast majority of metroid-likes out there, including giants like Hollow Knight (which was an amazing game, but also a nightmare of exploration). I did feel the need to point out the wrongs, and I hope this does come through as constructive criticism, as I heard AV2 was on the way.  It's definitely still a cool game, and I do recommend it.

Date 2021-07-02 Playtime 6h 0m Rec Negative It is hard to write a review about this particular game without commentators and critics automatically crying foul to the fact that this entire game was made by one person.  Yes, one person.  However, any criticism should be seen as constructive as that is the entire point of any review.  To write about the strengths and weakness of any work.    Axiom Verge is a blend of genre's and games from the NES days (Metroid, Master Blaster and Bionic Commando being the most present in this game.  Players take on the role of a scientist name Trace who is transported to another world where he has to fight aliens from a genocidal madman.  The story is enjoyable and has some interesting twists that players will be fond to uncover as they explore the Sudran (the alien world).   Gameplay is typical fair of shooting aliens and grabbing loot.  Bosses are few and far between but when you fight them they are enjoyable as you attempt to exploit their various weakness.  For me, the gameplay is at its best when it is working in favor of the player,  Nevertheless, there are some fundamental problems that hurt the game from greatness.  The biggest criticism I have with this game is the lack of direction and the game leaning too far into exploration.  The game never tells you were to go next and many areas are blocked off by upgrades that you need.  The problem here is that while there is an option to place markers on the map you are limited to only two and with a vast space it is easy to get lost.  Worst is the map is unclear on what is a wall or not.  What I mean buy that is certain areas through the game where it appear that is more rooms to explore don't .  This was annoying that several times I had to go onto a walkthrough just to find the next area or where to go next.  When one my first playthrough I have to resort to that level of assistance then there is a problem in the overall design of the game.  In conclusion, this game is fun when it works (the shooting and boss fights), but with madden level design, a poor map and lack of direction hurts the game in the long run and makes it less enjoyable overall.
Date 2021-07-02 Playtime 43h 47m Rec Positive Amazing game, already played through it twice (once on normal, once on hard), and plan to play through a third time- it's my top favourite, right up there alongside Hollow Knight- which is how I found out about it, via seeking games similar. Def worth buying.
Date 2021-07-02 Playtime 18h 58m Rec Positive fun metroidvania with a nice soundtrack.  in depth lore and story that you can immerse yourself in as much or as little as you would like.
Date 2021-07-02 Playtime 11h 46m Rec Positive Fun game with lots of weapons, nice music too. Wasn't too difficult but I did have some trouble with a couple of bosses, specifically the last boss. The game has a lot of backtracking and outside of the 'head train' that can transport you to points on the map it can be very tedious. You may have to use a walk through later in the game as it can get really confusing on where you have to go.   Otherwise, it was a good game and I'm excited for the sequel.

Date 2021-07-01 Playtime 16h 11m Rec Positive Questo titolo è una perla. Un sentito grazie all'autore (unico sviluppatore dell'opera) che da solo è riuscito a rimandarmi nel pieno degli anni 80/90. In pieno stile Metroid, l'avventura non è mai frustrante con un backtraking a mio avviso ben gestito. Ambientazioni e colonna sonora sempre al top. Ottima longevità (finito in 14 ore trovando circa il 70% degli oggetti ed esplorando circa il 90% della mappa).
Date 2021-07-01 Playtime 7h 29m Rec Negative Metroidvanais are one of my favorite games to play. I wanted to like this game and I did at first. But no indication of where to go next, long sections that lead you to a dead end or nothing because you don't have a particular item so you have to trudge all the way back, backtracking all over the place without a clue what to do, enemies that dive at you from off screen along with some enemies that take off way too much hp, way too many weapons, and the half baked fast travel system completely destroys it.  The graphics, controls and soundtrack are all top notch but the more I played the game the more I hated it.
Date 2021-06-30 Playtime 11h 43m Rec Positive Good simple fun. Although I got stuck a few times and wandered the entire map which was not exactly fun. I wish there was a fast travel system to make that process faster. Later in the game I was completely stuck and thought I had nowhere to go. I was about to give up but then I realized one of my abilities could work in a slightly different way that allowed me to reach an area that I assumed required something that I did not have. I suppose that's a common problem in these types of games but in this case I feel that the mechanic was not fully explained. I could do without the glitch mechanic personally since I don't think it adds much to the experience. There are quite a few weapons in the game and most of them I believe are pretty much inferior or useless compared to a select few.  In summary, the biggest flaw is how easy it is to miss areas and the need to backtrack looking for areas that you can now get to with your new abilities. That really cut down on the amount of fun gameplay that there is in the game. Many times I would see an area on the map that I didn't completely explore so I would backtrack there only to realize that I still didn't have the necessary ability to progress. Or worse - I didn't realize that my current abilities were enough to progress. The gameplay is good, the bosses are fun (wish there were more). Overall, it's good.
Date 2021-06-30 Playtime 11h 11m Rec Positive Metroidvania, retro graphics, perfect soundtrack, mystery plot and nice weapons/gadgets. Combination of everything creates a weird and peculiar atmosphere. The music is especially good. A great metroidvania.

Date 2021-06-28 Playtime 13h 41m Rec Positive 足够好的银河城游戏。但没有那么好，至少远没有部分评测吹得那么好。 ++枪很多很多，而且几乎都很有趣，有趣的枪基本都藏起来了，自己找找。 --跳跃高度不够直观，点名批评KUR区上层，不少平台之间的距离是刚刚好跳不过去需要用到钩爪的，但因为距离只差一点就容易让人以为能直接跳过去的结果就是直达底层重新跑一次。这点算是平台跳跃类游戏的基本功没做好了。 -说到钩爪，钩爪的设计思路很好，但操作上有点糟糕，我试过勾上墙壁后出现：左右键取消、B键取消、A键取消的情况，同时以上键都试过按下但没取消的情况。反正游戏到最后我只能确定B出勾爪，取消一直搞不懂。 其它部分就是一个合格的银河城游戏应该的，不加不减。 毕竟是多年前的游戏，而且像我上面说的有减分项，就不推荐全价了。但即使不是史低，只要是普通的打折也值得购买(写评测当前新史低)。
Date 2021-06-28 Playtime 15h 41m Rec Positive [h1]More Metroid than Castlevania[/h1]  [i]This is an early impression of Axiom Verge. I will do a full review after I beat the game.[/i]  Axiom Verge is a 2D platforming action exploration title, that bears close resemblance to the old 2D Metroid titles, and plays much like the same subgenre that was coined (but not born) in the wake of Symphony of the Night. The Metroidvania. You have all the usual tropes present. Start out with your basic arsenal, and explore to find and collect power ups to gain access to that area you saw before but could not reach. Find a weapon, and find that it is not only suitable as a tool for carnage, but also as a practical tool getting through barriers. Explore a massive map with interconnected areas. Yes, it's all here. Well, mostly. One of my biggest disappointment with the game is that there is a lack of a fast travel hubs. One of the major things about Metroidvanias is they involve backtracking. And while this was not a common thing in the oldest Metroidvania titles, it is pretty much a staple now. Such an odd omission. That said, the gameplay is spot on. Never did I feel at odds with the controls, and while some enemies felt tougher than others, none of them felt like they had artificial difficulty. That said though, another disappointment is that the bosses I have fought so far have been a bit on the easy side giving little to no problem.   One of the cool things about Axiom Verge is that the game has a really cool manipulator gun called the address disruptor. IT basically can "glitch" enemies, and change how they behave, or even change them entirely from being aggressive to something more helpful. Like turning a wall crawling laser shooting enemy into a friendly that kills other enemies, and may even blast holes in walls to open up hidden areas. This disruptor can also be used to create platforms, or break down barriers in different areas with "glitches". It's all around a pretty nifty little device. You also get other cool little gadgets, like the little headcrab looking drone that acts like a substitute for the spider-ball from Metroid, and more.   Visually the game is fine. More like Metroid rather than Super Metroid, but with 16-bit style visuals rather than the 8-bit that the original Metroid was on. It works fine, and will definitely spark that nostalgic feel. And on the audio side, I was pleasantly surprised with just how good this game sounds. Whether listening to it with my headphones, or even on a laptop, the sound effects and the music really pop.   As stated above, this is a first impression... I will write up a final review after I beat the game.   I purchased the game during the Steam 2021 Summer sale for $4.99, and honestly feel this game is worth even the full price of $19.99, especially for fans of Metroidvania titles, and especially for fans of the older 2D Metroid titles.
Date 2021-06-28 Playtime 7h 17m Rec Negative If you like backtracking and rerouting a lot, by all means buy this. There is a lot of/to love. I like the style, i am going to watch a playthrough for the story, but otherwise it's a chore. I don't like getting an upgrade and past a barrier just to meet the next barrier a couple steps later. after getting the upgraded ... depixelator(?) i had to stop (at yet another type of pixel static). The frustration far far far outweighs the fun with the upgrades which i also find rather underwhelming to begin with. The enemies seem designed to disincentivize engagement, keeping distance is the name of the game. Which makes traversing for me personally a pure chore. Paired with triple backtracking and bad orientation I had to turn it off every hour. The rudimentary 1 and 2 marker system that Ican only use in the respective room doesn't help me at all on the first playthrough, when i don't know what i'm looking for.
Date 2021-06-28 Playtime 9h 17m Rec Positive A good Metroidvania that feels like Metroid, but with WAY more weapons to find and use. Having beaten the game on hard difficulty, I would highly recommend playing normal on your first playthrough, as while the game overall is decent difficulty the final boss receives an insane difficulty spike (in my opinion) on hard. For proof note that less than 5% of players have done this, but I suppose that's part of the appeal.  tl;dr: Good medium length metroidvania, recommend playing on normal if you're looking to enjoy the hard parts of the game.
Date 2021-06-28 Playtime 18h 27m Rec Positive Fantastic game. I love the SNES graphics and the overall vibe is very Super Metroid
Date 2021-06-28 Playtime 21h 50m Rec Positive [b]“我是谁？我现在在哪？我特喵下一步要去哪里？”[/b]——《Axiom Verge》中的三大终极问题。  《Axiom Verge》是字面意义上的metroid-like，甚至连缺点也一并复刻了过来。比如场景更加阴间且单调、场景切换动画故作复古、boss全部大而化之为病原体感染的居民，基本没有让人印象深刻的存在、关键节点依然要按顺序攻略、电光索的手感配合与之对应的谜题几乎是噩梦、连超银的地图终端都没有继承下来。  和古早的metroid一样，除了最终boss房的位置会在流程中后期点明以外，游戏自始至终没有明确的目标，玩家会经常性的陷入迷路的窘境。但值得肯定的是，游戏的可探索的区域一直被控制地很好：  区域1ERIBU区域2ABSU的流程相对偏线性，初见可探索的区域占五成左右，剩下的会以各种方式被封死，它们提示着将来可能会获得的能力，留作日后回访时再做探索；而到了区域3ZI以后，玩家的退路会在第三个房间被彻底堵死，直到取得高跳前都无法前往之前的区域，这段时间玩家的活动范围被限制在了ZI和KUR中，有效防止了随着能力解锁造成可探索区域的井喷。在KUR后期取得勾爪以后，作为传送回廊的INDI被解锁。它以一种横向电梯的方式，联通着玩家曾经造访过的四个区域，以及未知的两个区域。  新区域往往需要新能力才能前往，再加之没有明确的提示，玩家会很自然而然地经由INDI返回最左侧的出身地图，一路将前之前未能造访的区域一一探索一遍。即使你真的迷路了，在跌跌撞撞探索的过程中，你总能在海量隐藏要素中找到一些时髦的小玩意。而关键的节点大多有明确的地标或者多个同门槛的入口，你在探索的过程中可以很自然地回到正轨上。事实上在同类中能学到这种润物细无声的引导的并不多。  到目前为止，Axiom verge仍然停留在对经典的临摹上，而glitch gun这一设定则让游戏在一众metroidvania中脱颖而出。  它在游戏内的描述是"Corrupts or de-corrupts weaker blocks and enemies."——损毁或复原方块和敌人。落实到可玩性是则是地形改造和形态切换。这一点和guacamelee有一点相似，只不过guacemelee是全局的表里世界转换，围绕这一转化设计了大量的跳跳乐和清版战斗。Axiom Verge中更注重局部的变化，而且地形改造的数量不多，主要聚焦于敌人的形态变换，以及由形态变换衍生出的战斗和解谜。  举几个例子：  Scissorbwaks在形态切换后会在移动时拖曳出长长的移动平台，开辟出新的移动路径；以Hive为代表的刷怪点转而产生源源不断的血包；以flying krill为代表的空中怪物会成为新的跳跃平台；巨型Greenworm可以转而破坏场景内的隐藏墙壁；紫色哨兵会在房间切换以后出现在场景中的同一个位置；T型哨兵会直接受玩家控制等等。  而游戏中后期较为隐藏的位置都与这些性质相关。  你能够想象的出来如果这些要素两两组合能做出多复杂的解谜关卡，但可惜的是，这些内容基本没有两两组合起来，甚至单个创意都用的很少。游戏内大多数房间中的战斗主要还是围绕各个不同的武器设计——有相应的武器会更加便捷，但没有也没关系，反正可以用小机器人莽。再加上boss战普遍偏差，关卡设计上的短板很大程度上拖累了整个metroidvania的反馈循环，探索得到的反馈大打折扣。而原本用来避免因为数值过高造成探索脱敏的剧情碎片，由于过于云里雾里并没有承担起本来的职责。  除此之外： -还是要提一嘴boss战真的是软肋，但作者显然也意识到了这点，流程中期以后有纯演甚至可以直接绕过的boss。 -隐藏要素多虽然是好事，但涉及到勾爪的大多都很阴间，如果要和闪现组合在一起那就更阴间了； -资源管理出了问题，无限续航的小机器人由于过于强力连boss房都进不了； -剧情有些意犹未尽，或者说就是未尽……权当给续作挖坑吧； -既然有这么多全收集成就，通关后在区域小地图给个百分比不过分吧：（  8.4/10:童年修正主义类独立游戏，不仅仅停留在临摹经典的阶段，还试图引入了glitch gun和密码板在探索上做出了自己的特色。但受制于个人作品的原因，很多地方不尽人意。二代未来可期。

Date 2021-06-27 Playtime 9h 42m Rec Positive [h1]Recommendation: Only buy in sale![/h1]  [b]Decent[/b] little game. Overall I had fun playing it but because steam only allows positive or negativ I wanna give some some cons which annoyed me: - sometimes long backtracking (if you are not quite sure where to go or haven't uncovered the whole map). - Bosses are mediocre. Most of them do not really have any mechanics and some of them can just be face-tanked. Never took me longer than 3 tries... - you have a shit ton of weapons but only use like 3-5 at max.  - I personally didn't enjoy the music, even found it annoying in some places.  - The sound mix in general could be improved. Some explosion blow your ears out, while you can't hear other things.   Took me around 8 hours which felt not too long or too short.

A lot of people refers too this as a Metroidvania...?

Date 2021-06-23 Playtime 8h 3m Rec Positive A metroid homage that leans hard into the HR Geiger angle, and that varies the formula in satisfying ways, Axiom Verge is good.  It's got a few weak points. Some powerups (grapple and dash) feel a little bit janky to use. The map is a typical metroidvania map, and tells you as little as possible while also being kind of clunky to navigate.  However, the rest of the game is extremely strong. The action feels fun. The soundtrack bumps. The writing is great (although it veers into post-human existential horror, which may not be your thing.)  Even subtle stuff like atmospheric storytelling and the flow of boss fights, Axiom Verge nails.  If you have any nostalgia for the original metroid, this is a gem.
Date 2021-06-23 Playtime 20h 43m Rec Positive Something about this game just... gets me going man  The sense of exploration, the feeling that every item you come across tastes like golden side quests makes my day every time. Of course, some items are essential for your progress, but they're also kinda scattered like the rest. There's no order, there's just stimulus for you to explore the absolute wonderful mess of a place that the environment is.   Speaking of the environment, that's definitely what I loved the most about this game. It is not often I see a game make use of the extraterrestrial alien theme with so much abstraction involved and making it turn out so beautifully. The creepy music, the unknown moving walls and ever-changing background. The enemies whose shape is just entirely abstract, all of this make up for an atmosphere that, OH MY GOD IT'S SO GOOD AND I LOVE IT.  If you can relate to this in any way, please do go ahead and get this game for yourself. For those that do not enjoy this type of ambience, this may feel like just an average metroid-like with cool lore.
Date 2021-06-22 Playtime 8h 8m Rec Negative I really really wanted to like this game but as far as metroidvania's go this one was one of my biggest disappointments. clunky controls. i swear to god i just cheesed one of the bosses because i legit didnt know how to do damage. lots of backtracking. navigation does not flow very well at all. overall i would still give it a 6/10
Date 2021-06-19 Playtime 11h 39m Rec Negative Wanted to love this game since I usually like Metroidvanias, but there's a lot in the way here. Combat is tedious and unsatisfying most of the time, and bosses are either laughably easy or ridiculously hard. The number of different weapons you get is somewhat overwhelming, especially since most of them are near useless.   The art and music are both great - but it can sometimes be hard to tell a foreground sprite from a background one. Some areas are just hard to look at/parse what's there. I'm hopeful that the sequel can address some of these issues, I think there can be something great here.

Date 2021-06-18 Playtime 9h 36m Rec Positive There are only two ways I can distinguish Axiom Verge from Super Metroid. 1) The player character doesn't do frontflips when he jumps and 2) He doesn't turn into a ball when you press down-down. Were it not for that, you could tell me this was a Super Metroid ROMhack and I would believe you.  And since Super Metroid was (and still is) one of the best dang games of all time, it stands to reason that something sufficiently similar is also pretty dang good.
Date 2021-06-17 Playtime 0h 41m Rec Negative I try to be charitable with new games, especially when I'm really hoping they'll scratch an itch for me. But there's just nothing to keep me playing this one. The game is so amateurishly irritating in so many small, stupid ways that I just can't bring myself to go and bash my head against it any longer.  First of all, don't be fooled by the game's aesthetics- the gameplay is less Metroid and more Cave Story. I mean that it wants to hurt you and challenge you more than it wants to engage your curiosity and make you explore. Now, I love Cave Story to death, but it's a frustrating game. If it didn't have charm and compelling mystery to it, I would never have played through it. Axiom Verge, despite already being more frustrating than Cave Story, has yet to offer me either of those things. Instead, I've been shown an intro cutscene that was so vague it borders on meaningless, and I've been given a hero who, despite having actual dialogue, is as flat and boring as a cardboard cutout. (He doesn't even look interesting! He's literally just some guy in a t-shirt!) There's been no hook of any kind.  And the thing that really irritates me is that this game just doesn't seem to understand its own genre. Environmental storytelling? No, have a bunch of inscrutable weirdness that fails to intrigue. Interested in that new gun you just picked up? Well, that's too bad, because it's worthless against all the enemies in the next segment. Want to feel rewarded for exploring side passages? No, there is nothing waiting for you except doors you can't go through yet. I didn't find any kind of reward for exploration until I'd already beaten the first boss, and it was (ostensibly) just an increase to projectile size. I couldn't tell the difference.  Truthfully, though, the game just fails to be interesting. I can't think of anything more damning than that.

Date 2021-06-15 Playtime 19h 55m Rec Positive Para quem é fã da série Metroid (eu por exemplo considero o Super Metroid como um dos 100 melhores jogos de todos os tempos), Axiom Verge é um jogo obrigatório. Gráficos retrô, mas muito bonitos, som que combina com a atmosfera do jogo, jogabilidade fantástica e diversão do outro mundo (literalmente!). A mecânica do drone remoto é muito interessante. Realmente me surpreendeu. O enredo também é muito bom e é impressionante saber que esse jogo foi desenvolvido por uma única pessoa. Um trabalho de gênio. A única coisa que eu senti falta foi um upgrade de dash. Pelo menos eu não consegui. Mas nada que prejudique o jogo. Todo fã de Metroid deveria jogar Axiom Verge. Jogaço. E que venha o 2. Nota 9,0.

Date 2021-06-07 Playtime 27h 41m Rec Positive Among the vast catalog of metroidvania titles available on the market, "Axiom Verge" easily stands out for anyone looking for an experience similar to that provided by the popular Nintendo franchise. But despite its assumed influence, did Thomas Happ manage to deliver a game capable of standing out on its own ?  - Graphism - The 8-bit aesthetic shows an incredible amount of details and is served by an inspired, disturbing but also fascinating, art direction. However, what truly stands out are the various visual and glitched effects you'll have to venture through or use at your advantage during your journey in this hostile place.  - Gameplay - A huge collection of weapons and tools are at your disposal to help you explore the world in which you are trapped. Controls are responsive and most of your arsenal works as you'd expect. The lack of clues and basic map design can sometimes make it unclear where your next objective is supposed to be.  - Story - The plot starts intriguing, then quickly becomes confusing because of the complex perception of reality concepts it tries to tackle. Thankfully, most of it only is developped through collectable logs and watching the cutscenes is more than sufficient to give you the bare minimum in term of context.  - Sound - Sound effects are subtly compressed to infuse them with an sweet dose of nostalgia, reminiscent of old school games. The soundtrack has a strong emphasis on vintage synth sounds and succeeds in finding its own identity, even though the tracks often lack the catchy melodies necessary to make them memorable.  - Replay Value - More than five hours should be necessary to complete your adventure and collect everything on your way. The achievements will push you to start at least two new games and get you familiar with everything this entry has to offer. After that, the recently added item randomizer might make you come back for more.  Without a doubt, "Axiom Verge" is the closest thing you can find that looks and plays like the very first "Metroid" game. It's also a solid entry in the genre, though it lacks the quality of life improvements standarized by its highly praised competitors and its story can be disapointingly unclear for most players.
Date 2021-06-07 Playtime 30h 32m Rec Positive Like: theme, visuals, soundtrack. Dislike: huge amount of backtracking, find-a-cheat-spot bosses, disappointing finale.
Date 2021-06-07 Playtime 13h 34m Rec Positive Nice Metroidvania, has a decent plot, a bit spooky and alien even for the genre. Overall worth playing.
Date 2021-06-07 Playtime 30h 11m Rec Positive One of the best retro-style metroidvania games out there! An actual masterpiece, done pretty much by a single person, Tom Happ, who sing;e-handedly coded this game and also created its art & music. Axiom Verge is strongly influenced by Supermetroid while adding a lot of unique and interesting gameplay mechanics to the classic formula. Plot and game work in general are very fascinating and keep you intrigued right until the final moment.  Technically, there's absolutely nothing to complain about. The game run smooth, controls are tight and responsive and there are no bugs or issues to mention.  Visually, AV is pretty much what you expect from a retro-style pixelart game, with art style reminiscent of Super Nintendo games(obviously, Super Metroid being a big influence). And while I wouldn't call this game stunningly beautiful, it is certainly a nice looker if you're into classic pixelart.  Music is, expectedly, composed as chiptune tracks, similarly mimicking the style of si-fi game soundtracks of SNes era. And despite its retro-style nature, AV's music manages to set the atmosphere just right, be it an uplifting tune of the sunlit plains, grim droning sound of the dark caves or a menacing music foreshadowing a boss encounter. Sounds are also inspired by SNes platformers and are very fitting for the overall game aesthetics.  All in all, a game well worth playing.
Date 2021-06-06 Playtime 10h 8m Rec Positive It's "metroid-vania" at its finest.
Date 2021-06-05 Playtime 10h 54m Rec Positive Metroidvania seviyosanız öneirirm. Sevmiyosanız da öneririm. Deneyin nolur sanki.
Date 2021-06-04 Playtime 3h 50m Rec Negative Just can't see myself ever recommending this game to anyone. The combat is so tedious. Every boss fight so far has just been stand in this one ideal spot and shoot and jump without any horizontal movement. And I felt punished for backtracking because it meant I had to fight the extremely tedious enemies with my garbage weapons.
Date 2021-05-31 Playtime 14h 53m Rec Positive Compelling story, smooth controls, very atmospheric and well-designed levels.  An excellent metroidvania, totally worth your time and money.
Date 2021-05-31 Playtime 17h 22m Rec Positive A really amazing Metroidvania. With a good soundtrack.
Date 2021-05-30 Playtime 13h 29m Rec Positive Mettez le manga Blame et le jeu Metroid dans une pièce, donnez leur un peu de gingembre, mettez un peu de Barry White en fond sonore, laissez faire la nature, et vous obtenez Axiom Verge.
Date 2021-05-29 Playtime 18h 5m Rec Positive Surreal and highly nostalgic. The gameplay is also fine, while looking for secret passages is what I enjoyed the most.
Date 2021-05-28 Playtime 23h 30m Rec Positive Awesome game. Couldn't put it down 'till I beat it.
Date 2021-05-28 Playtime 8h 8m Rec Negative It's okay. Dowvoting to balance the rating which is definitely too high.  The devs of the game don't understand what makes Metroid-like games so successful: in a good Metroid-style game, the movement upgrades are integrated into the exploration of the world. You discover power-ups which were not anticipated, which suddenly open up a world of opportunity to explore rabbit holes that you previously abandoned, unsure of how to proceed.  In this game, the barriers that present themselves are obvious. It's like seeing coloured gates, and being able to anticipate coloured keys (powerups) to unlock them. The coloured keys offer no use outside of that specific function of getting through those gates. There is a single movement upgrade in this game which lets you get around quickly (drone teleportation) but that came about 30m before the final item, which is effectively the end of this game. Of course, this game drags on after the final upgrade, guess the devs don't realise that everything after that is just ceremony in these Metroid-style games.  The map is also pretty boring to explore, since dead ends present themselves quite quickly, with obvious 'coloured gates' as explained. Near the end of the game, you literally acquire a key which makes coloured blocks disappear. This key is fetched immediately after finding those blocks, and has no purpose except in that one area. So what the heck was the point of that powerup? May as well have used a switch like elsewhere in the game.  Enemies fall into one of two categories: a) easy but tedious. Shoot from a distance. Take way too long to kill. Repeat for 10-15 enemies per room. b) You cannot avoid their attacks because they move faster than you (by the way you never get a speed upgrade, just a high jump near the beginning of the game). These enemies you can't do anything except damage-boost through. Again boring, not challenging.  It's an okay game because there is still an exploration aspect, and because if you don't know that the upgrades you're going to find are going to be boring, then you still look forward to them. Now that you've read this review and know to be disappointed... not sure you could enjoy the game.  The game gives you plenty of gun types which are nothing but an annoyance, as they clutter your weapon selection menu. And to switch between these weapons you need to interrupt the game.  The narrative is not engaging.
Date 2021-05-27 Playtime 11h 8m Rec Positive If you like Super Metroid, this is a game for you
Date 2021-05-27 Playtime 24h 56m Rec Positive Do you like science fiction? Are you looking for one of the best metroidvanias of the last decade, and probably of all times? Wanna get a tasty dose of pixel graphics, excellent soundtrack and nonsensical 90's design? Then get this game, period.
Date 2021-05-26 Playtime 23h 20m Rec Positive si quieres recordar juegos de antaño como  Super Metroid o los castlevania este juego te dara varias horas de buena diversión no es tan difícil pero es te bueno
Date 2021-05-26 Playtime 14h 47m Rec Positive I think I already finish it 3 times, and now, after the documentary i replay it again
Date 2021-05-26 Playtime 27h 47m Rec Positive If you like metroidvanias, you'll probably enjoy this.  There is a good amount of challenge and all the required upgrades can be found with a little bit of exploration.  It's also nice that if you die, you don't lose any upgrades you picked up.  While the required powerups are easy enough to find, there are a few optional ones that are obtuse.  A couple require you to know how certain glitched enemies behave; one is vague, the other can be understood with a little observation.  However, there are also a few places where you'll need to know passcodes and the game can get pretty obscure with these.  The Passcode system is something that you can find, but it's never required to beat the game; in fact, its first impression indicates that it's for lore and easter eggs.  Still, the system could've been handled much better through visible passcode doors and better telegraphing.    For reference, I found about 90% of the pickups on my own the first time through.  I also would've liked to see a bestiary of enemies you've beaten that also shows what glitching them does after you've succeeded in doing so.  Having the map keep track of upgrades you've picked up would also be helpful to avoid unnecessary backtracking.  One last thing, try entering JUSTIN_BAILEY into the Passcode system when you're able.  It doesn't offer any advantages, but keep it active for the final boss fight as well.  You'll see why.
Date 2021-05-25 Playtime 57h 52m Rec Positive It's just really fun. Everything is working together: the controls, the art, the story, the atmosphere.
Date 2021-05-24 Playtime 10h 19m Rec Negative This game was okay, if you like metroid you'll find some enjoyment with this game. The game has some cool ideas, but is lacking overall. Pretty much all the bosses are able to be cheesed pretty easily. The music was good, but a tad repetitive for me. There were a few music tracks that were just down right annoying, but the ones that I thought were good wore on me pretty quickly. Most of the weapons don't feel like upgrades, and some are downright useless. The "dash" functionality being bound to a double tap of the d-pad ended up being pretty annoying especially later on in the game. I think the "drill" tool should have been removed in favor of having a dedicated dash button. Overall, this game was kind of a middling experience for me. I don’t know that I would really recommend it to anyone, but if you really love metroid type games give it a shot.
Date 2021-05-22 Playtime 525h 42m Rec Positive If you're looking for a Metroidvania that's more on the Metroid side, this is the right game for you. A damn solid action platformer with secrets hidden all over and a story worth digging into.
Date 2021-05-21 Playtime 8h 59m Rec Positive Duas coisas meio ruins nesse jogo: a música, chega uma hora que enche o saco e o final boss, é muito fácil se você pegar uma certa arma... Porém, a jogabilidade, quantidade de armas, power-ups e gadgets foi uma surpresa para mim, tem uma quantidade absurda! Vale muito a pena o jogo.
Date 2021-05-21 Playtime 24h 0m Rec Positive Wanna get completely LOST and have not a single clue of where to go? All that while being haunted by some CREEPY ASS music and beyond weird enemies? PLUS an ULTRA complex lore told in a very shady way, divided in non linear CRUMBS around the map?  This game if for you.
Date 2021-05-18 Playtime 15h 29m Rec Positive This game is a love letter to Metroid. It really brings back memories, and even improves on the formula! Seriously, even some of the music sounds like it was inspired by Metroid, and one of the classic Metroid cheat codes works here (once you find the appropriate item)! And there are some really neat gimmicks like the weapon that "hacks" enemies and terrain into more advantageous configurations. I also like how when you die, you aren't taken back to your last save - rather, the game saves automatically and returns you to the location at which you had most recently saved, sort of like Dragon Quest. The difference being that you get to keep any found items, map exploration, and defeated bosses that you might have earned since you saved. That really cuts down on the frustration and encourages exploration! So yeah, this is a great game and I regret not picking it up sooner!
Date 2021-05-15 Playtime 6h 35m Rec Positive Un gran juego que recae gran parte de su carisma en su excentrico pixel art, grandisima ost y look retro que hacer recordar a los primeros Metroid con plataformas verticales.  Si eres un amante del género, es un must a tener ya que realiza de gran manera las mécanicas esperables de un metroidvania. Por decir algo negativo, tanto power-up se hace redundante o hacen menos a otros. Ya cuando tomas el hilo sabes cuales te servirán sí o sí y cuales son algo de relleno, aunque esto solo pasa para los power-up de algunas armas.

Date 2021-05-09 Playtime 16h 29m Rec Positive Artstyle is great that why I bought it I personaly did t like it.
Date 2021-05-09 Playtime 43h 3m Rec Positive Ive played metroid games since I was a kid back in the early 90s. Axiom Verge takes that genre and gives it a fresh new feeling. Not only is the game play and mechanics on point but the story is equally fulfilling and deep, keeping you wanting more. Cant wait for part 2.
Date 2021-05-08 Playtime 17h 18m Rec Positive Faithful Metroidvania. If you like the genre you know what you're in for.  Music is good, a little too catchy though. I noticed that the tracks would play in my mind on repeat as I would try to sleep at night. I don't know if that means the music is good or bad, ultimately. I liked it so much I had to turn it down?
Date 2021-05-06 Playtime 22h 3m Rec Negative Story and character development (or lack thereof) frustrated me. I found myself playing more out of a desperate hope that the story would turn out more satisfying than I feared it would; I am sad to say my fears had more accurately predicted how things would go.  The main character's ever-present irritated chip-on-his-shoulder personality was hard to tolerate. I say this guessing that if I were to find myself in a deadly alien environment and at the center of some multi-verse plot, I too would be overwhelmingly irritated (alongside waves of utter terror), but it did sour some of the "fun" I was looking for in playing the game.  From a sensory standpoint, a surprising negative for me was how unpleasant many of the sound effects and action feedback was. The drill felt like fingernails on a chalkboard to me... a power-up that I found I was needing to use to test every wall for secrets, which meant a lot of the game was played with a near-constant sensory irritation. The glitchy visual effects for some game mechanics and the CRT-fuzzy secret areas were often a visual version of that nails-on-chalkboard unpleasantness. Might not bother everyone, but very much bothered me.  I also echo what other reviewers have brought up, that the environments lack enough unique characterization to make them memorable. They are all "hostile or strange alien landscape," with different color schemes and different flora/fauna designs, certainly. But they all seem to blur together as "more alien planet landscape." The music is by far the most evocative of each section's individuality, and one of the most enjoyable sensory experiences of the game. However, the music doesn't feel especially "connected" to specific areas--I felt a bit like I could put the soundtrack on shuffle, regardless of which area I was in at the time.
Date 2021-05-05 Playtime 29h 26m Rec Positive great if you like metroid and hate your eyes
Date 2021-05-05 Playtime 19h 6m Rec Positive [h1] This is an amazing game. [/h1]  Everyone should pick this one up. The part where you end up fighting [spoiler] yourself, as a spaceship, as the bad guy [/spoiler] was completely mind blowing. The powerups are insane, weapons are fun to use, and there are good rewards for exploring and finding the secret areas.
Date 2021-05-03 Playtime 36h 36m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvanias out there
Date 2021-05-03 Playtime 12h 54m Rec Positive Excellent Metroidvania game! Well worth it! 
Date 2021-05-02 Playtime 74h 48m Rec Positive Pixeled Metroidvania goodness leaning more on the side of Metriod goodness.  Needs a sequel.
Date 2021-05-02 Playtime 19h 11m Rec Positive Very nice metroidvenia. This game brings back a great metroid feeling and at the same time it is very unique. Great soundtrack. I had some hard time with the difficulty, but i made it through.
Date 2021-04-30 Playtime 27h 5m Rec Positive Metroidvania done right! The 16-bit aesthetic is excellent and the music is very fitting to the atmosphere of the levels. This is definitely on my ever growing list of 'Games I Must Finish'
Date 2021-04-29 Playtime 9h 11m Rec Negative Sadly did not live up to my expectations. Perhaps they were simply too high. This game feels clunky and visually confusing. Getting an upgrade should make me excited - not annoyed at having to use some downright  bothersome mechanics for the upcoming stages. I won't be picking up the sequel, sadly.
Date 2021-04-29 Playtime 17h 15m Rec Positive I've always been nostalgic about Metroid even though I was awful at it. I didn't have an NES back in the day, but there was a multi-game arcade machine in a local pizza parlor that had it, and I spent tons of quarters on it. This brings back all those memories and more. The soundtrack is like the old Metroid one on steroids -- the game play is addictive and fun.  What I really like is that it's hard, but not unfairly so. The 3 bosses I've fought have been really easy once you figure out their patterns, which is saying a lot considering how much I usually suck at boss fights.  The visuals are really trippy too. It's basically like Metroid on acid. That's the best I can describe it.
Date 2021-04-28 Playtime 11h 59m Rec Positive Very sweet little game that was obviously built on pure affection for old school Metroidvania style games. Great art style, excellent soundtrack. Certainly worth a buy; if not at full price then certainly on sale
Date 2021-04-27 Playtime 95h 42m Rec Positive Good game.
Date 2021-04-27 Playtime 20h 38m Rec Positive Great game! Just love it! Very good story. Intresting world with lots of secrets and possibilities. Amazing music.  It is probably the best metroidvania on steam.
Date 2021-04-26 Playtime 2h 35m Rec Positive メトロヴァニアをプレイしたい人には おすすめできるゲーム。 とても楽しい。
Date 2021-04-25 Playtime 19h 4m Rec Positive One of the best games I've ever played.
Date 2021-04-25 Playtime 24h 47m Rec Positive  Great and unique power ups, creepy music and atmosphere. A must play for metroidvania fans.
Date 2021-04-24 Playtime 10h 0m Rec Negative Starts out as a decent platformer, but as you progress through the game it gets worse and worse in pretty much every aspect: the writing, the music, and especially the gameplay.  Axiom Verge has some of the worst boss/enemy/level design I've ever seen in any video game. Enemies that get stuck inside you, enemies that attack you from inside the walls, enemies that fly at you from off-screen, enemies whose attacks are impossible to dodge — many the most annoying archetypes are present here. The bosses are all massive damage sponges and are super repetitive, each one forcing you to figure out a tactic and then spam it over the course of what feels like 20-30 cycles. The combat becomes super tedious towards the end, making every room a chore to clear.  The only redeeming feature about the gameplay is that the controls are very tight and responsive... until you get the dash ability, that is. I don't know why they thought double-tapping a direction to dash would be a good idea, but it's the complete opposite of that. The character just ends up dashing all over the place when you don't want him to, not dashing when you do, and dashing in the wrong direction 50% of the time. All of this wouldn't be too much of a problem if the game didn't rely on this mechanic so much after it's introduced.  Axiom Verge is a game that promises a lot but suffers from some very confusing game design decisions, as well as a lack of personality. I'm a huge Metroid fan, Super Metroid being my favorite video game of all time. Unfortunately, this game seems to borrow too much of what held those games back, and not enough of what made them good.  Edit: I'll give this game another try sometime in the future and update the review accordingly, but for now all of my points stand.
Date 2021-04-24 Playtime 33h 6m Rec Positive What to say about this game that has not been said already. It's an amazing piece of art, addictive, to the point that is infuriating that Tom Happ didn't hide more stuff along the levels to keep playing forever. The music is the perfect match for the art and playability. It felt like going back in time to play a console game again. Beware, this game does not hold your hand, but that's one of the things I like more. A perfect scifi game.
Date 2021-04-23 Playtime 47h 47m Rec Positive Jogo excepcional, que traz uma proposta semelhante à da série Metroid clássica, mas com novas mecânicas e uma história bastante interessante. Os gráficos são muito bons e a música é fantástica, imersiva e bem encaixada.   As áreas do jogo são bem distintas e a ideia de ter que voltar nelas após conseguir um novo upgrade garante uma exploração completa do cenário, especialmente para procurar os muitos itens secretos, que incentivam a fazer o 100%.  A curva de dificuldade é muito boa e garante o jogador a desenvolver novas estratégias para passar pelas áreas, e o final do jogo é intrigante e fascinante.  O fato do jogo inteiro ter sido feito por uma só pessoa aumenta o brilho dele, e mostra como jogos de plataforma podem continuar sendo instigantes e inovadores. Altamente recomendado!
Date 2021-04-23 Playtime 15h 45m Rec Positive bon metroid like, bonne durée de vie pour ce style de jeu
Date 2021-04-22 Playtime 24h 0m Rec Positive A bit slow to pick up but when you get in the loop it is a fine metroidvania
Date 2021-04-22 Playtime 33h 43m Rec Positive Really fun Metroidvania with an interesting cyclical narrative.
Date 2021-04-22 Playtime 42h 46m Rec Positive +++++++++++; боссы смешные)
Date 2021-04-22 Playtime 11h 29m Rec Positive I went in not expecting much, but I was blown away.   Pros: Too many Cons: There's a lot of weapon variety, but most are bad. I ended up using ~5 out of the... ~20? Once I got the end game flamethrower, there was no point in using anything else. The grapple got phased out way too fast. It might as well not even be in the game. Needs better fast travel, getting to the center area takes too long, and once you're there it still takes too long riding the giant head.
Date 2021-04-20 Playtime 1h 7m Rec Positive Pretty cool Metroidvania. Didn't really continue it because I wasn't really in the mood for an oldschool metroidvania, but I can tell its a nice game. It really brings me memories from Metroid, it has some neat weapons and upgrades and what seems like a hooking plot.
Date 2021-04-18 Playtime 11h 23m Rec Positive One of the best platformers I've played in a long time.
Date 2021-04-18 Playtime 5h 34m Rec Negative Constantly don't know where I should be going, game seems bugged so that I turn invisible for about 1.5 sec every time I get damaged which is annoying, movement mechanics aren't that enjoyable. I usually really enjoy Metroidvanias, but this one has all the annoying aspects of them that I don't like so I stopped playing.  All the other aspects are pretty good though, and it's really neat to see a game made by one person entirely.
Date 2021-04-16 Playtime 24h 2m Rec Positive I have very fond memories of this game. It's a beast of a metroidvania with an interesting art style, engaging bosses and an epic story. Weapons and upgrades feel meaningful in most cases and while the game has its quirks, I absolutely recommend it.
Date 2021-04-16 Playtime 17h 33m Rec Positive this is a great metroidvania that i recommend to everyone i cannot wait for the second one to come out as i have gone through this game on multiple platforms.
Date 2021-04-16 Playtime 22h 43m Rec Positive This was a solid gaming experience. The pixel graphics are amazingly clean and the art style is beautifully dark - although the color palette can sometimes get repetitive and drab, it's solid enough overall that this isn't a huge issue. The gameplay is super smooth and straightforward. I had to do a lot of backtracking, but the fast travel system helps with that significantly. The abilities are really fun to use - yes, even the teleport dash, despite its unorthodox controls - and so are the weapons, although I do think the game has more weapons than the player will ever seriously use. I only ended up using five or six different weapons throughout the whole game. The story is great, too; it feels a bit short, but none of it is overly cliched or obscure, and its tone is just heavy enough to emphasize the game's atmosphere without being so depressing that you despair for a happy ending.   Speaking of endings: medium spoilers for the final boss and ending.  I liked the concept of the final boss. Anyone who's played the game probably knew who the boss was going to be about halfway into the game, and the character works very well as said final boss. However, I don't think the actual fight was executed very well. It's extremely repetitive and uninspired, and because of that it feels less like a fight and more like an execution. With some weapons, the fight is incredibly annoying. With others, it's a joke. I didn't enjoy it at all, and it ruined a lot of the buildup in the late game. I DID like the ending to the story, however, and I can't wait to see how that plays into the sequel.  Overall, if you're looking for a game in the style of a classic metroidvania, this is the game for you. Just bear in mind that most of the fun will come from the exploration and not the boss combat.
Date 2021-04-16 Playtime 58h 25m Rec Positive Buen juego, si le gustan los metroidvanias, y no son el tipo de jugadores que le importan muchos las graficas, es una compra segura, buena jugabilidad, buen camino de progreso y una buena difilcultad, muy recomendable
Date 2021-04-16 Playtime 14h 36m Rec Negative The atmosphere is creepy and mysterious, a lot is left for the imagination. Because of this, the first hour of the game feels exquisite. Then, it slowly goes downhill as you can't figure out where to go, with nothing to help you get back on the right track if you're lost. I spent over an hour backtracking, trying to find where to go next because I couldn't jump over "that" ledge (you know which ledge, once you played).  Your weapon arsenal is, to be honest, excessive; you'll likely be rotating between 3 weapons and never using certain weapons that you just discovered since they either have very niche uses, boring to use, or are severely under powered (which is odd, considering new guns should feel exciting and refreshing).  I sped through the later half of the game to get it over with. I really had high hopes for the gameplay with the kick ass music, beautiful sprite-work, and lovely atmosphere. I'd only purchase this if it were on sale, sorry.
Date 2021-04-14 Playtime 11h 29m Rec Negative Too difficult to be fun.  A victim of the modern ego based video game craze.  I would even put it on easy to be able to play but there's no such option.  Enjoy keeping me, a veteran of the genre since Metroid away since my dexterity isn't what it used to be.  Make the difficulty of your game granular.  Basic enemies take forever to kill so navigating the rooms feels very slow and uninteresting to me.  I'm not sure why i don't see anyone else complaining about this, but It's not like I'm just terrible across the board at games.  This will go down as one of the larger gaming disappointments of my life.
Date 2021-04-13 Playtime 24h 24m Rec Positive [h2]More "Metroid" than "vania," Axiom Verge is a solid game developed by one man.[/h2]  This game was developed by just 1 guy and is a love letter to Super Metroid, and it isn't as deep as many other modern indie metroidvanias (it's also way more Metroid than "vania"), but it's among those titles that masterfully revisited the genre and helped spark more popular interest in the genre within the industry; it also draws in-world inspiration from classics like System Shock and H.R. Giger's art.  Axiom Verge throws the player in control of Trace, a scientist that gets stuck in a strange, digital alien-like world (which features some really nice concept and overall design). From there on it's your usual metroidvania (or Metroid in this case) where you need to explore, fight, and backtrack. But there's always something driving you on, be the mystery of the story, the enthralling alien atmosphere, or a platform up there that you now need to figure out how to get to.  The OST is my favorite part about Axiom Verge, it's retro cyber and sort of psychodelic; it keeps the player immersed in this strange world they're thrown in. No matter where, the OST was always a big part of my enjoyment of Axiom Verge. Thomas Happ made the OST all in MIDI. The soundtrack is not only my favorite part of the game, but it's incredibly well done, different and catchy.  Pixel art is well crafted and Axiom Verge features some interesting creature design, including Elsenova (who is featured in the cover art), and a plethora of other beings akin to her that share her features. It also has some mild body horror elements that are tied to upgrades and certain areas/monsters. A large part of the game's areas have that "organic structure" style of design.  Now for the flaws; the biggest flaws in Axiom Verge is that the area traversal can get too repetitive and the difficulty is also a bit inconsistent and jumps or plummets more often than not; first 3 areas everything is basically static and then from there on the whole world universe is out for you and you're fighting armored enemies with boulders rolling at you. It's an abrupt change in difficulty. Another issue is that despite how many guns you can acquire, you'll only be using 1 or 2 and the rest feel useless; they could've been balanced better. Another thing that bothered me was how the map blends into the background excessively in some parts; it puts more strain on the eyes.  Overall Axiom Verge is a good game, and although some of its game design choices could've been more up with the times, it's a fun Metroid-like experience that is well worth one -or several playthroughs.
Date 2021-04-12 Playtime 17h 7m Rec Positive Estilo de jogo plataforma, onde você vai obtendo mais habilidades, conseguindo destravar áreas que antes não conseguia. Lembra um pouco o estilo de jogo de Shovel Knight. Quando achei que ia zerar, que nada, tem mais jogo. Achei que seria curto, felizmente me enganei. Vale pegando alguma promoção.

Date 2021-04-09 Playtime 57h 38m Rec Positive Amazing Gameplay and Excellent storyline! 10/10
Date 2021-04-08 Playtime 10h 21m Rec Negative Axiom Verge is a love letter to the original Metroid, in both the good and bad ways. It's story is decent, with some good gameplay ideas, but the bland visuals and poor movement don't amount to very much.
Date 2021-04-05 Playtime 76h 39m Rec Positive Extremely Yes.
Date 2021-04-04 Playtime 12h 55m Rec Negative Well made game, but kind of gets annoying as the player makes progress. Kind of monotonous and progress and direction are kind of vague. This is a good game though, but maybe not 23$ good.

Date 2021-04-02 Playtime 13h 2m Rec Positive A great Metroidvania that leans heavily on Super Metroid aesthetics and gamefeel, but still brings its own welcome twists to the formula. With some genuinely disturbing boss designs, atmospheric exploration and environments, and a variety of fun beam weapons to use, Axiom Verge is short but makes full use of its mechanics to tell an interesting story
Date 2021-04-02 Playtime 19h 49m Rec Positive Good game if you like Metroidvanias.  Has some minor flaws but nothing that really takes away from the gameplay.
Date 2021-04-02 Playtime 1h 13m Rec Positive Highly recommend. I won this game in a giveaway and while I usually don't like platformers that much, I'm enjoying myself. It's fun to explore and watch the story unfold in pieces.
Date 2021-04-02 Playtime 25h 4m Rec Positive 在愿望单里躺了近一年，实际入手才觉得物超所值。 整体来说就是银河战士，和恶魔城没啥关系。更加注重探索，弱化动作。 探索方面是我最满意的部分，每条死路都藏着一些小秘密，后面很多解谜脑洞挺有意思的。游戏内置地图标记功能，区域地图道具全开会有特殊标记，不看攻略也不会太麻烦。 战斗方面...其实非常拉胯，多数boss就2个攻击方式，后面几个boss和小怪甚至躲都没法躲只能硬拼血（不过后期多数时候都在跑酷）。 此外，游戏的剧情也非常有意思，收集齐文件里的内容会对主线有完全不同的理解，可惜只是单结局，主角也只能做个工具人。 要说最大缺点就是没有传送点吧，虽然后期游戏有个类似塞尔达风弹那样的快速移动手段，但中期要在几个地图间来回寻找新能力还是挺让人审美疲劳的。  
Date 2021-04-01 Playtime 16h 51m Rec Positive Tight controls, beautiful areas, fun platforming, and absolutely BANGING music. Must play if you like Metroidvanias

Date 2021-03-29 Playtime 12h 27m Rec Positive Reminds me a modern SNES Metroid game, I love Metroid :)
Date 2021-03-28 Playtime 9h 45m Rec Positive Everyone already knows this game is great by now but I absolutely love it. Does a really good job replicating the mystery that the first Metroid game presents.
Date 2021-03-28 Playtime 17h 1m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a fantastic Metroidvania game, which I cannot recommend enough. While yes, it's difficult, the game itself has such a rich diversity in weapons and gameplay options for movement. If you grew up playing Super Metroid and Metroid Zero Mission, you'll feel right at home here.  I advise that you play the game using a controller though, as the Keyboard controls are not all that intuitive.  Hands down the best Metroidvania on PC, next to the now almost impossible to get AM2R. If you missed out on the fanmade Metroid 2 Remake, this is as close to it as you're going to get. Much like all the Metroid Titles, the music in this game is PHENOMENAL (and available on Spotify), while the artstyle takes this very H.R Geiger Approach, with graphical glitches as an aesthetic choice, which makes it heavily stand out.  Again, I cannot recommend this game enough.
Date 2021-03-26 Playtime 15h 49m Rec Positive i absolutely love this game, it does everything perfectly
Date 2021-03-26 Playtime 13h 3m Rec Positive awesome 
Date 2021-03-25 Playtime 11h 57m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is one of the best Metroidvania’s I’ve played in a long time and was released in 2015. It has a great soundtrack that is a throwback to the SNES era, is full of secrets that keep you wanting to explore, has a killer plot with an amazing ending, hits the 16-bit atmosphere it sets out to emulate and has lots of nods to the Metroid series.  I think it does a better job of being like Super Metroid than Super Metroid does! I highly recommend it to everyone, and when you consider that one person was responsible for all of it, it shows that you don’t need an immense team to produce a great game.  The games story is one of its many highlights, and to have it explained before you experience it would be a travesty. The short of it is you play as the scientist Trace, and after a lab explosion awake in a new and unfamiliar world. You are guided by a mysterious voice in a hostile environment who helps you find a weapon, and guides you to where they are. Any more than that would start to ruin the multiple surprises, but the story twists and turns quite regularly, and as lots of the plot points are hidden away you need to do a fair bit of back tracking and exploring to flesh it out. I was thoroughly impressed where the game ended, and in a nod to Metroid, if you collect enough items in the game you unlock the true ending and turns it upon itself.  Gameplay is like most other Metroidvania’s, as you progress you unlock newer tools that expand more areas to explore. The game isn’t forgiving as you aren’t actually given any help in where you have to go or when you should backtrack (you’re on your own and the map wont mark secrets). Your character isn’t a super solider- a few hits from enemies is usually enough to kill you (unless you have all health upgrades) and you are rewarded for cautious gameplay, most of my deaths were from being over confident (or one particular late boss). The game isn’t completely unforgiving, if you take the time to explore and pick up the multitude of hidden weapons, upgrades and items and use them correctly you can make your life easier. Your abilities start out fairly weak, however by the end you can grapple along ceilings, dash through walls or drill through breakable bricks, jump higher, glitch areas or enemies and fire a drone off and control it. Most of these can be upgraded multiple times, which improves their functionality or range (many of the stronger versions of these are hidden pickups). Weapons are scattered around the maps (they can’t be upgraded) and they all have different uses and ranges, with some penetrating walls or objects. Weapon strength, range and additional life meters are all separate pickups that need to be found but make a huge difference. The game randomly hides 3 super weapons and the maps that spawn them are randomised every game.  For a game that’s emulating the 16bit era, the game does a lot with its graphics. There is plenty of variety in the environments with each area having a distinct feel that slowly bleeds into other areas, and it does an amazing job of hiding its secrets- nearly every map has some sort of hidden object in it and in most instances you wouldn’t know they are there (and if do you likely have no idea how to get to them). In a homage to Super Metroid there is even a sequence that changes an entire areas map after you have explored it to the boss (much like the ghost ship). Most of the areas are interconnected to each other (most areas have at least 3 connections), with one hub areas acting as quick passage between all of them. There is great diversity in enemies and their attack patterns, and glitch weapons double that (some enemies pump out health once glitched, others move slower, unlock secrets or become platforms you can stand on). Anything your character is wearing or currently has equipped is shown on screen. Bosses start out with basic attack patterns, and most of them don’t really progress past that or have a gimmick that makes it easier to dispose of them but some have difficulty spikes that are quite hard, even when fully upgraded.   The music is amazing and for those who like the retro style midi format of old Axiom Verge completely nails it. Its full of synth tracks, and has quite a few surprises. “The Axiom” track is tweaked into a new song at one point, and there is an excellent song with vocals that starts playing as you enter one of the areas that is unlike anything else you have heard in the game and makes you just stop what you are doing and listen. There is also a really good piano melody that meshes into the synth. Even better, the entire OST is available as DLC and I highly recommend the purchase.  While not offering a new game mode, there is plenty of replayability for those who like leaderboard challenges as you are given a final scorecard with a rating for finding secrets, total time played and total deaths, with categories for speed runners, 100% completion, no deaths and difficulty ratings.  If trying to get 100% achievements then you are likely going to be using a guide for all the collectables, as well as multiple runs for the different completion requirements you need to meet. While the game can be completed in under 4 hours, a full run when exploring everything will likely take around 12+.  For more reviews please visit https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31327216/
Date 2021-03-24 Playtime 12h 13m Rec Positive Great retrovania
Date 2021-03-23 Playtime 15h 38m Rec Positive Un des plus grands metroidvania indie à avoir vu le jour. Axiom verge propose l'exploration d'un monde vaste et étranger, poussé par des forces qui dépassent le joueur et laissent une sensation de malaise. Le jeu se prend en main facilement et les mécaniques innovantes permettent des puzzles parfois ardus. Une expérience incontournable.
Date 2021-03-23 Playtime 15h 8m Rec Positive Very simply, the game is heavily influenced by Super Metroid, and Metroidvania style. That is exactly why I LOVE this game. That feeling is the sensation of taking your first step into a foreign planet with no clue where you are and next to no protection. Your task is to find upgrades as you explore, and find a way to (possibly?) leave the place you stumbled upon. The story thus far is very intriguing, and very unique on its own. I cannot wait until the second installment finally lands on steam!
Date 2021-03-22 Playtime 10h 23m Rec Negative 'Inspired' doesn't mean having a mini-map as shitty as the thing inspiring you, this may sound like nitpiking but when an entire genre is built around exploring a map
Date 2021-03-22 Playtime 43h 26m Rec Positive its a pretty nice metroidvania, gets kinda tricky tho
Date 2021-03-21 Playtime 35h 27m Rec Positive Um dos melhores jogos que já tive o prazer de jogar! Aquele tipo de jogo desafiador, que te prende do começo ao fim. Esperando ansiosamente o lançamento de Axiom Verge 2.
Date 2021-03-21 Playtime 22h 10m Rec Positive Metroid-like. Ne me demandez pas l'histoire, je suis pas sûr d'avoir très bien compris. Une trip sur les mondes parallèles je crois.  + Les musiques, très bonnes pour du 8 bits. + L'univers chelou organo-mécanique. Bien plus glauque que celui d'un Metroid. + Level design plutôt bon quoique classique. On ne change pas une recette qui marche, celle des Metroid en l’occurrence, donc ça fonctionne mais ça manque de cachet. + Gameplay ultra précis et fluide. J'ai joué à la manette, on retrouve (encore) beaucoup de Metroid dedans, mais avec une plus forte gravité donc un contrôle plus fin. + Pleins d'armes différentes, genre une vingtaine. Elles ne sont pas toutes utiles, mais cette diversité dans l'arsenal est suffisamment rare dans un jeu du genre pour être notée. + Les upgrades de progression, vraiment originales. À chaque acquisition d'un nouveau pouvoir, je me disais "ouais cool, c'est bien trouvé ça!". + Pleins d'ennemis. Si c'est souvent juste un swap-color avec plus de PV, il y a quand même assez de variété pour faire bien plaisir. + Enfin la possibilité de poser un putain de marqueur sur la map, quand on repère un objet que l'on ne peut pas encore ramasser. Bon, on est limité à 2 marqueurs par environnement, parce que sinon le concept du genre serait un peu niquer, mais c'est déjà super agréable. Merci pour ça. + Bonne petite durée de vie, je dirais une douzaine d'heures en normal sans forcément faire 5000 allers/retours à la recherche du 100%.  - C'est moche. Désolé jeu, j'aime pas trop dire ça d'habitude, mais là... Bon, quelques environnements sont plutôt réussis, mais globalement c'est vilain, ça fait vraiment trop textures misent bout à bout sur chaque case du jeu, sans transition entre chaque. On va dire que c'est parce que le jeu n'a été développé que par une seule personne. - Un son. Ce son, celui quand on touche un ennemi blindé. Ce son atroce, mixé largement au dessus de tous les autres, qui pète les oreilles par sa fréquence et son volume. Globalement, les sons sont assez dégueulasses, cf ma remarque juste au dessus. - Jeu trop facile (niveau baston). Je l'ai débuté directement dans la difficulté max (sur 2), et je n'ai vraiment jamais eu de soucis. Peut-être 1 boss ou 2 qui m'ont posé soucis, ou une salle particulière pour choper un objet caché. Mais vraiment, rien de compliqué. - Pas de tricks de folie du genre Walljump, Shinespark ou Bomb Jump. Pas de gameplay émergeant, ou alors j'ai pas trouvé. Et c'est bien dommage, d'autant que ça amène mon point négatif suivant: - Les énigmes pour récupérer toutes les armes/upgrades. Je me suis amusé à aller voir la soluce, une fois avoir fini le jeu, pour compléter ma progression et obtenir le 100%, histoire d'avoir une vision globale sur la chose, et ça m'a déçu. Il n'y a pas vraiment de tricks compliqués, comme dans Metroid, des trucs just frame qu'on recommence 15x avant de le réussir, afin de enfin récupérer l'objet convoité. À la place, c'est du pif du genre de se coller à tous les murs du jeu et d'essayer de les traverser avec un des pouvoirs du héro. Du coup ça rend la progression un peu lente et fastidieuse. Oh, et aussi, il y quelques powerups qui nécessitent pour les récupérer des énigmes complètement fumées, que sans soluce je n'aurais jamais trouvé tellement c'est abstrait, sans indication aucune, démerde toi. Et pourtant j'aime ça les énigmes, mais là...  Pour conclure, j'ai passé un excellent moment sur Axiom Verge, je vais même de ce pas relancer une partie pour tenter de le finir en 1 vie low%. Pis peut-être tenter le speedrun juste après, il a l'air rigolo. Quelques défauts, pas vraiment rédhibitoires, je pense même qu'en "casu", sans trop fouiller dans le game design, j'aurais trouvé le jeu vraiment excellent. Mais voilà: ça fait 1an et demi que je suis complètement hypé par ce jeu, et du coup je crois que mes attentes étaient trop hautes. La hype c'est le mal.
Date 2021-03-21 Playtime 0h 11m Rec Positive steam上最像银河战士的游戏   good
Date 2021-03-20 Playtime 23h 10m Rec Positive On balance, I do recommend this game but it has it's fair share of annoying quirks. The lack of quick travel can be very tiresome especially when you're not sure where to go next. The game does not hold your hand at all. Another issue I had was with the map. There are minimal markings on it. In other metroidvanias there are quite often special markings for doors etc that are different or cannot yet be opened thus given you some idea where to back track to later on. Even this could be overlooked if at least you were able to annotate more than 2 markers on the map at any given time. I quite often forgot where the unexplored areas were or where i'd reached a roadblock before. This lead to a lot of aimless roaming around till by chance, I'd reach a spot that I'd been to previously. A better map system and/or some map legend would have made the experience much less frustrating and more streamlined.
Date 2021-03-20 Playtime 33h 35m Rec Positive 'legal, bem louco, empolgante'
Date 2021-03-20 Playtime 12h 26m Rec Positive ストロングスタイルなメトロイド系 不気味な雰囲気と「なんかアイテムあればこの先いけるんだろうな」って感覚、そこについて特にヒントが出るでもないあたりはスーパーメトロイドくらいの調整。 なんか強引に行けたりする部分もあったりして、シーケンスブレイク好きな自分も満足。
Date 2021-03-20 Playtime 12h 48m Rec Positive Best metroid since zero mission
Date 2021-03-20 Playtime 3h 2m Rec Positive So it's a Metroidvania, feels like Super Metroid to me. Pretty rad soundtrack, diverse weapon choices, tight controls, it really has what you're looking for if you find yourself pondering, "Do I want to play a Metroidvania right now that isn't Metroid or Castlevania?"  If so this game will scratch that itch
Date 2021-03-20 Playtime 11h 22m Rec Positive powerups help you access new areas as you go. this game has a very classic play style similar to metroid. There are very epic retro style bosses.
Date 2021-03-19 Playtime 16h 21m Rec Positive Es muy buen juego, me sorprendió al principio creí que el juego tenia una falla pero eso resulto ser parte del juego  y esta muy genial aparte de eso la jugabilidad, variedad de armas abilidades los boss geniales y la musica ufff brutal :D
Date 2021-03-18 Playtime 13h 13m Rec Positive This isn't just a Metroidvania. This is basically a Metroid-clone. In a good way. If you like Super Metroid, you're gonna love this.
Date 2021-03-17 Playtime 13h 34m Rec Positive Ничего не понятно. Но ООООЧЕНЬ интересно.
Date 2021-03-17 Playtime 15h 12m Rec Positive Really enjoyed this metroidvania. Bosses are a bit meh but the unique Giger-esque aesthetic of the world made it really interesting to explore. Great graphics and music (seriously there are some bangers) and you get an unexpectedly (for a metroidvania at least) large arsenal of neat weapons to play with
Date 2021-03-15 Playtime 14h 10m Rec Positive I bounced off this when I first played, but it's a great Metroidvania that leans hard into the first half of that word. Also throws in some Another World/Out of this World for good measure.
Date 2021-03-15 Playtime 15h 36m Rec Positive Perfect for that metroidvania itch.
Date 2021-03-14 Playtime 20h 8m Rec Positive really fun to play with cool music and weapons
Date 2021-03-13 Playtime 349h 6m Rec Positive An excellent Metroidvania.  Smooth controls, really interesting movement and the Randomzier that was just added gives this a surprising amount of replay. Definitely recommend this game!
Date 2021-03-13 Playtime 44h 16m Rec Positive I played it for an hour when I got it, thought "this is pretty good" and didn't play it again for 9 months. Now that I returned to it, I can safely say that this game is excellent. A must play if you enjoy metroidvanias. I didn't expect too much from the story, but the story was incredibly interesting and satisfying. The gameplay mechanics were really creative. I like the idea of using glitches in the game as a gameplay mechanic. The weapons were cool as well.  Play it broh.
Date 2021-03-10 Playtime 53h 44m Rec Positive What can I say that hasn't been said? Great game. Although I'd say it's fairer to compare this to Metroid Fusion than Super Metroid - the controls aren't as tight and there's some unavoidable damage. The story, however, is great. It's presented perfectly and serves as a reward for those willing to seek it out.
Date 2021-03-10 Playtime 39h 9m Rec Negative While I was really excited to play this game as I love Metroidvania games, I found this game to be rather boring to play and even tedious at times. The storyline is rather bland and kind of confusing.  You can get all sorts of different guns, most of which are pretty useless. You can find tons of power ups littered through out the different leveles. I found myself mostly wandering the different levels trying to find ways into rooms you can spot, but not easily access.  While sometimes this can be fun in games, it seemed like this was just a way to make the game last longer.  The graphics are a mixed bag. Some enemies look pretty cool, while others look pretty lame. The play mechanics were probably my favorite aspect of this game. The ability to tranform the environments and enemies with your ray gun was a cool idea. I commend the guy that made this all by himself. I don't want to crap on his hard work, but this game wasn't really that good in my opinion. Here's to hoping that Axiom Verge 2 takes the good parts of this game and builds upon it.
Date 2021-03-07 Playtime 27h 54m Rec Positive If Axiom Verge has one strength, it's that incredible soundtrack. Every song had a unique tone to it and they changed frequently enough that I was always glad to hear the next track. I never had one of those "oh no it's that song again" moments.  The color scheme and overall art within the game has a "gooey" bio-tech sort of feel to it. There were a lot of small features cooked into the animations. It's clear that this game was a love project for these devs.  If there was one thing I would change about the game, it would be some type of system to help you navigate the map. I'm roughly 75-80% through the game and I have absolutely no idea where to go. There isn't really a fast travel system (at least, not one I know of), so I've spent probably an hour or so just trying to find my objective. Admitedly, my playthrough has been really spread out, so maybe that's part of why I lost my sense of direction. If I could solve for that, this game would be a LOT better in my opinion!  Either way, I'd strongly recommend picking this one up for the soundtrack ALONE.
Date 2021-03-07 Playtime 11h 34m Rec Positive Just a great game. Music is outstanding. Controls are tight. Perfect retro styling.
Date 2021-03-05 Playtime 9h 21m Rec Positive 良く出来たメトロイドヴァニア。  体内にいるようなMAPが薄気味悪い。  わりとプレイしてて詰まったりするけど youtubeにプレイ動画とかが上がっていたので 詰まった時はお世話になった。  良ゲーです。
Date 2021-03-04 Playtime 9h 39m Rec Positive Very fun, very metroid, hard levels & bosses, great music, I definitely want to finish it. Muy divertido, muy estilo metroid, niveles y jefes difíciles y gran banda sonora. Definitivamente quiero terminarlo.
Date 2021-03-04 Playtime 20h 59m Rec Positive Well, I played this game for now only around 30 minutes but until this point... it's awensome.
Date 2021-03-03 Playtime 13h 27m Rec Positive Лютая годнота! Визуал на любителя, многие хаят его, но как по мне-бомба!  Меня, если честно, именно графон и подкупил в первую очередь. Геймплей по старомодному немного неуклюжий, но он не скатывается в душноту, управление не мешает играть. Сюжет и лор запутанный, проработанный и весьма интересный. Я в афиге, что игру эту создал всего один человек. Не жалею ни одной копейки, потраченной на такой труд. Игра стоит того. Кстати, это первая "метроидвания", в которую я поиграл. Крутой жанр, как оказалось, как раз для таких аутистов как я, кто любит лазить во все дыры и искать всякие секретки и баффы. 
Date 2021-03-03 Playtime 28h 26m Rec Positive [h1]É quase como voltar a jogar Super Metroid[/h1]  Axiom verge é um clássico metroidvania como qualquer outro, simples assim, ou melhor, simples e perfeito. Axiom Verge não tenta ser mais do que ele é: uma homenagem aos jogos desse gênero. Tanto a parte gráfica quanto os efeitos sonoros são quase como voltar a jogar um jogo de SNES, mas com seu charme único. A história é realmente muito bem escrita e dá base para a atmosfera do mundo onde se passa o jogo. Além de bem elaborada, é uma história que te deixa bastante curioso e ansioso para descobrir mais informações sobre aquele mundo e tentar desvendar o que está acontecendo ali.  Infelizmente nem tudo aqui é tão bom quanto suas intenções. O jogo acaba passando a impressão de certas áreas serem maiores do que deveriam ser. Quando falamos sobre jogos desse gênero, se perder faz parte da experiência de qualquer metroidvania de respeito, mas existe uma diferença entre se divertir tentando encontrar seu caminho e ficar frustrado por ter que ficar passando infinitas vezes por áreas repetitivas e com pouca originalidade. Porém o ponto desse jogo que mais me decepcionou foram os chefões. Basicamente quase todos os chefes aqui seguem um padrão: uma barra de HP enorme e ataques que cobrem uma parte enorme da tela. A maioria das lutas se torna um teste de resistência, onde você só fica segurando o botão de tiro e desviando de tudo que vem na sua direção até que o chefe finalmente exploda.  Mesmo me frustrando, e até se decepcionando, com certos pontos desse jogo, qualquer um que seja fã do gênero de metroidvania ou até mesmo que tenha boas recordações de Super Metroid, está muito bem servido com Axiom Verge.
Date 2021-03-03 Playtime 6h 33m Rec Positive A really solid Metroidvania. I'd recommend anyone who is a fan of the genre to check this one out.
Date 2021-03-03 Playtime 15h 42m Rec Positive wow..amazing
Date 2021-03-02 Playtime 19h 30m Rec Positive Keyifli bir Metroidvania. Özgün bir evreni var, konusu dikkate değer. Sağda solda bulunan tek tük bilgiler merak körükleyici olmuş. Harita tasarımını çoğunlukla beğendim. Gizli bölgeleri aramak, geliştirme/silahlar bulmak tatmin hissi veriyor.   Çok fazla backtrack yapıyoruz oyunda Metroidvania oyunlarının doğası gereği. Fast travel olayının olmaması, yeni bir geliştirme alınca bunu kullanarak açacağımız bölgelere dönüşü biraz zahmetli ve can sıkıcı yapıyor. Çok fazla silah var oyunda ama genellikle 4-5 tanesi kullanılıyor. Düşmanların formunu değiştiren disruptor gun keyifli bir mekanik olmuş. Oynanış biraz daha akıcı olabilirmiş. Oynanış mekaniklerini etkileyen geliştirmeleri aldıktan sonra epey aşılıyor bu durum ama oyunun sonuna çok yaklaşmış oluyoruz bu aşamada da.   Oyunda çok fazla boss yok. Olanlar da çok zor gelmedi bana. Daha fazla ve biraz daha zorlayıcı olmalarını isterdim.  Oyunun müziklerini çok beğendim. Retro havasıyla uyumlu. Akılda kalıcı güzel parçalar var. Kiminin kafasını şişirebilir bir süre sonra gerçi.   İndirimde gayet makul bir fiyata alınıp 15 saat civarı güzel vakit geçirtebilecek bir oyun. Tavsiye ederim.

Date 2021-03-01 Playtime 14h 5m Rec Positive Nerdy engineer gets thrown into a parallel universe and his solution to get back is big guns and hacking.  It's like a Lovecraftian Super Metroid with a bit of Contra thrown in. Hell, it feel like a ripoff in the first few areas (not that I'm complaining). It can be a bullet hell, but I'm all for that kind of challenge.  Very strange plot. Killer soundtrack and pixel art.

Date 2021-02-27 Playtime 9h 17m Rec Negative Game design trop basique voire à revoir sur certaines parties: -armes toutes plus inutiles les unes que les autres  -certains mobs mal foutus avec le système de hacking qui les fais passer de vrai demi-boss a trash mob trahissant une incapacité de les balances convenablement  -système de combat à distance inaproprié dans des map aussi serré rendant l'arme de corps à corps l'une des rare viables paradoxalement  -un dash qui se trigger à la mannette avec un double coups de joystick le rendant totalement arbitraire comme si il n'y avait pas assez de touche sur une manette( et ne me demandez pas de jouer à ce jeu au clavier parce-que ça à l'air d'être une purge).  -manque de personnalité globale du jeu en terme de graphisme """""retro""""""ou de gameplay en général  qui nous rappelle beaucoup trop un jeu que je ne vous ferais pas l'affront de vous citer  -des boss allant de l'acceptable avec un combat original au scandaleux se résumant à une bête course au DPS.  -exploration sans aucun intérêts (ce qui est un comble pour un metroidvania).En effet je n'ai pas du tout ressentie d'accomplissement au fur et à mesure des objectifs atteints et des améiorations obtenues( qui sont je le rappelle dans les 3/4 inutiles).  Avec tout ça je ne peux pas considérer ce jeu comme bon. Bref, en espérant que la suite corrigera tout ça.

Date 2021-02-24 Playtime 11h 51m Rec Positive its only real flaw is maybe trying to run with too many ideas at once. the rest of the time it's a terrific scratch for the metroid itch
Date 2021-02-24 Playtime 3h 21m Rec Positive This game feels like an homage to Metroid. It has a great soundtrack and awesome NES style graphics.

Date 2021-02-20 Playtime 28h 15m Rec Positive A fun metroidvania that challenged my exploration and abilities. Fun and worth every hour put into it
Date 2021-02-19 Playtime 40h 21m Rec Positive Great game. Worth getting.
Date 2021-02-19 Playtime 11h 54m Rec Negative A neat attempt at a Metroidvania that falls flat due to poorly implemented mechanics and bad development decisions.   Controls:     All tools are always equip. This means that a total of 5 buttons on the controller are blocked off from use, leading to game play mechanics, that desperately call for a dedicated buttons, to be locked behind awkward inputs.     The worst offender has to be the sprint/teleport mechanic. It is activated by double pressing a movement key.  This often lead to accidental activation during combat, as well as increased difficulty in timing the ability; Both in combat as well as for terrain traversal. A dedicated button would have made the ability much more useful.     The grappling hook also suffers from this. There are multiple sections in the game that require you to swing while hooked to a platform, release and then re grapple the same platform. Some kind of input here to make this less painful would have been nice.     Another thing that is missing is the lack of a diagonal fire button. Not being able to quickly and accurately shoot diagonally (like in super metroid or fusion) is the prime source of "difficulty" in combat. The game does offer a "hold position" input. But the only reason this is useful is because the game lacks one for diagonal fire.  Weapons:     Why are there so many? Half of them are so utterly useless and awkward to use that the only reason to equip them is for some of the puzzles, the other half is so mediocre that, even when it would be optimal to switch to them, it feels tedious to open the menu to switch to them.     Out of the 13 weapons I collected in my playthrough, the starting weapon was the only one that consistently felt like the proper choice and 3 were occasional switches for niche situations.     The game could have greatly benefited by reducing the number and making sure they all have their proper  Combat:     Combat is very meh. The impossibility of aiming diagonally (without standing still) is basically the only thing that makes this game challenging. Enemy design is kind of neat, but so much can be beaten by just standing still and mindlessly firing.     "Difficulty" of enemies also just randomly spikes in the last area, which is frustrating. It feels like the developers wanted to tie all the game mechanics together, but due to everything being monumentally clunky and impossible to use with any accuracy, it feels like an absolute chore.    Bosses:     Basically all bosses have one or two gimmicks. The approach is either to find out their gimmick, after which they are less than trivial, or just tank through their damage output.     As with normal enemies, about half the bosses can be beaten by standing still, firing at them and jumping or ducking occasionally.     I see tanking though their damage output as viable, because I was consistently able to almost defeat every boss on the first encounter like this (I played on hard difficulty).    Nowhere is this better exemplified than in the final battle. You can just equip the enemy-piercing gun, crouch beneath the boss's weak spot, and fire directly up. This allows you to avoid 3/4 of the projectiles and the damage that you do take can be healed by health drops from the boss's summons, which are killed passively when they move through your line of fire.     Again, the only difficulty in Boss fights comes from the fact that you cannot fire diagonally without having to hold down the "hold position" button.  Map:     The map, if nothing else, is pretty good. Mazelike levels with lots to explore. My only gripe here is that it doesn't feel very connected. There are no AHA! moments when the sectors connect and a lot of paths end up being very linear. I wouldn't be able to tell that it was one contiguous map if I weren't able to view it.     This is especially apparent when backtracking. The lack of shortcuts and sections that loop back in on themselves forces you to go through very tedious sections multiple times, leading to death warping often being the optimal mechanic for map traversal.     It wouldn't surprise me if this game is very linear in general. There are a few moments when it feels like it starts branching out, however new areas are often locked behind multiple obstacles one after the other, making these extended gate section seem like roadblocks against sequence breaking.  Exploration:     If you enjoy trying to teleport through every wall, scaling everything that looks remotely scale-able and having your address disrupter and drill out all game (which severely impacts the mood this game is going for btw), testing every block for an interaction, then I guess you will enjoy exploration in this game.     This is especially infuriating since some block and objects are affected by your drill/address disrupter, yet other blocks/objects, with the exact same model and texture aren't. Often even in the same room!     Basically it is impossible to tell what can and what cannot be interacted with, making exploration one giant exercise in trial and error.     It is also often hard to tell what is foreground and what is background, making hidden passages and 'crawlspaces' incredibly difficult to spot.  Story:    The story is pretty generic. Seems like a list of randomly selected cosmic horror, matrix, sci-fi, grimdark cliches strung together. But next to the pain that was the game play, I had no energy left to get properly invested in it so who knows.  Atmosphere:     The atmosphere is great. The music is varied and gives you a chill down your spine. To bad it is absolutely ruined by your drill going "brrrrrr...." and your address disruptor going "plewplewplewplewplew..." constantly, lest you miss in intractable block.  Visuals:     You either like the art style or not. I thought it was pretty neat, but it suffers from a lot of stuff looking very samey and indistinguishable from one another.     If you didn't have a map, you'd have a hard time navigating due to the lack of uniqueness within a sector.  Conclusion:     There are many great ideas in this game and if they weren't held back due to incompetent implementation, you'd have an amazing game on your hands. Definitely one of those cases where I am absolutely baffled beyond belief that a game has over 90% positive reviews.     Worst Metroidvania I have actually finished.
Date 2021-02-19 Playtime 6h 38m Rec Negative I really hate this game. I'm currently forcing myself to play it, because I have been trying to play it for so long. Even jumping adds some delay between your next jump after landing. Everything is painfully slow, and you just kind of meander around drilling walls and never knowing where to go. The graphics are great, but I'd prefer a larger sprite and smaller environments. It can take what feels like hours just to walk a corridor. Literally every single weapon in this game is weaker than the normal shot you start with and slower. So there is no reason to ever use any other weapon, which is just sad. It feels like everything in this game is meant to slow you down. Enemies are bullet sponges, you get power upgrades over time which is great for helping there. The bosses can be beat without ever moving, standing in place and shooting until they die. Some bosses you can cheese by walking in the right spot. The music is just fantastic, but the sound effects can be insanely jarring. I recommend lowering the SFX volume just enough to let the music shine. The grappling hook is just pure cancer, it really doesn't make any sense. The dash mechanic is tied to double taps, so using an analogue stick forces you to dash constantly, as it picks up double movements as you change direction, rendering the analogue stick almost unusable. The right stick changes weapons, so every time the wind or a finger barely touches it your weapon menu comes up. Really don't even need more than Kilver or Normal Shot. I think this is a good game, but it really desperately needed some community feedback. It was made by a single talented individual and I feel like he really could have used someone to pushback and challenge some of his design choices. Most aren't huge complaints, but they do really hurt the game experience for ME. Being able to bind the 'dash' mechanic to left trigger for instance would have been a game changer, double tapping just doesn't make sense anymore. It was mostly a fighting game mechanic, and best for D-Pads, a relic from a time in history when controllers didn't really have enough buttons. I've been a long time lover of Metroidvanias and this game comes so close to being a legend, but falls short in nearly every category.  I could probably go on for hours about all the things I don't like about this game, but I'd still recommend it because despite all the issues, it's still a great game. I really, really do not want to play the second one if none of these issues aren't addressed.
Date 2021-02-18 Playtime 10h 0m Rec Positive Nota 6,8 de 10 Em resumo este jogo é muito clone do Metroid, e sinceramente não sei se isso é bom ou ruim.

Date 2021-02-14 Playtime 22h 6m Rec Positive Excellent game. Looking forward to the sequel.
Date 2021-02-14 Playtime 68h 11m Rec Positive I think a lot of people overlooked this game due to its "metroidvania clone" nature. Trust me, it has some fun tools/game mechanics that make it stand out. But the most unique and wonderful part of the game is its grim, sci-fi story of genocide, treachery and fear. Seriously, the plot is not what it seems at the very beginning, the middle and at the end of the game, especially if you bother yourself with gathering and decyphering all of the notes. The game also has very charming aestetics/visuals and absolutely amazing music that got me into playing Axiom Verge in the first place. I still cannot believe the fact this whole game was made by just one man. It's a relatively short and enjoyable adventure, so give it a try, you won't regret it.
Date 2021-02-13 Playtime 20h 40m Rec Positive Oldshool Metroidvania like no other

Date 2021-02-11 Playtime 10h 52m Rec Positive Excellent metroidvania that takes a lot of inspirations from Super Metroid specifically. Unfortunately, this inspiration does end up making it feel and play like a clone almost. However, the unique upgrades and wide arsenal of weapons makes up for this. The areas are interesting, however tend to not be as diverse from one another when compared to a game such as Super Metroid or Hollow Knight.   However, still one of the best metroidvanias i've played. It's worth it just for the soundtrack and fun boss fights.  8/10, didn't last long enough to tide me over until silksong, but the main character has some crazy sideburns.
Date 2021-02-10 Playtime 14h 18m Rec Positive Yes
Date 2021-02-09 Playtime 22h 10m Rec Positive Metroïd nostalgia here we come :) I liked the game very much, the double tap dash gave me some troubles, but still, this is an awesome game. (i had to follow a guide to get 100% completion, some items are just too hard to find (imo) )
Date 2021-02-09 Playtime 14h 38m Rec Positive ...
Date 2021-02-07 Playtime 14h 27m Rec Positive Was dieses Spiel vom klassischen 2D-Metroid unterscheidet? Der Name, sonst nichts. Einfach supergeil gemacht. Unvorstellbar, dass das von nur einer Person entwickelt wurde. Ich werd hier nicht rumspoilern, nur soviel, wenn du nach einem Spiel suchst, dass sich anfühlt wie Super Metroid, dann ist das hier exakt das Game, das du suchst. Nicht gerade günstig, aber hey, der Kerl hats verdient!
Date 2021-02-07 Playtime 9h 3m Rec Positive This game is very fun and is a fun return to the style of classic metroidvanias. I would recommend playing it on hard diffuculty your first time through, as most bosses can be tanked through without too much worry by just exploring for enough upgrades. The price though low, is still a little high for the length, in my opinion. I would say put this game on your wish list and buy it when it has a sale.
Date 2021-02-06 Playtime 1h 33m Rec Positive More Metroid than Super Metroid. Back to the original NES roots. If you are not a NES fan, you may have hard times on this game. But if you are American and still crazy on the NES-hype train, then this is your kind of drug. Almost no story, direct to the action. However game can be confusing at many times, and either you have to struggle for eternity to solve it, or consult on the Nintendo Power magazine. Rad!  7: Above average - It presented what we regularly see in a different way.
Date 2021-02-06 Playtime 61h 8m Rec Positive This might be my alltime favorite metroidvania, the atmosphere is perfect and i love the music and the overall design.
Date 2021-02-06 Playtime 15h 26m Rec Positive Slightly tedious, but overall it was interesting at least. Never did finish it. I got so sick of the final gauntlet that I just stopped and watch the final stretch and ending on Youtube xD I don't fault the game though; many bosses were very fun. 
Date 2021-02-05 Playtime 15h 1m Rec Positive Great metroidvania
Date 2021-02-05 Playtime 9h 59m Rec Positive I prefer Metroid but still ok
Date 2021-02-05 Playtime 40h 29m Rec Positive I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Axiom Verge. Its not just a metroidvania in game play and formula, but a direct love letter to the genre. Hands down, its the closest thing to Metroid I have ever seen that wasn't actually a part of that franchise and it takes that obvious inspiration while somehow still maintaining a unique identity.   The atmosphere is amazing, illustrating a massive alien planet while maintaining a sense of bleak loneliness in a dying world. And it keeps that tension high through the whole experience while still having a small cast of characters to interact with. Their presence keeps the story compelling but by no means cut through the feeling of being alone and stranded. If anything, they exacerbate it by being unrelatable and eerily inhuman.    The graphics and sound are top notch, the mechanics are fluid and fun, exploration is interesting and rewarding and the story is amazing (especially for how few words its conveyed in). The ending is satisfying but the narrative is open enough to allow for thought, and I love all the potential explanations as to what is really going on in Axiom Verge. Its creepy, interesting and compelling.   Its a highly polished, modernized love letter to the original NES era Metroid, and its really impressive that this entire project was brought to life by one person.
Date 2021-02-05 Playtime 24h 40m Rec Positive absolutely excellent metroidvania game, amazed it was made by one person.  The art, music, gameplay, everything was stellar.  This is a must buy must play game if you likin them vania of metroids
Date 2021-02-05 Playtime 20h 46m Rec Positive Great soundtrack. Cool pixel art. Challenging without being punishing.
Date 2021-02-04 Playtime 24h 1m Rec Positive game
Date 2021-02-04 Playtime 25h 53m Rec Positive I think anyone who has ever played a metroidvania game needs to play Axiom Verge. The music, the environment, the combat is just absolutely incredible. I listen to the album outside of the game play. It is by far a impressive game with incredible content. I wish everyone could play it through once. There is so many features and weapons notable to play with. The creator definitely packed as much content as humanly possible into a pixel game. It it so long, there were moments I found myself thinking I have reached the end only to find out there was more to explore. It can be frustrating, but it is worth the ride.
Date 2021-02-03 Playtime 16h 48m Rec Positive Отличная игрушка, единственное что расстроило это скудность локаций, их одинаковый внешний вид.  А так любителям жанра и не только рекомендую! 8 из 10 смело   некоторые боссы жесткие...
Date 2021-02-03 Playtime 39h 37m Rec Positive Очень интересная игра.
Date 2021-02-03 Playtime 27h 47m Rec Positive Great at times, frustrating at others. (I'm not a very skilled player and Axiom Verge is a Metroidvania style game.)  The glitching of your surroundings was a cool new invention. There are many small puzzles and hidden spots in Axiom Verge that can run a completionistic person up the wall (literally), and moving from one edge of the map to another and then back again - when searching for the next available route - but there's also joy in spotting and finding them. I suppose this game can be either ran through, or combed through. Each style of approach will give you a different experience. Mine was mostly positive, but the occasional frustrations made me really appreciate "winning" the game in the end. So it wasn't a game I would've gladly had kept on playing more and more of.
Date 2021-02-02 Playtime 17h 8m Rec Positive A decent metroidvania with an interesting story, look out for it when on sale.
Date 2021-02-01 Playtime 24h 23m Rec Positive I got lost, it was fun.
Date 2021-02-01 Playtime 11h 23m Rec Positive GOD... I LOVE THIS GAME, I love the music, I love the gameplay, I love the graphics, AND... I love the story AND how original it is!!! Axiom Verge is a Metroidvania video game by American indie developer Thomas Happ. The game was originally released in March 2015 in North America and April 2015 in Europe and Australia for PlayStation 4. It was released in May 2015 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. A PlayStation Vita version was released in April 2016. The Wii U[1][2] and Xbox One[3] versions were released in North America and Europe in September 2016. A Nintendo Switch[4] version was released in October 2017. The story startes with Trace, a scientist is running a lab experiment in New Mexico, U.S. when an explosion knocks him out. He awakens inside an egg-shaped machine on the alien world of Sudra. A disembodied voice leads Trace to The Axiom Disruptor, a powerful gun. Trace explores Sudra, using the gun to protect himself from massive monsters that attack him in the name of "Athetos" The game-play is extremely smooth, there are literally no glitches or problems playing the game, you can play it via a gamepads or by keyboards & mouse, the story is extremely satisfyingly, AND best of all the game has a sequel in development... All n ALL this game is a must have for your collection!
Date 2021-01-31 Playtime 19h 47m Rec Negative Poor combat ruins a lovingly crafted homage to Metroid. Fantastic story and art, but the game just plays poorly. From beginning to end, the combat interactions all boil down to questions about how you are going to deal with the fact that you simply can't shoot in the direction that you need to. The most powerful weapons in the game are the ones that spread your damage through walls or diagonally away from where are you facing so you can attempt to counteract the frustratingly limited ability to aim.   It really is a shame too given how cool the story and art are. The world design and puzzles are great, and it is still a fantastic achievement of a one-man project, Big fans of the genre should pick this up on sale and check it out in an academic sense, but this review stands as a thumbs down because it objectively just does not hold up to the modern heights that have been set now by the larger teams behind Hollow Knight, Deadcells, or Ori.
Date 2021-01-31 Playtime 11h 25m Rec Positive Fantastic metroidvania. Just play it.
Date 2021-01-31 Playtime 10h 23m Rec Positive easily one of the best metroidvanias out there
Date 2021-01-30 Playtime 14h 9m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a great love letter to Metroid.  I am a very big of Metroid and this was just a treat to play.  The pixel art is amazing and the designs and the background of the environment are great to look at.  The combat is interesting and I do like the way the guns handle.  There are some problems, there is no fast travel and the way to progress forward is confusing.  You will get lost and will have no idea where to go.  I did get a guide to help me once but that was the only time.  I recommend you pick this game up if you are starving for some MetroidVania games, then this one is for you.
Date 2021-01-29 Playtime 28h 38m Rec Positive excelente juego muy buena historia aunque deja muchas cosas a la imaginacion pero es parte del encanto
Date 2021-01-29 Playtime 13h 2m Rec Positive It's a pretty good metroidvania with a dark vibe to it. It can get old quick, though, so I would play it in bursts.
Date 2021-01-29 Playtime 10h 15m Rec Positive This is one of the best "metroidvanias" since super metroid or castlevania symphony of the night. I cannot recommend this enough. The game play is brutally difficult and requires planning. Graphically it calls back the the 16-32 bit generation of consoles.   Like Dark souls in the sense that it feels tough but when you triumph its all the sweeter. You will explore and backtrack as the map opens more and more as you gain equipment. Its best approached without looking at guides. I would avoid looking at guides and tips until you finish it. Some things are best enjoyed through fresh eyes. I have completed this on the nintendo switch, so my pc version is a replay for me, but its worth it. The soundtrack was what convinced me to repurchase it.  The soundtrack compliments the game perfectly and is good on its own and I listen to it all the time. If this is on sale get it, you will not be disappointed. That is unless the idea of an side scrolling bores you. Then maybe this might not be for you, but look at some spoiler free reviews and have a think about it. Do it for your pal sea pickles.
Date 2021-01-27 Playtime 2h 1m Rec Negative An awesome game that I had to get refunded because of slow down & tons of things popping in & out on the screen.  My Pc runs triple A games in 4k.  And this games run horribly.  This is unacceptable
Date 2021-01-27 Playtime 23h 26m Rec Positive Honestly, I went into this game cautiously because of some middling reviews out there. It far exceeded my expectations. It's very fun to play and explore, and I really dig its aesthetic, though I could imagine it isn't everyone's cup of tea. While clearly inspired by Metroid, it feels like its own thing. I was also consistently surprised and engaged by the power-ups it gave me to progress. In the sequel, maybe something akin to the X-Ray Scope or even Power Bomb to look for secrets more easily would be welcome, since this game seems to inherit the "bomb every wall" philosophy of Metroid's extras.  Its world is very intriguing and I am considering 100%ing it to get the full lore. It reminds me of the way games like Metroid Prime, Bioshock, and Doom 2016 allow you to gain more insight into their backstory if you choose to get the respective extras.  I would recommend it not just if you like Metroidvanias, but especially if you like Metroid. I am a big Metroid fan, and I imagine Axiom Verge's similarities to that series played a part in me liking it so much.
Date 2021-01-27 Playtime 20h 30m Rec Positive It Gud
Date 2021-01-26 Playtime 24h 25m Rec Positive Cons: Some of the secret finds are pretty obtuse.           Occasionally it's not entirely apparent what to do next.           The story is obscure and "who cares?"y.           I hate the fucking grappling hook.           Where's my damn double jump? (I also hate the double tap airdash)  Pros: Plethora of items.          Good map size.          Diverse cast of enemies.          Sharp difficulty spikes but, frequent save points.          All map progress and item gains are saved upon death.
Date 2021-01-25 Playtime 31h 29m Rec Positive Solid 2d platform paying heavy homage to Metroid.
Date 2021-01-24 Playtime 10h 31m Rec Positive its metriod but imagine if the story was scary as fuck lmao
Date 2021-01-24 Playtime 12h 15m Rec Positive 怀念2d萨姆斯的话就买吧，没错的。 没玩过建议先去玩12代metroid复刻和34。 单纯的IGA城爱好者也可以考虑半价玩
Date 2021-01-22 Playtime 15h 42m Rec Positive A fantastic game, made doubly so by the fact that it was developed by a single person. It was a bit slow at the start for me - honestly, it took me several hours (3-4 or so) to finally get into it. But once the exploration really took off, navigating the HUGE world of Axiom Verge was a blast, and using both the wide variety of weapons and incredibly creative mobility upgrades was satisfying and fun. Once you're in the thick of it, the artwork and atmosphere really establish themselves, and the story is quite compelling all the way through, too. Definitely worth your time, especially if you're a fan of the genre.
Date 2021-01-22 Playtime 28h 43m Rec Positive 地圖寬廣,但是探索無頭緒!!!希望有中文!
Date 2021-01-21 Playtime 18h 40m Rec Positive The Metroidvania aspect is really good, really really really good, it's amazing :000 there is a lot of variety in weapons and upgrades, many of them are really original and interesting. ... But the enemies are utter trash, jesus christ, they just constantly rape you, they are so annoying, sometimes it's actually impossible to dodge them, so have that in mind before buying it, the game is incredible, but the enemies are an unfair pain on the butt all the time.
Date 2021-01-21 Playtime 14h 4m Rec Positive A solid metroidvania. Really good. A bit cryptic with the puzzles maybe but that does not affect the overall score of the game. Great fun!
Date 2021-01-20 Playtime 10h 50m Rec Positive Este juego me a parecido muy bueno y si te gustan los metroidvanias y mas aun metroid este juego es compra obligatoria, ademas no te llevara mucho completarlo (a no ser que quieras el 100%).
Date 2021-01-20 Playtime 11h 11m Rec Positive very good
Date 2021-01-19 Playtime 43h 35m Rec Positive I was thoroughly lost in this game for so long I restarted on new files three times before I actually managed to beat it even once. (And then I 100%'d it.)  Ultimately I think the game, for the most part, feels good to play. There's some stuff that definitely takes some trial and error, but ultimately if you're not speedrunning the game you have plenty of save points to execute that. I enjoyed the story and the somewhat abstract implications behind it. I like how you can even do some optional things without necessarily needing all of the navigation items that would make it easier to complete them. It just feels nice.  Currently I'm trying to learn to speedrun the game. Once the pieces start lining up there's a certain flow to it that's really enjoyable, even without using major glitches.

Date 2021-01-17 Playtime 15h 24m Rec Positive Buenardo
Date 2021-01-17 Playtime 11h 51m Rec Positive Игра для любителей платформеров с закосом под ретро. По геймплею - классическая метроидвания: очевидных ориентиров не дают, нашел улучшение - ищешь, где применить - применяешь - продвигаешься дальше. Игра выполнена в депрессивных тонах, что в совокупности с отличной подходящей музыкой создает гнетущую атмосферу безысходности и одиночества, в запутанных коридорах кроме вас есть только агрессивные твари. Боссы в игре не очень сложные, проходятся с пары попыток. В игре множество видов оружия, но пользоваться вы будете только несколькими. Понравилась механика взлома врагов, посредством которой можно изменять их свойства. Не понравился однообразный скупой дизайн локаций, как то они совсем не запоминаются. Так же не понравилось, как сделана карта, она совсем не информативна, на карте не отображаются локации с секретами, да и в самих комнатах нет никаких подсказок на наличии в данной комнате секрета, чтобы пройти игру на 100% придется пользоваться гайдами.
Date 2021-01-16 Playtime 8h 33m Rec Positive Spielzeit waren ca. 20h (buggt wegen Offline-Modus) Absolut geiles Spiel! Super Musik, super Grafiken, nicht eintönig trotz der großen Karte. Axiom Verge kreiert eine tolle Atmosphäre und verspricht sehr viele versteckte Items und Wege. Wem Metroid oder Castlevania Spaß gemacht hat, der wird hiermit ganz bestimmt  eine tolle Zeit haben.  Einzige Mankos: - Wer auf 100% steht (wie ich) kann hier nicht erwarten, das im blind play zu erreichen. - Ukhu (rosa Wespe) war wahnsinnig frustrierend, hier hat man am Besten möglichst viele Upgrades und eine gute Strategie.
Date 2021-01-16 Playtime 4h 41m Rec Negative This Metroidvania is full of cryptic nonsense. The enemies take so many goddamn hits and are often placed in order to trick you into getting hit. You cannot see them because they're off-screen and when you see them it's too late and you've already taken damage. Of course you are pushed back and thus fall down in many places and have to make your way up again. As I said: the enemies are intentionally placed in that fashion and that is really annoying. Traversing and exploring the world becomes a chore because of evading those enemies. At least I got sick of fighting them after a while. And as far as I've got there's no fast travel function. Maybe it's introduced later, I don't know.   Yes sure, from a creative point of view it's an amazing game, very well made and thought through. Combat can be fun; upgrades and gear are plenty and it feels good to discover it. But just like Hollow Knight it's one of those games that don't treat the player in a friendly way but rather want you to suffer. I'm so annoyed and angry about the **** it keeps throwing at me that I cannot be asked to continue. No, it's worse: I don't want to play anymore but keep coming back because at its core it's a really good game. I hate it when a game does that.
Date 2021-01-16 Playtime 17h 11m Rec Negative I get the homages and the various hidden upgrades and numerous weapons would make this a challenging game for completionists, but I just found it kind of boring.  The aesthetic was a cool throwback, but it quickly became ugly and drab.  Combat often felt cumbersome and the story itself never drew me in or surprised me.  I love Super Medtroid, Castlevania, and others in the genre, but for everything this game does, it was simply never fun.
Date 2021-01-16 Playtime 35h 23m Rec Positive Absolutely addicting Metroidvania. I did one playthrough on Normal where I got 100% items and map, and a Hard Mode playthrough in Speedrun Mode to clean up the rest of the achievements. As a massive fan of Metroid, and someone who's played Super and Prime countless times, this really hooked me. Absolutely play this, it's a great way to get into the genre alongside the Metroid series.
Date 2021-01-15 Playtime 24h 2m Rec Positive Cool and good. One of the greatest metroidvanias of all time.
Date 2021-01-15 Playtime 15h 51m Rec Positive Крутая игра и история, способная взломать вас ещё до того, как вы взломаете саму игру 11 схеморождённых из 10
Date 2021-01-15 Playtime 16h 41m Rec Positive Super fun game. If you liked Super Metroid, you'll almost certainly enjoy this. It's worth playing either way.
Date 2021-01-15 Playtime 145h 44m Rec Positive It's not a perfect game, but DAMN was there immense love poured into it. It bleeds through so evidently in everything from the wonderfully imaginative world building and stunning visuals all the way down to the careful attention to detail in every little sprite. The music, the colors, the lore, the far fetched but still wholly compelling sci-fi jargon, the mystery, the way the story unravels, the way that unraveling happens alongside a fantastic discovery of an expansive yet carefully woven map, all so incredible. Not perfect, but certainly incredible. And I just want to double stress: The world building is so. damn. cool. Despite being pretty easy to categorize as sci-fi, its imagination is boundless. Tom Happ really portrays an interpretation of alien worlds that is wholly his own, and using visuals limited by his resources, manages to make that portrayal an absolute treat for the eyes and mind. It seems to click so perfectly into some distant subconscious dream receptor I have somehow. And it has some really immensely fascinating things to say about [spoiler]the progression of extremely longstanding civilizations and what time might do to a people who have found a collective enlightenment, and the value of spirituality in a culture and the immense tragedy that occurs when these things are crushed in the name of science and progress, which whether intentionally or not parallels the colonization happening in our world today.[/spoiler] Even with the quirks (which include getting lost a lot (which, given the beauty of the world I wasn't so bummed about), sometimes awkward combat and maneuvering, and [i]occasionally[/i] cheesy writing) I would SO much rather spend my time playing a game made with this much love than some game that lacks all these quirks, with "perfect" controls and gameplay, made by developers who don't really care. And I was audibly in awe of all the care that went into this game (which tangibly came through as a part of the experience in a really splendid way) [i]before[/i] I finished it and saw the credits and realized it was made by one. Single. Person. Entirely!! Fucking... I don't have the words. It's just so intricate. This guy had a vision, and truly took [i]all[/i] the time and care necessary to realize that vision as fully as he could. And trust me when I say experiencing that vision is worth your time and attention, if you've got some to spare. And I say that with the deepest reverence for time and attention as the most valuable thing we have in this life. Well, I suppose I can't speak for everyone, but I can at least tell you with certainty it was worth mine.
Date 2021-01-15 Playtime 10h 3m Rec Positive It's more Super Metroid, which is always good.
Date 2021-01-13 Playtime 18h 19m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an homage to the original Metroid and to Super Metroid but with an improved gameplay and a lot more abilities and secrets.  The game is very old school. The graphisms, sounds, controls and difficulty are made to mimic a NES game. It's very fun and they nailed the Metroidvania recipe.   The map is fairly large and in hard it took me 18 h to complete with a c.90% completion rate. The bosses are not too bad. They feel very much like NES bosses.  My only complaint is that their is no real fast travel which makes the game quite tedius toward the end, especially if you try to get the >80% item and 80% map to get the true ending.  7/10  
Date 2021-01-13 Playtime 10h 44m Rec Positive 見た目はちょっと不気味なところはあるけど 最高なメトロイドヴァニアだ 2021年には続編が出るらしい 楽しみだ
Date 2021-01-13 Playtime 5h 52m Rec Positive A pretty cool spiritual successor to Super Metroid. The glitch effects are pretty cool and the soundtrack is fantastic.
Date 2021-01-12 Playtime 19h 7m Rec Positive TLDR; If you grew up with Metroid, Castle Vania, or any similar game on the Gameboy, this is your game. I can't praise it enough.   The game is a retro looking Metroid Vania that provides tough but very enjoyable level discovery, boss fight, and exploitation of amazing mechanics. Along the game you not only find out about a very detail overarching world story but play with incredible mechanics that seems weirds on paper but is perfectly entwined with the world. One of these sees your avatar glitch through walls, allowing you to explore more locations; or using a gun to change the properties of pixel in the environment. It’s not only an homage of old similar games, but an innovation and reinvention of gameplay mechanics. If this interest you just a little bit, trust me, you are in for an amazing ride. 
Date 2021-01-12 Playtime 15h 2m Rec Negative 粪操作！粪流程！ 玩起来一直觉得很吃力的游戏。 首先游戏没有明确的目标，但是有过于多的“发现一个地方过不去，到别的地方获取能力，回来解锁”的要素，这种要素过于多，以至于在没有明确方向的时候会来来回回到处跑。比如获得了新能力，然后跑回去查看一些过不去的地方，但发现只有一个地方能过去，过去以后要不就是遇见第二个障碍，要不就是只拿了一本莫名其妙的书。 很吃力地玩到后面以后还有密码解锁机制配合大量的文献操作，解谜过程非常枯燥。  总之就是游戏流程设计，地图设计都比较糟糕，让人产生一种“原来银河恶魔城游戏能这么讨厌”的感觉。每次玩完都感觉自己浪费了大把美好时光。  第二是操作性，游戏的手柄操作非常难受，常用的瞬移功能是用双击方向键来实现的，用手柄时得松开摇杆，然后点两下十字键才能快速进行瞬移，因此很难实现精确操作，然而往往会在不需要瞬移时因为摇杆的判定触发瞬移而产生各种影响。游戏的勾爪是八向缓缓射出，也很难用。要想在空中进行什么跑酷十分困难。游戏的换武器用手柄也很麻烦。总之如果要用手柄玩，不得不时不时用键盘进行一些操作，实在很影响心情。它本该做得更好才是。 即便不说是手柄，游戏本身的操作也让人觉得各种难受。  优点：游戏的美术和音乐能带给人一种处在异次元一般很独特的感受。剧情的缓缓揭开也较有意思。Boss战大多还算较为有趣  但是游戏的流程玩法地图操作设计都可以说是令人糟心，以至于视听和剧情难以弥补操作游玩体验上带来的负面感受。  不推荐。
Date 2021-01-12 Playtime 19h 7m Rec Positive Amazing metroidvania. If you are looking for a great game to play, this is it.
Date 2021-01-11 Playtime 18h 38m Rec Positive uno de los mejores juegos estilo metroid que he jugado  sis, no confundan con metroidvania   ok, su estética, música y historia me gustó mucho aunque me gustaría que la historia no sea tan críptica y que dependa mucho de notas para contarla, pero weno, eso no impide para disfrutarlo al máximo <3  muy recomendable y ojalá su secuela salga pronto B)  chúpenla
Date 2021-01-11 Playtime 13h 16m Rec Positive Such a great game - the music is top notch! Thoroughly enjoyed the story, the art takes me back to my childhood but with an updated spin, and the gameplay itself is just plain fun! -- Highly suggest this game if you're into metroidvania's at all.
Date 2021-01-10 Playtime 13h 32m Rec Positive É Super Metroid purinho! Com exceção da história, que é bem mais profunda e complexa. Você fica o jogo inteiro instigado a entender o que está acontecendo
Date 2021-01-10 Playtime 13h 25m Rec Positive If you love Super Metroid, this will be right up your alley. Interesting story, fun powerups and a world full of variety really make this game a lot of fun to play through.
Date 2021-01-10 Playtime 23h 18m Rec Positive If you like the exploration aspect of Metroidvanias but are turned off by Souls-like tough combat like me, Axiom Verge is the right game for you.

Date 2021-01-10 Playtime 15h 58m Rec Positive Este juego es brillante. Hermoso pixelart, que homenajea al supermetroid, y le da una vuelta de tuerca. Genial las mecánicas del juego, y como van cambiando constantemente, muy entretenido. El único punto a revisar, es que el mapa es muy amplio, y podes quedarte trabado en un escenario durante un rato largo. No tiene Fast Travel. Sacando eso, es genial, gran historia, y gran música.
Date 2021-01-10 Playtime 10h 40m Rec Positive What a perfect metroidvania that isn't tedious and has a fresh story. If you like the genre, give it a go!
Date 2021-01-09 Playtime 41h 16m Rec Positive Amazing Metroidvania with a pretty interesting story as well. Highly recommend.
Date 2021-01-09 Playtime 37h 24m Rec Positive The first game I tried doing a speedrun on says a lot for my dedication.
Date 2021-01-09 Playtime 10h 37m Rec Positive Axiom Verge é um metroidvania que honestamente dá pra tirar o "vania" por ser similar até demais com metroid. A jogabilidade é ótima e responsiva, quando você morre é quase sempre culpa sua mas o que realmente me incomodou foi a progressão do jogo. O caminho a ser feito tá muito longe de ser óbvio fazendo com que você acabe podendo perder muito tempo transitando pelo enorme mapa que não tem algum teletransporte e só te dá atalhos após ter passado pelo menos na metade do jogo. Também não é difícil perder diversos colecionáveis e melhorias, portanto se você gosta de melhorias escondidas, esse jogo é pra você. Como afirmei no início, o jogo me lembrou até demais de Super Metroid, jogo no qual eu também não gosto tanto da progressão.  [b]Pros:[/b] - Excelente jogabilidade - O mais próximo que temos de um metroid não metroid - Desafiador porém não injusto  [b]Contras:[/b] - Progressão não natural pode fazer com que você perca muito tempo andando pelo mapa. - Curto  Axiom Verge é um ótimo metroidvania e você não deveria sentir vergonha de usar um guia para auxiliá-lo(a), vale a pena pra quem gosta do gênero, não acredito que seja uma boa referência para jogadores novos do gênero (digo isso somente pela progressão, não desconsiderem os pontos positivos). Recomendo que comprem com desconto.
Date 2021-01-08 Playtime 7h 26m Rec Negative Не любитель метроидов и метроидваний, но игра зацепила своим визуальным стилем и музыкой. Собственно только их и получил.  Осторожно, в районе данного обзора возможны осадки в виде небольших СПОЙЛЕРОВ!  1) Геймплей. Как и в других представителях жанра приходится много бродить по локациям (в поисках предметов для прокачки оружия/персонажа и поиска входа в другую локацию), но - проблема бэктрекинга в других играх решается перемещением от одной точки сохранения к другой (Ghost 1.0 и т.д.) Здесь же - только одна подземная локация, которая соединяет 3 других, через которых нужно добираться до других нужных игроку локаций. И если Русалка, которая Вас должна переместить будет не в том месте где вы будете находиться, то - топайте пешком до точки выхода. Гениально. Решение - просто 10 дизайнеров из 10. Ещё спорный момент - перемещение с помощью дрона. Если вначале - это просто приятное разнообразие, то ближе к концу игры - необходимо уметь забираться в недоступные места используя все свои возможности (дэш, прыжок, метание дрона, крюк и т.д.). Происходит просто насилие над геймпадом. Один, два раза проделать такое - ещё терпимо, но постоянно возвращаясь на локацию - утомляет.   2) Боевая составляющая довольно скудная. Всё оружие лень искать, да оно и не надо - стартовое оружие самое комфортное для игры. Остальное - опционально и только ради разнообразия можно использовать.  Очень интересное решение - дизраптор и цифровая бомба - враги меняют внешний вид (начинают "глючить") и меняю свои атаки и траекторию движения. Большинство противников при прямоте рук - не представляют опасности, боссы - слишком просты (достаточно заучить паттерн атак и движений).   3) Дизайн. Отличный стиль - биомеханика, так же улавливаются нотки работ Х.Гигера. Качественно передается ощущение, что  главный герой чужд в этом мире и возникает желание покинуть уровень, найти какое - то более комфортное окружение.  4) Звук. Хотелось бы сделать небольшое отступление, т.к. есть "хороший" пример, емко передающий то, что происходит в игре: RoboCop I на NES - в этой игре мы слушаем главную тему фильма, на всех уровнях, битвах с боссами. В Axiom Verge происходит то же само: [u]в игре нет ambient-треков[/u], только ситуация чуть-чуть лучше - своя главная тема на каждую локацию. При этом - музыка звучит отлично, треками можно заслушиваться даже вне игры (по жанровой принадлежности больше подходит syntwave/dark-ambient, с упором в 16-bit). Но во время игры - музыка мешает, не помогает создать нужный настрой, задать ритм. Лично для себя заметил, что через 20-30 минут непрерывной игры - музыка начинает выедать мозг и приходится её сильно убавлять.  5) Сюжет. Кратко и почти без спойлеров: типичный попаданец, попал, в другой непонятный параллельно/хз какой мир. И вроде бы всё стандартно, но - происходящее объясняется вскользь, характер ГГ не раскрыт никак.  Сюжет подается короткими диалогами и записками, которые надо расшифровать (при этом - записки малоинформативны и представляют собой либо комментарии, либо переписку судран, в далеком и не очень прошлом). Шифры представлены в виде кода, который может быть где угодно - в текстурах, записках, именах и т.д. Поэтому чтобы понять, что в игре происходит и что было до появления ГГ, то игру нужно проходить на 100% (концовка от этого тоже зависит).  А концовка так вообще ничего не объясняет - кто появился, что произошло, зачем всё произошло и т.д. Главный герой - ученый. Но он никак не пытается анализировать действия, окружения и врагов. Просто бегает как болванчик и делает то, что ему скажут. В общем - от сюжета ждал большего.  Итог. Слишком большой мир. Если сделать локации более компактными, то играть будет в разы приятнее. Всё это приправлено устаревшей графикой. Стиль отличный, но - возможности палитры сильно ограничивают насыщенность визуальной части и не хватает детализации персонажей. Так же, спорный момент - это музыка. Она не плохая, просто слишком перенасыщает общий фон. Лучше бы был просто качественный ambient. Не блещет и сюжет - неплохой потенциал, убитый бредовой манерой повестования и бессмысленными диалогами. По геймплею - даже на эмуляторе, серия Metroid/Castlevania (SNES) играется намного приятнее, чем Axiom Verge  При всех своих немногочисленных положительных качествах, игра, которая вышла в 2015 г., не терпит никакого сравнения с другими представителями жанра - хотя бы с Super Metroid, которая вышла аж в 1994 г.  P.S. И ещё - личный минус автору/разработчику за релиз Axiom Verge 2 в виде эксклюзива на ПК в "лучшем игровом магазине".
Date 2021-01-08 Playtime 11h 6m Rec Positive solid psycodelic metroidvania. doesnt stand up to the greats and its a bit condusing to remember exactly where you need to go because the game doesnt exactly put a red gate and say find the red key card and come back. nor does the map help you out with that aspect even though its one of the only vanias ive played that has a subway system built in. Many upgrades feel like sidegrades and so you never really get the powertrip feeling or fun of dancing through the early games platforming with new abilities. Much more metroid than vania. Most bosses are basically variations of kraid so so if thats your jam this is the game.
Date 2021-01-08 Playtime 17h 44m Rec Positive + Beautiful and creepy alien world that is a joy to explore + Variety of creative weapons and upgrades + Amazing level design, especially (a majority of) secrets that test player's attentiveness and curiosity and, when found, result in a satisfying "aha!" feeling + Great music that fits the tone of the game perfectly + Engaging story, and "souls-like" world-building that is told through pieces of lore scattered all around the place and are always a pleasure to find and theorize on  - Lack of fast travel (not counting the hub room), which is a real shame because IMO the story could have easily allowed and justified it [spoiler] as Trace, when "dying", is "rebirthed" in the last egg via constructing a body around the nanogates with his data, so there's nothing that prevents him from just passing his nanogates between the eggs [/spoiler]  - Some (a small minority, to be fair) of the secrets are hidden behind walls that look just like any other wall, with nothing indicating that something's there. So instead of being a test of player's attention to details and memory it becomes a dumb habit to drill or bump or corrupt every wall (I didn't bother, but completionists will have to deal with that) - The biggest con, or rather a warning. The D-pad. You can control the character with either the D-pad or the thumb stick. But this game is designed with D-pad in mind. And it's not just that it doesn't have granular movement speed control that can be achieved with the analog thumb stick. It has a dash mechanic that is activated with double pressing a direction. So it's a total pain when using the thumb stick. The problem is, it becomes crucial later in the game, when there are enemies or platforming challenges that pretty much require you to use the dash (well, if you don't want to tank the damage or get a bit frustrated). Early in the game, it's the other way around - the game has 8 directions, so naturally I started using the stick, because diagonal aiming on a D-pad is uncomfortable. And as a result, I got so used to it, that I couldn't switch back to D-pad when the game really needed me to. Or rather, I wasn't ready to invest the time into reconditioning myself. So the last couple of hours of the game felt a bit frustrating because of that. A word of advice - don't get used to the stick. Disable it in the settings, the game allows the player to do that, too bad I didn't connect the dots fast enough.
Date 2021-01-08 Playtime 19h 2m Rec Positive Maravilhoso, simples assim. Um carta de amor para os fãs do gênero.
Date 2021-01-06 Playtime 10h 30m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a Metroidvania styled game with heavy H.R. Giger influenced in all pixel art glory, created by one individual, it's a beautiful and atmospheric game with top notch music and sound design that complements it.There's lots of secrets and even more areas to explore. With a sequel over the horizon, what better time than now to dive into a truly bizarre experience for people who admire these kind of games.
Date 2021-01-06 Playtime 18h 43m Rec Positive 👍
Date 2021-01-05 Playtime 17h 10m Rec Negative The game is incredibly generic and rather boring. The general combat and bosses suck. There are a million weapon types but the combat is so uninteresting that it all goes to waste, you just use the strongest weapon you have and ignore the rest. There is no fast travel system in between save points which gets very annoying. Backtracking through the game is not interesting seeing as how the first time through most areas wasn't interesting to begin with. The game uses the old "shoot at random walls" to look for powerups gimick that gets very annoying. And with no in-game radar or hint system it is completely impossible to 100% this game without a guide. Unless you want to run into and drill all 4 walls of every room in the game. I only managed to get 78% of the items in my first playthrough and I felt like I was relatively thorough in my "exploration".  My initial 2-3 hours of the game were fairly positive, but after that the game started to feel pretty repetitive and uninteresting and I only finished it because it was past the refund window. The game isn't completely unplayable as much as I'm shitting on it, it's just not really worth your time or money if you haven't already invested in it.   I can not recommend this game when there are so many other great "metroidvanias" that completely blow this game out of the water in every possible way.  IMO you should buy and play this list of "Metroidvanias" before you EVER consider buying this game out of boredom.  Dandara Eniromental Station Alpha Gato Roboto Guacamelee! 1&2 Hollow Knight Ori 1&2

Date 2021-01-03 Playtime 11h 16m Rec Positive One of the best modern metroidvanias that tells a Story in a very subtile way. Makes you wanna Explore more and more. It ist very Super Metroid Like. Which is a good thing. I found lots of weapons Not very useful.
Date 2021-01-02 Playtime 18h 4m Rec Positive Great Metroid tribute, but could use better bosses and it needs to be better at giving clues as to how to continue in certain spots, as it is easy to get stuck. But I liked it, overall. 8/10

Date 2021-01-01 Playtime 17h 27m Rec Positive If you've been itching to play a new 2D Metroid, but cant wait for a new one to come out, this is the game for you.
Date 2020-12-31 Playtime 1h 0m Rec Negative After trying to play through this game, I had to change my review to negative. The backtracking is insane, and I somehow lost all my powerups after returning. It has promise if the game could be updated to address the backtracking issue.
Date 2020-12-31 Playtime 22h 36m Rec Positive A unique gaming experience. Story, action, intrigue, which is unlikely for a platformer. I'd say Another World meets La-Mulana meets the very first Duke Nukem meets Soul Reaver meets Half-Life. Yeah, that's a lot of games, meaning this is truly a unique gaming experience.  TL;DR: A solid 9/10, would recommend to anyone.  Design: 9/10 Level progression is non-linear and in fact there are no "levels", it's an open-world platformer (kind of like Soul Reaver or La-Mulana). Player wakes up and can explore the whole of the game from the start. Certain places are out of reach until bosses are slain which are guarding items that give the player new abilities (e.g. long jump). Each region has its own "boss", enemies and secrets to explore. Transition between regions is flawless and first impressions of each region have been polished so the player knows what to watch out for in the new region. UI is furnished with a minimap; players can also put up to two markers per region, to track points of interest for further reference. The full map is quite large for a one-man team. The final level puts a few very annoying monsters between your respawn point and the boss(es) which is a bit annoying. Also making the jump from the Zi region to return back from whence you came is rather hard without certain items (e.g. grappling hook). I would consider these two flaws in the design, which is why the grade is 9 and not 10. Grappling hook feels a bit clunky and not polished enough (pressing an arrow key too long will ungrapple; I recommend the author to take rope from Worms games as an excellent example of how this grappling hook could act like).  Music: 10/10 I like how dynamic it is and how the low-health-alarm-beeping blends in with the combat music.  Story: 8/10 Game feels a bit short. It would be nice though if the player could chose a different ending. The game offers non-linear exploration already, why not let the player decide on the ending as well? If there were DLCs offering micro-expansions I would totally be into them.  AI: 9/10 Compared to other platformers this game offers a surprisingly good AI, which really brings the enemies to life. Each of them act differently, have different strengths and weaknesses, and the player is rewarded if they study and exploit them. Still sometimes AI can get stuck and doesn't know how to proceed to finding you.
Date 2020-12-30 Playtime 10h 26m Rec Positive Pretty good metroidvania. If you like those kinds of games you will enjoy this. Unfortunately this game doesn't really stand out compared to what inspired it.
Date 2020-12-29 Playtime 13h 8m Rec Positive Um ótimo metroidvania, com muito mais referências a Metroid do que Castlevania. Um enredo que te segura para saber o desfecho da história. Um mapa clássico de Metroidvania que te deixa progredir somente se você consegue updates para seus equipamentos e te faz voltar a algum ponto anterior para conseguir alcançar algum ponto para a progressão da história. A trilha sonora coeza que traz um clima Biopunk para o jogo. Com certeza um dos melhores jogos do estilo.
Date 2020-12-28 Playtime 22h 45m Rec Positive Fantastic exploration and some fun weapons and gadgets. I missed a few more memorable boss encounters, and some areas are a bit boring. But overall a fantastic metroidvania.
Date 2020-12-26 Playtime 1h 28m Rec Positive its pretty ok  6/10 Axioms
Date 2020-12-26 Playtime 18h 4m Rec Positive I played this game so long I peed myself before I noticed I had to go to the bathroom. I haven't done that since I was 5.
Date 2020-12-25 Playtime 36h 2m Rec Positive Игра просто отличная! Она дарит прекрасные ощущения при помощи различных визуальных решений и шедевральной музыки
Date 2020-12-25 Playtime 69h 30m Rec Positive one of the best metroidvanias out there
Date 2020-12-25 Playtime 43h 2m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is the work of a creative genius. And thanks to this game there is now something that rhymes with orange. 10/10
Date 2020-12-25 Playtime 25h 17m Rec Positive A great Metroid-esque game cut from the mold of the old NES style. A variety of weapons and upgrades to be found which test your gaming sensibilities to acquire. Interesting bosses as well. That said, story is rather convoluted and some minor issues with controls may detract from your experience. That is a very minor complaint however.
Date 2020-12-24 Playtime 19h 5m Rec Positive Better Than I'd Expect From an Official Metroid Sequel  This is a Metroid game in every way possible without violating Nintendo's intellectual property. Not a lazy clone though, more like a worthy entry in the franchise, with a distinct aesthetic, plot, and roster of abilities and enemies. Where things must be different, they're fresh and tasteful.  For those unfamiliar with Metroid, I'd compare Axiom Verge with Hollow Knight. Not quite as good, and very different in style, but enjoyable in a similar way. If you like one, you'll probably like the other.  Update: after finishing the game I have two complaints to add.  First, compared to official 2D Metroid titles, the boss fights and ending are lackluster. Axiom Verge simply doesn't do big action setpieces as well as Metroid.  Second, in the late game, exploration and joyful discovery are replaced with rather aimless, tedious, and frustrating backtracking. I passed one late obstacle due to a nonlocal effect I didn't see coming: I didn't gain a tool to pass it, the location simply changed due to something I did far away. If I was told about this somehow, I missed it, and I only discovered the change by returning to an area I "knew" was a dead end, out of frustration.  All in all, I still enjoyed it very much and look forward to the sequel.
Date 2020-12-24 Playtime 0h 53m Rec Positive METROID. Original from Nintendo Metroid. Yeah it's heavily inspired and YEAH IT ROCKS. This is a masterpiece, absolutely recommended! Old School Vibe 100%
Date 2020-12-22 Playtime 19h 29m Rec Positive 見た目の通りの『メトロイド』クローンではあるものの、アイテムや仕掛けは『メトロイド』とは異なっており、シリーズ経験者でも新鮮な気持ちで遊ぶことができた。カットシーンやフレーバーテキストアイテムもあり、プレイモチベーションを保ちやすいのも嬉しい。  マップの広さはそこまで大きくはなく、隅々まで探索しようと思えばちょうどいいくらいの広さ。ただ、次に行くべき場所へのヒントみたいなものはなく、中盤以降になると、先に進むために若干トリッキーなひらめきが必要になる箇所が出てくるため、一度正規ルートを見失うと、その後長時間迷い続けることもあり、若干興が削がれる。  アクションとしての手応えは、ノーマルであればそこそこで、この手のアクションゲームに慣れた人であれば、そこの難易度で詰まることは少ないと思われる。アイテムをきちんと収集していれば問題ないが、終盤はノーダメージでのクリアは不可能ではと思うところもあるため好みは分かれると思う。  世界観は難解かつ独特で、ダークなSFが好きな人にはハマると思うが、昨今のこの手のジャンルでは主流のライトな「kawaii」キャラクターものが好みの人には応えてくれる要素は全くない。探索アクションとしてはオーソドックスでボリュームもほどよいと思うので、ハードコアなメトロイドファン以外にもオススメできる。
Date 2020-12-21 Playtime 0h 12m Rec Positive куку 
Date 2020-12-21 Playtime 13h 40m Rec Positive The music is great, the items are fun to use, and the visuals are lovely. Inspired me to read through Blame! and BioMega again. My only complaint is that some things weren't quite explained too well, like the passcode tool's usage outside of translating notes. Still, this game is great and worth playing. Pick it up and enjoy.
Date 2020-12-21 Playtime 124h 35m Rec Positive Great metroidvania
Date 2020-12-19 Playtime 15h 33m Rec Positive Great game very much inspired by Metroid. Definitely recommended if you like the fighting/exploration/collection of the similar metroid games. Try not to spoil the story or secrets for yourself, they're a lot of fun to discover.  Pros: Fun gameplay and lots of great content like art, areas, enemies, items, weapons, secrets. There's definitely more secrets than you can ever find on your own, keeps you observant but you'll still miss stuff. The story was surprisingly interesting and well done. Cons: Sometimes the controls can be a little clunky feeling, particularly the 8-angle aiming, but it's definitely part of the difficulty designed into the game so it is fun too. The boss fights can be a little simple, don't really switch up their strategies, but they're not too annoying if you can learn the patterns.
Date 2020-12-18 Playtime 23h 26m Rec Positive if you manage to get trough the outdated graphic and embrace the pixelart this game is quite enjoyable  the way this game implement fresh new mechanic to the core platformer style WOW they way the story is told trough the pixelart, the short cutscene, the message hidden in the map. it made me feel like the more i play the more i understood the story this is like the hidden metroidvania gem that barely anyone know about
Date 2020-12-15 Playtime 41h 40m Rec Positive Muitobom
Date 2020-12-14 Playtime 36h 25m Rec Negative I enjoyed most of this game, but the further I got into it, the less fun it became. Mostly because of the dashing. Every time my dashing upgraded I let out an audible sigh because it just became more difficult to control. Having to double tap a direction to dash which you can do while jumping is awful. My guy would just randomly dash around while I was trying to fight stuff too. Just make it a button that makes you dash in the direction you're moving. It's silly but that alone, and not being able to remap it to a key just made the end of this game so not fun. Aside from the dashing, the game was pretty fun. Even on hard most of the game wasn't that difficult.
Date 2020-12-11 Playtime 11h 33m Rec Positive 9/10 on a strict edge scale very addivtive but at the same time, a very HARD game! 
Date 2020-12-10 Playtime 27h 47m Rec Positive More like a metroid game than castlevania. The weapons and boss fights are quite good and challenging.
Date 2020-12-10 Playtime 13h 25m Rec Positive Great game, only negative is I wish fast travel was unlocked earlier.
Date 2020-12-09 Playtime 14h 1m Rec Positive Increíble juego. Su estilo retro marca un ambiente y recuerda a buenos juegos como metroid y castlevania
Date 2020-12-08 Playtime 35h 6m Rec Negative Even though my complaints are minimal, I will not be replaying the game.  It's was a good copy-paste of Metroid. Unique aspects and elements throughout where the world felt like this living, breathing, visceral thing that is dying along with a great soundtrack.   First, it's easy to wander around and think, 'I'm not supposed to go this way' after watching your health bar get slashed to pieces when you walk through a door and there's a monster hanging out on the other side of the door way. This happened plenty of times along with falling down a hole in the floor and then a ball of shit leaps out of the bricks I landed on and knocking me into the dirt. After looking at a walk-through, you find you need to glitch your way through a pile of bricks and then through a wall that contains a power-up. I don't have time or patience for "humping" every wall or patch of dirt to %100 this, I just want to game and relax.  Next, there are a lot of power-ups that shoot a rainbow-variety in thirty different directions but I didn't end up using them just because the regular shot is point and click. Using other power-ups feel satisfying when they hit an enemy but chances of it actually hitting your target are low.   Finally the story: there's a lot of notes and logs you can find through out and the characters have back-and-forths but I didn't care. My concern going into this world is "I NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE AND BACK TO WORK!" but there is this plot that someone was here before, everything is corrupt, etc. but I didn't know why my character was doing the things he did. The character, Trace, trusts these voices and machines right off the bat. I personally didn't trust them. I was trying to find an endgame with them thinking they'll turn on me, maybe they'll be decommissioned for a reason and I had blindly followed their orders to bring them back to power, or something interesting but it's standard, flat good guys vs. standard, flat bad guys.  By the time of the fourth boss fight, I was ready for this whole thing to be over with. I'm reminded of this: Don't be subtle until page 3. If I don't know or care about these people or setting, then I'm not going to care when I get thrust into something without any understanding context.
Date 2020-12-07 Playtime 8h 21m Rec Positive 11/10
Date 2020-12-07 Playtime 11h 2m Rec Positive Solid Metroidvania, perfect length and unique powerups. Certainly one of the genre's best.
Date 2020-12-06 Playtime 11h 1m Rec Positive What a classic Metroidvania game this is! Really solid gameplay, great traversal abilities, cool weapons and such a strong emphasis on exploration. It can get slightly exhaustive when you get stuck again not knowing where to go, but in the end it's never too hard to find your way (plus the feeling of accomplishment once you do is great). I actually really enjoyed the story and was amazed by the well-fitting OST. After finishing the game with most of the map explored I didn't go for 100% completion just because the game lacks a fast-travel feature. I understand that feature not existing (for normal story progression it would take away from design of the game), but would really like it for cleaning up.
Date 2020-12-06 Playtime 27h 25m Rec Positive Un ottimo Metroid-like (o Metroidvania che dir si voglia), impegnativo ma senza essere mai frustrante. Appaganti gli scontri con i boss, stile da vendere, colonna sonora interessante, alcuni pezzi rimangono in testa per mesi.
Date 2020-12-06 Playtime 6h 17m Rec Negative Imagine a dull, glitchy (and not in the intended way) Metroidvania filled entirely with floating medusa heads and bats as enemies and you've got Axiom Verge. Enemies are solely designed to slow you down and frustrate your jumps. Upgrades are amazingly linear and any clever sequence breaking means you're likely stuck. You have to die to enemies or reset the game in that case - the developer clearly didn't plan for adventurous players. Listen to the soundtrack somewhere and you'll have 90% of the good parts without the annoyance.
Date 2020-12-05 Playtime 24h 58m Rec Positive Serious Metroid Vibes
Date 2020-12-05 Playtime 13h 37m Rec Positive 良質メトロイドヴァニア。 おどろおどろしい不気味な世界観が本家メトロイドを彷彿とさせて良い。 シナリオも考察しがいのある内容でグッド。  ゲーム性も清く正しくメトロイド。 メトロイドが面白かった人は間違いなく面白いでしょう。  けどヒント不足で進行が詰まりかける箇所があったりするのはメトロイドでも初代に近いかも。 そのレトロ感を楽しめるかどうかは人を選びそう。  ローカライズは所々拙いが許容範囲。 一部特殊メッセージが未翻訳、そのせいで一部謎解きの難度が上がっているのは頂けない。   総評としては「とにかくメトロイドがやりたい」なら買い。
Date 2020-12-05 Playtime 32h 7m Rec Positive Definitely buy! One of the ultimate Metroidvania games!!  Challenging yet fun bosses, outstanding soundtrack and so much more!
Date 2020-12-05 Playtime 11h 19m Rec Positive Awesome Soundtrack Great Look  Controls are a bit wonky on an Xbox One Controller (may work better d-pad only?)
Date 2020-12-04 Playtime 16h 16m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a game I CONSTANTLY recommend, and have bought multiple times to gift to friends. It is a HIGHLY WORTHY spiritual successor to Super Metroid, and I say that as someone who considers Super Metroid as her favorite game of all time. If you like Metroid / Metroidvanias at all, don't hesitate. Axiom Verge is wonderful.
Date 2020-12-04 Playtime 9h 9m Rec Negative bad
Date 2020-12-04 Playtime 10h 46m Rec Positive Terrific atmospheric music and gorgeous, sometimes unsettling pixel artwork. Nice diversity in stages, baddies, weaponry and tricky secrets. The challenge level on Normal is so-so for a seasoned retro gamer, but nonetheless, Axiom Verge feels great, looks great (For classic pixels), has an intriguing sci-fi storyline and generally has a lot of original charm. That being said, it would fit in beautifully in a cartridge right alongside any classic Metroid game.
Date 2020-12-03 Playtime 22h 14m Rec Positive Я долго подходил к этой игре из-за ее внешнего вида. Пиксельные платформеры мне нравятся, но не сильная и пестрая "простота" отталкивала. И тем не менее, в какой-то момент решил начать, так как очень нравилась затрагиваемая сюжетом тема. Скажу, что на удивление, очень и очень понравилась. Есть только две не понравившиеся вещи: слишком много оружия, половина из которого, имхо, бесполезный мусор, удобный только 1-2 раза за всю игру... И слишком много очень не очевидных, даже минимальным намеком, секретов. То есть, огромный шанс попросту не получить каких-то улучшений и достижений на них банально из-за того, пропустил место, хотя и отлично справляешься с секретами в других играх(вот тут, кстати, сильно и выпирает чрезмерная пестрость картинки в некоторых таких случаях). В остальном, это отличный геймплей, музыка, какая-никакая атмосфера, и разумеется, интересный, хоть и редкий, сюжет. Однозначно советую.
Date 2020-12-03 Playtime 22h 21m Rec Positive The Best!
Date 2020-12-03 Playtime 13h 1m Rec Positive Je suis un grand fan du genre metroidvania, et ce jeu a été une aventure ma foi fort sympathique. Il n'est pas parfait mais il fait le taf quand on dit dans le milieu.  Le style très inspiré génération SNES est parfaitement respecté et touchera tout les amateurs de cette époque. le jeu est globalement beau et très inspiré Metroid surtout. Peut être un petit bémol mais le designer a peut être eu la main un peu lourde sur la palette du violet mais ça va c'est pour chipoter. L'histoire est ok, c'est pas le grand cliché mais ce n'est pas le trone de fer non plus. Le twist final est sympa mais un chouia attendu. Mais ça fait largement le taf.  Le level design à la metroid est très bien foutu et aux petits oignons. Un régal du début à la fin, comme dirait Stallone dans Cliffhanger "Je retrouve mes sensations". Encore une fois pour chipoter mais j'avais un peu pété un câble à l'époque, mais il y a un passage pas clair où j'ai dû aller chercher sur internet et j'aurai jamais trouvé tout seul. Mais à part ça c'est très bien.  J'ai beaucoup aimé l'innovation avec ce que j'appelle le "glitch gun". C'était intéressant et ça a donné tout le sel du jeu qui s'est totalement démarqué grâce à ça. Même si la plupart des spots sont évidents, pour ceux qui aiment fouiner il y a des zones à ratisser avec ça et le nombre de secrets à découvrir est tout simplement mirobolant.  Un certain bémol pour ce qui est des boss du jeu. Ils sont gros et bien travaillé mais trop faciles, ce qui fait qu'ils ne sont absolument pas mémorables. Et surtout le boss de fin qui a été une grosse déception.  Un autre point qui manque par rapport à un metroid mais on n'a pas le sentiment de claustrophobie que j'ai quand je joue à n'importe quel metroid. Le personnage est plus petit et donc on a plus d'espace pour se déplacer et esquiver, les boss grands mais faciles n'aident pas, on n'a pas le sentiment d'être une souris coincée et c'est un peu dommage mais c'est une ambiance difficile à retranscrire il faut avouer.  Bref ce jeu est plutôt cool, j'en garde un bon souvenir, peut être un poil court quand on ne fait pas le collectathlon. En promo à 15 balles il vaut son pesant de cacahuètes.
Date 2020-12-02 Playtime 27h 43m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a wonderful metroidvania, perhaps one of the finest in it's genre. While there might be better ones out there, Axiom Verge is the closest to replicating the terror and atmosphere of the original Metroid series. And for that, it gets a MASTAH PEAS in my book.
Date 2020-12-02 Playtime 14h 21m Rec Positive Yup
Date 2020-12-02 Playtime 8h 23m Rec Negative Clunky controls, few movement upgrades, troll enemy location with knockback that will drop you way down, and an unfortunately straightforward path with no freedom and flexibility makes this game far from the Super Metroid it wants to be. Yes, it looks and sounds unique, and the story can be intriguing if you're willing to collect all the scattered notes and decipher it. But these are the only good things I can say about this game, and they are not gameplay related, nor can they save it from being plain and boring underneath.  You can go on a small adventure, solve an interesting puzzle and feel like a genius for a moment - only to get 1/6 of an upgrade or the 20th gun that you will never use. The game constantly insults you with pathetic rewards for long trackbacks and punishes you for trying to think out of the box. For example, until you get a mediocre upgrade during the later hours of the game, you have almost no reason to kill enemies since they give you nothing but small chunks of health back - that you'd better not waste on them in the first place. Some of the upgrades you get are cookie cutter material for the genre, but they cannot be used outside their intended lock and key function, while the fresh upgrades that can make this game fun are received so close to the ending that the game will be over before you can even enjoy them.  This game is not what people make you think it is and I pretty much regret playing it. And if you're going to defend this game, at least be honest - there's no excuse for double tapping the arrow keys to dash, and no excuse for this not being changed to a hot key during the 5 years in which this game is released.
Date 2020-12-01 Playtime 14h 34m Rec Positive Questo titolo era nei miei radar da tempo, in quanto spesso presente nelle classifiche dei migliori metroidvania. Tuttavia, non mi ero mai minimamente informato sul gioco, nè visto qualcosa che non fosse il trailer sulla pagina di Steam. Appena ho avuto l’occasione, quindi, ho dovuto provarlo. Devo dire che l’esperienza mi ha un po’ travolto: mi sono trovato in un gioco che è la quintessenza stessa dei metroidvania classici, con tutti i pregi e difetti che ne conseguono. L’omaggio al genere non potrebbe essere più ovvio, anche grazie ad una serie di cliché e meccaniche quanto più capostipiti del genere. Niente fronzoli, con un gameplay incentrato sull’esplorazione delle molte aree della mappa. Una storia che rimane un’ po’ nel vago abbozza un contesto in cui si muove il giocatore, senza però guidarlo, se non in maniera superficiale. Sebbene un po’ deluso da un finale secondo me non all’altezza e da qualche scelta, probabilmente arbitraria, di gameplay, si è comunque rivelato meritevole del plauso che ha ricevuto  [h1]In breve:[/h1] -un titolo sicuramente non adatto a tutti. Apprezzabilissimo dagli appassionati del metroidvania nudo e crudo, ma che per lo stesso motivo potrebbe risultare poco accessibile e anche frustrante a chi è abituato alle comodità. Un gioco che si basa sull’esplorazione minuziosa di ogni angolo e che premia il giocatore attento. Molto ispirato artisticamente, avrebbe giovato di qualche rifinitura nel combattimento, soprattutto per quanto riguarda i boss  [h1]Pro:[/h1] -artisticamente molto ispirato, sia nei nemici, soprattutto i boss, che nelle ambientazioni -esplorazione molto incentivata e premiata, con numerosi collezionabili e potenziamenti opzionali ottenibili solo con un'attenta perlustrazione delle aree di gioco -grande varietà nella tipologia di proiettili utilizzabili e nei power up necessari per proseguire nella mappa -furbi accorgimenti di level design per cercare di guidare indirettamente il giocare nella giusta direzione -storia un po’ cliché ma che svolge molto bene il suo lavoro, e non priva di colpi di scena  [h1]Contro:[/h1] -boss con pochissimi pattern di attacco, cosa che in genere si traduce in un combattimento molto ripetitivo e poco entusiasmante, che spesso sa di “gimmicky” -assenza di un sistema di fast travel adeguato a navigare velocemente l’intera mappa, cosa che si traduce in sezioni di backtracking che possono essere anche parecchio lunghe -capita molto spesso che quando più di un power up sia necessario per accedere ad una certa area, l’ordine di questi sia tale da far pensare al giocatore di avere il giusto potenziamento per superare il primo ostacolo, per trovarsi bloccato subito dopo dal successivo di cui non era a conoscenza, lasciandolo con l’amara consapevolezza di aver solo perso tempo -presenza di un continuo “beep beep” quando si è a poca vita. Cos’è, pokemon?
Date 2020-11-30 Playtime 0h 54m Rec Positive Nach vielen positiven Tests endlich gekauft und spielt sich toll. Zu Beginn jedoch mit einem faden Beigeschmack, weil ich mit dem Keyboard anstelle dem Controller spielte:  Was negativ auffiel: * Beim Keyboard ist der Exit/Quit-Key bei den Menüs auf "Q" gemapped anstelle auf der sonst üblichen "ESC"-Taste. Das sollte definitiv nachgebessert werden. Also seid gewarnt und ladet im Zweifelsfall die Anleitung im PDF-Format runter, bevor ihr das erste Mal mit dem Keyboard spielt. * Die kleinen Dialogsequenzen können nicht wie üblich durchgeklickt werden, man wird jedes mal gefragt "ob man sich sicher ist, ob man abbrechen will" - mit Default "nein". Hier ebenso ein wenig schräg implementiert und verbesserungswürdig.  Absolut positiv: * Ansonsten schönes Game-Design, ist wirklich ein schöner Metroid-Klon geworden, irgendwo zwischen NES und SNES angesiedelt * Tolle Grafiken * Und vor allem ganz, ganz tolle Musik!!!  Und wird als physical-Release noch in meiner Switch-Sammlung landen ;-)
Date 2020-11-30 Playtime 23h 48m Rec Positive Conheci Metroid através do GBA e fico muito grato que hoje tenham criado para PC jogos no mesmo estilo. Axiom verge me proporcionou a experiencia de um SuperMetroid, Metroid: Fusion, com muitas armas diferentes, upgrades jamais previstos e os clássicos puzzles para conseguir power ups. Valeu muito a pena cada hora que permaneci jogando.
Date 2020-11-30 Playtime 34h 33m Rec Positive Definitely one of the best MetroidVanias ever made.
Date 2020-11-28 Playtime 19h 26m Rec Positive While not the most wildly imaginative Metroidvania title, it picks its theme and sticks with them hard.  It has a super solid internal consistency, and a solid tool set coupled with amazing level design, impressive grotesque bosses, and a pretty awesome soundtrack to top it all off.
Date 2020-11-28 Playtime 9h 10m Rec Positive Classic metroidvania. Satisfying mechanics. Some power-ups are overly/annoyingly hidden.
Date 2020-11-28 Playtime 16h 28m Rec Positive When I think of the genre "metroidvania", this is the exact game that comes to mind. Many people call hollow knight the "peak of the genre", but I think this comes closer to it. There are some small health and power upgrades hidden behind collisionless walls as well as some obscure password noticing to be had, but this game absolutely nails its atmosphere from the art to the music to the story and lore of its world. The variety in the weapons is also very nice and very different from other games I've played. It is an extremely polished package with some very fun abilities that keep you wanting more. I can't wait for the sequel.
Date 2020-11-27 Playtime 28h 26m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvania games I have played. Smart game design, cool bosses and absolutely great soundtrack. The game is quite challenging but rewarding.
Date 2020-11-27 Playtime 8h 55m Rec Negative Crashes to desktop constantly, making the game unplayable.
Date 2020-11-26 Playtime 13h 3m Rec Positive good game buy it
Date 2020-11-26 Playtime 14h 36m Rec Positive Fun sidescroller with alot of cool weapons and powerups, theres also some thinking needed to know where to go next as you can find new paths with the powerups you find. Overall a really good game.
Date 2020-11-26 Playtime 11h 53m Rec Positive Lukewarm on this one -- good enough to try out if you're into this kind of thing. Despite keyboard mapping being unintuitive for non-gameplay stuff (q does what esc would usually do, for example) this game has been alright so far.  It's not exceptional in any way, but it has its charm to it and I enjoyed the sound track a good amount, it's might be worth a try. While the art style is sometimes a bit bland and sometimes even offensive, some new areas are quite beautiful and made me feel a sense of wonder -- exploration has been fun enough to continue playing.  I do wish each area had its own characteristic style, sometimes it feels like the world is just a bunch of random rooms / collections of rooms pasted together, which can takes away from how cohesive it could feel. It can prevent you from associating each area with a certain vibe. The boss fights are one of the big  places where the game is lacking -- I really enjoy the boss music but some of these fights were just so simple. For one of the fights, I could just stand still in the right place while crouching and select the right weapon and continually fire at the thing until it died. I think this game is overrated, but it still has handed me some fun and memorable gaming experiences so I'm giving it a thumbs-up anyway. I definitely have to be in a particular mood to play this though.
Date 2020-11-25 Playtime 54h 11m Rec Positive Great classic style game. I recommend using a controller. Feels like SNES!
Date 2020-11-25 Playtime 14h 9m Rec Positive Plays like a great Metroid game. Story and soundtrack are read as well.
Date 2020-11-24 Playtime 170h 37m Rec Positive Would absolutely recommend this game.  A solid metroidvania with tons of flavor, nostalgia, and creativity.  I'm impressed every time the story and mechanics progress in the game.  One of the premium metroidvanias.
Date 2020-11-23 Playtime 26h 41m Rec Positive Great game, not just for being an awesome metroidvania, but also how it expands this genre with some amazing storytelling. Also nice to have a game that you don't need to put 10 quazillion hours into.
Date 2020-11-23 Playtime 16h 27m Rec Positive This is the new Metroid we deserved but never got from Nintendo.  Solid work.
Date 2020-11-19 Playtime 33h 24m Rec Positive I would recommend this game.
Date 2020-11-18 Playtime 16h 3m Rec Positive Сойдёт.  Под конец, правда, игра начинает слишком душить.
Date 2020-11-18 Playtime 22h 44m Rec Positive Very much love this style of game. Immersive sci-fi story, very refined controls, always another secret area to discover. A timeless art style. Take a bow Tom Happ!
Date 2020-11-17 Playtime 12h 27m Rec Positive I remember when Metroid was fun. Before Other M kind of knee-capped the series and prevented a proper new entry from releasing for... how long was it again? (looking it up now) Almost ten years.   It's great indie creators have stepped in to fill that void over the years. And while I'm late in recommending this, Axiom Verge is still worth every minute of your gaming time to pick up and play to the end. And with Axiom Verge 2 around the corner, there isn't a better time to get it (aside from when it launched, but none of us can really time travel).   The puzzles are interesting. The environments are gorgeous. There is a pretty solid, haunting story beneath all the beautiful artwork and fun gameplay. There are sections that are, indeed, a little frustrating because of my dumb brain not fully jiving with platformer mechanics. But this a solid recommendation for anyone who loves the Metroid-style of gameplay but can't really get their fix from recent Nintendo releases (or lack thereof). Fingers-crossed Axiom Verge 2 can live up to what the original put out for us.
Date 2020-11-14 Playtime 17h 57m Rec Positive Jeu très sympa rappelant Supermetroid et de nouvelle action de mouvement bien sympathique.
Date 2020-11-14 Playtime 6h 41m Rec Positive way cool
Date 2020-11-13 Playtime 29h 26m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is one of my all time favourite games and one of the best metroidvanias ever, in my opinion on par with the original metroid series. It is a must-play for every fan of the genre. The graphics sport a retro pixel look that oozes style and character. Especially the bosses look crazy, alien and unlike anything you have seen before. These bosses are a centerpiece of the gameplay as well, they are quite challenging and require a bit of tactics.  The second centerpiece in my opinion are the weapons. There is a pretty big selection of them and they have a huge variaty, some allow you to utilize completely new tactics. Almost all of them feel very powerfull and give a very satisfying impact with big graphical effects. Of course there are also some weapons and upgrades that unlock new paths, as is customary for the genre. The soundtrack is awesome as well. It greatly underlines the vibe of otherworldly ancient scifi ruines that is established by the artstyle. And even now years later I sometimes find myself randomly humming the title track "The Axiom". The story is a nice treat for everyone that loves mystery and there are a good number of secrets to find as well. Secret messages, secret weapons and even secret rooms. I actually spent some time manually decoding a few messages written in alien glyphs because the secrets of this world intrigued me so much.  tl;dr it's an amazing metroidvania, buy it!
Date 2020-11-13 Playtime 0h 26m Rec Negative Here's a tip, capturing old era style games doesn't mean you can't change the annoying and not so fun parts of them.  Like what pray tell?  Lets see, every time you save it takes a few seconds.  Why does this need to happen every single time?  Every time you enter a new room, screen goes black for a second to "transfer over" to the next stage.  I get it, metroidvania, ha ha ha.    If not for these minor - yet very frequent mechanics - game would be fun to enjoy.
Date 2020-11-09 Playtime 11h 14m Rec Positive Excellent Metroidvania
Date 2020-11-09 Playtime 34h 42m Rec Positive Epic!
Date 2020-11-09 Playtime 76h 2m Rec Positive I started this game a while ago and came back to it recently. I began on hard to make it a deeper experience and completely avoided looking at the internet for help (except for one passcode). This game becomes an extremely rich experience as you try to figure out the secrets in the game using the tools at your disposal. I really enjoyed code breaking the languages in the game too.  A majority of the boss fights are rough on hard and you have to come up with a great strategy to win. My only qualm is that if you press the same firing selection again it can switch to a recent selection. It's convenient for switching between 2 shots but it can be easy to goof up in boss fights. I was also unable to go or shoot diagonally up+left for some reason. I don't know if that was a designed feature or a glitch?  Overall this game is extremely polished and I thoroughly enjoy the mystery, challenge and creative style. There was one area I phased through near the bottom of the first area and got stuck but that was the only glitch I encountered. I found out there's a second AV coming out which is pretty exciting.
Date 2020-11-09 Playtime 25h 25m Rec Positive ;tldr, 7/10 - Good scifi time, too many weapons/tools that maybe could have been realized better.  Metroid, but not really. This is a great, medium sized metroidvania that leans heavily on the first half of that equation. ~~  There are a LOT of weapons to collect and most of them are optional. I find this to be both a pro and a con. On one hand, more stuff! Who doesnt like stuff and while I might love the flame thrower, maybe someone else doesnt. Its good to be able to make that choice. There are however, more than twenty options, and some of them are randomly located and you can only get one per save file. It was cool, but also a pain.  The music is atmospheric more than ambient, and occasionally a damn good jam.  The bosses are all pretty cool to fight but use really basic attack patterns that make them not too hard, but not too satisfying either.  Really looking forward to the sequel. Will def play that when it comes out. Looking for a metroidvania while you wait for Silksong to come out? This might hold your attention for 10-15 hours
Date 2020-11-08 Playtime 17h 6m Rec Positive Really nice game if you enjoy the old Metroid style.
Date 2020-11-08 Playtime 29h 50m Rec Positive you are gonna want a game-pad, as the keyboard controls are busted. You can not look down and left while locked with default controls, when rebound there are still issues concerning the locking function. FABULOUS GAME don't get me wrong! I l o v e this game! I'm just sad that I am unable to really play it now that my controller is busted. 7/10, that control stuff just sucks. The story is great, the gameplay is great, great feel on a controller, great mechanics. You are gonna wanna come back to this one

Date 2020-11-02 Playtime 10h 48m Rec Negative Отличная игра, но пермаментно глючное управление под linux ( играешь будто на залитой сладким чаем клавиатуре, где клавиши то не нажимаются, то залипают), портит все удовольствие в ноль. Пробовал играть на разным компьютерах - везде абсолютно идентичные проблемы.
Date 2020-11-01 Playtime 12h 45m Rec Positive Axiom verge is one of my favorite Indie titles.  I love the atmosphere, music, and gameplay. Top notch game!
Date 2020-10-31 Playtime 13h 18m Rec Positive 12時間ほどで初回クリア。どうやら真エンドもあるようなので後でやっておきます。  エイリアン蔓延る世界で目覚めた研究者が各地を探索する、正しく”メトロイド”なレトロスタイル2Dアクション。ステージ構造に現代的な優しさはなく、新たなギミックを得たらマップの未探索エリアを残らず自分の足で探っていく必要がある。もはや懐かしいレベルのお堅さだ……。 かなり面白いと思ったのが、ゲーム紹介文中にもあるバグの要素。敵をバグらせたり自分をバグらせたりフィールドのバグをぶっ壊したりと、ノイズ込みの演出面がかなり良質。世界観の構成にも一役買っててすげーーいい感じでした。 難易度的には見た目よりずっと優しめで、どちらかといえば終盤エリアの初回探索中に死にそうになることが多かった。攻略法さえ把握すればめちゃめちゃ簡単、みたいな敵が相当多い印象。ラスボス含むいくつかのボスに関しては正直適切な解が分からずゴリ押してしまったのでちょっと申し訳ない気分にはなったが……。 唯一の気掛かりが日本語訳がかなりふわっふわしていること。言ってる内容はなんとなく理解できるしストーリーもきっちり分かるのだが、あれどうにかならんかな……それとも悪夢じみた世界観演出の一端としてあんな訳なのかな……分からん……。  総合的には見た目の割に優しめのアクションと昔ながらの足で片っ端から巡る探索スタイル、何よりバグの演出面がかなり良質なゲームでした。
Date 2020-10-31 Playtime 17h 10m Rec Positive Amazing! Best 8-bit metrodvania game I've played in years. Highly recommended!
Date 2020-10-30 Playtime 14h 10m Rec Positive Juegazo. Muy inspirado en Metroid, con todo lo bueno que ello conlleva, y con un giro de tuerca que lo mejora aún más.
Date 2020-10-30 Playtime 17h 19m Rec Positive This note is for my future-past-self: Axiom Verge is an absolute gem.  Have you ever loaded up the original metroidvania games and wished "damn, I wish the game didn't control like garbage" but still needed that sweet sweet nostalgia of channel 3 tube TV gaming? Play Axiom Verge.  Pros: - SNES stylized game with contra controls - Modernized ideas and gameplay - Fantastic soundtrack - Intriguing story with great ideas - Clever, not cruel, difficulty and secrets.  Cons: - I now want another 30+ hours of content - Needs a Secret World radar or something. I circled the map 3 times and only found 4/5.
Date 2020-10-29 Playtime 25h 4m Rec Positive Gran metroidvania, diseño de niveles interesante con bastantes armas y power ups como estamos acostumbrados en este genero.

Date 2020-10-24 Playtime 9h 59m Rec Positive I find my self torn. I had to use a walk through for this game, because apparently I am horrible at finding my way around. But, I enjoyed the combat, and the bosses, and the world it built. If you like metroidvania games, play this one. It is rather good. If you don't like those, maybe still play it, because there are walk through. It is is still a fun ride while you are on it. I enjoyed metroid fusion, because it told me where to go. I like the challange of 'how do I get there' vs 'where do I go now.
Date 2020-10-19 Playtime 4h 2m Rec Positive This is an amazing game that if you love games like the 2D Metroid games then you should be getting this. In fact I think its better than most of the Metroid series.
Date 2020-10-19 Playtime 15h 2m Rec Positive Давно хотел сесть за эту игру, вот появилось время. Ну что тут сказать - это снова метроидвания =))) Причем она больше метроид, чем вания, а обычно наоборот. Но не вздумайте играть в оригинальный Метроид, если получилось эту игру пройти - поломаете себе психику =))) Что понравилось: да все тут неплохо для представителя жанра - сюжет, музыка хорошая, большая карта, много секреток, которые кстати реально помогают в прохождении, короче, я не считаю время в игре потраченным впустую. Что не понравилось: порой заебывала бессмысленная беготня по карте, лучше бы телепортов понаставили хоть по одному на каждую локацию, и да - последний босс! Победить его - чистая удача. Интересно, это так и было задумано, что никакого паттерна нет, чистейшее хаотичное валилово тебя из разных видов оружия =))) Автор, камон, даже в буллет-хеллах паттерны есть и раскусить паттерн - это отдельное удовольствие =))) Но то, что автор у игры один, причем реально один - это респект! Надеюсь, что вторая часть будет лучше. Итог: 4/5 с уходом в тройку - неплохо, но ничего особенного.

Date 2020-10-18 Playtime 6h 47m Rec Positive Axiom Verge mi ha colpito al primo impatto. Quello che piu' mi ha attratto era lo stile pixelloso con un audio molto piacevole. Tuttavia non mi convinceva qualcosa nel gameplay. Dopo averlo installato però ho dovuto ricredermi. Anche il gameplay era ottimo con un fantastico equilibrio della difficolta' e con un potere esplorativo molto simile a quello di Metroid per lo Snes. I Boss di fine livello sono eccezzionali mentre le musiche si susseguono insieme agli effetti sonori gasando a dovere il giocatore. In alcuni punti il gioco diventa veramente difficile ma mai impossibile. La varieta' delle armi e' ottima. Lo story-board e' perfetto a volte geniale. In conclusione direi che Axiom Verge e' un titolo di altri tempi in chiave moderna ed e' unico nel suo genere anche se appartenente ai Metroid-vania.  PRESENTAZIONE 95% Di grande impatto a nche se con una grafica retrò  GRAFICA 95% Bella pixellosa al punto giusto,ben animata e variegata. Mappa molto ampia che sa sempre differenziarsi.  SONORO 95% Colonna sonora fantastica. Effetti sonori da brividi. Insomma....tutto quello che ci si aspetterebbe da un tripla A....non da Axiom Verge.  APPETIBILITA' 94% E' un titolo simile a Metroid e quindi vale la pena spenderci qualche oretta....  LONGEVITA' 95% ....peccato poi che qualche oretta diventino un sacco di ore.....  GLOBALE 95% Ragazzi scaricatelo!!!...erano anni che non mi divertivo così!!!

Date 2020-10-13 Playtime 7h 15m Rec Negative Tries very, very hard to be Super Metroid, but lacks the depth of story and atmosphere that made that game feel great. Have a walkthrough handy because some of the backtracking and puzzles can be especially obtuse.
Date 2020-10-12 Playtime 19h 31m Rec Positive One of the best Metroidvania games in past decade. One or two frustrating areas, but they don't detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.
Date 2020-10-12 Playtime 12h 34m Rec Positive Intriguing setting, feel very reminiscent of Metroid.  Combat is fairly challenging, exploration offers a lot of secrets for those willing to retread ground.  The highlight of the game for me was the soundtrack.  Pulse-pounding action tracks pair with otherworldly techno to immerse you in the alien atmosphere.
Date 2020-10-12 Playtime 19h 28m Rec Positive Very good
Date 2020-10-11 Playtime 13h 30m Rec Positive If you like Metroidvanias, this game is a must play.   This game is a love-letter to the old classics and the influence is undeniable.  It has so many clever little ideas which make the game a delight to explore. And although the aesthetic of the game is too oppressive and quick to wear-off on some players, I personally think it's quite charming. I don't want to nitpick, because I think this game stands very good on its merits.   I have never played anything quite like it.
Date 2020-10-10 Playtime 19h 48m Rec Positive the metroid-ness of this game has caused my stomach to grow hair within itself. If it wasnt for this game my stomach would still be cold and furless. Thank you Axiom Verge!
Date 2020-10-10 Playtime 14h 25m Rec Positive A metroidvania with a sci-fi-esque plot. Even though it took me over twice the time howlongtobeat.com says the average length is to beat the game, I greatly enjoyed this retro-themed RPG.

Date 2020-10-08 Playtime 15h 37m Rec Positive Mermão, que joguinho gostoso de jogar. Ele deixa você se perder no mapa e te encoraja a explorar cada cantinho do cenário e descobrir o caminho por conta própria, sem te segurar na mão. Coisa de Metroidvania COMPETENTE (nesse caso em particular, mais "Metroid" do que "Vania"). O jogo tem um arsenal de armas bem mais extenso do que eu esperava e eu cheguei a terminar o jogo sem desbloquear todas, devo revisitar em breve pra tentar o 100%, cada arma serve uma função e/ou um estilo de jogo, recomendo experimentar com todas com os diferentes inimigos do jogo. Os powerups são diferentes do que eu to acostumado na maioria dos Metroidvanias (de novo, o jogo segue mais a escola de Metroid do que Castlevania) e usa de algumas ideias bem originais, um belo toque de ar fresco, na minha opinião. Sinceramente eu não esperava muito da história desse jogo, mas acabei me surpreendendo, pq gostei bastante dos personagens e da história como um todo. To muito curioso pra ver como vai ser a continuação e pra onde vão levar isso.  Ah, e pelo amor de Deus... As músicas desse jogo são maravilhosas. Os cara tão de parabéns.

Date 2020-10-01 Playtime 23h 15m Rec Positive 过了很久才突发奇想要给“公理边缘”这款银河城游戏补一个评测。  说是银河城其实也不太准确，单一个“银河”足矣，“城”的味道我是没品出来 XD。  啊，说回游戏评价本身，一言以蔽之：过于平庸，平庸到有些乏味。打分的话，6.5/10。  剧情还行，有某个养女儿的游戏内味了，不过隔了这么久，具体讲了什么我已经忘完力。  游戏体验方面，流程里完全没有令人印象深刻的boss，场景重复利用度高得一批，难度一般，小怪很呆，boss很笨。 武器虽然多但基本上都没什么卵用，除了喷火枪初始枪电球枪都是废物。就是用bug枪可以把敌人刷成glitch形态还算有趣，整个游戏只有这个小亮点，说是亮点却也止步于此了，这个机制用处比较有限，除了用来回血跟解决飞行敌人比较香，其他时候都形同鸡肋。  地图设计一般，有的地方推图属实恶心人，打怪即使使用游戏最强的喷火枪有时也不太好使（这游戏打怪没有任何奖励，最好的过图方法其实是空中连续bug抛射跑酷）； 收集成就较为困难，因为收集的要素太过繁琐，导致后期补收集还需要把整个地图再次用脚丈量一遍，恶心透顶。  最折磨人的是断层空间的设定，一直打到全收集我都没找到过断层空间，于是只能被迫对着网上的攻略，把所有断层空间可能出现的地方全glitch了个遍，没有出，然后抱着怀疑的态度又把所有地方检查了一遍，还是没有出，很崩溃。（这时候我只缺这一个成就，为了这个成就来来回回耽误了好几个小时，还是一无所获。  峰回路转，突然我在公理边缘steam讨论区里翻到了别人几年前的存档，一个主角就站在断层空间门口的存档。  啊，感谢互联网，赞美万机之神。  *存档载入* *成就get*  *游戏卸载*   可喜可贺，可喜可贺，这么粪的银河城游戏还是比较少见的。  当然不是说游戏本身粪，单指他的收集成就，真的真的非常粪。 要你捡到所有收集要素不说，还需要glitch所有敌人，而且包括那种只出现一次的敌人噢。 这不纯恶心人么。  顺嘴说一句，对于一次不死的成就，只要在死的时候光速关游戏，就妹有任何问题。      不过呢，即便非常恶心人，纵使游戏体验比较一般，我还是给个好评，因为我太爱银河城游戏辣。  银河城类型游戏加4分，(6.5+4)/10，最终评分9.5/10，算是值得一玩的作品。
Date 2020-09-30 Playtime 50h 47m Rec Positive TL:DR Axiom Verge is a beautiful well-made tribute to Metroidvania games. Perfect for fans of Samus and Metroid and well worth your money.  Lets get reviewing!   Axiom Verge is a mastercraft that feels right at home along side any Metroid game from Nintendo. Having played through multiple times this is a must have for any avid Metroid enthusiast.  Controls: Controls feel clean and precise. Running, gunning and jumping all feel responsive and easy. There is a slight problem with the dash power sometimes feeling tricky to pull off or activating when you don't mean to; however this doesn't hurt gameplay.  Gameplay: Familiar to any Metroid veteran. Run, jump, explore, and collect upgrades scattered around many maps. There's a dozen or more  of guns to use, always giving you a new way to fight enemies. Tons of powerups to open new areas. Bosses feel challenging but fair. Try different guns. Some work better on different bosses.  Story: The story is an intriguing mystery to be solved. Why are you on this alien world? It keeps you hooked to the end and doesn't stop. Lots of twists and surprises to keep you wanting to know more.  Graphics:  Graphics are a gorgeous  pixel art style that's fun to view. Bright vivid caverns, dark eerie  tombs, and lush gardens await on this alien planet.  Music: The music is wonderful medley that fits the current mood. Heavy synth styles set the atmosphere. Somber and mysterious. Energetic and fast. Slow and gentle. Dark and haunting. Every zone has its own track that is a joy to listen to. And boss themes get you pumped for a fight!  Overall this game is fantastic and I'm glad I got to play it. A true Masterpiece of Metroidvania that'd make Samus proud!
Date 2020-09-30 Playtime 72h 0m Rec Positive This game beautifully captures the spirit of the classic Metroid games while telling its own story. You'll find a lot of nods to the game that inspired it, including some familiar undertones in the soundtrack, the occasional organic barrier that shoot back and a boss that takes up way more space than would fit on one screen! The aesthetic of each area is both strange and stunning. The colour pallet of each zone went a long way to distinguishing them from each other, and the environments carried their own moods as well, from sinister to serene, but always surreal! The sound design was really good too. Adjusting the timing for the low health warning sound with the pace of the background music was a stroke of genius that I have not seen in any other game! The enemy design is on point as well - you can almost always know how they work the moment you see them and recognise them immediately the next time you encounter them. The developer even had the forethought to include a Speedrun mode, which removes the dialogue and upgrade message boxes, as well as adding a timer that tracks how long it took to reach and defeat bosses. This is great for streamers who prefer to show gameplay while keeping most of the story veiled - not a common choice, but I like that the option is there! There are a couple of things that I reckon could use some improvement though - I found it too easy to lose track of myself in later stages when I took damage, due to how fast everything was moving and flickering if I'd used disruption. The sounds used for energy beams could have been a few decibels quieter too while still conveying the threat appropriately. And while a lot of the abilities your hero gains are unique, some of them could have been more interesting. Upgrades are also simple health, damage and range boosters which are permanently applied across the board, which is fairly basic compared to systems that offer choices between perks that can be swapped out at some point. But perhaps the biggest issue I had was how long it takes to respawn after dying. It might make sense in the early game thematically, but once you're moving a lot faster in later stages, the time it takes for your character to just stand up again becomes obnoxious. However, in light of the rest of the game, these are just minor grievances. If you like the Metroidvania genre and especially like pixel platformers, this is definitely a game worth having in your library!
Date 2020-09-28 Playtime 7h 40m Rec Positive Liked: - Interesting tools and abilities - Unique atmosphere - Interesting bosses  Disliked: - Confusing directions and backtracking
Date 2020-09-27 Playtime 36h 55m Rec Negative On the surface, imagine the original 'Metroid' without the limitations of the NES hardware and you pretty much get 'Axiom Verge'. While I'm a longtime 'Metroid' fan though, Trace (this game's hapless brogrammer protagonist) is no Samus.   I don't know how a game exists in which you can collect up to nearly TWO DOZEN weapons, permanently extend your health, increase the strength, range AND size of your projectiles and you're STILL perpetually underpowered, but somehow Thomas Happ Games made one. Actually, I'll answer how: All but a handful of your weapons are useless, upgrades are incremental at best, there are no armor enhancements, and your character has the maneuverability and control of a sack of potatoes. It's no wonder that even by the end of the game, battling ordinary enemies still feels like a fight for survival. Ironically, it's the bosses, with their predictable patterns and giant arenas, that present the LEAST challenge. This should not be.   'Axiom Verge' tries to be a tribute to 'Metroid', yet the developers didn't seem to be able to fully grasp what makes 'Metroid' awesome. It was never just about collecting "stuff". It's about collecting "stuff" that makes you stronger and faster and revisiting previous areas and being able to wipe the floor with everything in your path; To feel like you're actually progressing and accomplishing something! That spirit is completely missing from this game, and compound it with all the other broken elements like poor controls and incredibly unbalanced difficulty, and it simply fails to achieve its objective.
Date 2020-09-26 Playtime 11h 13m Rec Positive [i]Axiom Verge?[/i] More like, I'm on the [i]Axiom Verge[/i] of giving this game a glowing recommendation that's what. I haven't said 'this game kicks ass' in a decent amount of time prior to exploring this incredible, grotesque underworld.  A solid 9/10. If I have anything against this game, its that one stupid song with the autotuned vocal track. If I can turn off the vocal track, then maybe... just maybe...  I'm only half-kidding. I was definitely INTO this game, and I can see myself coming back to comb down more of its secrets. It may be a bit blatant with its [i]Super Metroid[/i] inspiration compared to... say, [i]Hollow Knight[/i], but damn this was a great time. Loved the abilities you get and the pacing was on-point. Secrets were pretty good too. Check this one out for sure.
Date 2020-09-25 Playtime 17h 3m Rec Positive I will try to be as honest as I possibly can. Personally, I very much enjoyed this game. It has all the tropes one would expect in a Metroidvania (Exploring, using new upgrades to unlock previously blocked or in inaccessible regions on a map, weapon and ability upgrades, and boss battles). That being said, I also think that some of the regions were boring and repetitive. One of the reasons I love Super Metroid is the fact that not only does every region on the planet have a unique feel, but every room has a unique feel and layout. Honestly, this is more similar to the original Metroid than Super Metroid. So just keep that in mind when or if you purchase this.  All in all, good game.
Date 2020-09-24 Playtime 16h 15m Rec Positive Good game.

Date 2020-09-14 Playtime 22h 31m Rec Negative Игра говно. Вот вам объективный отзыв.
Date 2020-09-13 Playtime 9h 39m Rec Positive Not a big fan of the confusing block design. Even tho I am used to games like this, it still threw me off  a few times. Also the multiple times I had to go back and forth kinda annoyed me when you hear the  background music over and over again.  Nevertheless the Boss fights were sick! I loved fighting every single boss (except the endboss, kinda meh).  The story is also interesting, overall a solid 8.2/10 imo.  
Date 2020-09-13 Playtime 6h 28m Rec Negative Tedious, boring and not fun.  IMO this game is so slow, boring and backtrackey that I constantly had to fight a boredom-induced state of tilt that made me want to half-ass everything, taking leaps of faith and face-tank enemies trying to rush through it hoping to finally reach a fun point in the game - which never happened before I finally gave up on it and quit not even halfway through.
Date 2020-09-11 Playtime 16h 56m Rec Positive An excellent metroidvania game. Some cool things about it that are pretty unique: - The health bar and environment pulse to the beat of the awesome soundtrack - Enemies don't instantly respawn when you move to another room; you have to remove 2 rooms away for enemies to start respawning. Very nice QOL feature.
Date 2020-09-09 Playtime 11h 15m Rec Positive Solid metroidvania with a good sense of isolation. Cool weapons.  I give this game a PEW PEW out of 10.
Date 2020-09-08 Playtime 33h 21m Rec Positive If you are like me and you have an itch that can’t be scratched unless nintendo releases a halfway decent metroid game and you feel like they are taking a little too long to release Metroid Prime 4!!!. Axiom Verge can make that wait a little bit more bearable.  This game takes Inspiration from old metroid games, so much so that it almost feels like one. It has the exploration and the looking for upgrades that I love from the metroidvania games that we all like (according to steam). The biggest praise that I can give Axiom Verge is that it excels at the upgrades, every single tool that you have has a specific purpose, but with some clever thinking the upgrades can be use to do so much more, and the more you upgrade you upgrades (Genius writing I know), the more possibilities to explore or to use those tools together to make crazy but interesting things. (I know it's kind of vague but you really need to play the game to know what I mean).  And the biggest problem for me that Axiom Verge has are the weapons, on 2 things. #1  they only have 1 purpose, killing, which makes finding them not as exciting because getting a new weapon doesn’t mean that you will be using it to unlock new areas it just means that you have a cool/goofy/weird weapon to move around. and #2 There are over 20 weapons in the game, and if you are the kind of person that switches constantly to see which weapon is the most efficient in any given situation the game will slow down by a lot. And finally since getting the weapons is not exciting, there is nothing worse in this game than backtracking to previous worlds finding those corridors that you haven’t tried just to find a weapon that you would probably never use, and that doesn’t help you progressing through the game.  Still it's an enjoyable game that you should try if you are still waiting for the next metroid game or the next season of Castlevania (because let's face it, there is a high probability that the game series is dead) like me, or if you can’t have enough metroidvanias in your life,   also like me.
Date 2020-09-06 Playtime 16h 9m Rec Negative The game isn't completely bad, but it has flaws that really bothered me, like enemies and level design, even visually some levels are just hard to look at. A lot of enemies are really annoying, areas that are just enemy spam, specially late game. Bosses are not fun too. I guess it's worth to get on sale but don't expect too much.
Date 2020-09-06 Playtime 20h 17m Rec Positive This game was incredible - the fantastic story, the delirious visuals, that haunting, thumping soundtrack - and of course, the faithful and superb gameplay. As much as I wish I could experience it again for the first time, this game is so good that I get the same feeling just firing it up again... back into the breach!
Date 2020-09-05 Playtime 19h 27m Rec Positive It was pretty fun, enjoyed the soundtrack, absolutely wish there were markers for items you missed or a list of which enemies you didn't hack as I have no idea which I missed for the hack all enemies achievement.  Otherwise solid interesting story, excited to see how the sequel improves on this game. Also Flamethrower OP
Date 2020-09-02 Playtime 17h 38m Rec Positive pretty good but still metroid awful movement (double tap movement keys, trash hook) kinda good bosses 
Date 2020-09-02 Playtime 12h 35m Rec Positive solid ass metroidvania superb art direction
Date 2020-08-31 Playtime 20h 13m Rec Positive This is the best love letter to Super Metroid I ever played. I would say this is a must play for classic metroid fans.  I got the good ending first try, which I really recommend getting at some point. The plot was really good and the good ending ties it up right.  There was some frustrating controls & mechanics with the grappling hook. It never felt smooth and I usually felt myself dreading when I needed it.  
Date 2020-08-30 Playtime 25h 32m Rec Positive This game is generally underrated and forgotten. A great example of the genre.
Date 2020-08-30 Playtime 12h 20m Rec Positive Feels like you're in a tool music video. 46/2
Date 2020-08-28 Playtime 18h 23m Rec Positive Best game for metroid fans. Simply mind blowing :D
Date 2020-08-27 Playtime 28h 18m Rec Positive Classic Metroidvania gameplay with a nice twist on the upgrades and a trippy story.
Date 2020-08-27 Playtime 11h 48m Rec Positive Music is okay.  Art is fantastic.  The story is compelling enough.  Exploration using the gadgets you find along the way is pretty enjoyable.  A lot of hidden items can be frustrating, and I don't like that they're not marked on the map.  The boss fights are designed poorly generally speaking, though a few are fun, and a few are challenging, most of them will make you feel unsatisfied for one reason or another.  I don't like the price tag. I think it should be more like 15$.  Overall: 7.5/10. Pretty solid Metroidvania.
Date 2020-08-26 Playtime 3h 56m Rec Negative After nearly 4 hours I've begun to find this game tedious. I don't really enjoy running around the map, it's difficult to tell what blocks are breakable/hackable/etc. and the bosses so far have not been all that fun. There are better metroidvanias, and I would really much rather go play either of the OGs of the genre.
Date 2020-08-21 Playtime 10h 23m Rec Positive Metroidvania de la vieja escuela, un gran arsenal de armas y un gran numero de secretos por descubrir. Una historia con buenos giros y cuyo final te dejara descolocado, pero con la sensación de haber disfrutado de una gran aventura.
Date 2020-08-21 Playtime 14h 16m Rec Positive Esse jogo é magnífico. Você não vai se arrepender.  Meus amigos, a trilha sonoro é absurdamente linda. Esse jogo me faz ter ainda mais vontade de um Remaker de Super Metroid
Date 2020-08-20 Playtime 25h 32m Rec Positive This is a game for people who have enough patience and love challenging themselves. The music in this game is really cool too.  I would recommend to give it a try and give it some time to shine.
Date 2020-08-20 Playtime 0h 6m Rec Positive How do I get a refund? I wanted to play this game with my controller but it doesn't work. I've decided I'd just play the Switch version.
Date 2020-08-20 Playtime 12h 26m Rec Positive A very solid game, and worth anyone's time if you are a fan of Metroid.  The level design, atmosphere, and story are fantastic.  The weapons are interesting, and there is a whole sort of interesting upgrades that you can get, that make you feel like a badass.    My only real complaint with the game is the difficulty.  The majority of your game, you are ALWAYS just running on your last bit of health, and you are just looking for the next save station, so you don't die and lose your spot.  This is especially true with the boss fights.  The bosses, in my opinion, are the weakest link of this game.  For a lot of them, there is no real discernible pattern to dodge the boss's projectiles.  It's more a matter of just choosing the right weapon, mashing away at the fire button, and hoping for the best.  For those struggling with the Wasp boss in Eden: [spoiler] Get the "Inertial Pulse" first.  This is one of the best weapons in the game for boss fights, as it bypasses the boss's hitbox and goes straight for the weak point.  During the wasp boss battle, stand on the right-most side of the map, pull out the Inertial Pulse, and just walk back and forth and fire the weapon diagonally until the boss dies. [/spoiler]
Date 2020-08-19 Playtime 20h 38m Rec Positive If you're a fan of Metroid then Axiom Verge is a must-play. The formula is very familiar until you start unlocking and combining power-ups for platforming, like lab coats that let you teleport or the remote drone that you shoot like a grenade and then teleport to its location, or my personal favourite the Address Disruptor which "corrupts or de-corrupts weaker blocks and enemies." It has an intriguing plot and the world has plenty of hidden lore (and upgrades) to find, and it's all wrapped in a truly alien aesthetic with a bangin' soundtrack.  My only knock against Axiom Verge is the bosses, most of which are totally stationary with simple attack patterns and requiring simple strategies to defeat them. With the player having so many cool ways to maneuver the bosses feel outdated, in a bad way. The final boss is pretty dang awesome though.  Expect your playthrough to last around 10 to 12 hours if you're not going for 100%.
Date 2020-08-17 Playtime 22h 11m Rec Negative Axiom Verge does a lot right, but I'm not glad I played it, and I wouldn't recommend it.  I love the Metroidvania genre. I love Super Metroid; I just played it again a few months ago, and Axiom Verge just isn't as good as Super Metroid. Replay Super Metroid not Axiom Verge.  The Axiom Verge world is large, complex and interlinked, but the various places are not particularly interesting. Many of the power ups are unique and interesting, and there's some creative combat and platforming to be had. This is the major strength of Axiom Verge.  The problem is it's not easy to tell the difference between an area you can't reach yet and an area you will never reach. If you think it's forever unreachable, you will forget about it. I spent a lot of time backtracking randomly because I didn't know where to go next and needed to "stumble" upon an old obstacle that I can now get past with a new ability. Super Metroid doesn't have this problem. Doors have different colors, destructible blocks show an icon of the ability needed, and the world is full of unique, interesting, and memorable places. Obstacles are unique and memorable. Axiom Verge locations are only memorable if they were particularly irritating because of an enemy or platforming challenge.  I ended up looking at guides because I got tired of trial and error back tracking. This ruined the exploration and "figuring it out for yourself" aspect that makes Metroidvania's fun.  I was pretty meticulous about trying to find everything, but I only found about 70% of the items, so there's a lot of well hidden secrets. But you will not find many of them without a guide because they involve random passwords you have to enter in random places that make random changes to the world...I say random because if you don't use a guide, all of this will be 100% trial and error.  I did finish the game (on hard), but I came very close to quitting several times. I don't recommend playing the game on hard; most enemies are irritating, not fun.

Date 2020-08-13 Playtime 12h 59m Rec Negative Идешь ты такой к боссу, а на пути летающие хрены. Пройти мимо нельзя - собьют с платформы. Хакнуть - слишком долго. Убить - бегать туда-сюда в надежде что он промажет и потерять кучу хп. И после 3 комнат с врагами ты приходить к боссу без хп.  заебись
Date 2020-08-12 Playtime 17h 20m Rec Positive For fans of oldschool Metroid and Zelda games as well as obscure RPG hidden gems on NES/SNES/GENESIS, this is the game for you. Everything is excellent, from the graphics to the soundtrack and sound effects. It has depth, secrets, a deep map to explore, challenge without being frustrating, and lots of stuff that is just in general fun. As someone who grew up in the 90's this game feels like all my childhood video games reimagined into something new and unique in it's own right. I highly recommend this to everyone, even people not looking for a retro gaming experience, because it is a good game regardless of what genre or era you try to label it as. It's fun, plain and simple. 10/10, can't wait for the sequel. I should add that I have already played this through once on PS4 and am playing it through a second time on my PC (Had to buy the game twice because my PS4 is no longer with me and didn't mind spending the money again, would do it a third time if I had to)
Date 2020-08-11 Playtime 14h 57m Rec Positive Super fun, enjoyably frustrating, super thick atmosphere and vibe, great music.
Date 2020-08-11 Playtime 10h 56m Rec Positive While the story is forced and unnecessary, the incredible art and rather entertaining metroidvania game play make up for it in the end. This game includes several mechanics that should become staples of other metroidvanias, Axiom Verge is a modern take on classic mechanics and it mostly flows very well. While some people may have issues with the challenge of the bosses (some of which can be cheated to complete) and the complexity of the puzzles, veterans of the genre will accept the challenge. The game will give you about 8-11 hours of game play and more with achievements. While it's not perfect, it is very good and a welcome entry into the genre.
Date 2020-08-10 Playtime 26h 48m Rec Positive ta weno.
Date 2020-08-10 Playtime 5h 20m Rec Positive Super Metroid nostalgia.
Date 2020-08-10 Playtime 29h 9m Rec Positive Awesome platformer with great playability. Excelent music and interesting story.
Date 2020-08-10 Playtime 10h 49m Rec Negative The only reason why I've played this game for 10 hours is because I paid too much money to just to quit due to boredom. I should have gone with my gut instinct and not purchased this game because it didn't look even remotely interesting to me in the trailers, but this game has gotten such high praise so I decided to take a chance and bought it on sale for 10 bucks. So let's take a real short look into why absolutely hate this game.   This game takes alot of ques from a great game franchise called Metroid which happens to be one of my top 3 favorite franchises of all time. In a quick summary Axiom Verge fails where Metroid excels due to lack of charm. The story in Axiom Verge is massively convoluted to the point of people needing to seek interpretation of what the game is actually all about even after they complete the game. Unfortunately if you're not really into the story there's not much else. The small enemies are uninspired as well as most of the bosses. In short, the game is boring A.F. I highly recommend other Metroidvania style games like Cave Story and Shantae which have great stories, gameplay, music and sound that keep you coming back for more when you get your ass handed to you. Ofcourse if you haven't played Metroid 1,2,3, Prime 1,2,3, Zero Mission, Fusion, or even Other M, go play those instead of this game.
Date 2020-08-10 Playtime 18h 19m Rec Positive Best Game!
Date 2020-08-09 Playtime 0h 13m Rec Negative This is the first time I request for a refund. And I'm sorry Axiom Verge was the last drop in a big glass, but enough with this retro games intended to be played with joysticks. I know you can configure to play it with a keyboard... but not make it default using who knows what joystick... "Press X to fire gun"... X on what?!? X on keyboard doesn do sh*t... It's not THAT hard to figure out que confirmation key is Space rather than Enter and the Menu key is not Escape... but come on, at least configure it to play like a DOS game.   The gameplay is ok... just ok. And the story... I couldn't care less about that guy. Just stick to Metroid.
Date 2020-08-09 Playtime 8h 37m Rec Negative One of the most overrated games I've played in a while. Basically Metroid but with bad bosses, weapons, and level design  
Date 2020-08-09 Playtime 9h 47m Rec Positive Do it...
Date 2020-08-08 Playtime 17h 43m Rec Positive Great Metroid clone. It's a little on the difficult side for me. First, it's easy to get stuck where you feel like you are running in circles not getting anywhere. Second it's pretty difficult and I die quite a lot. You may be like me and choose to use a guide. I like the one by AkanubonOrih because it shows little maps with numbers indicating what order to get the items in. Still it's a great game with cool pixel art graphics that appear to me to be a combo of 8 and 16 bit style graphics. Some of the bosses remind me of bosses from the Metal Slug series. I can't wait to finish it, and I can't wait for the sequel which is on it's way!! Git it, it's gud!
Date 2020-08-07 Playtime 13h 54m Rec Positive O jogo é ótimo! Gostei dos gráficos, da trilha sonora e da história que mesmo sendo pouco detalhada, você termina o jogo com dúvidas dos desfechos finais e querendo ter mais explicações. O jogo é totalmente inspirado em Metroid, porém com recursos únicos. De negativo acredito que tem uma infinidades de armas que não são necessárias pela pouca quantidade de inimigos, o power up de gancho é meio ruim de se usar dependendo do seu joystick, ele poderia ter um range maior!
Date 2020-08-06 Playtime 24h 15m Rec Positive This game is excellent. If you like Super Metroid or Metroid Fusion I think you will like this game. If you have ever wanted to play either of these Metroid games but have never had a chance to or don't have the necessary platforms then I would recommend this game to you  as both the gameplay and experience are similar. I honestly think this is superior to the remake of Metroid 2 Samus returns as Axiom Verge more closely represents the older metoid games through its visuals and exploration.   Please bear in mind I have played those Metroid games so it is hard not to compare them but I will aim to review the game on it's own merits.  This game is a metroidvania so if backtracking to similar areas does not appeal to you you might be put off this game however a lot of the backtracking is for extra items and weapons, I felt that if you just followed the main story you didn't have to back track to many of the earlier areas. Saying that the backtracking feels worth it when you can access some more powerful weapons and increase your health against some of the tougher bosses.   The only thing I think could improve the game is being able to gain an ability that allows quicker movement as Trace can feel a bit slow when walking, especially late game when you feel you should be faster. You can get a dash ability but it requires you to double tap a direction to move a short burst that way. It doesn't feel as fast or as smooth as some of the movement upgrades Samus' can acquire in metroid so if you have played those games Trace's movement in Axiom Verge might feel a bit stilted. I still really enjoyed the game despite this  though, it was just something I noticed.   When I was thinking about what to write as a review when I was collecting items at the end of the game I thought I would end it by saying please make a sequel but creepily when I next went on Youtube there was a trailer for Axiom Verge 2  in my recommendations. I can't wait for that and I assure the developers that I will certainly by buying the sequel.
Date 2020-08-02 Playtime 25h 9m Rec Positive Axiom Verge, un metroidvania para experimentados y obsesivos; los creadores no la ponen fácil para descubrir sus secretos. Todo ambientado desde una estética que recuerda a Giger, de Alien. Genial! Lo recomiendo con amplitud.
Date 2020-08-02 Playtime 13h 4m Rec Positive excelente
Date 2020-08-02 Playtime 31h 53m Rec Positive Very high-quality Metroid-style game.
Date 2020-08-01 Playtime 22h 20m Rec Positive If you like old school Metroid, this is for you. Just a great game all around.
Date 2020-07-30 Playtime 12h 26m Rec Positive Pros: - Great boss battles. Nice sense of scale. - Cool soundtrack. - Great sense of exploration. The map is full of secrets and is very tightly packed, which makes backtracking easy and not a hassle. You find a lot of alternate paths as you get your upgrades. - Very responsive controls.  Cons: - Underwhelming ending. I expected more from all the build up through the game.  Fantastic indie metroidvania. 8/10.
Date 2020-07-30 Playtime 15h 16m Rec Positive Un juego que haria a Mama Samus orgullosa
Date 2020-07-30 Playtime 16h 41m Rec Positive From the outside, this looks like a Metroid clone. The level appearance and design have the same look and feel. Most of the enemies have that insect or robotic look as well. However, Axiom Verge does enough to create its own identity. The story is certainly unique, if not a bit confusing given all the terminology.   The game has similar barriers that prevent you from exploring all areas from the get go but offers unique solutions. For example, the deployable, controllable drone lets you explore past small gaps much like the ball in Metroid. The drone comes with a couple of upgrades that can dramatically change how it benefits the player.   The amount of different weapons at your disposal is astonishing. There are roughly 10 different beams you can shoot out as your main weapon. They give you plenty of options to choose from when deciding how to defeat a particular boss or group of enemies.  Overall the game is fantastic. The music is also surprisingly great and unexpected from a tiny no name developer.
Date 2020-07-29 Playtime 31h 46m Rec Positive This game is a masterpiece, I love Metroidvania games, and the Lore/ and story of Axiom Verge is amazing, I cant wait for Axioim Verge 2!
Date 2020-07-27 Playtime 25h 57m Rec Positive This game is awesome !  Looks beautiful, Gameplay feels perfect, great story (not that standard stuff) with great ideas and unexpected elements. Great secrets, fun bosses (not easy, but bot too hard either). A well done Speedrun mode.  What makes this game so awesome for me clearly was the atmosphere. The story didn't feel like that stuff we know in the west, it felt more ... russian... kind of...  and this is awesome.  Music is fantastic too.  All in all: playthrough any % 10 hours, 100 % all achievements - 23 hours
Date 2020-07-27 Playtime 12h 10m Rec Positive This game hits alllll my feels as a kid who grew up playing Nintendo in the 80s/90s, loving Metroid, Contra, Rygar, 'Vania etc. This game is better than all of them, and takes the genre to new heights. If you like rewarding exploration, awesome soundtracks, and incredible pixel art, few games come close. - The one critique is that there are too many moments where you're stuck wondering if there's something you're overlooking, vs. just needing to forge ahead and get an upgrade elsewhere first. This should have been made more clear, and paths ahead, secrets & temporary impasses should have *slightly more visual cues than they do. But overall, amazing game.
Date 2020-07-27 Playtime 3h 46m Rec Positive Bom Metroidvania
Date 2020-07-25 Playtime 23h 9m Rec Positive It's just Amazing. I love this game. I love the soundtrack. Usually I am not a soundtrack fan. This is like one of the only games I have ever played where I have listened to the soundtrack afterwards. I really like this game!
Date 2020-07-24 Playtime 16h 14m Rec Positive 9/10 - Great game, among the best.  Pros: - Axiom Verge is inspired by the Metroid series, but it’s absolutely not just another Metroid clone. That being said, it is comparable. It's story driven and more linear - similar to how Metroid Fusion handles its map. The gameplay is refreshing, and as you progress, you really start to feel stronger and much more mobile. The heavy emphasis on weapons-based powerups gives you lots of choices on how you want to fight and problem solve. Overall, it’s a very underappreciated game! - The best part about this game is its music and sound design – it’s phenomenal! It’s well designed and very memorable. The retro-style visuals are amazing, and they add to the worldbuilding. The combat and puzzles are great. The story, while sometimes hard to follow, hooks you in after you get a feel of how things work. The only bad thing I can say about the story is that I wish it had more! - Exploring the map is fun rather than tedious like Metroid games can be at times. It’s interesting seeing the different environments and creatures that live in each zone. There’s a zone that helps you travel faster when the map starts to open up. The collectible items are handled perfectly and are not overdone.   Cons: - The boss fights are lacking. Most of them are easy and predictable with very exploitable weaknesses. I can think of two or three bosses that are handled well, but it could have been done much better overall. When the bosses take damage, they usually just attack faster without much, if any, of a change in pattern. I don’t get the same sense of dread before a boss fight like I do in Metroid games due to this.
Date 2020-07-23 Playtime 10h 8m Rec Positive I am very confused but I enjoyed it so hey.
Date 2020-07-22 Playtime 53h 48m Rec Positive First game in a while which I really enjoyed and became engrossed with.  A pleasant surprise.  Can't wait for more content from this developer.
Date 2020-07-21 Playtime 13h 39m Rec Negative There are some design choices in this game that I can't comprehend. Why are there 20 different weapons? Why are they so terrible? What is the point of the grapple hook? Why does the grapple hook has a dedicated button but not the dash? Why can't the player aim with the right analog? What is the point of a bomb that deals no damage?  In my opinion, the boss fights are the worst aspect of this game. They are long, boring, frustrating, and destroy any fun you're having with the game.
Date 2020-07-20 Playtime 34h 32m Rec Positive In an era when creativity across all forms of entertainment is waning, Axiom Verge stands tall above all others. While it is nominally an homage to Metroid, it goes well beyond that to an entity all its own that stands in a league by itself. Axiom Verge raises the bar for what makes a truly good game. These days, most developers care more about graphics than content or atmosphere. Axiom Verge proves that the graphics only need to be perfect for the story being told, not state-of-the-art.  The heart and soul of Axiom Verge is, in fact, its deep and provocative story. What may seem pretentious to some is, upon closer inspection, one of the most legitimately complex narratives of the last decade. If Metroid had a love child with the themes and stories of the Matrix, Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and the Time Machine, that love child would be Axiom Verge. I'll not spoil it here, but the basic premise is that you are playing Trace, a scientist who wakes up on a mysterious planet after an accident nearly takes his life. That planet has had nearly all sentient life wiped from it by a man named Athetos, and a living machine called Elsanova guides Trace toward saving her people and stopping Athetos. Boy oh boy does it go down the rabbit hole! The number of layers to the story could be discussed by philosophy professors for the next thousand years. I can only imagine the kind of compelling conversation one could have with Tom Happ, the solo designer of this game and the greatest dev of all time in my book.  The graphics and sound are purely 12-bit, in that they hover between NES and SNES standards except with a modern resolution. The controls are smooth as silk and everything matters. The pulse on your lifebar is actually in tune with the music and is a hint as to how to get the maximum firing speed from the various guns. You don't just mash the buttons, if you time it right, you can shoot even faster! The gibberish on the right hand side of the screen while using various gadgets eventually yields a passcode to a secret area. Various notes from throughout the game, translated by another passcode, unlocks yet another secret area to one of the more useful weapons. Every mystery can be solved with the tools at hand, though the one I just mentioned requires either building one's own table to translate by (easily done but time consuming) or looking it up online. The game actually comes pre-loaded with its own actual glitches, too! In addition to the puzzles of the game, each save will generate five glitch zones with extra items in them that can be found by watching the screen for scanlines! Brilliant! Even better are the deeper glitches placed in the game for speedrunners playing the mode designed for exactly that! By holding your ground and turning while shooting your grappling hook straight up, you can swing through a one-block barrier (this is one aspect of the speedrun as it stands at the time of this writing). All legitimate, all designed that way, as the game's puzzles are designed around this glitch aspect. With various tools, you can glitch the enemies, too, for all sorts of fun (and an achievement!)  Replayability is near-infinite because this game is amazingly-fun to speedrun. When you really get going, trying to inch your time down can become very addictive. Then again, almost everything about this game is addictive. It is simply that much fun. The difficulty is just enough to give new players a hard time and still be learnable while giving advanced players plenty of options to try new and exciting tactics.  I can't recommend this game enough. If you like platformers and a deep story that can make your brain hurt, you can't pick up a better game than Axiom Verge. Tom Happ is a genius who has shown that it doesn't take a corporation with millions of dollars to make an amazing classic of a game, and I very much look forward to playing Axiom Verge 2.
Date 2020-07-20 Playtime 25h 6m Rec Positive Jogo com história alucinante, jogabilidade impecável, arte simplesmente hipnotizante. Um jogo te deixar pensando por um bom tempo de boca aberta. Infelizmente não tem bom fator de retorno.
Date 2020-07-19 Playtime 18h 38m Rec Positive 9/10 If you like metroid style 2d games you have to play it.
Date 2020-07-19 Playtime 25h 44m Rec Positive Absolutely phenomenal. One of the best metroidvanias I've ever played.
Date 2020-07-19 Playtime 16h 4m Rec Positive Overall is a very interesting homage to Super Metroid. It is quite fun (specially the glitch-superpowers and the extra movement actions) and addictive.   Some graphics look less polished, but remember that the whole game (code, graphics, sound/music) is the work of a single person. On the other hand, it has wonderful visual FX (kinda "mode 7") that still are spectacular (as of 2020) While exploring the world is a joy most of the time, at times it is quite easy to get stuck, not knowing what to do next. Some items/powerups are extremely hidden - have a game guide at hand.  There is a plethora of weapons (so many that it may be hard to select the one you want), but personally I only find useful a small subset. Also, I personally found the grapple very hard to use. To me is a lost opportunity (a more responsive hook would have made extra fun to breeze across some parts of Axiom Verge world)  Even taking into account these downsides, Axiom Verge totally deserves to be played end to end. 
Date 2020-07-18 Playtime 17h 48m Rec Positive Pretty good. It's Metroid.  Some things I found frustrating. Early bosses are easy to cheese, some late bosses are pretty tough, and a couple areas feel really unforgiving. Got stuck and didn't know where to go more than once, and not in a fun way. Also, there are some issues with the controls IMO - it's too easy to accidentally switch weapons (on the Xbox One controller at least) or to accidentally teleport, both of which can get you killed or cause you to fall. Also, story didn't make sense to me.  Still, those are my only complaints. Lots of varied guns that are fun to use and it's fun to figure out which weapons work best in which situations. Level design is for the most part excellent. And I had fun, so, worth it.
Date 2020-07-17 Playtime 13h 11m Rec Positive This is an outstanding Metroidvania, but it has some characteristics some players might not like. There's lots of backtracking because the game isn't linear. You also often don't know where you have to go next. That combination leads to a lot of random wandering over the map (with no fast-travel option) trying to figure out which unexplored area is open to you since the last thing you unlocked.
Date 2020-07-17 Playtime 34h 35m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an excellent example of a metroidvania done RIGHT. No map markers, nothing telling you where to go. Only vague hints on your objective, and I love it. Pure, natural pathfinding. This game has many unique abilities that I have not seen in any other game before and the dev was really creative with how he designed them and how they effect how you look at the world around you. World design and layout is excellent and if you ever get lost, just go to the parts of the map you haven't explored yet! That's what I did and I only ever got "stuck" once when I was too stupid to see what I had to do (the solution was right in front of my face). The sci-fi story and setting is done really well and the 16-bit visuals often greatly enhance the imagery and scenery giving this game a really distinct and unique look. Would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good metroidvania, or a platformer in general.
Date 2020-07-17 Playtime 17h 48m Rec Positive Great! 
Date 2020-07-17 Playtime 12h 27m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an amazing metroidvania leaning way more heavily on the metroid half. The pacing and items feel very akin to that of Super Metroid, with equally great soundtrack and world design. The theme of corrupting reality is executed really well both in aesthetic and game mechanics. Bosses and enemies are very engaging, with several ways to approach all of the above.   The story is somewhat convoluted. At a surface level, just going along as one would in their first playthrough, it's enjoyable and not distracting at all, but I recommend not overthinking it. I thoroughly appreciate the addition of a speedrun mode which not only takes tutorial and textboxes out of the game, but also provides a definite seed for RNG elements, completely removing randomness from the game. The massive caveat therein is that you have to play through the game in one sitting; that may seem included in the name, and I suppose it is, but an intermediate step would have been nice.  Lastly, I just want to draw attention to how awesomely crafted this game is while being produced largely by one person, Thomas Happ. The game is so unique in it's visual and gameplay motifs that one could not begin to spurn the effort and passion Happ put into the experience.   And then Happ went and set the sequel to release first on Switch...
Date 2020-07-16 Playtime 6h 3m Rec Positive Any absolute must buy if you are an old school Metroid fan.  Brooding with atmosphere, really cool music and a pretty interesting storyline.
Date 2020-07-15 Playtime 20h 17m Rec Positive Axiom Verge’de, bir laboratuvardaki patlama sonucu ölen ve tamamen farklı bir evrende gözlerini açan Trace’i kontrol ediyoruz. Oyunun mantığı oldukça basit: Geniş haritalarda dolanarak yeni weapon ve itemlar aramak; bu itemları kullanarak önceden kapalı olan yeni haritaları açmak ve bunları yaparken de bol bol şekilsiz mahlukatları kesmek... Metroidvania türünün severlerinin kaçırmaması gerektiğini düşünüyorum.     Puanım:   8.5/10     Artılar:  1) Müzik ve pixel art tek kelime ile muhteşem (Müzikler gerçekten iyi, harbi diyorum bak).   2) Bu maddede değineceklerim “metroidvania” türünün tanımlayıcı özelliği olsa da yazmam      gerekiyor. Oyun bir kaç parçaya bölünmüş büyükçe bir haritadan oluşuyor ve yeni, bir kısmı      zekice gizlenmiş, itemları bulmadan haritanın kalanına gidemiyor ve bosslara erişip oyuna      devam edemiyorsunuz (Tabii ki bulunması oyunun devamı için zorunlu olan itemlar      haricinde zibilyon tane item var. Oyun bittiğinde yaklaşık olarak yarısını bulabilmiş ve      haritanın da yüzde 90’ını tamamlamıştım). Bu itemları bulmanız da haritadaki kalan yerlere      gidebileceğinizin garantisi olmuyor. Onları kullanarak ne yapmanız gerektiğini bulmanız      gerekiyor. Her ne kadar oyun verdiği “subtle” ipuçları ile sizi bunu yapmaya itse de, bu      ipuçları oldukça zeki bir yolla verilmiş. Ne yapmam gerektiğini bulduğum ve gizli bir item      keşfettiğim bir çok an kendimi atomu parçalamış gibi hissettim. Oyun da bu hissiyatı      vermeyi amaçlıyor belli ki, ve bunu güzel oldukça güzel bir şekilde yapıyor.  3) Oyunu yalnızca normal zorlukta bitirdim. Bossların zorluğunu da, aynı vaadettiği gibi,      normal buldum. Ne çok kolay, ne de çok zordu (Eşek arısından bozma 5. boss Ukhu hariç.      Oyunu hard’da oynasam PC elimde kalabilirdi). Her boss fight’tan keyif aldım.  4) Address disruptor veya namıdiğer “glitch weapon” oyuna renk katıyor. Yaratacağı      sonuçların rastgeleliği çok güzel sağlanmış. Kullanabildiğiniz her an kullanmanızı şiddet ile      tavsiye ederim. Sonuçları şaşırtıcı olabilir.  5) Hikaye başlangıçta soru işaretleri ile dolu ve anlaşılmaz olsa da, ilerledikçe merak      duygusunu uyandırmayı başarıyor ve güzel bir şekilde bağlanıyor.    Eksiler:  1) Kontroller... Daha doğrusu menü kontrolleri. Buna alışmam oldukça zaman aldı ve bir kaç      kez save’leyemeden oyunu kapatıp küçük çaplı sinir krizi geçireyazdım, ki bu      gerçekleşirken oyunu kapatma amacında bile değildim! Bunda tabii ki benim kazmalığımın      da etkisi büyük.  2) Her ne kadar yeni silahları arayıp bulmak oyunun belki de en keyifli yanı olsa da, bir çok      silahı tamamen kullanışsız buldum. Oyunu yalnızca 4 silah kullanarak bitirdim. (Oyunda      toplamda kaç silah olduğundan emin değilim ama ben 9 tane bulmuştum).
Date 2020-07-14 Playtime 15h 54m Rec Positive One of the better metroidvanias out there. Exploration is top notch, the soundtrack is killer, and the combat is fun.
Date 2020-07-14 Playtime 11h 16m Rec Positive This feels like Super Metroid. Nothing else needed.
Date 2020-07-12 Playtime 5h 44m Rec Positive Very good
Date 2020-07-12 Playtime 20h 38m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a love letter to Metroid, Mega Man, and blowing into the cartridge to fix all your problems. This was made by a one-man dev team, and for that, it is incredible. I don't know if I've played as good a glitch-based game as this, and I've played Pony Island. The action is on-point, the vibes are absolutely going, and I had a lot of fun with it up to a point. Like all metroidvanias, this game has areas gated off that have to be overcome by getting upgrades, and often times those make sense, but in other cases that gate is jump height or tricky jumping, and for a long time I wasn't sure if I was just bad or if there was an additional jump upgrade I just didn't have. There were some upgrades, and directions of progression, that I just didn't know about and had to refer to the wiki to get. I can't imagine trying to get a couple of upgrades WITHOUT the wiki. That said, it's a good game otherwise, and too much guidance would kind of defeat the vibe he was going for with it. Honestly, just buy this game and don't be afraid to read along with a walkthrough, the selling point for this game is all onscreen action and vibes, and you won't miss out by reading ahead. Also, since I gotta mention it somewhere in here, the soundtrack slaps.
Date 2020-07-12 Playtime 15h 55m Rec Positive nicely done. I feel like I'm in metroid again or almost
Date 2020-07-11 Playtime 4h 22m Rec Negative You might think that this game has bad controls, but then you find the grappling hook and realize how REALLY bad they are. This game was made by people who think the sewer jump in TMNT for NES was the best part of the game.

Date 2020-07-11 Playtime 12h 3m Rec Positive 暂时的银河战士精神续作
Date 2020-07-11 Playtime 17h 18m Rec Positive Gostei muito do jogo. Me remeteu uns 22 anos atrás, eu era fissurado em Super Metroid. Boa trilha sonora, clima obscuro. O jogo te prende. Para quem é saudosista, quem é de agora e aprecia o gênero "Metroidvania" é uma boa escolha!
Date 2020-07-11 Playtime 16h 35m Rec Positive A really solidly executed take on this genre with a surprisingly compelling story. It doesn't try to reinvent the wheel too much but it's definitely not without numerous unique elements that keep it from feeling like a straight up Metroid clone. If you enjoy this genre you'll love this, it's a no brainer.
Date 2020-07-10 Playtime 13h 4m Rec Positive Exploration is fantastic. So is the music. Some of the graphics are annoying (not being able to see small objects). The boss fights are terrible. I recommend this if you're a fan of Metroid.

Date 2020-07-09 Playtime 16h 55m Rec Positive Un jeu exceptionnel, à conseiller à tous les fans de Metroidvania ! Dans le plus pur style de Super Metroid, un jeu complexe, au gameplay prenant et à l'histoire originale, avec une bonne durée de vie (je l'ai fini en 16h en Difficile en visitant 90% de la map et en récupérant 62% des objets/capacités) et une bande-son démentielle ! L'univers est assez sordide et glauque donc à conseiller aux fans de cyberpunk et à un public averti
Date 2020-07-09 Playtime 20h 6m Rec Positive Glitches are [strike]a feature[/strike] [b]the future[/b].
Date 2020-07-09 Playtime 14h 47m Rec Positive Brilliant metroidvania type game. Some decent weaponry and intriguing lore as well. Really enjoyed it. If you enjoyed Super Metroid then you'll enjoy this.
Date 2020-07-08 Playtime 17h 25m Rec Positive Its a very well made Metroid clone with unique abilities all themed around graphic glitches. Graphics and sounds are all great.   Main issue I have is with the enemy AI and difficulty. You die in very few hits to even basic enemies. Luckily you do not lose progress on death. But still you need to dodge enemy attacks like the plague. Which is why the AI is so bad.   A lot of enemies have fixed move and attack patterns. For instance there is a hammerhead looking fish that will always jump in an arc out of the ground or ceiling. It kills you in 2 hits but if you stand outside of the arc you can freely attacking it without it ever coming closer. So this is the optimal way to fight: find the blind spot where enemy patterns don't hit you, stand still and attack.   Bosses are no exception. With the 3rd boss being the easiest by far because it can only attack one very specific spot in the final phase. I only died to the 2nd boss as that one seemed to have actually good patterns until I found an exploit that let you walk through him and attack him from behind...  The game is also really bad at telling you what you abilities do. You can glitch enemies but what that does to enemies is different on each enemy type. Some stop moving, some glide through walls, some connect to each other. It again is pure trial and error to see what works and what not. Which is bad because you need to use fringe interactions often to access hidden poweups.   Still considering this game was made by 1 Person it is impressive. It is just rough around the edges and lacks player feedback.
Date 2020-07-08 Playtime 9h 27m Rec Positive Good game. It's really a Metroid game clone which is nice in a time where no good Metroid game are being made. You get a good mix of exploration and fighting. Graphics are good for an indie game and the music is acceptable while forgettable. Certain things to be aware of. There are too many useless weapons, which take away a lot of the excitement from finding one. Exploration is slow and making it faster require a lot of quick input. Story is a bit of a mess but it has some good idea. Overall I think it's a 7/10.
Date 2020-07-07 Playtime 26h 25m Rec Negative [h1]Going backwards, for better or worse[/h1] This is one of those games that I played and then wish that there was an indifferent option on Steam, or at the very least a numbered or star rating. Don't get me wrong, this is a competently made Metroidvania with awesome, retro visuals and a good sound track. It probably does not deserve a thumbs down, as it is miles above some trash shovel-ware games on here. However, it became a slog to get through for me and by the end I was just glad I was done with it. [b]I simply did not enjoy playing it for the majority of my time spent with it.[/b]  It could be that I had just finished playing Ori and the Blind Forest and Hollow Knight, two games I would vastly recommend over this one. Those two games are metroidvanias as well, but both of them add innovation to the genre. One of the biggest things those games do is reward you for backtracking by having exp/skill upgrades. You feel like you are making progress even when going back and re-exploring places you have already visited. This game requires a lot of backtracking, and I mean A LOT, in order to get to new areas. However, it does not incentivize the backtracking at all. There are no item/exp rewards for killing the trash mobs, and the combat itself isn't fun enough to be its own reward. You may find another throwaway weapon or hitpoint upgrade, but I never felt the reward was satisfying enough for the amount of time spent.   Adding to the issue is the not very useful, retro-style map. Another example of the developer going for nostalgia over innovation or even practicality. Don't get me wrong, I hate hand-holding and I hate when games tell you exactly what to do and where to go. The lack of direction given to the player is not the problem, the problem is that while aimlessly wandering to find the right direction you feel like you are wasting time, literally making no progress and partaking in boring combat. The game is basically begging you to use a guide to save you from the tedium of even more backtracking as you look for health upgrades and lore items. It doesn't help that at one point I bounced off of an enemy into an area I wasn't supposed to be able to go back to, but I didn't know I wasn't supposed to be able to reach it. After all, the game is all about finding weird bugs/glitches and exploiting or manipulating them in order to proceed past them. So I wondered around for a long time thinking there was something new I was supposed to find in that area. Nope, there was only boring combat and wasted time to be had.  [h1]Combat/Bosses[/h1] Let's talk a little more about the combat now. More specifically, about the bosses. The bosses (like the rest of the enemies) have cool designs and beautiful sprites which contribute to the great, cold sci-fi aesthetic this game has. There is only one problem with the bosses: they are boring to fight. That does not mean that are easy, some of them presented a real challenge. But the challenge was a predictable pattern that offered little room for creativity. [i]You do the thing that the game wants you to do and you try not to f*** it up, because that there boss has a lot of HP and its blasty balls go boom boom, so follow the pattern until it is dead, k? [/i]  Again, nostalgia prevails over innovation.  [h1]Weapons[/h1] There are LOTS of weapons and each of them has its own gimmick. Some of them are pretty cool. [b]Some of them.[/b] Unfortunately, the majority of them are not used to their full potential and I feel they were just added because the developer thought they were neat to program. I think I ended up using 3 weapons during the course of the game for actual combat, with other weapons only being used when they were necessary to use against specific enemies or to solve certain puzzles. Surely, they could have been put to better use or some system of strengths/weaknesses or extra incentive for using certain weapons could have been added. Many games solve this by having status effects, combinations, resistances, and other incentives for using one attack or weapon over another. Oh, but this is supposed to be a retro callback and Metroid didn't do that, so I guess this game couldn't either. You basically just need a long range and a short range/scatter attack. Done.  [h1] PROS [/h1] -That is some awesome, retro-inspired art and cool enemy sprites. -The game feels cold, alien, and mechanical. It is a unique look and feel, and the music and art all mesh will to portray it. -The story is interesting. It requires you think about it and doesn't hit you over the head with its meaning.  [h1] MEH [/h1] -Lots of weapons. There are some cool ones, but I can't remember the last time I played a Metroidvania and ended up just not giving a crap about finding new weapons after a while. -platforming is just okay (this isn't Ori)  [h1]CONS[/h1] -Combat gets boring (this isn't Hollow Knight) -Uninspired boss design -Map -almost no incentive for massive amounts of forced backtracking -Oh look, a crappy weapon. Okay, let's see what it does. Uh huh. Okay, switching back to my old weapon. -backtracking -backtracking -backtracking -ITS COOL BECAUSE ITS RETRO  [h1]Summary[/h1] It has been a while since I have played this, but I wanted to chime in with my dissenting opinion since the game seems to come so highly recommended and I see it everywhere now. When I mentioned some of these points in a forum before, I was basically told I wasn't hardcore enough, as if I have not been playing games since my original NES as a child (including, yes, Metroid). I even have a gag t-shirt that looks like a Metallica logo and says "Metroidvania: Masters of Backtracking." I have nothing against the genre, it is one of my favorites behind RPGs, Roguelikes and TCG/CCG/Deck-builders. I would just rather play one of the innovative and novel games that has come out in recent years over something that mimics the classics of old without being as good.  [h1]Overall Score: 7/10[/h1]  Obviously, there are lots of people who want super retro gameplay, even for things like combat and bosses. Personally, I like grindy old-school RPG's with crappy 3D graphics; it hits that nostalgic spot for me as those were the games I spent the most hours in. However, I would fully understand if someone else said "Uhh, I don't think this is for me." This isn't for me. I'm not a purist when it comes to Metroidvanias, I just want something to be fun.  Basically, if you loved Metroid, Super Metroid and early Castlevania games and want something that will scratch that nostalgic itch without being too much different gameplay-wise, you will probably love this game. Lots of people love this game. I like the soundtrack and art, I recognize it is solidly made and the developer poured his heart into it. I just didn't enjoy my time spent with it overall. I recommend it for a certain subset of people, but for everyone else: there are better options available.
Date 2020-07-06 Playtime 16h 31m Rec Positive The eerie genius child of Contra and Metroid
Date 2020-07-05 Playtime 16h 13m Rec Positive Axiom Verge - это невероятно качественная метроидвания, которая словно кричит нинтенде: "в современном мире есть место классическим двухмерным метроидваниям, вон мы уже сиквел фигарим, так что вам еще надо для пятого метроида?!" Настолько это игра похожа на детище R&D1. Но даже без очевидного вдохновителя, Аксиома может предложить множество идей и фишек, о которых я распишу ниже. Плюсы:  + Невероятная пиксельная графика, которая может как вызвать ностальгию по первым похождениям очаровательной блондинки, так и поразить невероятными русалками. + Атмосфера одиночества, апатии и смерти, которая будет удерживать вас в этой игре до последнего. + Сюжет, который по глубокости и сложности сопостовим с Хроно триггером, и которого так не хватало в Метроидах + Исправление косяков оригинала, например: точки сохранения вас хилят, а не заставляют фармить хп на мобах, фаст тревл, отсутствие важных для прохождения предметов в, бл***, секретках. СЕКРЕТКАХ. + Приличный бестиарий с по-настоящему уникальными врагами. + Классная механика взлома врагов. А вот минусов только 1, но зато какой!  - Боссы. А вот боссов разработчик делал вдохновляясь не великолепным Metroid 4, а ... первым. Они все ведут себя одинаково (стреляют по Трейсу и немного похаживают, если могут) и даже финальный - очень плох.  А если ну очень придираться: - Догадаться до того, что последний халат телепортирует и вверх, и вниз - очень сложно, как и в принципе понять как этот халат юзать. - От последней точки сохранения до других локк идти долговато, можно было и вывести к коридору. И это всё. Больше придраться не к чему. Так что я ставлю игре 8/10 и рекомендую фанам Метроида, а вот всем остальным я рекомендую ознакомиться с этой серией,а потом сразу к Аксиоме.
Date 2020-07-05 Playtime 11h 34m Rec Positive I bought this game along with 6 others at the time. I did not expect to like 2 of those games and this was one of them. But i was pleasantly surprised. The game is pretty good although i seem to have suffered from being lost from back-tracking. It's also possible that I went searching in areas i shouldnt have for too long and it tired me out xD Either way this is a good buy, just don't do what i did .. I do plan on revisiting the game in the future to complete it.
Date 2020-07-04 Playtime 6h 14m Rec Positive good
Date 2020-07-04 Playtime 23h 53m Rec Positive I was looking for good metroidvanias when I stumbled upon Axiom Verge.  Well, It's more of a metroid than vania and being a fan of the old SNES super metroid I was delighted by that.  Even more when I noticed that the dialogs and the narrative are super captivating. I finished the game more than once and I'm hoping for a sequel.  This was the most pleasant surprise for sure, no one has recomended it to me before, and for sure is one of the best quality games in my library.  I recomend this game to everyone, especially to those who like me were fans of the old metroid games.
Date 2020-07-03 Playtime 3h 12m Rec Positive I purchased this game on every platform its available on.. Support them the best you can too so they keep releasing this kind of gems!  Pros: Gameplay:  If you liked Super Metroid you will 100% enjoy this game.. it has the same vibe! Soundtrack: Honestly 10/10 fit perfectly the world you play in.  Cons:  A little too short!!!! I wanted it to keep going for so much longer haha! <3  Worth purchasing.

Date 2020-07-02 Playtime 8h 37m Rec Positive これはメトロイドヴァニアですか？ これは（2D）メトロイドです（私見）。  おおまかに： ・2Dメトロイド。 ・2Dの探索型アクションゲーム。  おすすめか否か： ・2Dメトロイドが楽しいと思う人にはとてもおすすめ。 ・メトロイドヴァニアのうちキャッスルヴァニア要素が好きな人は、どうだろう（どっちも好きなので）  良かったと思う点： ・2Dメトロイド。 ・通常画面表示は固定だが大型ボス戦時はズームアウトするため全体を把握しつつ遊ぶことができること。  可も不可もしない点： ・初期の壁すり抜けアイテム説明にダブルタップとあるが2回目のタップ時、押しっぱなしにしないと動作しないので気付かないうちはハマったと思った。 ・スピードランモード（タイムアタック用・実況配信者用）もあるよ  悪かったと思う点： ・MAP移動用のワープが欲しかった（一部を除いた各MAPへのショートカット用MAPはあるが）。 ・2Dメトロイドでよくあるハマりをやらかした（目的地不明で迷子、操作が増えたのに使いどころがわからず迷子、など迷子）。 　→SteamのAxiom Vergeのガイドに攻略も動画もあるのでなんとかなります。
Date 2020-06-30 Playtime 22h 29m Rec Positive Rhythmic, classic 2D Gaming at its best in terms of Level Design, Graphic Style and especially the wonderful music. Although it all melts together perfectly. I just barely cried, because i could have died of acid after the second boss, so, this game is really touching! I grew up on the Mega Drive: Streets of Rage 2, Thunderforce 4 and Revenge of Shinobi- especially the last two ones made me cry and broke my nerves as a child. I LOVE AXIOM VERGE.
Date 2020-06-29 Playtime 22h 31m Rec Positive It's 8-bit Metroid.   It's not as good as Super Metroid of course, but it's better than Shadow Complex. I've never played the original Metroid, which is obviously the basis for this, so I can't compare it to that, except the modern controls.  One thing I will complain about is the grappling hook. Your character automatically leaps when you're trying to propel from clifftops, and there's no way to turn it off.  Oh, and there's one weird bug--I think it's a bug--where if you try to phase shift through a wall you can't, it can create a duplicate of yourself and let you pass through certain walls and ledges, etc. This only happened once, but I haven't tried to duplicate the duplicator as it wasn't very useful.
Date 2020-06-29 Playtime 15h 14m Rec Negative 作为一款挺有名的银河城游戏，在玩家间和媒体那里是不是会听到其大名，现在终于玩上了。但有些令我失望。  一个是游戏里没有即时传送功能。拿到某些关键道具，想回头到以前的地图去拿之前拿不到的道具，或者回头进行主线，只能跑图。游戏时间基本好一大半的时间其实是跑图。  最后是主线几乎没有引导。虽然剧情会告诉你去干什么，但是具体要去哪个区域哪个位置完成，是没有指引的。你只能看到有路就去试试走走，发现走不通就回头试另外一条。再加上上面说的没有即时传送。假如你走错路，往回走的过程是满让人气馁和痛苦的。

Date 2020-06-28 Playtime 13h 55m Rec Positive Um excelente Metroidvania, feito por somente uma pessoa e ainda sim no nível de Ori ou Hollow knight. Super divertido, amplo, com MUITAS habilidades que destravam ao longo do caminho e um mundo muito amplo. Por fim, tem a arte, a música e ambientação sinistra de SuperMetroid no nível certo
Date 2020-06-28 Playtime 35h 38m Rec Positive Игра относится к жанру метройдвания. Наиболее ярким представителем игр данного жанра, из тех в которые я играл, на мой взгляд, является Super Metroid консольной версии SNES. То и данную игру я буду сравнивать именно с игрой Супер Метроид.  Axiom Verge, как по мне, игра не однозначная. С одной стороны это не плохой сюжет, разнообразные боссы, достаточно большое количество локаций и практически не повторяющиеся враги. Музыкальный звукоряд на каждой отдельной локации, к которому быстро привыкаешь. Возможно он и не слишком проработанный и нет таких психоделических композиций, какие были в Супер Метроид. Но все это вышеперечисленное однозначно можно отнести к сильным сторонам данной игры. К минусам я бы отнес то спорное решение, автора игры, относительно количества разнообразного оружия и его баланса в плане убойной силы. Единственный вид оружия обладающий свойством проникать сквозь стены (которого действительно не хватает на протяжении всей игры) можно получить только в самом конце, когда самое время убивать финального босса и то за этим оружием нужно возвращаться в другую локацию.      И местами уж очень сложные задачи, одни похожие на явные баги (но все же не производящие ощущения халтуры), а для решения других, порой, требуется просмотр роликов с прохождением на ютубе )) Подводя итог, в целом игру я бы посоветовал, игра интересная, временами затягивает, местами сложная, но по прохождении все равно оставляет приятные воспоминания.
Date 2020-06-27 Playtime 11h 59m Rec Positive It's a fun game and a good metroidvania however I found most weapons to be useless or disappointing
Date 2020-06-26 Playtime 10h 22m Rec Positive The game is good but some mechanics are clumsy.  Overall a very enjoyable game if you are more on the "metroid" side of the metroidvania spectrum like me but it could use some polish.
Date 2020-06-25 Playtime 26h 21m Rec Negative It's amazing this game is getting warranted a sequel.  They say this game was made by only one developer, which I keep hearing a lot of people say for indie games like these these days.  The truth is, unless this person is really extremely talented, there's no way one person can make a game all on his own.  He/She had to have got this play-tested at some point.  I mean, even Metroid, which this game is based off of, did not have just one developer (look at the credits).  This game's story is terrible, the level design is terrible, the enemies are terrible, the music is terrible...but yet there's something about this game that reminds me of Metroid...oh wait.  Don't get me wrong, for the first couple of hours, you'll get sucked into the game's...uh, "world" if you like...with interesting enemies and environments.  However, you'll be frustrated with this game's length and be asking a lot of questions about not just the game's world and story, but even the game's programming.  Questions such as:  Why does the screen keep waving back and forth even when I'm not progressing forward? (I get why, but overtime it starts to nauseate you if you don't progress forward to find a certain character you haven't met up with yet.)  Why does this world keep questioning the avatar when even the avatar himself doesn't know what's going on?  Why are there enemies in every room I go to?  Why does this game not catch a break in between rooms except for save points?  Why are save points 2 map grid blocks high when there's nothing even worth exploring in them?  Why does hit-detection seem off?  Why can I only shoot diagonally when running?  Why don't enemies get pushed back when I shoot them with my electric shotgun?  Why does every platform have an enemy on them that wants to home in on me every time they see me?  (If you want me to progress, at least give me a fighting chance!)  Why does it seem that the weapon upgrades don't stack up on damage or range yet enemies die more quickly due to more powerful weapons?  Why is it that I can't corrupt the whole game world instead of just certain areas (most of which only contain journal pieces)?  Why is it that some journal pieces have perfect English, yet some have only gibberish?  Does the main avatar have amnesia?  Is he hallucinating another world?  Is he in the Matrix?  Even the game's own description doesn't even know!  On top of that, this game's story piles on cliches after cliches after cliches (a demon alien robot thing!).  Why are they trying to kill the main avatar when you don't even know why?  The game also literally forces you to run in a circle just to get a power up!  I think this game was literally made for the sake of filling in that Metroidvania gap which has has been done to death by better games both in the past and present (Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night and Timespinners come to mind for current generations).  The 8-bit/16-bit style does nothing to differentiate that from both current and past games.  If this game were to come out during the time when Metroidvania's were popular on old school consoles, this might have gotten a pass.  However, this game offers nothing original and nothing new to the table both in the Metroidvania genre, and gaming as a whole.  Sure, the weapons are nice and the shooting is fun for a while, but as I've said earlier, this game will give you a headache for its convoluted universe and programming.  Here's a tip to that one developer who made this game (which I doubt): Keep it simple, stud.
Date 2020-06-25 Playtime 17h 30m Rec Positive A true metroidvania. Going for the 100% completion!
Date 2020-06-24 Playtime 15h 49m Rec Positive Great game, totally an awesome throwback to the metroidvania style. Excellent story super challenging.
Date 2020-06-23 Playtime 10h 20m Rec Positive Top demais! Destaque pra trilha sonora maravilhosa! Recomendo pra quem curte um Metroidvania!!
Date 2020-06-23 Playtime 18h 16m Rec Positive game was made by one guy and close to the original metroid the best way to compare this one game has some crazy lore that leaves the one asking questions when you finish the game about events

Date 2020-06-22 Playtime 126h 25m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is everything you could ever want in a Metroidvania: large, interconnected world, visually distinct places, places off the normal path that you can't access without the right upgrades/tools (but sometimes can), sequence breaks, tight controls, enhanced storytelling through the world and its optional items, secret areas, fantastic atmospheric music, you name the trope, it's probably here. And it does them all exceptionally well.  The world is enigmatic and we only learn a little bit about it beyond what we see, but boy does that rabbit hole become compelling the more you dive in.  Modern features it brings include highly customizable controls, save and quit (progress is saved and you respawn at the last save room), 8-directional aiming, speedrunning mode, and more. The platforming, enemies, and bosses offer a nice challenge, rarely overwhelming players who are not super comfortable with platformers.  Replayability is high. Your first playthrough could take you a long time as you explore the world, but on subsequent playthroughs you can easily reduce the time it takes you to finish the game.  A solid 10/10 experience for all you hardcore Metroid fans who are looking for an amazing 2D experience released after 2004. Can't wait for the sequel.
Date 2020-06-21 Playtime 57h 52m Rec Positive Muy impresionado con este juego... Si amaste Super Metroid, este juego te encantara. Parrafo aparte a la banda sonora, alucinante... a y para los que les guste conseguir el 100 % de los items, un verdadero desafio
Date 2020-06-21 Playtime 34h 23m Rec Positive If you like Metroid, will like this game.
Date 2020-06-20 Playtime 22h 16m Rec Positive Amazing Metroidvania game!!
Date 2020-06-20 Playtime 14h 23m Rec Positive Very nice game. Well produced. I am a 2D platformer fan, and this game fulfill my expectations.  Pros: Well executed metroidvania genre. No major flaws. The design of the map could improve a little, though (not complaining, but there are room for improvements). 
Date 2020-06-19 Playtime 6h 39m Rec Positive This stands as the finest inheritor of the Metroidvania 16-bit world I've ever played. The pulsing synthwave soundtrack, the wonderful visuals and interesting mechanics and weapons will keep you working and exploring for hours. I am sure once you've discovered all this place has to offer, you could speed run it, but why? Immerse yourself in the action and breathtaking designs - you will feel that you must earn access to your savepoints. Bring your mind for strategy and be mobile and adaptive at all times - for this wonderful place will smash the unwary!
Date 2020-06-19 Playtime 20h 1m Rec Positive Despite how on-the-nose this game appears to be to Metroid 1, the comparison is mostly skin deep.  With the multitude of weapons, the ability to alter enemies with a glitchy aesthetic for both puzzle solving and ease of combat, plus some truly unique methods of expanding movement options, Axiom Verge makes an identity of its own.  Couple that with a story created by inference on the various memos found hidden in every nook and cranny, I was always captivated on where the game was heading next.  Several of the puzzles are particularly cryptic, but it will be immensely gratifying to solve them with your own knowledge.  My main complaint is that the visuals can be a bit intense at times, especially with the larger glitch effects.  In addition, while the boss fights are frantic and fast-paced, your methods of evasion later on are lacking for what the game can throw at you.  Overall, this is a great experience, and I cannot wait for the sequel on the horizon.
Date 2020-06-18 Playtime 13h 39m Rec Negative Double tapping the same button/stick as the one you use to move is a mechanic implementation that needs to die along with pointless and frustratingly obscured collectibles. Otherwise, this game is visually beautiful, and despite it's flaws I am infinitely impressed that the entire thing was created by one person. Unfortunately, the above complaints outweighed my love for the genre, so this gets a thumb down from me.
Date 2020-06-18 Playtime 7h 1m Rec Negative 如果一个无名小卒就能做出任天堂看家系列水准的游戏，那这个世界也未免太主次不分了。模仿《超级银河战士》，然而精髓一个都没学到，体验一塌糊涂。
Date 2020-06-18 Playtime 19h 54m Rec Positive I only ask two things of metroidvanias, fun and interesting powers and a lot of things and secrets to explore. This one delivers both on top of an intriguing story and amazing characters. Metroid players can find a lot to enjoy here.
Date 2020-06-17 Playtime 16h 46m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a good game, but almost all of the bosses are either really boring or really frustrating because of how they attack. Other than that, the game is great.
Date 2020-06-15 Playtime 26h 2m Rec Positive Good music, great atmosphere, beautiful aesthetics. The item variety is also very cool. The game's biggest weakness is balance: I played on hard difficulty, and the first 2/3rds of the game were very manageable. Then I hit an insane difficulty spike, where you meet some very hard bosses. This was very frustrating and really dampened my experience of the game, especially since the very last boss was a push-over that I beat in 5 minutes. Also, you often don't know where to go, but if you enjoy exploration and are listening to a podcast its OK. Overall good game, only lacks in certain aspects.
Date 2020-06-15 Playtime 21h 22m Rec Positive Metroid is my favorite game series of all time. I can say with absolute certainty that this game is without question the best metroidvania game I have ever played and may very will be the best I will ever play. If you like 2D Metroid, I cannot recommend this game enough. It is beyond worth the price.
Date 2020-06-14 Playtime 14h 45m Rec Positive Great looking game with a very confusing story and a bunch of secrets. Combat is fun and bosses are challenging. Sadly most of the weapons you get are pretty useless. A big disappointment for me was when I got an in-game translator for the alien language since translating it yourself is much more satisfying.  You can still do it yourself but it just feels like a waste of time at that point. Still a good game though, maybe wait for a discount.
Date 2020-06-13 Playtime 13h 36m Rec Positive Axiom Verge was released in 2015 at a time when the metroidvania genre already had a good number of great games. This could make Axiom Verge "just another metroidvania" or not get enough attention. But the work here is so absurdly well done that it would be very difficult for this game to go unnoticed. A fluid gameplay, with good pace, beautiful pixel-art graphics, interesting mechanics, metroidvania elements very well explored, a rich universe, with a good lore, a lot of mystery and a really interesting plot. Axiom Verge is one of the most addictive games that I have played in the last time you just can't stop playing. If you're a fan of metroidvania, you MUST play Axiom Verge.
Date 2020-06-11 Playtime 6h 38m Rec Positive Fun, challenging, gives an incentive to explore. 10/5
Date 2020-06-10 Playtime 2h 37m Rec Positive (+) Great atmosphere  (+) Good soundtrack (+) A game for Metroid/Castlevania fans  (-) Fatigue set in after the first few bosses
Date 2020-06-09 Playtime 14h 49m Rec Positive Great Game!!

Date 2020-06-09 Playtime 17h 30m Rec Positive good old platforming retro action
Date 2020-06-08 Playtime 16h 34m Rec Positive If you are a fan of 2D Metroid games, you should be excited about trying Axiom Verge. The aesthetic and world interactions (like shooting random walls to reveal a secret with little to no indicator) are reminiscent of older 2D Metroid games.  Although I do not think this style has aged well, it does provide some fan service for nostalgic 2D Metroid lovers. The game differs from Metroid with its expansive weapon arsenal that is only loosely tied to the progression items and with a protagonist that has dialogue interactions. I recommend Axiom Verge to 2D Metroid fans but would be hesitant to recommend it to anyone who is not a seasoned Metroidvania player.  The bosses in this game are disappointing and could have been a lot better. The game featured too many gimmick boss encounters when one considers the overall short length of the game and the bosses that are standard turn into bullet hell fights that do not meld well with the game play. The game has a focus on eight directional aiming which often has the player standing still in order to aim diagonally; so, bullet hell boss fights do not make sense with being forced to stand still. I enjoyed the aiming system in the exploratory portions of the game but the aiming system made dodging and doing damage at the same time too difficult in a way that did not feel like a challenge but rather a design flaw.  
Date 2020-06-08 Playtime 11h 14m Rec Positive 괜찮은 메트로베니아 게임. 숨겨진 요소를 찾지 않고 빠르게 간다면 이거보다 더 빠른 시간 내에 깰 수 있다. 순간이동 포탈 같은것이 없어서  새로 얻은 기술로 이전에 못가던 곳을 가려고 할 때, 그곳까지 직접 이동해야 하는것이 귀찮다.
Date 2020-06-08 Playtime 17h 43m Rec Positive This game made by one man is better than a lot of games made by entire studios. If you're a fan of Super Metroid, or metroidvanias in general, then why are you still reading this? You should be installing this game.
Date 2020-06-06 Playtime 12h 47m Rec Positive Green ball thing best weapon
Date 2020-06-05 Playtime 11h 25m Rec Positive If you really like metroidvanias, I recomend it. Otherwise, it was somewhat of a 'filler game' to me. The story required more attention from me than I was inclined to give it and it turned confusing all the way through.  Regardless, it was an ok game, and I can see why people liked it, even if it didn't scratch my itch too much.
Date 2020-06-04 Playtime 92h 16m Rec Positive excelent throwback to oldschool 2d metroidvania games.  art style is on point, even has a plot!  most importantly, gameplay is smooth.  level areas are massive, but feels like exploring an alien enviornment.  again, on point!  I was looking for another rom hack, and stumbled across this gem.  definitely recommended.
Date 2020-06-03 Playtime 10h 55m Rec Positive cool metroidvania with a ton of weapons. But if you are not familiar with metroidvanias you could get frustrated with not finding the right way to progress
Date 2020-05-31 Playtime 84h 10m Rec Positive Great retro-style Metroidvania.  Had problems with teleport firing when I didn't want it (and sometimes not when I did want it), and switching weapons in error in the middle of a fight. Needs to have an option to unbind L3.
Date 2020-05-29 Playtime 8h 34m Rec Positive Well, I give it a modest recommendation. I found the gameplay a bit dull, but A.V. is trying to capture the feeling of the nintendo classics. I did not find the challenge too hard or too easy, and there were a lot of findable upgrades to keep me interested. One super nice feature was how each boss had multiple strategies, including a cheese-move that let guys like me advance.  The game worked great on an old ubuntu desktop with radeon mesa drivers and two xbox-type gamepads. The game takes 160MBs of diskspace, and it uses a Mono-type game engine. I would recommend anyone still on the fence to wait on a big sale, since I feel the full price is a lot for a game that is not real accessible. (86% of owners got the achievement for the first boss, but only 56% got the one for the third boss.)
Date 2020-05-28 Playtime 22h 43m Rec Positive I adore this game!  Some people play it for five minutes and dismiss it as a Metroid clone, but I promise it really isn't.  Obviously it's Metroid inspired, as all metroidvania games are (and also the retro pixel art yada yada), but dismissing it as a clone ignores all of the good things this game has to offer.  There are certain obstacles that lead you to think you'll be getting a roll or a double jump later on to clear them, but instead you get a completely unexpected ability.  Every time I unlocked something or found a secret it felt super rewarding and got me really excited to find more!  The environments are super atmospheric and look amazing.  The soundtrack for the game is equally amazing, and helps support the atmosphere even more.  It was super hard to stop playing for the night, and I honestly wish there was more.  Idk I'm not very good at forming cohesive thoughts, so here's a quick list of good things about this game: - the map is HUGE - the robot ladies look so cool - holy moly so many weapons - holy moly so many mobility options - holy moly so many upgrades - tons of secrets and hidden abilities - secret worlds are so cool -designs for bosses, enemies, weapons, and environments were well made and also COOL - the map helps completionists know when they've collected everything     It wouldn't be a fair review without criticizing the game a lil, so here's a list of cons: - lore is a bit confusing but is good once you figure everything out              - I wish there was more environmental storytelling instead of just reading stuff out of tablets (there is some environmental stuff tho) - there is no quick way of crossing the map unless you're very experienced and know what you're doing. - the grapple is CLUNKY and I hate the first area where it is introduced.  It does gets easier as you figure it out though. - I wish my character moved faster but whatever - bosses could be a tad bit harder- especially towards the end  In conclusion, game is fun please give it a try
Date 2020-05-28 Playtime 14h 22m Rec Positive This game is very close to exactly what you would want from a Metroid game with stunning visuals and a dark atmosphere. The amount of weapons and hidden areas is amazing and it even includes hidden areas that are randomized between playthroughs. Only complaint is the difficulty twards the end is brutal.
Date 2020-05-28 Playtime 25h 13m Rec Positive Definitely takes a lot of inspiration from Metroid (Classic style), so if you're a fan of that, you'll like this one.  It's huge, rewards exploration and probably has multiple endings depending on how fast you beat the game, how much of the map you discover and how many of the items you collect.. All three of those are metrics that are tracked.
Date 2020-05-27 Playtime 9h 5m Rec Negative Это самая неудачная (именно неудачная, не плохая попрошу заметить) Метроидвания в моей истории. Обо всем в целом: черезмерно нагроможденное управление, где джойст просто захлебывается от действий (смена оружия и крюк на правый стик ? Это надо было головы не иметь, что бы так сделать по дефолту), отвратная музыка (5 минут максимум), спорная графическая составляющая (привет 16 цветов), бестолковые апгрейды, дурацкие боссы, никчемное и бесполезное оружие, хаотичные локации. Все сделано по принципу - главное количество. Пожалуй это самый глобальный прокол в играх этого жанра и если в других казалось бы хороших проектах игру губят несколько крайне плохих вещей (приветик Бласп и Холлоу Кнайт), тут ее губит абсолютно все. Я вообще не знаю за что ее порекомендовать можно ? И как заставить себя ее пройти хотя бы раз ? Ребятки, честно, Метроид на NES это классика, а тут какой то жеванный картон в обертке от Рафаелло.  Просто. Пройдите. Мимо.
Date 2020-05-25 Playtime 21h 36m Rec Positive Alors oui, j'ai beaucoup aimé ce jeu. C'est un très bon Métroid Like ou Vania, bref comme bon vous semble  (fait par mec tout seul en plus, et ça c'est ouf) ... Mais ils a quand même de grand défauts qui peuvent le rendre assez frustrant. Par exemple ces power up qui comme dans tout bon Métroid sont sensé vous débloqué les zones au fur et à mesure. Là, les power up ne vous débloque pas des zones mais des bouts de zones petit à petit... (vous chopez un power up et pensez pouvoir enfin avancer et en fait vous faites trois mètres et vous êtes de nouveau bloqué) ce qui oblige à un nombre de backtracking vraiment indigeste par moment.   Notamment du fait que les déplacements sont très long, qu'il n'y a aucun moyen de TP et que LE pouvoir cool du jeu et de tout bon Métroid, qui permet de se déplacer plus vite et avec fun, à savoir le Dash (avec la Red Coat) ne se débloque qu'à la toute fin du jeu. après ça, il ne vous reste plus qu'à REparcourir une énième fois les zone juste pour leurs derniers secrets ou aller direct au boss final... c'est dommage. Explorer, et  revenir sur ces pas, c'est le lot des Metroid ok, mais sans déplacement plus rapide et avec les mobs qui repop en permanence... Ajoutez à cela l'absence d'indications quelconque sur ou aller ou quoi faire et ça donne vraiment des moments de perditions dommageable pour l'expérience de jeu. Si en plus vous ne captez pas rapidement les mécaniques indispensable du jeu avec le Disrupteur c'est encore pire. Il y a aussi plein plein "d'armes" (ou plutôt tirs) différents dans le jeu ce qui pourrait être à priori super mais il faut savoir qu'elle ne servent qu'à tuer des monstres, ne vous vous débloque aucun passages (à par au début du jeu) et pour la plus part ne sont pas très utile et manque de puissance (sauf pour les dernières qui sont bien cachées et nécessite le super dash), perso j'ai fait le jeu quasi  tout du long  avec mon tir de base que je trouvais la plus part du temps plus efficace.  Bref, j'aime les jeux qui ne nous tiennent pas par la main, mais la c'était un peu trop pour moi. D'autant plus qu'en soit, le jeu n'est pas difficile du tout. Les boss sont anecdotique, les mobs sont pas ouf, ils sont juste chiant car pour la plus part leur patern se limite à vous foncer dessus et vous coller au train ou alors c'est des sac à PV ce qui est juste relou. Donc au final ce jeu est cool pour son univers, son ambiance et ces musiques. Le game play est bon mais tarde trop à être vraiment fun. Je pense que ma deuxième run le sera plus que la première et ça c'est dommage sur un Metroid. Ah, et aussi un conseil, faites le jeu en anglais, la trad Fr est franchement bizarre.  ça reste quand même un type tout seul qui l'à fait et pour ça, ce jeu est vraiment incroyable. Il était peut-être un peu trop tout seul d'ailleurs, et les défaut du jeu sont surement du à ça.  Axiom Verge 2 va bientôt arrivé en tout cas et je suis curieux de voir ce que ça va donné. Pour sur je vais me le faire, malgré tout ce que j'ai dit plus haut sur le premier opus, j'ai aimé ( Mon côté maso surement).
Date 2020-05-24 Playtime 23h 14m Rec Positive Metroidvania raiz!
Date 2020-05-24 Playtime 22h 40m Rec Positive Pretty good, closest game to the original Metroid that I have played so far.  Good music and gfx
Date 2020-05-23 Playtime 21h 2m Rec Negative A respectable metroidvania which has a few too many issues to give a hearty recommendation. There's a lot to like in the Giger-esque aesthetic and soundtrack, and the gameplay is mostly solid, but Axiom Verge stuffs itself too full on multiple fronts. Your ever-expanding array of tools eventually uses every last button on the gamepad, leading to frequent interface issues. One particular problem is that you change weapons by pressing the analog stick in, which means that your weapons will often swap by accident in the middle of trying to run and gun. Another is your short-range teleport being a double-tap on the D-pad, which can take several tries to work when you're trying to get through a wall, then has the nerve to go off by accident in the middle of some precision platforming. You can rebind the controls, but since all the buttons are used, this tends to fix one thing only to break another.  Then there are the secrets. A pile of hidden stuff to hunt for is a cornerstone of the genre, but Axiom Verge offers too many of them hidden in too many different ways. You eventually wind up testing every little bit of wall to see if it's breakable, hackable, or intangible, in addition to looking for places you can teleport through walls or send your remote drone into tunnels. This soon devolves into an exercise in tedium, and it only gets worse when you have to revisit the entire game with your new tools to prepare for the next boss. Aggravating that last point, the game lacks an accessible fast travel system, meaning you spend insane amounts of time backtracking through areas you've already cleared out, and then cursing and doing it again when you die and return to the last save point.  Hardcore fans of the genre who just can't get enough and/or want to challenge their secret-finding skills will find fun here, but for the frustrations involved, most of us are better off sticking with Bloodstained.
Date 2020-05-23 Playtime 21h 37m Rec Positive Very good game!
Date 2020-05-23 Playtime 1h 15m Rec Positive Прошёл на PSVITA, прослезился, разрыдался и купил везде где только дотянулся со всем обвесом.  Саундтрек - моё особое почтение. Всем любителям ретро, платформеров и метроидваний - просто обязательно. Мало того что вы почешете то что обычно чешете метроидваниями, в этой игре куча фишечек приятно обновляющих процесс игры. Равно как и челленджей.  Также отдельно особенно отмечу то, как уровни в итоге собираются в цельную планету после открытия транзита. В момент игрового открытия я просто рот разинул.  10 русалкив из 10 Томас просто гора.  Жду вторую.
Date 2020-05-22 Playtime 32h 57m Rec Positive If you're looking for another great Metroidvania, this is the one.
Date 2020-05-22 Playtime 14h 11m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a solid, mediocre Metroidvania.

Date 2020-05-17 Playtime 11h 15m Rec Positive The first half is a bit wonky but DAMN does it get good
Date 2020-05-15 Playtime 12h 59m Rec Negative I'm close to the end and realised I just don't want to play it anymore.  It started quite good to become increasingly annoying and tedious mostly due to bad ennemy design/placement and control choice (that double tap to dash is awful). The story is serviceable although it didn't hook me into it. Most of the graphics are pretty bland except for some parts which looked very nice. I ended up turning the music off.  I may finish it one day although it's highly unlikely
Date 2020-05-13 Playtime 64h 47m Rec Positive Just play it. You'll have fun.
Date 2020-05-13 Playtime 7h 52m Rec Positive Decent combat, but incredible pixel art and a wonderful soundtrack make it better than it might otherwise be.  The "intentionally glitchy" environments are so convincing that it made me think my computer was messed up.  It is DEFINITELY not perfect, though. The areas barely differentiate from each other, and there are not many memorable locations. This makes backtracking difficult, as the large size of the map combined with uninspired map design makes it feel same-y. Enemy AI is also just cheap sometimes, they rush you as soon as they see you. And a lot of the weapons are useless outside of their functionality to open certain doors. And the controls feel clunky sometimes, specifically the air dash and the grappling hook.  As a piece of art, this game is lovely, as a game this game is average or even below average. But, as a whole I would still recommend it for cheap.
Date 2020-05-12 Playtime 10h 38m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a single-player “Metrdoivania” game, which harkens back to yesteryear with heavily pixelated graphics and stylized soundtrack.  You play as the sideburn-sporting scientist Trace, who wakes in an alien world after an accident and has to unravel how and why he’s there.  The game is an obvious homage to Metroid, and includes all the tropes that people have come to expect from the genre - a mapped world with item-based barriers, boss fights, hidden extras, etc…  The gameplay and world are addictive and fun, even if the controls & sound design don’t feel as polished as Super Metroid.  The nostalgia factor of the game is high, and any fans of the Metroid franchise will undoubtedly enjoy it.  The game isn’t without its flaws - the animation and sound design is only okay, and doesn’t give a real visceral feel for fights or level traversal.  The plot has interesting moments, but is also a little nonsensical.  While some environments are very evocative and interesting, they don’t have any backstory or meaningful transitions, giving the world a very level-by-unconnected-level feel.  Though there are a variety of weapons, there’s no strong motivation to switch frequently, so you end up using the same two or three.  Incredibly, this game was developed by a single person, which I think is very amazing, and it really is a love-letter to the genre.  I had fun racking up my 58 deaths, and I think that people who like the genre will really enjoy themselves.  Recommend?: Yes* Rating/10: 7 Value @ $20 (estimate)?  0.5 hour/dollar (okay) Hours played for review: 10  * for fans of the genre 
Date 2020-05-12 Playtime 21h 46m Rec Positive Pixel art metroidvania, what would you need more. Brings those childhood memories from Metroid :D Seems similar to ESA, but I think it's easier on the secret endings and puzzles. Definitely will be coming back for more. 8/10.
Date 2020-05-11 Playtime 16h 43m Rec Negative Хороший арт-проект, ужасная игра.  Буквально единственное, от чего в этой игре не хочется плеваться - это эстетика, годный закос под визуал старых метроидов и арты Гигера. Музыка неплоха, но однообразна, и надоест вам раньше, чем вы пройдёте игру до конца, а это займёт немало времени, к этому мы ещё вернёмся.  Управление в игре просто инвалидское, гг дико медленный и неповоротливый, и боёвка от этого сильно страдает, потому что у врагов с перемещением всё отлично, многие двигаются по ломаным траекториям и намного быстрее персонажа игрока. Радует и система прицеливания - по диагонали стрелять можно только стоя на месте, что, конечно же, очень удобно в условиях, когда вам надо кайтить двух-трёх противников, носящихся из одного угла экрана в другой. Оригинальный метроид, игра 30-летней(!!!) давности, играется намного удобнее, и сбалансирован гораздо лучше, хоть там и нет такого разнообразия противников. А ещё тут от старых игр сохранена схема "одно нажатие кнопки - один выстрел". Учитывая, сколько раз вы эту кнопку будете прожимать, очевидно, что стрельба с удержанием кнопки была бы гораздо лучшим решением.  Причём даже если вы тщательно собирали апгрейды, мобы с финальных локаций будут сносить вам всю полоску хп в несколько тычек, спокойно выдерживая десятки попаданий из вашего оружия.  Кстати об оружии, большая часть пушек добавлена просто чтобы было, в игре только пара пушек, которыми реально эффективно можно играть, какие-то вам понадобятся ровно один раз в одном боссфайте.  Боссфайты в игре очень душные, и все состоят ровно в том, чтобы заучить один паттерн перемещения по платформам и повторять его до тошноты, пока у босса не кончится миллиард хп, который ему щедро отсыпал разработчик. Некоторых боссов даже в фан-комьюнити считают ужасными. Особенно мерзкими являются босс-скорпион, которого можно покоцать только определённой пушкой, и который, если вам неудачно зарандомит, может просто оттеснить вас к стенке, где вы просто не успеете от всего отвернуться, босс-оса, спасибо удобной системе прицеливания под углом, и финальный босс, выводящий все минусы боссфайтов в игре на новый уровень.  Диалоги в игре очень кринжовые, с постоянными попытками в мета-шутки, многие реплики ужасно прописаны. Сюжет сам по себе не фонтан, всю игру ты омогаешь инопланетным суперкомпьютерам с ИИ добраться до логова главного злодея, но под конец выясняется, что [spoiler] ты - клон главного злодея, созданный этими суперкомпьютерами, но даже после того, как ты это узнал, ты всё равно должен убить ту версию себя, потому что... Ну... Он плохой, тебе ведь так сказали[/spoiler]  Ещё в игре ужасно непродуманно разложены локации и нет толковой системы быстрого перемещения, только тоннель между тремя(!) локациями, причём между разными предметами, нужными по сюжету, может быть натурально пол-игрового мира, и тебе придётся всё это расстояние протопать, прощупывая каждый угол, чтобы понять, где новый предмет откроет путь дальше. Собственно, большую часть игрового процесса у вас и будет занимать бектрекинг.  Единственное, чем можно игру оправдать, это - то, что её делал один человек, но вот какое дело: незадолго до Axiom Verge я прошёл Hollow Knight, и HK просто на десятки голов выше во всех аспектах, перемещение - удобное, левелдизайн - продуманный, боёвка - увлекательная, боссфайты - изобретательнее, а сложность не кажется искусственной, хотя игру делали только два разраба и композитор. Хотите поиграть в годную метроидванию - поиграйте в Hollow Knight, Ori, или в серию Metroid, если почему-то ещё этого не сделали, это хорошие и продуманные произведения, добившиеся признания без закосов под игры тридцатилетней давности.

Date 2020-05-02 Playtime 11h 20m Rec Positive Stellar Metroidvania, genuinely scary at times and there's very little, if any, jankiness to the controls. Always a challenge and a lot of fun to uncover the secrets of the world.

Date 2020-05-02 Playtime 21h 24m Rec Positive E um jogo legal. Lembra mesmo o Super Metroid do SNES com muitos itens espalhados pelo mapa. Como eu estava jogando sem prestar muita atenção, fiquei perdido por muito tempo mas o jogo conseguiu prender minha atenção depois da metade. Vale a pena. Espera uma promoção pra comprar.
Date 2020-05-01 Playtime 23h 48m Rec Positive Mucho más entretenido de lo que esperaba, 100% recomendado. tiene muchas cosas ocultas
Date 2020-04-29 Playtime 27h 57m Rec Negative Axiom Verge n'arrive pas une seconde à la cheville du hit, sorti 20 ans plus tôt, qu'il espérait singer. Bien que le jeu ne soit pas totalement déplaisant, il peine vraiment à convaincre au regard de la foultitude de jeux du genre qui sont sortis ces dernières années. Tout d'abord, le lvl design est problématique: l'absence d'indications nécessite un nombre d'aller-retours vraiment indigeste pour se débloquer lors d'une première partie. Aucun passage ne présente de réelle difficultés, mais certains sont mal fichus et par conséquent gonflants à traverser (donc cela devient vite un calvaire de se les taper 50 fois lorsque l'on tourne en rond). On notera au passage l'absence d'inspiration lorsqu'il s'agit de remplir 3 salles consécutives avec des uniques et mêmes monstres. Le scénario n'a aucun intérêt. La traduction française est tellement catastrophique qu'on recommandera quand même aux anglophobes d'opter pour la langue de Shakespeare. Mais même ainsi, la narration est soporifique et malheureusement aucune option n'est proposée pour passer les dialogues. Les boss ne présentent aucun intérêt: leurs patterns sont ultra simplistes. Ce sont juste des sacs à PV face auxquels il convient juste de s'armer de patience pour en venir à bout. Alors il y a quand même quelques bonnes idées: le nombre d'armes conséquent, l'originalité du gameplay axé autour du disrupteur et certaines compositions musicales assez accrocheuses.  Mais si on fait l'addition, au final ce n'est vraiment pas folichon. 
Date 2020-04-28 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive So good. Perfect clone of metroid. Could be even better than metroid. I love it. Atmosphere is perfect, soundtrack is brilliant.
Date 2020-04-28 Playtime 30h 59m Rec Positive + Absolutely fantastic visuals. + Great variety of guns with a lot of interesting ideas. + Interesting story and world design. + Lots of diverse biomes, each with their unique enemies. + Lots of different bosses. + Various means of traversing the world. + Love the Address Disruptor.  - Boring soundtrack most of the time. - You will miss most collectibles without using a walkthrough. - Some controls aren´t explained to you at all and you only stumble upon them when googling for them.  - Getting some of the collectibles will quite literally require you to break your fingers trying to pull off some incredibly hard button combination. Looking at you, Bioflux Accelerator 2.  - BOSSES DO NOT HAVE VISUAL HEALTH BARS. Very frustrating because you never really know how close you came to beating the boss. - Most bosses have too much health for my liking.  When you have figured out their movesets, it takes too long to take them down, they are too tanky.  - Many guns are really situational. - Why aren´t all guns automatic or can be continually fired by holding down the button? I hate having to button spam to wiggle down a boss. - Many collectibles are really hard to find because breakable blocks aren´t distinct from the surrounding walls - Alternate ending is hidden behind finding a lot of collectibles. - NO FAST TRAVEL! Why this game doesn´t have some kind of warping between save rooms is something I don´t understand. It leads to a lot of backtracking and endlessly slogging through the same levels.  - Final boss is way too easy.  - The wasp boss is BS, because aiming diagonally doesn´t really work the way it should. During this bossfight, the controls are a bigger enemy than the boss itself.   OVERALL, A GOOD GAME WITH GREAT H.R.GIGER INSPIRED VISUALS AND AN INTERESTING STORY, BUT WITH SOME MAYOR DESIGN FLAWS WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN IRONED OUT DURING THE BETA STAGE.   PART 2 BETTER HAS FAST TRAVEL, BOSS HEALTH BARS AND A LOT MORE COMFORT WHEN LOOKING FOR SECRETS.  
Date 2020-04-27 Playtime 16h 50m Rec Positive Ends on something of a plot cliffhanger, but the overarching conflict is finished so it's a complete story. It just doesn't answer all of the questions it brings up.  Very solid metroidvania.
Date 2020-04-26 Playtime 30h 48m Rec Positive If you're into 'metroidvania' games, be sure to pick this up, it's pretty cool and not too complicated.   If I had to name a point of critique, it would be that the grappling hook control feels clunky.
Date 2020-04-26 Playtime 2h 32m Rec Negative I'm really disappointed in this game. The movement isn't as fluid or maneuverable as Metroid games and weapons seem to have little to no knockback/stun on enemies so the second you shoot at them they just bum rush you and your only option most of the time is to spam them while taking damage. They're are weapons designed to shoot enemies around corners or through walls but there range is limited or there fire rate is so slow that it either wont reach most enemies with out getting closer making them kinda pointless or the fire rate is so slow it become a chore to spam enemies at a distance. The story is interesting but the dialogue is awkward. Lastly while the pixel art is nice it does feel a bit too copy pasted in game.

Date 2020-04-26 Playtime 3h 26m Rec Positive Talk about tuned in and turned on! This game had me erect til the final boss! Unfortunately there WAS the issue of it being a very fun game with a cool artstyle, but my extreme contempt for anything in the way of my GIGABONER allowed me to prevail. Just jack in and jack off and you'll be blowing loads in no time!

Date 2020-04-24 Playtime 9h 21m Rec Positive Es un muy buen metroidvania, con buena historia, me gusto un monton la diegesis surrealista de este juego.
Date 2020-04-23 Playtime 23h 4m Rec Positive Ottimo Platformer alla Metroidvania con storia gore-fi interessante ed estremamente originale. Il gameplay è fluido e dinamico e la mappa facile da capire dopo poco tempo. Le armi sono molto diversificate e consentono varie strategie di gioco. L'attenzione ai dialoghi deve essere costante o si rischia di perdersi importanti indizi per avanzare nel gioco. Il finale è coinvolgente e molto ben realizzato. La trama inizialmente può apparire confusa ma poi va chiarendosi pur rimanendo elaborata e avvincente.
Date 2020-04-23 Playtime 22h 28m Rec Positive Haven't gotten very far into yet, but already hooked! The gameplay and exploration is fun, the environments look beautiful, the controls are tight, and the bosses so far look awesome, to just name a few things I'm liking so far.
Date 2020-04-23 Playtime 33h 27m Rec Positive Good. I did the hard option on my first run through and it got quite tough at the end. I used a 360 pad and I didn't gel with the dash much, in the moments  i really needed it like in boss battles it just felt clunky and annoying, luckily its more useful for exploration.
Date 2020-04-22 Playtime 15h 44m Rec Positive Very solid metroidvania with cute aesthetics and rigid gunplay.  Sometimes the mechanics aren't explained well enough and the player is left wandering around. I kinda liked it, since it let me figure things on my own though at times I had the tools to progress, but did not realize I could use them in certain way to do it.  Boss fights... sigh. My biggest gripe. First and second are great and promises much, but after that they can be either cheesed or "brute forced" by sitting in one spot and just shooting. The bullet patterns don't seem intuitive and rewarding to dodge. Oh well, still worth the money.
Date 2020-04-22 Playtime 9h 22m Rec Positive If you like metroid you will like this.   If you don't like exploration and getting lost occasionally you will not like this.
Date 2020-04-22 Playtime 59h 0m Rec Positive revive la experiencia de Super Metroid en este juego
Date 2020-04-21 Playtime 12h 46m Rec Positive I still have yet to finish this game, but it's a really solid Metroidvania and I'd easily recommend it if you're craving for another Metroid-like experience.
Date 2020-04-20 Playtime 23h 21m Rec Positive 9/10
Date 2020-04-20 Playtime 30h 45m Rec Positive Excelent game. As a stand alone game, not only as a Metroid homage. The gameplay is smooth, the controls are slick, the sense of progression is HUGE, there are obscure secrets everywhere. You will get lost, you will get stuck. But that's intentional. Let me just tell you, if you come to a part that you can't get over because you couldnt get that jump _just_ right; it's intentional. The jump isn't supposed to work, just go on and find the next upgrade and don't get demotivated.  The game has a beautiful way of teaching you it's mechanics without blatantly highlighting the button prompts or places you can use your ablilities. You are encouraged to test things out, explore and find neat secrets.  The story _is_ pretty lackluster that's correct but you have to remember this isn't the focus of the game, just like in Super Metroid it's bare bones by design, so that you can piece your own head cannon together from obscure ancient texts and enviromental clues, if you want to that is.  If you still aren't convinced, watch a let's play, the gameplay speeks for itself.  In short: It's a MESTAPIECE BABYYYYYYYYYYY 
Date 2020-04-19 Playtime 13h 37m Rec Positive An outstanding addition to the frankly quite bloated Metroid genre. It's not without its flaws, but I would still wholeheartedly recommend it.
Date 2020-04-19 Playtime 3h 15m Rec Negative I couldn't get into it. It's a beautiful game, but it just doesn't feel comfortable to play. SM was released so long ago and it plays so much better. Too bad, there were good ideas in it!
Date 2020-04-18 Playtime 1h 31m Rec Negative I love Metroidvania games and Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion, etc. but Axiom Verge is like all the bad parts of the original NES Metroid (bland colors, boring level design, endless back-tracking, no fast travel, getting lost constantly) without enough  good stuff to balance it out. I'd much rather put the money into either of the Ori games (the newest of which features level design by Milton Guasti, creator of AM2R).
Date 2020-04-18 Playtime 17h 19m Rec Negative yep, i am sorry i bought it, the game's plot sucks almost as hard as AI of enemies or grind of few bosses which cannot be cheesed by jumping behind them. I really liked the soundtrack
Date 2020-04-17 Playtime 16h 10m Rec Positive Excellent game. I had been wanting this game for awhile and never got around to playing it until now, and upon completion I can say I was not let down. The game is aesthetically pleasing, has a great story, great soundtrack, and has a relatively long playtime.   The best part however, is how the game rewards you for progressing by finding new weapons and abilities that can help you advance through the game. Finding and unlocking secret areas for new weapons, power-ups, and journals makes the game even more enjoyable. I enjoyed the game immensely. Not to mention, I never write steam reviews, but upon completing this game I felt like I had to give it a positive review from how much I enjoyed it.   There is a lot of backtracking in this game which can lead many people to feel frustrated, and I see how they feel that way, but for me I never had an issue with it. I've heard people complain about how hard the secret rooms are to find, and I can agree to some extent, but I found plenty of rooms by using the hints in the layout of the game, and when you get used to this finding secret rooms can become easier to do. I would also like to add that there is a specific area where you will most likely get stuck. It will require you to google the solution which I had to do, but other than that I've never gotten too stuck in this game. I would advise the developer to fix this issue as it has led many to quit the game entirely. However, if you overcome this issue then the game gets better from there.   In the end, Axiom Verge is a great game and I definitely recommend it, and the fact that it was mainly made by one developer amazes me. At full price I'd give it an 8/10, but since I got it on sale I'd give it a 9/10. The backtracking can be annoying to some, and there is still a place where most player get stuck that hasn't been fixed yet, but other than that I had a lot of fun playing it and definitely recommend.
Date 2020-04-16 Playtime 127h 10m Rec Positive By far one of the greatest indie games on the market. On the surface it looks familiar, you draw parallels to elder games, but as you dig through the core of Sudra you begin to realize just how wildly imaginative Thomas Happ designed this world to be. From the Title Screen, the music sucks you right in and is handled with such finesse that you'll most likely miss the rhythmic match of the musics down beat to your beating health meter if you didn't know to look for it! Not to be undersold, the upgrades you'll likely, maybe, discover are some of the most unique you'll ever use - Thomas puts your Metroid hidden-secrets-searching to the test! As we iterate over and over again in the community, this is Thomas' love letter to Super Metroid and metroidvanias alike.
Date 2020-04-16 Playtime 8h 50m Rec Positive Metroid is a boy in this game.
Date 2020-04-15 Playtime 24h 42m Rec Positive Superb in every way. The level of care and love put into this project drips from every corner of the game.  The story is great, the environments and music blend magnificently, and it never feels like it's too much or dragging on. Anyone who's a fan of old Metroid games, Xeodrifter or any Castlevania on the DS will love this game.  The bosses are fun and make you think without feeling like you're being punished for trying, and the exploration is astounding. Everywhere you go there's something to find to enrich your arsenal or your understanding of the story.  A lot of the weapons are unnecessary though, and many I hardly found a use for. They're all great ideas but the scope of the game's mechanics are diminished somewhat when you have no reason to use 60% of them. However, most of them allow different strategies for making bosses easier if you know how to use them.  The dark, gritty and Gigeresque atmosphere of the game really brings home the theme of the game. Every song brings a unique feeling to each area, and it's all high quality synth/techno with an 80's bent. Some areas are serene, others look like nightmares. It's all beautiful with the best 8-bit graphics.  I await the sequel.
Date 2020-04-15 Playtime 14h 16m Rec Positive Ich war auf der Suche nach einem guten Metroidvania und bin durch mehrere Reviews auf dieses gestoßen, es ist ganz klar bei welchem Vertreter sich die Entwickler hier inspiriert haben und trotzdem ist es ein eigenes Ding und es macht seine Sache in so ziemlich allem sehr gut! Gute Bosskämpfe, gutes ArtDesign, gutes Leveldesign. Klare Empfehlung!
Date 2020-04-15 Playtime 32h 18m Rec Positive La verdad es que hacia tiempo que no me encontraba con un juego que me mantuviera pegado de la manera que lo ha hecho este juego. Tiene un estilo visual muy acertado, recuerda bastante al Metroid pero a la vez es una experiencia nueva, tiene variedad de entornos y la musica acompaña en todo momento, esta excelentemente hecha y puesta en cada nivel, hay niveles que piensas "Dios, es que es justo la mñusica que tiene que tener!". Para el precio que tiene y las horas que me ha dado, 16h, esta mas que justificado su precio si eres de esos que te gusta explorar y revisar para conseguir cada item. Es un juego a la antigua usanza en donde tenias no solo que avanzar, sino recordar lugares y sitios en el mapa para luego volver y recuperar algo que en un momento no puedes pero a medida que avanza la historia y mejora tu PJ si que puedes, en esto facilita la labor al poder poner hasta dos marcadores facilmente en cada nivel. El único juegi que me ha tenida tan enganchado casi como este ha sido el Dead Cells pero a nivel de experiencia, me quedaría con este, este me ha hecho recordar a los juegos de cuando era mas pequeño en mi NES pero con gráficos mejores. Es un MUST-PLAY.
Date 2020-04-15 Playtime 15h 24m Rec Positive Excellent game, if u like Metroid this is a good tribute
Date 2020-04-15 Playtime 9h 12m Rec Negative This game is bad. If you are thirsting for classic metroid gameplay, just go play metroid. This game has so many flaws, and nothing to redeam it. The story is weak at best, I wont spoil it, but none of it relates to your environment, none of the basic enemies or environments have any meaning or connection to the plot other than "you've got to save the world." the few NPC's that you interact with have no real connection to the world as a whole, the plot feels shoehorned in, as if the levels were finalized before anybody started writing the story. The bosses are part of the plot but they don't do anything to build upon it. The twists are dumb and confusing, and all of the plot is given via exposition drops that take 5 min at a time of boring dialogue, and are separated by sections of frustrating and repetitive gameplay. The metroid style progression system also leaves me disappointed. Each of your upgrades don't really make it more fluid or satisfying to traverse the world, if anything, the tools you are given feel slugish and clunky, and only exist to get you to the next area, or find one of the few secrets in the game worth getting. Speaking of which, secret! These blocks of text, that are for the most part of the game, written in some weird alien speech, are hidden behind secret walls or impassible barriers that require unlocks locked behind (in some cases) four hours of gameplay, feel frustrating and un-intuitive. I would be ok with backtracking through areas that I have cleared to get secrets, but there is no real reason to, all of the damage, health, and utility is given to you by force after a boss fight, or just sitting in your path. None of the environment or enemies change upon revisiting an area (another example of the world not being connected to ANYTHING you do in it), and all the stuff that you do to alter the world via your drill, or glitchy gun thing are reverted every time you save, or leave the area. Making all the shortcuts you found arduous to backtrack through. Ok, one last complaint then I am done, and it has to do with the game's difficulty. There are games that are challenging, like hollow knight, games that are hard, like dark souls; these games are fun, because they are fair. Then there are games that aren't hard, but want to be, like Axiom Verge. Don't mistake this as the game being easy, let me explain. In my nine hours of playtime, I died to bosses once, because they are easy. I died countless times to random enemies scattered around the map because they are placed in spots designed to get cheap, unavoidable hits in order to kill you, and lengthen the games play time. Enemies will pop out of the floor without warning and take half your health bar, or hit you with invisible lagging hit boxes, or just be blatantly placed in spots that you can't get past without damage boosting into them. This kind of gameplay is frustrating and not fun in the slightest. In conclusion, this game is not worth playing, and I have no idea how it has such high ratings on steam given the glaring issues I have encountered. Do not buy this game. It is not fun.
Date 2020-04-15 Playtime 17h 28m Rec Positive Si te gustan los juegos estilo Metroid, compra obligada.
Date 2020-04-14 Playtime 14h 29m Rec Positive it's a lot shootier than i was expecting. and the story only really gets started like 60% of the way in (or maybe i only became involved with it around that point, but this genre isn't known for engaging stories to begin with) it has difficulty levels, but death isn't terribly punishing -- you don't lose any powerups you picked up or map exploration once you have seven different guns, you start to figure which gun works best against what (i didn't even find half of them, there are like thirty) honestly i most appreciated that while it looked like a metroidvania, it didn't play like one -- like i was expecting a morph ball or a double jump and never got 'em, but found other ways to achieve roughly the same things  and while as forementioned i don't think the story gets going until over halfway in, the story is very enthralling
Date 2020-04-14 Playtime 28h 58m Rec Positive Axiom Verge throws you into the deep end of what it feels like to be lost, the feeling you want to find in a good Metroidvania style game, which pertains to the same feeling when you first start up (Super) Metroid  It has a slightly linear feel to the game, but that only comes to you after a few playthroughs  The weapons are unique and fun, but all of them aren't needed to finish the game  The achievements are very possible if you put a little bit of time into them  This game is for fans of the early (Super) Metroid games!
Date 2020-04-14 Playtime 17h 14m Rec Positive Игра крайне интересная, сюжет по началу кажется непонятным и абсолютно несвязным ,и вообще бредятиной, однако после непродолжительной игры на события начинают проливать свет, после чего внимание игрока фиксируется к происходящим событиям.Также классная физика, механика и общая задумка и композиция игры не заставит скучать.Если вы вдруг подумали что это какой то платформер, который вы за час осилите, то нет, это далеко не так, и залипнуть в игре есть на что, в основном благодаря разнообразным секретам и большой карте.Вообщем игра крутая, так что если вдруг вы попали на скидочки ,то обязательно берите, конечно, если вы не ненавистник такого рода игр :)

Date 2020-04-13 Playtime 18h 9m Rec Positive If you're a fan of 2-D Metroid games, do yourself a favor and grab this one. It does a really good job of blending the classic metroid formula with some interesting new gameplay mechanics that don't seem out of place. And the atmosphere is great; it has a very 80s/90s Aliens/HR Giger feel to it
Date 2020-04-13 Playtime 31h 25m Rec Positive I got this on sale thinking it was going to be a nice throw-away game to pass a couple hours by. Boy, was I ever so wrong. This game, this masterpiece, is so much fun to play over and over and over again. It has the typical platforming ques, ticks all the metroidvania boxes of finding items to progress further, and an very riveting and interesting story.   like many of these pixelated side-scrollers, the platforming and puzzle solving gets increasingly difficult as the game progresses, that is a given. the delivery of the difficulty curve is gradual and the changers are pretty intuitive without being thrown in your face and there is a TON of backtrack-ability and secret hunting, though it isn't really necessary to complete the story mode.  There aren't many characters in the story but there is a great amount of lore and history ingrained in the story mode. There are secrets to uncover, side characters that help you along the way, and even a full blown written language you can actually decipher to read some of the collectible lore.  I cannot recommend this game enough, it's much longer and much much more well thought out and better executed than most metroidvania games on steam and I'm super glad I bought it.
Date 2020-04-13 Playtime 7h 5m Rec Positive game good
Date 2020-04-12 Playtime 11h 50m Rec Positive very good game. love it.
Date 2020-04-12 Playtime 12h 22m Rec Negative Playing on Normal difficulty for a first run, and really trying to find stuff to like about it. I just can't. The list of weapons is way too large, and aside from a couple of standouts (Kilver and Voranj), most feel basically useless instead of being an up- or sidegrade. The novelty of the lab coat, drone, and glitching enemies and the environment are cool, but that's not nearly enough to carry the whole experience.  It's way too linear for a game trying so hard to be Metroid. The bosses are punishingly difficult purely for the sake of being difficult, with bullet hell used in place of good encounter design. Most bosses do have a trick to them that makes the fight easier, but this ranges from marginally helpful to feeling like an unintended exploit that totally defangs any threat the boss would otherwise present (Telal and Uruku in particular). Enemy damage is way too high for the Metroid comparison as well, particularly in the early areas before you start finding health upgrades.  This is the one thing Axiom Verge successfully replicates from the bygone era it's trying to be: the demands of flawless execution. However, this serves only to create a sort of mindless busy work that's a test of one's tolerance for such archaic quarter-milking arcade design far more than any test of real skill. The "git gud, scrub" crowd will likely scoff at that last bit, but even Dark Souls isn't as punishingly hard as its reputation would imply. What Dark Souls has that Axiom Verge absolutely lacks is twofold.  First is an actual difficulty progression. None of the boss mechanics are tricky to understand, and they pretty much follow set patterns. This doesn't work in the game's favor, though, and instead of dreading maybe a couple of fights (Capra Demon, Four Kings), Axiom Verge leaves one dreading every single boss fight, knowing it's going to be nothing more than a time sink of a grind, with absolutely no other progress to be made until you clear it.  Second, while Dark Souls will often reward inventive gameplay, with multiple ways of clearing most encounters, including the bosses, and both it and Metroid sport a progressively opening map with ways to break the typical sequence of progression, this is not the case in Axiom Verge. Bosses have one viable standard strategy, and even though each typically has an exploit strategy as well, this winds up feeling cheap and unfulfilling rather than rewarding clever play. Exploration upgrades allow you to go to only specific areas. Combinations or alternate uses that would be built-in and discoverable in similar games, or can be replicated (such as Super Metroid's Spring Ball vs Bomb Jump), are explicitly separated here.  In short, Axiom Verge is a visually nice game that has a couple of interesting ideas, but ultimately tries so desperately to be a nostalgic retro title that it winds up bringing some of the worst aspects of a previous gaming era forward instead.
Date 2020-04-12 Playtime 8h 58m Rec Negative A metroid clone made by people who don't understand what made metroid great. The boss fights are just massive health sponges where you stand on a spot and spam a certain weapon for 10 minutes. The exploration is just garbage with most mobs also being health sponges and killing you in two hits and forcing you to wait a stupid amount of time to get back, with sparse save points, because fuck you. The mechanics are boring as well. What a waste.  The controls are also unresponsive, this game doesn't work on a keyboard, since you are unable to aim and jump in the left direction (bravo, developers).   Absolutely terrible game.
Date 2020-04-12 Playtime 11h 37m Rec Positive One of the most solid metroidvanias out there, cool music and cool story
Date 2020-04-12 Playtime 23h 48m Rec Positive é bom sim
Date 2020-04-12 Playtime 11h 35m Rec Positive Good metroidvenia, would recommend
Date 2020-04-11 Playtime 11h 26m Rec Positive [b]-Personal Opinion, take with a grain of salt-[/b] Overall love this game. It's a bit short, you can expect about 10-12 hrs if you're not speedrunning it and trying to explore as much as possible, but it's a ton of fun. It's a Metroidvania that leans much more on the Metroid side. [b]Pros:[/b] -Good story and storytelling, with parts of the plot hidden as collectables -Excellent sense of progression and the necessary backtracking does not feel tedious (YMVM, I actually enjoy backtracking to find things I couldn't get before) -Fun combat if you like the Contra style controls, with lots of different weapons -Great soundtrack -Creative upgrades, doesn't feel like it borrows too much from the games that inspired it -The art is fantastic, I really liked most of the character designs and environments [b]Cons:[/b] -As with the old Metroid games, there are hidden passages and collectables that will sometimes just look like an ordinary block. If you don't like smashing your face against every wall, then you might not enjoy that aspect.  -While the variety of weapons is fantastic, you do get a lot of them and sometimes in quick succession. Doesn't necessarily leave much room for each weapon to shine. You'll probably end up taking a liking to a select few of them and ignoring the rest. On the plus side, this does leave room for many different styles and preferences. -The controls are usually pretty tight, but there's one movement upgrade (won't spoil it) that relies on double tapping a direction. It can feel a bit clunky and non-responsive when you're trying to combine it with just moving regularly.
Date 2020-04-11 Playtime 10h 26m Rec Positive The most Metroid-like of all the Metroidvanias that I've played.

Date 2020-04-10 Playtime 15h 9m Rec Positive good metroidvania game. held my attention to the end
Date 2020-04-10 Playtime 15h 32m Rec Positive I don't write reviews often but given the thing that shall not be named and the lockdown, I have time on my side at the moment.  I'd missed this game somehow and only just had it recommended to me a few days back. I was never a massive Metroid fan so was a bit unsure about it at first but all doubts were quickly cast aside after diving in.  I can honestly say Axiom Verge had me hooked from the start and I completed it in 3 sittings for a total of 15 hours playtime. What a great distraction it proved to be!  The only gripes I have are mostly down to becoming less patient as I get older:  - The grapple mechanism drove me nuts for a while - There was one stage quite early on where I just felt a bit too lost.  - Some of the secrets are a bit too well hidden and I only found them by mistake - I seem to be able to miss every single platform on the way down when I fall because I'm a clumsy oaf. :)  What an amazing achievement for the one-man-band developer. The story could have been a little more fleshed out but was interesting overall. The soundtrack is amazing and adds to the atmosphere immensely. The controls are responsive and do what you want them to the large majority of the time, with the odd exception of accidentally pressing the left stick down or triggering dash.  Bravo to Thomas Happ - you are a legend and I can't wait for the sequel!
Date 2020-04-10 Playtime 8h 6m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania style game.  I am a huge fan of the old Metroid side scrolling games. For years I have wanted a game like that on the pc. The control is fluid, and responds very well. The game is challenging, and the boss fights epic. Great pixel work, not a very broad pallete, but that felt right. Music was fun and decidedly 80's creep synth "stranger things" vibes. Most of the extra gun types were...not useless, but not useful enough to bother with. Any fan of Samus should play this, no questions asked.
Date 2020-04-09 Playtime 12h 58m Rec Positive By the numbers metroidvania, but its got its own thing going. Nice style, mostly good upgrades that compliment each other. Very good soundtrack. The music is used to deepen the imersion and it works quite well, while it has quite a unique, beat driven alien sound. Only thing that is really bugs me about this game is that the bosses all beaten by repeating the same pattern over and over again. They are also designed very similar to one another. I think this is about the only metroidvania type game I enjoyed, where in I feel dissapointed when running into a boss. They feel like a grind, keeping you away from the actual game, rather then a highlight of the action, as a boss should be. Might as well have cut them out, its really that bad. But it is not a deal breaker as the rest of the game absolutely makes up for it. Fans of the 2d metroid games like myself are guaranteed to enjoy this.
Date 2020-04-09 Playtime 9h 44m Rec Positive This was at least the third time I've tried to play Axiom Verge and the first time I got far enough to enjoy it; the first hour or so of the game is not fun. And that's actually pretty interesting in hindsight, because the entire rest of the game is extremely good. So what goes wrong at the beginning that made me stop playing twice? All I can think of is that in most metroid-like games, you start out with either a subset of your final gear and then lose it after some introductory sequence, or you start with nothing to one thing and then quickly gain better gear. In Axiom Verge, you are dropped into the game in a difficult section with a default weapon and no movement upgrades, although all around you right away you can see where you might be able to reach later, reminding you of your limitations. And you don't get any movement upgrades until the third area. So the beginning is largely a run and gun. According to the game's global achievements, a huge percentage of people didn't have any trouble with this and powered through, but it was a sticking point for me; if I'm expected to platform then I want the ability to do so at the start, at least to some degree. The starting player package was too basic for me.   I will also say that the story's introduction is also not good, which is another oddity as by the end of the game I liked the story quite a bit. But to start you're basically a scientist in a lab explosion and you're dropped into this place and given a gun unceremoniously. Finding out the rest of the story is actually great but you aren't given much of it until the back half, so for a while I just thought "I guess this ordinary lab scientist is totally stoked that he can jump 30 feet in the air now and shoot robots with these cool guns".   Then at some point an hour to two hours in (beat it on normal with all items in 9 hours) you start getting unlockables and the world opens up and... holy crap the game is great now. Lots to find and explore and it's fun. I just wish it started out with a slightly better moveset, and with more hints at what's going on behind the scenes. I'm not totally sure how some of the unlockable items can be found natively without using a guide as even with some codebreaking ability I couldn't find where you were supposed to see the puzzles at all. I did really enjoy the boss fights throughout, figuring out what worked and what didn't, and the game was fairly generous with save rooms so long as I looked around for them. I experienced two full game crashes, but at most only lost 15 minutes when I was item hunting (and forgot to hit save rooms).
Date 2020-04-08 Playtime 13h 24m Rec Positive Se si pensa che questo gioco è stato sviluppato da una sola persona, beh.. applausi a scena aperta.  Lo stile è meraviglioso, la storia è un pò così ma vabbè, molti nemici, moltissime armi, tantissime aree segrete da scoprire (alcune sinceramente senza una guida non le avrei mai trovate)  E' uscito da un pò di tempo, perciò lo si trova a basso costo e ne vale decisamente la pena se avete una passione per i metroidvania.
Date 2020-04-07 Playtime 15h 29m Rec Positive Great metroidvania, only weak part is the second half. Game gets bogged down hard in backtracking and the final area lacks incentive to explore because the enemies are insanely strong. However, despite that the game get a recommendation from me, still a solid game.
Date 2020-04-07 Playtime 8h 12m Rec Positive Metroid-Vania Goodness!
Date 2020-04-07 Playtime 14h 38m Rec Positive The graphic design and music are so great, is worth to play. I think is a very good game.  I won't talk those good things everyone have spoken, I think the gameplay experience can be more related on the story, is kind of wasted a good plot. I was expecting more illusion, clone staffs. The map should or might can show more the planet culture, the living style, ecosystem, ruin and temple for example,
Date 2020-04-07 Playtime 21h 12m Rec Positive The combat is ass but the atmosphere is 10/10 and the story is my favourite kind of story, fuckall!
Date 2020-04-07 Playtime 16h 18m Rec Positive I really liked this gameб great gameplay, interesting story wich you learns from from scraps of diaries. Visuals and sounds is great. Also soundtracks is great especially if you love old school chiptune music! Waiting for Axiom Verge 2!

Date 2020-04-06 Playtime 11h 5m Rec Positive I CAN GO THROUGH SOLID MATTER! NOTHING STOPS ME! IN A MINUTE, I WILL CROSS THE HOLY MOUNTAIN. WAIT FOR ME HERE. ...I GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN IN LESS THAN A MINUTE! ...No, I can only advance HORIZONTALLY! And that's ENOUGH! From bottom to top, I can't do. But anyway... I AM A CHAMPION! I HAVE CONQUERED ZE HOLY MOUNTAIN! HORIZONTALLY! HORIZONTALLY! I AM A CHAMPION!
Date 2020-04-06 Playtime 21h 7m Rec Positive This game takes me back to playing Metroid: Zero Mission and Metroid: Fusion on the GameBoy Advance when I was a kid, and also back a few years ago when I played AM2R. It captures the "lockpicking" fun of slowly working your way through a maze of corridors, and the theming of each world (as well as the soundtrack) makes this game, in my opinion, a superior experience to even the old sidescroller Metroids. It's not sacrilegious to say so, as this game owes its entire identity to those games and in most ways surpasses them, especially in terms of the smoothness of gameplay. The only mechanical hiccup is switching weapons with the right analog stick -- it's very intuitive, and it's a good way of doing it, but it has never really "clicked" for me. Other than that, jumping, swinging, shooting, dodging, ducking, blasting, and even controlling an adorable flea drone are all seamless.  One thing that I think could use improvement, however, is the storytelling. Their art designer clearly built these gorgeous, grotesque biomechanical machines, enemies, and landscapes (the bosses are a particular highlight) that give off an impression of a completely alien world unlike our own, with its own organic ecosystems. Then the main character is a scientist who is in no small part responsible for his own circumstances and for the desolation around him. And yet the actual presentation of the story, and the words that come out of the characters mouths, feel much more juvenile and much less mature than the stories of the Metroid games, which for the most part actually capitalised on that same sense of alienation without overdoing it. Even Metroid: Fusion, in my opinion, managed the presentation of its story better, and it was highly criticised for the intrusion of its story elements. Axiom Verge feels like H.R. Giger illustrated Eragon -- no amount of gorgeous set dressing can truly overcome an amateurishly-told story.  I highly recommend the game. I also highly recommend ignoring the story entirely and instead using the environments and impressions you get from the game world to come to your own conclusions about what the world means. It's seriously incredible to look at and feels brilliant to play.
Date 2020-04-05 Playtime 1h 3m Rec Positive excelente.

Date 2020-04-04 Playtime 10h 45m Rec Positive Good game!
Date 2020-04-04 Playtime 18h 1m Rec Positive A strange, sci-fi Metroidvania where you're a scientist transported to another world and trying to determine what has happened to him and make his way home. Lots of different weapons and abilities, some pretty unique to the game, fantastic music, and fun gameplay. I think it's worth noting that I don't generally like Metroidvanias, and I loved it.
Date 2020-04-03 Playtime 12h 35m Rec Negative Gameplay is slow and a little tedious
Date 2020-04-03 Playtime 10h 37m Rec Positive Is good.
Date 2020-04-03 Playtime 4h 5m Rec Negative 没汉化不怪你们，但地图有些地方能进不能出就没法说了；boss都是出肉装的阿喀琉斯，不打要害不掉血，掉血也是掉一点。这种设计其实非常糟糕，这意味着要用挑战耐心级的死亡次数去攻略boss，而且很容易卡关，直接将游戏体验清空。写这篇测评时我已经因为打不过boss卡关放弃过一次，中间停了一个月才重新拾起来，还是通过修改器解决的boss，然而又被地图卡着了——因为没有跨地区的快捷传送，地图没有彻底探索全就进入了下一个区域（个人感觉即便探索全了也会卡着），现在被困在某个区域里进退不得——没有多段跳，没有冲刺，没有闪避，没有跨区域传送，回血靠存档点和小怪，有些区域背景和地板完全分不清，个人评分5/10不及格
Date 2020-04-01 Playtime 21h 14m Rec Positive Thomas Happ i salute you.

Date 2020-04-01 Playtime 7h 47m Rec Negative Lost my job because of this game before even playing it  0/10 Would not recommend losing job
Date 2020-03-31 Playtime 17h 19m Rec Positive This is one of the best Metroidvania games I've ever played. It has a great game mechanic and the world is interesting to traverse. Ii has plenty of lore if that is what you're into. The amount of weapons is almost overwhelming, although many of those are novelty weapons which has little practical use.  For better or worse, many of the secrets and hidden rooms/items are very obscure. It could be off-putting for some to not be able to 100% the game (without a guide) because you'd have to find a hidden note which has to be translated through a password (which you find in another hidden note) in order to open up a vaguely detailed location. Others will of course love spending hours figuring this out.  My biggest gripe about this game is how you easily dash by accident. I used a D-pad while playing, but I've heard people using a joystick have the same problem. I wish the dashing could be mapped to another button, but a standard controller has all the buttons used for some other purpose.  Overall, great game, I enjoyed it immensely, and I recommend it to any one finding entertainment from a good ol' Metroidvania.
Date 2020-03-30 Playtime 28h 43m Rec Positive awesome game ! addictive. metroid-like. havnt completed it yet after 19 hours xD music ambience OP... i bet the characters in ReBoot 90s cartoon  were listening to this game's soundtrack in their micro nanotechnological ipods inside their polyfgonal clothes.
Date 2020-03-30 Playtime 18h 43m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a straight up Metroidvania game.  You move around a 2d map of oldschool, blocky graphics, collect weapons and powerups, and shoot stuff.  I beat it in a little over 15 hours using a controller, and that was taking my time and backtracking like an OCD maniac.    The game stands up in tight gameplay and variety in enemies and weapons.  The plot was really interesting and the different levels were unique.  I dug the giant lady android, the droid abilities were great, and I had fun finding stuff.  The music also did a good job sucking me into the universe.    Where the game falls is in how cryptic everything is, sometimes to the point of being downright mean.  I've played difficult games before, but the secret worlds were a huge sore spot.  Randomly generated per game in diff areas that have 9 ways to enter, and you have to play them to get 3 randomly generated weapons - which from what I understand you only get one per play through?  In order to get all the badges, that's beyond painful.  I want to replay the game to enjoy it, not scour the same dungeon walls for 45 hours or hug online guide maps to see which small obscure block I can phase through or drill or drone to maybe get the one weapon I need to complete the collection.  That got old really fast.   Then there's the whole 'getting the notes' and passwords deal.  I LOVE that you had to uncover passwords and decipher alien languages.  I wish there was more of an explanation of how to use the passwords without bumbling around it.  I wish incorrect passwords weren't also lit up like they were solved.  I figured out a password and unlocked an area without realizing I did so.  I also hated one specific riddle note that you have to do a 'one time' maneuver to find, which I think hints at a level that was never made?  And while some notes really added to the background of the story, others seemed...  Tangential?  I had no idea what unknown story line the developers were trying to tell me with some of them, or why I should care.     So yeah, if you like Metroidvania games, this is a Metroidvania game with aliens and demons aplenty.  There are tons of weapons that go boom.  Powerups are to be had.  There are bosses.  The story's interesting.  However the heavy amounts of backtracking and inane random choice hidden areas are too malevolent on a development standpoint and can make an otherwise enjoyable experience as fun as tooth pulling when it comes to being an achievement hunter.  I'll replay this game, might even try the speed run in the future.  There are fond memories to be had.  But finding everything the game has to offer is one big chore.  In my opinion, the game would be better without the secret levels.
Date 2020-03-30 Playtime 9h 41m Rec Positive Everything in this game is frickin' rad.
Date 2020-03-29 Playtime 12h 27m Rec Positive GUD  GAME
Date 2020-03-29 Playtime 26h 37m Rec Positive Excellent atmosphere and game mechanics. Not much replay value unless you're a hardcore completionist.
Date 2020-03-28 Playtime 16h 5m Rec Positive 不错，很棒的作品。值得一玩
Date 2020-03-27 Playtime 2h 28m Rec Negative A Metroid with not so much vania. The game play is: Super Mario platforming + 8-directional aim with "press button to stand still" + weapon switching so awkward the game has to pause while you do it. Yuck!   If you are nostalgic for 80s retro games, this might be for you. Fans of more modern titles (The Messenger, Hollow Knight, Steamworld Dig, Ori & The Blind Forest, etc) should be weary of searching for further similar content here.
Date 2020-03-25 Playtime 14h 0m Rec Positive You already know if you should get it or not.  if you like this kind of game.  i like this kind of game.  i got it.
Date 2020-03-25 Playtime 38h 12m Rec Positive Lots of fun, whether you're a fan of retro gaming or not. Tight controls, interesting platforming puzzles. Overall awesome. The only *nitpick* would be that the story and writing can get pretty self-indulgent. The dialog often jumps up it's own butt and sacrifices pacing and structure to violently pat itself on the back for being so clever.  But this is a minor gripe in the overall game play experience, but it may sometimes be difficult to be invested in the characters.
Date 2020-03-25 Playtime 19h 2m Rec Positive [h1]Another World meets Metroid[/h1]  I took this game right after finishing Samus Returns... and strangely, I didn't find Axiom Verge lacking.  When all is said and done, metroidvania games are all about the atmosphere, and in the atmosphere department AV passes with flying colors, the graphics and excellent music blend like gourmet cuisine for an engrossing experience. The world building and creatures are strange, the gameplay is smooth, the weapons are plenty, and some powerups are a true headache to get, but that only makes it all the more rewarding. Everything meshes just right to give you the full Metroid experience (and if you didn't know Another World, ask your gamer uncle).  As far as metroidvanias go, however, this game is on the "short and sweet" side (less than 20 hours), but don't let that disuade you from trying it, it's really worth it.
Date 2020-03-24 Playtime 21h 28m Rec Positive [h1]ПРЕВОСХОДНАЯ МЕТРОИДВАНИЯ В ЛУЧШИХ ТРАДИЦИЯХ СЕРИИ ИГР METROID[/h1]  [b]Axiom Verge[/b] за авторством Тома Хэппа – одна из тех игр, которые были разработаны всего одним человеком. Достойна ли она занять свое место на почетном пьедестале наряду с такими шедеврами от создателей-одиночек, как [b]Braid[/b] и [b]Undertale[/b]? Давайте это выясним.  ВДОХНОВЛЕННАЯ ЛЕГЕНДОЙ  С первых минут игры ощущается, что Axiom Verge была вдохновлена не чем иным, как самим прародителем жанра метроидвании – серией игр Metroid. Стартовая локация в целом, да и первые несколько комнат в игре буквально отсылают к оригинальной [b]Metroid[/b], далее по мере продвижения по карте также неумолимо чувствуется влияние легендарной [b]Super Metroid[/b]. Атмосфера таинственной враждебной планеты, дух исследований, отсутствие прямых подсказок, куда идти и что делать, – вот те аспекты игры, которые позволяют вновь проникнуться этим непередаваемым ощущением нестареющей классики.  НЕПОВТОРИМОЕ ЗВУЧАНИЕ  Музыкальное сопровождение игры не поддается никакому сравнению и описанию. Многие игровые саундтреки так или иначе можно охарактеризовать словами – например, спокойный, умиротворяющий, вдохновляющий ([b]The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion[/b]); или, наоборот, гнетущий, тревожный, вселяющий чувство таящейся повсюду опасности ([b]Gothic[/b]); а то и вовсе являющий собой динамичный тяжелый рок и хеви-метал ([b]Painkiller[/b], [b]Slain: Back from Hell[/b]). Музыку же в Axiom Verge нельзя вот так однозначно описать: она настолько тесно переплетена с другими составляющими игры (геймплеем, сюжетом и его подачей, ключевыми особенностями механики), что буквально не может быть охарактеризована в отрыве от самой игры, поэтому здесь можно смело говорить о стилистике.  СВЯЗУЮЩАЯ НИТЬ  Стилистика игры подразумевает единство всех ее аспектов, которые в своей совокупности формируют между собой неразрывную связь, позволяющую видеть игру не как набор из разрозненных элементов, а именно как целостную единицу, в которой вычленение одного из этих элементов неизбежно ведет к разрушению всей системы. В каждой хорошей игре, чтобы можно было говорить о ее неповторимом стиле, должен быть некий связующий элемент, объединяющее начало, проходящее красной нитью через всю игру. В мире есть множество качественных метроидваний, но далеко не все из них могут похвастать собственным стилем как раз ввиду отсутствия этого объединяющего начала. Во многом это идет от метроидваний серии Castlevania, таких как [b]Castlevania: Symphony of the Night[/b] и последующих [b]Castlevania: Circle of the Moon[/b], [b]Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance[/b], [b]Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow[/b] и других, где все действие происходило в одном замке, поделенном на зоны, соответствующие реальным типам помещений: библиотека, оранжерея, темница, бальный зал, тронный зал, часовая башня... Да, в каждой из таких зон царила своя атмосфера, но их совокупность не воспринималась как нечто целое, а скорее как множество разрозненных тематических локаций, засунутых в одни большие границы замка. То же можно наблюдать, например, и в [b]Skautfold: Usurper[/b], и в [b]Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight[/b] – игры сами по себе отличные, локации в них разнообразные и аутентичные, но нет между ними единой нити, которая связывала бы их воедино.  Как образец здесь может быть названа [b]Hollow Knight[/b], в которой такой нитью выступает общая тематика игры – насекомые. Да, локации в игре также разнообразны и уникальны, но всех их связывает то, что они представляют собой места обитания разных видов насекомых – пчелы живут в гигантском улье, пауки плетут свои сети в подземных норах, черви обитают в сточных водах, мухи облюбовали разлагающиеся останки… Из-за этого при переходе из одной локации в другую не создается впечатление, что ты попал в другую игру, тем более в Hollow Knight отлично развита идея взаимопроникновения одной локации в другую, когда каждая из них не выступает отдельной независимой «комнатой», а логично, плавно вытекает одна из другой и связана с «соседями» множеством разных путей.  ЦАРСТВО «ГЛЮКОВ»  То же можно сказать и об Axiom Verge, где таким объединяющим началом служат… математика, физика, информатика, программирование. Да, именно эта тема сквозной нитью проходит через все повествование, через весь геймплей, где нам предстоит нарушать привычные законы физики, изменяя реальность вокруг себя, вызывая в ней «глюки», использовать программные команды, ломающие код игры, преодолевать различные сбои системы и самому становиться их причиной. Этот необычный игровой опыт и позволяет говорить об уникальном стиле Axiom Verge.  УХОДЯ ОТ СТАНДАРТОВ  Локации в игре не менее уникальны. В отличие от многих собратьев по жанру, паразитирующих на ставших уже избитыми типах локаций – огненной, водяной, ядовитой, песчаной, техногенной и других, – в Axiom Verge нельзя вот так коротким предложением охарактеризовать ни одну зону, что выступает еще одним из аспектов игры, позволяющих говорить о ее собственной стилистике. Не допускает Axiom Verge и типичную ошибку многих игр, взявших за основу серию игр Castlevania новой школы, где все действие происходит внутри замка, то есть в сугубо замкнутом пространстве, обилии стен, потолков, коридоров и тупиков – настоящем аду для клаустрофобов. Здесь же, как и в Super Metroid, рано или поздно герой из-под земли выбирается на поверхность в виде просторных территорий под открытым небом.  ПОМЕНЯТЬСЯ МЕСТАМИ  Безусловно, самой запоминающейся в Axiom Verge, да и весьма заметной на фоне всей игровой истории в целом, является битва с самим собой. И нет, это не банальное сражение с двойником (доппельгангером), как, например, в Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, [b]Castle In The Darkness[/b] или [b]Taimumari[/b]. Здесь нам предстоит самим выступить в качестве огромного летающего монстра и сразиться с главным героем. Вся эта часть игры с галлюцинациями протагониста дарит ни с чем не сравнимый опыт и построена просто великолепно. А уж какие эмоции переполняют, когда вновь проходишь по тем местам, где ранее видел жуткие лица на стенах, мрачные фигуры, головы чудовищ из самых страшных кошмаров, но ничего этого и в помине здесь нет, когда сознание чистое и ясное, – автор достойно смог в игровом формате передать последствия употребления наркотических веществ, и вряд ли после такого захочешь испытать подобное в реальности.  КАК ХОРОШАЯ КНИГА  Не менее качественно проработан в игре и сюжет. Подается он постепенно, мир и его особенности изучаются вместе с главным героем. Значительная часть лора скрыта в редких страницах дневников, письмах, объявлениях, заметках, спрятанных в закоулках игрового мира. Происходящее вокруг вызывает вопросы как у протагониста, так и у игрока, и однозначные ответы получить в игре очень сложно. Не ясно, кому можно верить, кто прав, а кто виноват. Не раз и не два нас ждут сюжетные повороты, переворачивающие с ног на голову все, что мы знали до этого. И финальное сражение, и концовка игры – все несет на себе отпечаток сомнения: правильно ли мы поступили, был ли у нас выбор и вообще, есть ли в рассказанной истории полноценные зло и добро или каждая сторона конфликта права по-своему? Все это – признаки хорошего сюжета, которому в игре уделено немалое внимание. История, которую продолжаешь осмысливать и переосмысливать и после завершения игры, – вот работа настоящего мастера повествования.  [b]ВЕРДИКТ[/b]: отличная метроидвания, сделанная одним человеком с исключительной любовью к своему детищу. Великолепный саундтрек, глубокий лор игры, интересные и по-настоящему увлекательные механики использования «глюков» системы, превосходное управление, разнообразные способности – образец качественной игры, достойной самых высоких похвал. Тем ярче и эмоциональнее ощущается анонс [b]Axiom Verge 2[/b], которая должна выйти осенью 2020 года, – разве может быть еще лучше? Ждем с нетерпением!  ОЦЕНКА 9/10
Date 2020-03-24 Playtime 25h 55m Rec Positive A very neat Metroidvania type game. The devices you find are all unique and very fun to play with. One of the best things about the game is finding all the secrets hidden around using the various things you have.
Date 2020-03-22 Playtime 6h 14m Rec Negative No puedo recomendar este juego, simplemente no puedo.  Empezando por la música, un juego que no tiene ni siquiera un loop para hacerla inmersiva, aquí se les ocurrió poner un tema y cuando acaba hace un fade out y se queda todo en silencio unos segundos que te sacan de la atmosfera completamente.  En cuanto a la jugabilidad es puro NES pero hablando mal, esta autolimitado (o es que no supieron programarlo), no se siente como un juego bueno de NES.  En cuanto a diseño de juego, si un arma ralentiza la escena, curiosamente ralentiza el menú, dudo que sea intencionado, igual que si hay un efecto de un arma y abres el menú, este también tiene ese efecto.  Por ultimo acabar diciendo que no costaba nada poner un pequeño punto en las salas donde has cogido un objeto como la mayoría de juegos de este genero, porque acordarse de todas las salas es imposible.
Date 2020-03-21 Playtime 32h 50m Rec Positive Enredo fraco mas jogabilidade e cenários extraordinários, tudo de super metroid e muito mais.
Date 2020-03-20 Playtime 11h 27m Rec Positive •ᴗ•
Date 2020-03-19 Playtime 12h 30m Rec Negative Claramente, Axiom Verge está altamente inspirado en el juego Super Metroid para SNES sin embargo los planteos y la ejecución son completamente diferentes a lo que se podría esperar de un juego que mira tan de cerca a su musa.   Para alguien que ha jugado y completado Super Metroid varias veces este juego no se siente como uno malo, sino como uno mal diseñado.   Y no hay mejor forma de plantear esto que con dos ejemplos del mismo.  [olist]  [*] Usualmente un secreto es algo que está oculto a nuestros ojos, por más que sea obvio decirlo, pero cuando ese secreto es necesario o ayuda en lo que es el desarrollo del juego no tiene por qué serlo. Muchos juegos hoy en día por más secretos que tengan usualmente suelen tener algún tipo de indicador para encaminar al jugador a que descubra ese secreto, pero Axiom Verge toma un enfoque que se toma muy literal el termino ya que estos se encuentran usualmente detrás de paredes que parecen ser sólidas, que no tienen ninguna diferencia visual con su alrededor o detrás de paredes que solo pueden ser destruidas por dos herramientas, una la cual obtienes al final del juego. Entonces lo que termina siendo un “secreto” se convierte más en la búsqueda de huevos de pascuas porque lo consigues de dos formas: por simple y pura casualidad o por intentar traspasar/destruir todas las paredes del juego. Y esto es un problema grande, porque no hablamos de mejoras que no ayudan en nada, sino que hablamos de que en estas salas secretas podemos encontrar una gran cantidad de nuevas armas, mejoras de salud, mejoras de daño, mejoras de alcance, nuevas herramientas o mejoras de herramientas y por último notas que ayudan a expandir la historia. Entonces esto no es algo limitado que te abre la puerta al arma más poderosa del juego, sino que solo hace que la experiencia del juego se quede corta en cuanto a contenido y variedad se refiere.  Ahora ustedes pueden pensar “Esto está bien” y podría coincidir con ustedes si no fuera por tres factores:  [list] [*] En Super Metroid también tiene estos secretos en donde podemos encontrar algunas pocas mejoras escondidas, pero este juego te aporta una forma para que tú puedas encontrarlas y es el X-Ray. Esta mejora en el juego nos permitía ver paredes ocultas y las revelaba, de ahí en más dependía del jugador si quería utilizar esa habilidad para encontrar nuevas cosas o no. Aquí en Axiom Verge no encontramos tal cosa, podemos recorrer el mapa de arriba hacia abajo 10 veces intentando traspasar/romper todas las paredes y no lograríamos encontrar ni la mitad de los secretos que el juego tiene para nosotros.  [*] También en Super Metroid podías revelar o romper bloques secretos de múltiples maneras, así sea poniendo una bomba justo donde se encontraba, disparando un super misil o haciendo explotar una bomba que limpiaba toda la pantalla. Aquí solo puedes revelar bloques secretos con la herramienta del taladro dándole al bloque rompible en concreto, no hay otra forma. Pero aquí además se suma el problema del apartado artístico, el cual otra vez, no aporta ninguna diferencia visual para poder apreciar de que el bloque pueda romperse, simple y llanamente el juego nos obliga a taladrar de forma aleatoria, quitando esa sensación de “Ooh, tiene sentido, como no le pensé antes” a una sensación de “¿¡En serio estaba ahí!? 5 minutos taladrando todo para que al final este ahí…”  [*] Otra cosa que podría agregar es que en Super Metroid podemos encontrar “Salas de Mapeo” en donde al interactuar con la máquina que está en el interior de esta se nos revelara el layout de la zona en la que estamos y que incluso nos marcara lugares a los que podremos acceder en un futuro con alguna mejora y que se encuentran detrás de un muro que puede romperse. [/List]  [*] El diseño de nivel y el mapa en si plantean mal sus aristas, nunca sabe darte la información que necesitas y terminaras en muchos casos haciendo backtracking innecesario. Al principio pasas por 2 zonas, todo tranquilo y más o menos lineal, pero llegas a la tercera y cuarta zonas llamadas Zi y Kur respectivamente y te encuentras con que no sabes que hacer realmente.   Todo porque desde Zi ya no puedes volver a las anteriores y tienes que recoger, no 1, ni 2, ni 3, sino 4 objetos para siquiera comenzar a hacer backtracking pero esto no lo sabes y cuando obtienes el primer objeto seguramente te plantees volver porque sabes para que zonas podría ser útil así que intentas regresar para encontrarte con una negativa del juego así que piensas “No hay problema vuelvo cuando tenga el objeto que necesite”.  Encuentras el segundo objeto y dices “Es una buena mejora, seguro que ahora sí puedo volver… Oh… Aun no”. Encuentras el tercer objeto y dices “Bueno, con esto segurísimo” pero tampoco y ya cuando encuentras el cuarto objeto y te enteras de que se trata empiezas a preguntarte el por qué era necesario siquiera.   Todas las áreas del mapa después de conseguir todos los objetos anteriores se conectan mediante una Zona llamada Indi y es una de las formas más desinspiradas que vi en un metroidvania de conectar las zonas entre sí, es simple y llanamente una gran sala horizontal en el medio del mapa con una salida para cada zona.  Luego antes de la zona final vuelve a pasar otra vez lo mismo, una zona a la cual vuelves varias veces tras conseguir varias mejoras porque piensas que ahora si podrás superar el obstáculo que te ponen, pero oh sorpresa, hay otro obstáculo más. [/olist]  Otro problema bastante grave son los jefes y su falta de movilidad. He de admitir que el diseño de ellos está bastante bueno, pero son tan estáticos que he vencido a todos ellos a la primera sin moverme de mi posición, nada más saltando y agachándome en el mismo lugar. Ustedes pueden creerme o no acerca de lo que digo, pero no es nada más que la verdad, totalmente decepcionado de ellos.  En cuanto a los controles no he tenido muchos problemas salvo con el Dash y el Gancho… Ay, el Dash… Usando un stick análogo es imposible perfeccionar el Dash de manera cómoda porque hay que hacer dos movimientos rápidos hacia la dirección deseada, este sale cuando quiere así que para el Dash terminas usando el D-pad o el teclado porque no puedes cambiar la forma de ejecutarlo. El gancho la verdad no entendí cómo funcionaba, sigo sin entenderlo, a veces te balanceabas una vez y saltabas y a veces seguía columpiándose, nunca entendí la razón. También me hubiera gustado que el apuntado se hiciera con el stick derecho y que la selección de armas pasara al D-pad.  Pasando a algo positivo, la historia me gusto bastante, si bien depende de algunas notas para comprenderla del todo está fluye dándote la información necesaria para comprender al menos de manera moderada que sucede a tu alrededor. Pero si hay un aspecto que no me gusto y es que nuestro protagonista no quiere matar, es pacifista por guion, pero más allá de una ocasión el juego no nos da ninguna forma jugable de hacer real su pensar, es una disonancia entre lo que nuestro protagonista piensa y lo que nosotros debemos hacer para avanzar.  Obviando un poco el primer punto, el arsenal de armas es bastante variado, durante el juego no he sentido la necesidad de usar una sola arma, sino que he ido cambiando constantemente según la zona en la que me encontrase.  El apartado artístico me ha gustado, tiene ciertos problemas con los fondos que a veces se confunden como parte jugable pero fuera de eso me pareció bastante bueno.  Por último, cuando obtenemos la mejora del dron para teletransportarnos a él, la movilidad del juego mejora de una forma considerable, la verdad que me pareció una forma muy buena y si pudiera estar desde antes me habría fascinado aún más.  No me ha disgustado el juego, realmente me gusto y espero que la secuela logre corregir los errores que volcaron a que esta reseña sea negativa, un mejor planteo de los niveles y unos jefes un poco más dinámicos ya serían suficientes.  Si estas interesado cómpralo en oferta.
Date 2020-03-19 Playtime 15h 16m Rec Positive This is exactly what a Metroidvania should look like. Wide assortment of environments, enemies, weapons and items with great pixel art and brilliant level design. The plot was better than most AAA titles.
Date 2020-03-19 Playtime 16h 40m Rec Positive I can't believe I missed out on this gem 5 years ago. And soon, there will be a sequel...
Date 2020-03-19 Playtime 19h 54m Rec Positive .
Date 2020-03-17 Playtime 18h 5m Rec Positive Axiom Verge é definitivamente um metroidvania, com ênfase no metroid. Desde sua atmosfera até o processo de aquisição de novas habilidades, o jogo entrega uma experiência absolutamente fantástica para qualquer um que esteja a procura de um bom metroidvania, ou que simplesmente busca por um bom jogo.
Date 2020-03-15 Playtime 13h 45m Rec Positive its a good game
Date 2020-03-14 Playtime 27h 37m Rec Positive Cara como eu gostei desse jogo, principalmente da atmosfera. No começo eu fiquei perdido e acabei não jogando ele por uns bons anos aí. Mas quando eu peguei de novo eu adorei o conceito da história e como ela é contada. O design dos inimigos é muito bom, eu só achei alguns  boss exploitáveis  e encontrei um ou outro bug, mas no fim das contas é um metroidvania bem desafiador e testa sua memória pra lembrar dos pontos do mapa que você tem que voltar. As músicas de cada mapa são bem produzidas, e algumas vão ficar na sua cabeça de tão boas.
Date 2020-03-13 Playtime 22h 45m Rec Positive Axiom Verge es un juego excelente, sin matices, es un juego hecho con el corazón y mucho más, por un solo creador, Thomas Happ, un erudito en muchos temas, según mi opinión.  El juego parece simple pero son muchos temas los que aborda que intentaré resumir: Cuando Axiom Verge salió lo hizo en exclusiva para la PS Vita, por lo que se le apodó el “el Metroid de PS”, y efectivamente es un homenaje a una época de la ciencia ficción y a los video juegos de la época (homenaje a Allien también).  Trace (el protagonista, un personaje con una increíble personalidad, para estar dibujado en forma de pixel; con sentimientos y dilemas), no utiliza una armadura multifuncional, no, va con ropa de calle, alterando las leyes de la física, con su extraña arma, para movilizarse por el mapa dando saltos que desafían la gravedad y atravesando paredes. La física está resumida en dos fuerzas opuestas que nuestro protagonista utilizará para avanzar: La brecha y la grieta: La brecha es la fuerza que hace que las cosas sigan siendo lo que son, que todo se mantenga en su propia forma y la grieta lo que destruye, cambia, altera todas las formas, las hace liquidas y etéreas.  Filosóficamente Axiom Verge le da una vuelta al existencialismo para dejarlo fuera del humanismo. El ser humano es no es más que una criatura arrogante, infinitamente pequeña y cuyos logros más prodigiosos no serían más que chiste para las posibles inteligencias que podrían deambular en el espacio infinito.  A pesar de que Salió en PS Vita primero creo que la mejor forma de jugarlo es con un joystick en una TV o un monitor que te permita disfrutar los detalles.      Si no vas a jugar Axiom Verge, por los argumentos que te doy al menos escucha su BSO, que es de lo mejor que puedes oír mientras trabajas, estudias, lees, viajas, etc. Puro Darkwave electrónico, con unas piezas sublimes.      
Date 2020-03-11 Playtime 10h 43m Rec Positive A great homage and starting point for the world of metroidvanias.
Date 2020-03-10 Playtime 55h 59m Rec Positive Stupidly good game. Do yourself a favor and buy it. On sale, gifted or just at the plain regular price, the game is one of the most replay-able games out there. Not an easy game but probably one that people will look back on as revolutionary for its time. Game-play is tight, bosses are interesting and the atmosphere and music more than make this purchase worth it. Definitely a metroid-vania for the ages.
Date 2020-03-10 Playtime 20h 10m Rec Positive 新时代的银河战士，希望续作也能一样精彩
Date 2020-03-10 Playtime 12h 16m Rec Positive 游戏是个好游戏，非常难得一见的银河战士，注意是银河战士 不过我很想吐槽这个游戏的画面风格......灵感是不是从作者碰到过的FC游戏图形BUG里来的hhhhhh
Date 2020-03-09 Playtime 4h 33m Rec Negative There are parts of Axiom Verge that I am extremely excited about and would love to see more of! + I love the pulsating, geigeresque, organic-feeling architecture. + I love the metroidvania style of exploration that naturally opens up new areas with new abilities. + I love the vaguely sinister leadup to a boss that has just piles and piles of human skeletons. + I love the self-aware first-respawn where the protagonist freaks out that he just died.  There are parts of Axiom Verge I want branded into the dev team's foreheads as a warning to other dev teams. - I hate the first humanoid enemy you encounter; they're stronger than most enemies leading up to them, and the change of pacing and strategy just feels like a middle finger to the player, who is still likely learning the game at the point they're encountered (less than an hour into the game, if you're like me). - I hate the second boss.  I think the design is clever, but...well, let me talk about this more fully.  I admit, I can't get past the second boss.  You have to jump around on a narrow platform and the boss hits really hard--only a couple mistakes, and you have to start over.  I tried again and again, and it was taking long enough, I thought I must be doing something wrong, so I looked up a YouTube video.  The player in the video was doing exactly what I was doing, and the video was almost 8 minutes long.  Not only that, but the shot patterns become much more complicated and harder to avoid.  You have to endure that for eight solid minutes perfectly.  Hey, a couple minutes of that boss would have been fine, but eight minutes?  Really?  And it's not likely you do it perfectly, so it's more likely to be at least an hour.  An hour on one boss...just one boss...no.  No, this is not fun.  This isn't even work.  It's like you don't want people to see farther into your game.  You fail, game devs.  You fail at making a metroidvania.  You failed at making a bullet-hell shooter, too, since it looks too much like a metroidvania to attract fans of that genre.  You've managed to upset two fan-bases for wildly different reasons.  I hate this game.  I don't hate it because it's universally bad; I hate it because I can see the beautiful gems of glorious good buried beneath the unplayably frustrating, repetitive game.
Date 2020-03-09 Playtime 29h 1m Rec Positive This is literally "it isn't a bug, it's a feature"
Date 2020-03-09 Playtime 11h 42m Rec Negative overrated
Date 2020-03-07 Playtime 39h 1m Rec Positive If you don't already know that this is one of the finest and purest metroidvanias in decades and an indie legend, you haven't been paying attention. Art, OST, and gameplay are all excellent. If you like the [i]genre[/i] but don't like this, we're not friends.  I will say that there was one secret ([spoiler]the flamethrower[/spoiler]) that went way over my head, and I eventually looked to a Guide. I'm not proud of it. With that exception, which would've added 5-10 brainwracking hours, my playtime gives a decent indication of how much content is here for a completionist.

Date 2020-03-05 Playtime 9h 44m Rec Positive very good gam
Date 2020-03-04 Playtime 14h 8m Rec Positive Small Brain: "Hey, this is just like Metroid, so it should be really fun!" Large Brain: "Wait, this is EXACTLY like Metroid! Same level design, and many of the same exact enemies! What a total rip-off! This game is just a disappointing derivative." Galaxy Brain: "...well, I guess these weapons are actually pretty cool. It goes beyond 'shoot rocket at red door' and makes you really work for solving problems with unique and interesting items." Supercluster Brain: "I can't get this soundtrack out of my head..." Cosmic Brain: "This game is amazing."
Date 2020-03-04 Playtime 17h 32m Rec Positive Top-tier pixel art Metroidvania. If you're hankering for a hybrid of Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, look no futher.
Date 2020-03-03 Playtime 17h 51m Rec Positive I had a bad case of Metroids once. I couldn't sit down for weeks.  This is more Metroidy than that.  In a good way.
Date 2020-03-03 Playtime 12h 5m Rec Positive excellent game you should play it
Date 2020-03-02 Playtime 19h 4m Rec Positive A metroid-like game that stands shoulder to shoulder with Metroid itself. From the responsive controls, the memorable music, and the surprisingly thought provoking storyline. Axiom Verge is an excellent game
Date 2020-02-29 Playtime 9h 19m Rec Positive [h1]Almost a masterpiece![/h1]  Amazing overall, no need to praise the obvious, just check the other reviews or do a quick search through the internet.    The problem is... Although the whole game is balanced, spoiler]with fun and challenging enemies and bosses, the final one is shameful. You literally can't dodge any of his attacks, it's just a dumb way to end such a great experience.  Don't get me wrong, it is still a must play to any platform / metroidvania lover, but be aware, you might get a little disappointed.
Date 2020-02-25 Playtime 12h 15m Rec Positive A love letter to the Metroid games of old, that is in and of itself a great game.
Date 2020-02-25 Playtime 97h 20m Rec Positive Did you play the original Metroid?  This is more Metroid then Metroid.  If you liked the game that inspired Axiom Verge, then just buy it.
Date 2020-02-23 Playtime 41h 0m Rec Positive 非常喜欢！
Date 2020-02-23 Playtime 23h 28m Rec Positive Great game. Really confusing sometimes to find the right path but still a great game.
Date 2020-02-22 Playtime 10h 32m Rec Negative There's a lot of good things about the game: Soundtrack, Level design, Story, cool weapon and gadget ideas. However the longer the game goes on the worse it gets because of enemy design. Lots of enemies in the later  areas that are impossible to dodge so you'll guaranteed to end up taking damage. Even worse for the last couple bosses. Most parts of the game feel fair but instead of a difficulty curve we get a bullshit curve where "difficulty" just means semi-random patterns that you can't react to and take damage. Really unfortunate that a game that starts out that strongly ends so badly
Date 2020-02-21 Playtime 11h 15m Rec Positive 完成度很高的银河城，但也因而没啥特别突出的地方。  +舒适的流程过程 +出色的画面风格 -BOSS战斗机制无趣 -多武器运用鸡肋  不过还是低于预期，个人感觉排除风格单纯游玩不如空洞骑士跟盐与避难所多矣。
Date 2020-02-20 Playtime 10h 13m Rec Positive Good metroidvania with cool story, great gameplay ideas, nice weapons, but mediocre bosses and fights. But I rather recommend to check it out.
Date 2020-02-20 Playtime 11h 40m Rec Positive Превосходная игра. Такой красивый мир, много необычного оружия и возможностей, приятная музыка, очень разные и интересные враги.
Date 2020-02-19 Playtime 19h 57m Rec Positive Отзывов на этот платформер довольно много и в принципе добавить нечего. В совокупности имеем шикарную стрелялку, с кучей прикольного, но по факту бесполезного оружия, симпатичной графикой и психоделическими фонами, хорошим саундтреком и полным отсутствием вменяемой навигации по огромной карте за исключением гигантской каменной головы. Как ни странно у меня хватило терпения доиграть до конца, но все предметы и комнаты своими силами открыть довольно сложно, да и муторно. Советую к прохождению.
Date 2020-02-19 Playtime 36h 47m Rec Positive 我很想发一个长评论但是我懒得打 但这游戏真的不错
Date 2020-02-18 Playtime 4h 12m Rec Negative Uninteresting locations, frustrating controls (especially with a keyboard, less so with a controller), inconsistent soundtrack, uninspired enemy design, boring colour scheme, minimal sound design (you'll be listening to the same tinny awful sounds over and over), slow story, little to no puzzles, linear guess where-to-go gameplay that was only somewhat bareable with a guide up. I tried and tried but have just given up due to boredom.
Date 2020-02-17 Playtime 12h 5m Rec Positive If you like metroid get this game. So much fun. 9/10
Date 2020-02-16 Playtime 28h 36m Rec Positive Пушкин захотел стать доктором Осьминогом. Традиции Супер Метроида полностью соблюдены, чистая атмосфера тайны и чужеродного мира, в сеттинг добавилась только "матричность" с глюками и клещик из халфы. В секретных мирах даже эффект оверскана есть. По атмосфере до метроида всё же недотягивает, глюки это вещь своеобразная, но меня прям уж так не торгает, названия зон совсем неблагозвучные и бредовые. Но есть и крайне красивые места. В целом всё на уровне, ещё могу отметить хорошую музыку.  Дух старины в геймплее тут чувствуется ещё как. Очень высокая лабиринтовость - зайдешь вроде не по прямому пути и уходишь оооочень далеко, так что потом даже лень возвращаться, за ручку игра не ведёт. Никаких поблажек с телепортацией по карте, только одна "магистраль" по центру мира. Хоть враги и довольно предсказуемы, действуют по своим шаблонам как в Метроиде, лечилки из них падают редко и от балды играть не получится.  Единственное упрощение - при смерти/выходе всё взятое и открытое сохраняется, с другой стороны это немного экономит время. Боссы звёзд с неба не хватают - стреляют по шаблону, найдёшь слепое пятно и гаси его, но это тоже соответствует духу. Оружия зато очень круты и разнообразны, ножничный лазер или молния на ниточке под конец это нечто, или рекурсивный выстрел, позволяющий стрелять за углы.  Заглюченные враги приобретают новые свойства, зачастую помогающие находить секреты. Выглядит глюченье странно, но ощущение "олдовости" придаёт. И секреты тут самые что ни на есть секретные - тыкайся в каждую стену, догадывайся телепортироваться в толщу породы и т.д. Даже миникарта далеко не всегда правильно показывает границы комнаты - то есть даже за монолитной стеной может скрываться проход. Да, поиск всего и вся становится ну очень муторным, но это и есть так хардкорность и дух старины. Плюс, как и раньше, это НЕ ТРЕБУЕТСЯ. Полная концовка открывается на 80% открытия, что человечно, а хардкорное исследование чисто по желанию, ради процесса - это и есть идеальное решение. Даже тексты тут существуют на 3х языках, на 2 их которых нужны переводы, и один из этих переводов можно так и найти вообще, и часть истории игры так и останется загадкой. История, здесь, увы, и в открытом варианте слишком мутная и двоякая, но она не главное, а только фон для хорошей атмосферы и внезапных игровых элементов.
Date 2020-02-15 Playtime 14h 22m Rec Positive aside from Hollow knight i havent played a game like this since metroid fusion. highly recommend buying this game if youre a fan of metroidvania games
Date 2020-02-15 Playtime 18h 24m Rec Positive Melhor versão indie de um metroid que já encontrei, game perfeito!
Date 2020-02-14 Playtime 19h 38m Rec Positive Total Metroid clone, down to the purple map. But hey, if the recipe is great, why mess with it?
Date 2020-02-13 Playtime 34h 3m Rec Positive Absoluter Geheimtipp für Leute die Metroidvania, einen guten Soundtrack, Pixelart und eine spannende (aber auch komplizierte) Story mögen.  Ich habe knapp 15 Stunden gebraucht das Spiel auf Normal durch zu spielen mit 74% der Items und 91% aufgedeckter Map.  Einziger Minuspunkt könnte sein: das Backtracking. Es gibt keine Schnellreise, höchstens Abkürzungen. Man sollte also etwas Geduld aufbringen können.
Date 2020-02-10 Playtime 14h 54m Rec Positive The story works well. The game has more of that disturbingly alien feel, as opposed to the "capable adventurer" of Metroid. There are a bunch of games in the "metroidvania" genre, and it's almost by rote that you end up with double-jumping and wall-kicking and such. This game manages to give you upgrades that are different enough that you need to relearn how you're moving around in the world.  (You still get some classics, like a grappling hook.) While there's "alien language that is actually just ciphered English", you will get a tool in the game that will "translate" it all for you. Still, it's a bit neat that one of the scripts is a variant on Cyrillic, so if you can transliterate that you can read it even in the earlier parts of the game before you get that ability. (Or, you know, go look at a wiki somewhere.) The boss fights are all just slow grinds. I think that's the reason some people play; if so, don't bother. Exploration sometimes requires you to drill random walls, so it's easy to miss a few things. On the other hand, if you're perceptive, you can get most of it. It's just that you feel like you've got to try drilling everything around you all the time. For the sake of enjoyment, keep your random drilling to a minimum.
Date 2020-02-09 Playtime 16h 46m Rec Positive it was fun too uncover the world of axiom verge and its secrets . Towards the end of the game it became kinda tedious ! didnt like some of the end game bosses  because it feels like you can only use one tactic too defeat them. That makes those bosses  less dynamic and more boring. some of the late game enemies also have the same problem. stil a lot of my time with this game was fun! I liked most of the power ups and weapons and the overall experience Axiom verge gave me.
Date 2020-02-09 Playtime 18h 53m Rec Positive Awesome side-scrolling action! Lots of weapons, items and power-ups.  I loved the story too.
Date 2020-02-09 Playtime 38h 11m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is one of the strong games to come from the recent Metroidvania hype. It draws heavily from the original Metroid in terms of style and atmosphere, but is unique enough to be interesting and fun for its own merits. The gameplay is reasonably challenging, with an impressive number of weapons for just about every playstyle. Upgrades can be found throughout to lessen the challenge if desired, and outside of a few nasty ones, are generally not too cryptic for the savvy gamer. It is just as easy to avoid upgrades if the challenge is desired, which is an appreciated option.  I personally used some online help towards the end, mainly to find the few very obscure items left on the map, and did not feel bad about it. The game is begging to be explored and rewards you well, but some areas can show up as fully explored with no indicator as to where missing items could be hiding, something other games like Metroid Fusion handled more elegantly. Same deal with the story progression, it is generally organic, but stumbles in some places and online assistance really kept my progress alive.  Also, very much in line with some of the more negative reviews, I highly recommend playing this game on a keyboard instead of a controller. The controls are a lot more precise with the former and the game never felt like it was dropping inputs or the like.  Overall, a very worthwile experience. I could go on about the excellent soundtrack and well-done retro design, but these points are highly subjective and not very relevant to this review. High recommendation from me, though I won't blame you for waiting for a sale to get it, as the game time outside of reruns (bonus for speedrun functionalities!) is fairly short with around 10-30h depending on outside guidance.
Date 2020-02-08 Playtime 39h 33m Rec Positive This was the last game I bought before I moved from Haswell  to Zen 2, and I enjoyed every minute of it.
Date 2020-02-08 Playtime 15h 34m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania.  Even though the graphics are NES style, the music and gameplay does not disappoint.
Date 2020-02-03 Playtime 10h 57m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvania of all time :-)
Date 2020-02-02 Playtime 29h 14m Rec Positive Интересный такой инди Метроид - исследуем 2д мир, пуляем лазерами в инопланетных зверушек и ищем всякие секретики. Красивый пиксель арт и крутая музыка прилагаются, жаль только боссов маловато и бои с ними мне показались монотонными. Ну и в отличии от Метроида - стриптиз после титров тут не покажут, но оно и к лучшем, ведь тут какой то Пушкин в главной роли, вместо очаровательной Самусочки.
Date 2020-02-02 Playtime 31h 14m Rec Positive Quem curte games de Ação/Plataforma no melhor estilo Metroidvania, PRECISA JOGAR ESSE GAME!  Axiom Verge está na lista dos jogos mais incríveis que joguei na minha vida (neste estilo), abrangendo bem o tema “metroidvania” com maestria.  É facilmente notório que Axiom Verge tem fortes inspirações no grande clássico no Super Metroid (Super Nes), mas isso não quer dizer que ele é uma cópia, muito pelo contrário... O jogo tem luz própria; variadas e interessantes armas; seu próprio protagonista; habilidades específicas bem definidas, bem como sua linha instigante de storyline.   𝐏𝐎𝐍𝐓𝐎𝐒 𝐏𝐎𝐒𝐈𝐓𝐈𝐕𝐎𝐒 :  => Enredo: Storyline bem definida, com ficção científica; => Gráficos: Belas animações de sprites 16 Bits, cenários fantásticos com efeitos parallax! Ps: O efeito de distorção é algo diferenciado e importante ser mencionado; => Personagem: Carismático, engraçado e curioso; => Trilha Sonora: Destaco como ponte forte. Muito bem elaboradas as composições, mesclando do futurismo (cheio de efeitos especiais) ao melancólico/triste. => Jogabilidade: Joguei na steam (com controle de PS2 plugado no PC. Respostas excelentes. => Resumo Geral. Existe uma boa variedade de armas,  inúmeras habilidades para o personagem, vários locais para explorar, diversos itens secretos.  𝐏𝐎𝐍𝐓𝐎𝐒 𝐍𝐄𝐆𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐕𝐎𝐒:  => Alguns bosses do game são bem mais desafiadores que o próprio último desafio. => Os cenários tem seu "brilho", as animações são boas (como destacado acima), mas o nível de detalhes dos cenários poderia estar mais caprichado (apenas mudam o tom de algumas cores).  => O sistema de travel do jogo é muito ruim. Se tivesse uma habilidade pra se teleportar (nos pontos de save por exemplo) seria excelente.  Há inúmeros jogos bons na Steam, vários indies se destacam bastante... Mas um dos principais diferenciais de Axiom Verge foi ter sido desenvolvido por apenas 1 pessoa... É algo BEM difícil de acreditar. Certamente a segunda versão (que chega esse ano) será um grande sucesso de vendas.  𝑷𝑨𝑹𝑨𝑩É𝑵𝑺 𝑻𝒉𝒐𝒎𝒂𝒔 𝑯𝒂𝒑𝒑!!!

Date 2020-02-02 Playtime 12h 26m Rec Positive Solid Metroid style game, great music was constantly thinking out of the box
Date 2020-02-02 Playtime 26h 20m Rec Positive Es más que una inspiración de Metroid, pero sin embargo, tiene personalidad propia. Es adictivo, tiene buena música y una dificultad alta pero no imposible.
Date 2020-02-01 Playtime 10h 44m Rec Positive Axiom verge is a great game to play 
Date 2020-02-01 Playtime 23h 22m Rec Positive 陰鬱で神秘的な雰囲気が印象的な、探索要素強めのメトロイドヴァニアです。 レトロゲームのバグ表現を取り入れたギミックが、このゲームの最大の特徴であり魅力だと思います。  この手のゲームによくある、「ここは今は通れないけど、何かアイテムを入手してから後でまた来るんだろうな…」 というような箇所が序盤から多いので、メモ等をとっておくとスムーズに進め易いと思います。  拠点間ワープやファストトラベルの類が無く、基本的に徒歩で移動しなければいけない上に、主人公が強くなるまでは雑魚敵から受けるダメージもばかにできずゴリ押ししづらくて時間もかかるので、無計画に探索してしまうとけっこうストレスが溜まります。  グラフィックや翻訳具合から粗削りな印象を受けましたが、謎解きに関しては、親切にヒントを与えてくれたりはしないものの それとなくプレイヤーに気づかせる気配りもあり、優しすぎず難しすぎずちょうどいい塩梅だと思います ([spoiler]何か隠してある場所には違和感を覚えるような工夫がされていたり、アイテムによっては手に入れたらそれを使わないとその部屋から出られないものもあって、自然とプレイヤーに使い方をわからせる配慮がされています[/spoiler])。  ただ、100％クリアを[spoiler]狙う場合の難易度は、ネットで情報を出し合って複数人で解くのを前提としているような気がします。 ヒント無しでなんの変哲もない通り道の壁の中にアイテムが隠れてたりします。[/spoiler]
Date 2020-01-30 Playtime 40h 19m Rec Positive Absolutely brilliant game.  Amazing  soundtrack.  Huge replay value.  Just a great big pixelated ball of fun.
Date 2020-01-28 Playtime 47h 8m Rec Positive Great Game.
Date 2020-01-28 Playtime 0h 57m Rec Negative There are several negative reviews worth reading about this game that goes into more detail about the game in general. I'm an avid fan of metroidvanias, but I decided to pass on this one and refund after roughly an hour. What annoyed me the most was the controller. I don't know, maybe I'm just spoiled by games where you feel in total control of your character. Not here.  The second analog stick is used as a "weapon wheel", in which it pauses the game and you have to hit a direction and press A to change a weapon. I wish I could just hit the desired direction and change weapons mid-air or something. Or even map it to the D-Pad.  Also, locking the R-Stick to weapons, you have a bad time aiming. You have to hold LB to lock your character in place and aim. If you want to aim down while moving, good luck. I found myself using the R-Stick trying to aim so many times, it was frustating. Also, the weapon design are horrendous. Of course, I got access to only a selected few, but some of them felt like "ok, I use this to open a door and never again I'll use that crap".  I also had a very bad time with the music. The first map has a nice "intro" and suddenly the music goes into such a high pitch that my ears almost bled. I could not adjust it midgame, so I had to save and go back to the menus... Well, you get the idea. So many annoyances, I gave up playing.  I feel like the game has it's worth. Somewhere. I just lost my will to keep on playing it.
Date 2020-01-27 Playtime 10h 32m Rec Positive Probably the best Metroidvania style game I've played on the PC. Great graphics and music, a world full of biomechanical mystery that reminded me at times of Tsutomu Nihei's Biomega manga, at other times of the works of H.R. Giger. Excellent controls finish up the great package very neatly.  The only time I got stuck was because I didn't realize a second use for a certain item, and to be fair, I don't think it was very obvious at all, when I looked up how to proceed it felt like some sort of speedrunner exploit, but nope, it's the intended way.
Date 2020-01-25 Playtime 11h 8m Rec Positive a fun and excellent Metroidvania platformer.
Date 2020-01-25 Playtime 56h 38m Rec Positive A very good metroidvaina. More Metroid than 'vania A little smaller than Super Metroid but very fun!

Date 2020-01-24 Playtime 17h 3m Rec Positive I haven't had a game hit me this hard in such a long time  Lovingly crafted design playing to the strength of my roots, the heart of my design philosophy and inspiration
Date 2020-01-24 Playtime 36h 4m Rec Positive Its tough, but its great
Date 2020-01-22 Playtime 10h 5m Rec Positive I finally lost my verge-inity
Date 2020-01-22 Playtime 18h 48m Rec Positive Great game.  Love the retro music and art style.  Game is a great metroidvania.  Great references to scifi new and old, especially the Alien and Metroid series.
Date 2020-01-20 Playtime 14h 7m Rec Negative The game isn't a disaster but there's too many issues to recommend it. In short: A) The game has about 20 weapons, each one more useless than the last.   B) The whole "8-bit glitched game" thing is TEDIOUS, ugly, overdone, and unoriginal.  (.hack//Infection had this mechanic in 2002 on the PS2 - that's nearly 20 years ago.) C) Even if you get all (or nearly all) of the damage boosts, your weapons aren't able to cut down normal enemies fast enough to run through rooms while backtracking.  Since there's loads of backtracking, this makes for a much longer playtime than the underlying gameplay can honestly support. D) The sound effects for anything "glitch" related could be graciously described as "Chalkboard-On-Nails, in D Minor", and the game is loaded with it.  The sound effect for your weapons hitting an enemy's invulnerable points were even worse.  I ended up muting the game for the last 1/2 of it. E) Many of the static visuals were such obvious rip offs of the NES/SNES era Metroid games that I wouldn't be surprised if this game ends up getting taken down for legal reasons.  It felt low effort and derivative to the point of being distracting.   
Date 2020-01-20 Playtime 19h 14m Rec Positive truly a masterpiece
Date 2020-01-19 Playtime 11h 27m Rec Positive Аксиома игра довольно спорная. Да, это отличная метроидвания, местами крайне затянутая, раздражительная, унылая, но всё же в ней есть сюжет за которым довольно интересно следить и неплохой графический стиль. По большей части всё окружение напоминает эдакий "биопанк" которого вот лично мне не хватает и оно воистину завораживает. Игра довольно багованная, особенно на первых боссах. Некоторых можно было "обойти со спины" и рассрелять не опасаясь атак, так как босс просто не мог развернуться и начать палить в другую сторону. Одного босса так и вовсе можно было заставить прижаться к стене и яростно стрелять по нему не давая ему вообще никаких шансов даже атаковать. Рассказывать можно об Аксиоме довольно долго, но итог будет только один. Игра очень интересная, но она явно подойдёт не для всех. Особенно сложно было заставить её проходить во второй раз, но ради ачивок оно того стоило. Ждём продолжения, анонс второй части как раз недавно объявился на просторах тырнетов, вот только артстиль в трейлере уже напрягает глаза. Если в первой части он отлично выдержан, то в новой части... В общем да,следим за развитием событий.
Date 2020-01-18 Playtime 39h 41m Rec Positive Been a while since I played a game I liked this much. The following complaints didn't detract from the experience much at all, and I expect to change my mind to a degree as I get better beyond first playthrough. There's also a positive flip-side to this aspect I'll describe, but the times I felt the negatives were really the only bad experience I ran into, so thought I'd leave feedback:  I found some enemy movement/attack patterns and placement were a bit hard to counter with much agency. The game somewhat invites you to cheese it in the many ways it allows, but it's often fun to take advantage of these things too. It seems sometimes you just have to trade hits and do a somewhat sloppy dps-race when no cheese is available, but it usually still required some balance of avoiding dmg when you absolutely have to and dps-racing when you can afford to, which works out alright.   Juggling defensive strafing/jumping, shooting at them and double-tapping for that one thing you get (Hate that input) could get pretty awkward for me, so maybe with my mastery of this I will run into this a lot less and figure out enemy rhythms that get me through runs without many hp upgrades, but can be a bit awkward to first learn. (Watching Lobos play rn, seems to be doing about as well as I did, except he has even more trouble with double-tap input haha)  Like I said though, this barely detracted from the experience as I loved just exploring the environments and enemies, I normally only play games where I feel very much in control of the combat (Insert Dark Souls reference here), but this one easily got away with it and still engaged me with it's combat.   It definitely benefits from some balance of whittling the player down to a degree that's fair and manageable, it can create some tension for the player to react to as well as they can. Unlocking and/or figuring out ways to avoid these situations feels awesome as well. I really liked discovering how easy a combination of guns makes a room if you move certain ways, or how glitching certain enemies/discovering passages etc. helps out so much, makes me want to replay many times like the retro games it kinda reminds me of.
Date 2020-01-18 Playtime 27h 38m Rec Positive One of the best "retro" games on PC and the closest thing we have to Metroid on the platform.
Date 2020-01-17 Playtime 41h 35m Rec Positive Gran gioco, difficile, complesso, vasto, gran bella storia, come una volta. Retrogaming is the way!
Date 2020-01-16 Playtime 15h 21m Rec Positive metroid big boy
Date 2020-01-14 Playtime 14h 35m Rec Positive A nice Metroidvania game. Has just the right length. It features some cool and creative mechanics and tools with a retro look and feel. Really, I have nothing major to complain about.   The controls are smooth and snappy for the most part. Pretty much every controller button has a useful function which keeps annoying menuing to a minimum. The only thing I wasn't quite happy with was the dash/teleport which is activated by double tapping a directional movement button once it's unlocked. I found myself accidentally using that one way too many times. Other than that the gameplay very much feels like Super Metroid with new tools and a crap load of different weapons.  Level and world design are great. There are tons of hidden secrets to be found which reward observant players. Occasional Shortcuts and a central fast travel area that connects to almost every other area in the game make backtracking much more bearable considering the lack of movement speed enhancing traversal options for the player character.  I also very much like the art style. And I'm usually the first one to be sceptical of retro art styles. Axiom Verge definitely draws its inspiration from Metroid, but it still has its own design that goes beyond "muh pixels" that plagues so many indie games. However, while I do think that the art style is beautiful and I do understand that the game is thematically supposed to be about (intentional) glitches, I also have to mention that I found myself confused by the graphics in a number of situations. Trying to tell if an object is an enemy or harmless backdrop , which sprite is part of the foreground or background, whether a block is breakable or solid isn't always easy to tell and usually requires a trial and error approach.  Otherwise it's a great game. Not too long, not too short. Some decent boss fights. Classic gameplay with less jank. Didn't really care about the story, but it's there. 👍
Date 2020-01-14 Playtime 17h 44m Rec Positive Man, this is a master piece, especially if you are a metroidvania fan. I recommend doing hard dificult firts play if you are a hardcore player, things get more intense and satisfatory. (sorry for my broken english). All the best and wish you all a chance to meet this gourgeus game.
Date 2020-01-14 Playtime 16h 55m Rec Positive I have nothing but good things to say about this game. Visuals and sound are amazing. Controls are deceptively on point. The story is deeper than you think. It feels like a direct descendant to Metroid and follows all the precedents set by the series as a whole... and breaks all the rules in all the best ways. Kudos, Tom. You build a good one. I can't wait for the sequel!
Date 2020-01-13 Playtime 9h 51m Rec Positive Amazing metroidvania, sweet tunes, great gameplay, artstyle and heaps of weapons\upgrades.
Date 2020-01-13 Playtime 22h 17m Rec Positive Absolutely love this game and am eagerly awaiting the sequel as im now hooked on this world.
Date 2020-01-09 Playtime 12h 7m Rec Positive This game is fantastic. It heavily invokes Metroid nostalgia, but is completely its own original product. I highly recommend this game for any fan of Metroid or sci-fi/8-bit games.
Date 2020-01-09 Playtime 12h 38m Rec Positive good
Date 2020-01-08 Playtime 11h 7m Rec Positive Good gameplay, weird story
Date 2020-01-08 Playtime 19h 49m Rec Positive It's a spiritual successor, even a love letter, to Metroid. It's familiar without being a copy or a sequel. I haven't finished it yet, but it's my favorite game of the past few years.
Date 2020-01-07 Playtime 12h 9m Rec Positive a good metroid clone
Date 2020-01-07 Playtime 17h 35m Rec Negative I don't dislike the game; my reaction is, on the low end of "Meh," but there's no middle ground button. I'm immensely impressed one person made the game all by himself, though.
Date 2020-01-05 Playtime 9h 15m Rec Positive Great art and music but boss fights feel cheap and ending was anticlimactic
Date 2020-01-05 Playtime 0h 44m Rec Positive Ici, ce jeux se défini par "passion", on sent que metroid est avec nous, mais ici on améliore le modèle en y appliquant sa propre sauce. axiom verge est pour les amoureux de metroid et autre samus aran une référence.
Date 2020-01-05 Playtime 7h 58m Rec Positive Samus hombre y sin traje. La curva de dificultad está muy bien aplicada y le buscaron muy bien la vuelta para rediseñar muchas cosas y no parezca Metroid, pero es.
Date 2020-01-05 Playtime 10h 21m Rec Positive o jogo é bom, mas ta bugado ajeita isso ae
Date 2020-01-05 Playtime 15h 37m Rec Negative [h1]There are definitely better Metroidvanias out there[/h1]  [b]Pros[/b] [list] [*]Lot of variety of enemies and scenarios [/list]  [b]Cons[/b] [list] [*]Terrible enemy placement. You'll get hit no matter what you do, and often times the battle will become a running jumping stravaganza [*]Bad pixel art. This becomes a real issue when you try to find secrets, as all surfaces look the same and you don't know where to hit [*]A lot of weapons, but most of them useless. You'll stick to about three good ones [*]Nonsense dialogue [/list]
Date 2020-01-05 Playtime 15h 48m Rec Positive Супер музыка, сюжет просто огонь! Крепкая, лаконичная фантастическая история, я бы даже сказал изящная. Не понравилось, что некоторые секреты без прохождения кажется вообще невозможно найти, всё-таки мне кажется в метроидваниях такие вещи должны быть чуть более очевидны. Но это только моё мнение, и эти трудные секреты в любом случае практически не касаются сюжета! Игра супер, мне очень зашла.
Date 2020-01-04 Playtime 12h 30m Rec Positive 感谢汉化组汉化，有了中文补丁，于是就通关了，很棒的游戏。刚好续作预告也出了，期待续作
Date 2020-01-04 Playtime 9h 38m Rec Positive Good game.  This review was helpful.
Date 2020-01-03 Playtime 17h 32m Rec Positive Un excellent metroidvania. La réalisation est très léchée et tout le jeu très très bien dosé : pas trop dur, mais nécessitant un minimum d'investissement quand même. Un must.
Date 2020-01-03 Playtime 11h 10m Rec Negative The game features some cool weapons and abilities, but Axiom Verge also has a big issue: its pacing. The lack of any form of fast travel causes stretches of the game to become rather tedious. Obviously a game that is so heavily inspired by Metroid will encourage backtracking, but Axiom Verge does not provide any hints as to where the next main objective is, so the player is expected to explore every unexplored corner of the map each time they pick up a new traversal related upgrade. Maybe your memory is better than mine, but when I get a new upgrade, I don't automatically know which former dead ends can now be explored further, and the map certainly doesn't tell you. It's also very easy to overlook the correct path or to not even realize that it is even possible to reach, especially with some of the late game upgrades. Fast travel would have made it easy to forgive these frustrations, but, I digress. The game also includes bosses that pose almost no challenge whatsoever, and somewhat repetitive environments. You're left with a perfectly okay game but one that is heavily overshadowed by much better games representing its genre. I still look forward to the sequel though, as I get the feeling this developer will only get better!
Date 2020-01-03 Playtime 56h 7m Rec Positive closest game to super metroid that ive found
Date 2020-01-02 Playtime 17h 45m Rec Positive extremely good!
Date 2019-12-31 Playtime 13h 21m Rec Positive muito bom jogo me lembra muito do metroid de gameboy, muito completo cheio de segredos gostei bastante eles só poderiam melhorar nos controles, deixar mais fluido mas fora isso um jogão top 8/10.
Date 2019-12-31 Playtime 24h 16m Rec Positive Un plataformas con disparos que combina muchas mecánicas interesantes que te permiten explorar aún más el mapa cuando creías que lo habías visto todo.
Date 2019-12-30 Playtime 50h 7m Rec Positive Easily a contender for the best Metroidvania game of the decade.  Polished gameplay and controls, amazing music, intriguing story. The graphics/pixel-art will remind you of the height of the SNES era.
Date 2019-12-29 Playtime 17h 12m Rec Positive Um dos melhores jogos metroidvania que joguei em 2019 (apesar dele ser de 2015). Simplesmente sensacional.
Date 2019-12-29 Playtime 9h 21m Rec Positive yes
Date 2019-12-29 Playtime 30h 10m Rec Positive Практически полный клон Super Metroid. Что, в принципе, очень даже не плохо, но создает сильное ощущения вторичности. Слишком большой упор на бектрекинг, при среднем уровне левелдизайна, периодически утомляет(в современных метройдваниях не иметь хотя бы немного точек быстрого перемещения крайне сомнительное решение, имхо). Слишком большой арсенал оружия приводит к ситуации, что некоторое оружие лежит мертвым грузом и никогда не используется. Но, в целом, поклонникам жанра к ознакомлению конечно обязательно) 7/10
Date 2019-12-29 Playtime 8h 37m Rec Positive Excellent gameplay and very engaging!
Date 2019-12-28 Playtime 11h 9m Rec Positive i love this game so much !!
Date 2019-12-28 Playtime 13h 43m Rec Positive Просто отвал башки. Игру ругают за то что это не самый лучший метроид, но для новичков в жанре зайдет в самый раз. Так же слышал упреки за слишком ранний сюжетный твист. Но так могут решить лишь люди, поверхностно прошедшие игру. Для полноценного раскрытия сюжета нужно собрать все записки и посмотреть пару-другую роликов на ютубе, собирающие историю в хронологическом порядке.  Отдельно желаю автора добра и позитива, так как сделать в одиночку такую игру большого стоит. Специально взял игру в стиме чтобы поддерживать разработчика. Так как именно инди-произведения такого высокого качества заслуживают уважения, в отличии от современного ширпотреба, сделанного командами бездарей из скатившихся корпораций.
Date 2019-12-27 Playtime 15h 10m Rec Positive 10/10
Date 2019-12-26 Playtime 10h 49m Rec Positive Very metroid, but each new item opens up whole new worlds and areas to explore. It's fun revisiting old grounds and get good stuff as you pgoress. Extremely good game.
Date 2019-12-26 Playtime 17h 12m Rec Positive This game was so amazing when it was released I love the creepy atmosphere the enemies are really unique designs compared to other games like this, and the music boy he did amazing job  This game left me wanting so much more, it's a shame it would seem I will never get what I hoped for after waiting years for the sequel which was what a prequel? Prequels rarely deliver as good of an experience.  He changed too much unfortunately  At least this game is fun even if it's a bit too cryptic and fairly short and very easy.  I still recommend giving it a shot but it's not gonna revolutionize anything and pretty sure it's one of those play it once and done almost no one talks about the game.  Also going epic really kinda killed off anyone really caring about the games when they gotta wait a long time to play steam version by then they have forgotten about the game and....screw epic.
Date 2019-12-26 Playtime 23h 52m Rec Positive Sendo juegazo lpm, lo estoy disfrutando a full y el como se desbloquea todo de a poco, puedes terminarlo con menos del 50% de las armas y objetos, pero la gracia en este metroidvania es completarlo al 100% descubriendo sus secretos en cada habitación, y de verdad te sorprenderás con lo que te puedes encontrar tras una pared que antes parecía normal. mis 10/10
Date 2019-12-26 Playtime 37h 10m Rec Positive This game has become one of my favorite games of all time
Date 2019-12-25 Playtime 30h 11m Rec Positive Very similar to Super Metroid for all the right reasons.
Date 2019-12-25 Playtime 23h 47m Rec Positive [h1] Потерянный во времени и пространстве [/h1] Платформер по тематике космической фантастики. Сразу скажу эта игра про сюжет и атмосферу, исследование и разгадывания, но не как не про сложность и прыжки. Мы изучаем загадочный чужой мир, ищем новые пути и экипировку. Здесь много разнообразных врагов, но сражения с ними почти все одинаковые, а вот боссы другое дело. Рекомендую всем кто любит фантастику, здесь есть на что посмотреть и о чем подумать. Не смотря, на то что в игре есть хард мод, все ровно достаточна простая и не подойдет тем кто любит хардкор в играх, но зато она хорошо спидранется)
Date 2019-12-23 Playtime 12h 17m Rec Positive Metroidvania game with some great twists
Date 2019-12-22 Playtime 19h 37m Rec Positive Great metroidvania with a great soundtrack. Some of the upgrades are questionable in terms of benefit offered but nothing that makes the game terrible.   Would highly recommend.
Date 2019-12-22 Playtime 32h 43m Rec Positive One of the top Metroidlikes on the market!
Date 2019-12-21 Playtime 69h 47m Rec Positive watch out! i forget why
Date 2019-12-20 Playtime 8h 0m Rec Positive A very good metroidania,
Date 2019-12-20 Playtime 51h 12m Rec Positive Really exciting gameplay, I love to explore and find the many secret passageways (some very, very secret areas) and the cool upgrades found there. I think a lot of it can be passed for a player to still beat the game, and I think there's a lot of value to be had in finding things that not everyone does.
Date 2019-12-19 Playtime 2h 49m Rec Negative Не оценил. Занудно. Ну или может просто не мое.
Date 2019-12-18 Playtime 20h 43m Rec Positive This game is Metroid inspired, but has it's own original style. It has incredibly unique features and powerups, and plenty of replay value. If you like Metroid, you'll like the gameplay, and if you like interesting open ended storytelling, the game has that too. Storywise, It's a game that gets you to ask questions and come to your own conclusions about the game's world and it's mysteries, which is very impressive for an 16 bit exploration platformer game. The game also has some other nods to Metroid, such as the passcode tool (found later in the game), into which you can input passcodes in a similar fashion to Metroid (NES)'s password save system. The game also has many convenient features, such as a speedrun mode which removes all dialogue and cutscenes, as well as all randomized content, for optimal run conditions.  tl;dr: You like Metroid? Buy the game.
Date 2019-12-18 Playtime 26h 44m Rec Positive Its the amazing 2D metroid game that nintendo never released. Except the story is more complex. There are more lore secrets and its not made by a huge money grubbing corporation. Strongly recommend to buy the game if you like metroidvanias.
Date 2019-12-17 Playtime 6h 0m Rec Negative 没有中文就差评
Date 2019-12-17 Playtime 20h 21m Rec Positive Como não recomendar um jogo com uma referência direta aos clássicos dos 16 bits, mas que não copia em nada, ele tem sua própria cara, com ideias originais que fazem o jogo ser extremamente divertido. A trilha sonora é um show a parte, colocando todo aquele clima que qualquer um procura em um jogo. Então está mais que recomendado, mas se prepare para ver o dia clarear e nem perceber que jogou durante 10 horas seguidas.
Date 2019-12-16 Playtime 21h 1m Rec Positive Jogo incrível. Rico em história e em jogabilidade.
Date 2019-12-16 Playtime 32h 41m Rec Positive good game
Date 2019-12-15 Playtime 36h 6m Rec Positive Axiom Verge, mi ''metroidvania'' favorito (después de Super Metroid 3, Metroid Fusion y Metroid Zero Mision), fue creado sola y únicamente por Thomas Happ (incluyendo sonidos y música), es una obra de arte... su música, su ambientación, su jugabilidad e historia te atrapan y te llevan a otro mundo; cada minuto u hora que transcurre vas enamorándote y sumiéndote cada vez más del juego.  Este juego lo recomiendo como si fuera uno de mis mayores tesoros, ya que vale la pena haberlo terminado al menos una vez en la vida si es que eres fan de este tipo de juegos, y no tan solo de este tipo de juegos, sino que todos deberían darle al menos una oportunidad.  Si tienes dudas, descargalo pirata para echarle un ojo tal como hice yo, ya que no tiene DEMO y verás que vale totalmente la pena poseer esta joya original. Y como dicen los fans de este juego, este es nuestro nuevo Metroid, su sucesor espiritual totalmente. <3

Date 2019-12-14 Playtime 22h 43m Rec Positive A good metroidvania, with small challenges when you pick normal mode. Controls work great, it's the king of game you can play an hour at a time. 
Date 2019-12-13 Playtime 20h 57m Rec Positive This game is what I would call the indie version of Metroid.  Lots of fun to play, a good challenge, lots of different weapons, but a controller is definitely wanted.  Get this if you're a fan of Metroid or side-scrollers.
Date 2019-12-12 Playtime 23h 39m Rec Positive 10/10 play it if you like pixel metroidvania stuff.  [for real though, good movements, good bosses, a tiny bit of thumb torture, dope story amd cheeky hidden stuff,] 12/10 soundtrack
Date 2019-12-12 Playtime 14h 49m Rec Positive Даже если вы не любите жанр метроидваний, та атмосфера, в которой вы находитесь, то желание узнать что там да как вообще, оно (скорей всего) доведет вас до конца игры. Тонны секретов, первый раз прошел на вите, потом на сложном на компе проходил ито нашел всего 78% предметов и открыл 96% карты. Едва ли буду проходить еще раз, но потраченное время стоило того. Жду вторую часть <3
Date 2019-12-12 Playtime 27h 59m Rec Positive a great Metroidvania with a heavy emphasis on NES Metroid
Date 2019-12-12 Playtime 10h 19m Rec Negative i like metroidvanias but i rarely got lost to such a degree that this game has , its good but flawed as fuck
Date 2019-12-11 Playtime 18h 26m Rec Positive Excelente juego
Date 2019-12-11 Playtime 11h 59m Rec Negative I hear a lof of good praises for this game, but I think this one is seriously overrated.  The graphic is mixed bag (the art direction is kinda cool), the music is meh, and 2 metroidvania crucial parts that failed on this game: the weapons and mission structure  There are a LOTS of weapon choice (more than 20!), but every single one of them deal same damage like your base weapon. What's the point? It doesn't make the game more exciting. In the end I beat the game using the base weapon, because the other weapon just too unique and cumbersome to use.  Mission structure, the map size is adequate, but the layout is quite annoying. Let's say, when you enter a room from right after you got new ability, sometime you can't go back to previous room from left because the obstacle is respawned. It won't bother me if the dev created some shortcut using certain ability, but no, I must travel around the map again because I forgot some item or where should I go. And this game doesn't give you any marker where you should go! It's very frustating and annoying.  The other annoying point is: the boss battles is a joke. It's not challenging and smart.  I think this game is okay-ish, it doesn't deserved the high praise from a lot of people. It feels very very lack of polish. If you have some money to spare, I think you can get more fun with Guacamelee.
Date 2019-12-10 Playtime 20h 22m Rec Positive Finalmente terminei esse jogo e não deixa a desejar. Experiência bem metroidvania com upgrades criativos e muitas armas e segredos para descobrir, além de uma história interessante.
Date 2019-12-10 Playtime 22h 5m Rec Positive Classic Metroid action and adventure.
Date 2019-12-10 Playtime 0h 53m Rec Positive It feels like I'm playing an actual good game
Date 2019-12-09 Playtime 42h 32m Rec Positive This is legitimately one of the best Metroidvania games ever released, period. The art looks great (if you like Giger, at least), the plot in intriguing, and it's more unique mechanics are interesting-if underutilized.  At some points backtracking become impossible-short of using exploits, until more upgrades are found. Bosses are cool but underwhelming, and some weapons are just completely inferior to others. Despite all this, if you liked the original Metroid (and Zero Mission) and Super Metroid, this is a must-play. But even if you don't, it's highly recommended. 8/10
Date 2019-12-09 Playtime 12h 32m Rec Positive Axiom Verge has all the bones of a well-designed Metroid game: an alien soundtrack with a couple of motifs that are throwbacks to the music of the original, distinct environments and enemies with interesting and varied threats, slick and precise movement with satisfying animations and traversal upgrades, mostly imposing bosses and central figures, it's ominous and otherworldly, and it makes you feel small and isolated from all familiar life. That's more than enough to say that, yes, it's very much worth playing.  A few things keep it from being magnificent:   While there is a great assortment of weapons to find, the majority of them were not designed to be particularly useful over the few that are, so gathering up a couple dozen weapons is more of a novelty than anything. Still, there are several great offensive options which is just as many as most games in the genre have, and the game's glitch mechanic that reprograms enemy behavior makes up for any shortfalls.  Early on, you'll casually step off a standard ledge not knowing you'll be unable to go back to the early zones for quite some time. The game strands you in what is arguably the worst zone for a good chunk of the early-mid game, and you'll find half a dozen upgrades and be sick of hearing Hindi chant over a techno beat by the time you can finally go back.  Order of upgrades required to gain other upgrades required to pass a couple of narrow, out-of-the-way progression points with no direction from the game whatsoever is less than ideal, leading to unnecessary backtracking later in the game, over and above the usual in the genre—too many dead ends too many times, which the central elevator doesn't remotely alleviate.  Bosses as a whole are relatively few but the oh-shit bosses who actually feel threatening are even fewer; you can walk right through the second boss and cheese him from behind, and the ultimate battle is a joke—more for the purpose of neatly wrapping up the story than anything—especially after being warned about the big bad final boss throughout the entire game.   While every game in the genre does it to a degree, the tells for quite a few of the mundane hidden areas aren't sufficient, meaning to 100% the map without looking up anything you would have to spend a great deal of time knocking on every wall after gaining certain upgrades. While there are some well-designed secret areas involving passwords, some of the lesser hidden rooms should either have better graphical tells or be revealed or alluded to by a late-game item that helps round up the stragglers you've missed after 80-90% map completion, like the grubfinder in Hollow Knight.  These are relatively minor flaws in one of the better games in the genre so, once again, if you're a fan of Metroid, Axiom Verge is a no-brainer.
Date 2019-12-08 Playtime 38h 25m Rec Positive By far the greatest retro style game. Looks like Metroid on top, but has elements of Rygar, Bionic Commando, Megaman, and more. Great music, graphics, and atmosphere.
Date 2019-12-08 Playtime 35h 39m Rec Positive Una experiencia inolvidable, cabe decir que este fue el primer juego metroidvania con el que me desenvolví. Este juego tiene un sistema de progreso muy satisfactorio aparte de eso que no necesitas todos los items para terminar el juego. Simplemente es divertido el ver y descubrir áreas nuevas, obtener mejoras tanto como armas, salud, y otros objetos que te ayudaran a facilitar tu travesía, la dificultan es total que nunca sentirás que baje o aumente demasiado. Un título que debes probar si te gusta los retos.
Date 2019-12-07 Playtime 72h 30m Rec Positive 《Axiom Verge，公理邊緣》是一款 8bit 像素風格的 Metroidvania 類型遊戲，玩家為一位名叫 Trace 的科學家，在一次實驗意外中陷入昏迷，醒來卻發現身處在充滿未知科技與怪物的異世界。以異星探險的主軸來看，遊戲整體很有《銀河戰士》的風格，不過這款不論在劇情或內容上都完全有自己的風格，道具設計和關卡、劇情的配合也是前所未見的。遊戲融合了科幻、古文明、神話、現實、虛擬等主題，編織出一部科幻大片，這款的劇情若要拍成電影，完全是沒問題的，遊戲的主線完成的故事，跟挖掘出全部歷史文件，拼湊出來的故事有著驚人的反轉，如果你是一個「五歲抬頭」的觀眾，相信也會對這款的內容有著濃厚的興趣。  這款為什麼要叫《公理邊緣》呢？這要從它的故事說起，不過為了不劇透，關於劇情的部分這裡會跳過，可能會因此看不懂，但等你玩遊戲後就能拼湊起來，遊戲中所指的公理，基本上可以理解為宇宙萬法、宇宙法則，凡參透公理者就某種程度上猶如神般的存在，有點像悟道成仙的感覺。而邊緣呢？我們常會說遊走法律邊緣，是指在法律規則的範圍內行看似作弊的行為，用這個意思來看公理邊緣，我們就可以理解出，參透公理，依宇宙萬法行如神般的行為，穿越？讓假的成真？讓真的為假？何為現實？何為虛擬？世界究竟是真實的？還是虛擬的？這就要玩家自行理解或參透了。  遊戲介紹的最後一段很有意思： Life. Afterlife. Real. Virtual. Dream. Nightmare. It's a thin line. 「今生、來世；現實，虛擬；夢境，夢魘。只在一線之隔。」  需要中文的可以下載我製作的中文化使用： https://www.codebay.in/2019/12/axiomverge-cht-mod.html  想了解劇情或隱藏的背景設定的人，可以來看看我另外寫的劇情分析：https://www.codebay.in/2019/12/axiomverge-story.html
Date 2019-12-06 Playtime 18h 52m Rec Negative I mean... The game is not just a Metroidvania but a straight up Metroid. That's the only reason I played it and recommended it. Other than that, nothing special.  The story is the worst kind of convoluted  with gibberish words and those clone/time travel cheap tropes to make it seem smarter. The art is eh. Neither good nor bad. Metroid vibes but bleaker in more of a mucky way. There was never a moment I stopped to appreciate the beauty. I didn't like the controls too much, Movement itself is fine, pretty snappy but some layout decisions were driving me crazy.  You can remap the weapon wheel from the right stick, but [spoiler]  what's up with the phase shift and the grappling hook. It would be cool to actually use em in battle to feel quick and nimble, but they just remain progression gimmicks  for the rest of the game since they're so unintuitive and cannot be fixed in configs.  [/spoiler] The enemies are mostly unfair. And by unfair I mean unfair. I love difficulty in my Metroidvanias but this is just progress throtteling.  Some cool items and a lot of useless weapon mods, Overall, never got invested in the story and never felt that battle flow and agility. Kinda clunky and awkward but hey, it's more Metroid
Date 2019-12-05 Playtime 47h 13m Rec Positive Wonderful game if you're into old-school 2D metroids. So much love and character...
Date 2019-12-05 Playtime 8h 57m Rec Positive The game isint bad per say but honestly, although I'm only 2 hours in I feel like this game has a lot of standing still just to not die. Not to mention how obnoxiously meat shieldish some of the early enemies are. Most enemies feel too fast or somewhat clunky to try and maneuver around. The backtracking doesn't feel quite linear enough and the bosses are indeed too easy. Story and music are good so far. Feels as though enemies do way too much damage and the heal drops are far too random on ocasion. Even if they made health more plentiful before you get the first upgrade it would be more enjoyable but even after 2 extra pieces of health I still find myself getting shredded to pieces by any enemy that attacks me.   All in all not a bad game just feels too much like metroid fusion rather than zero mission or super. Progression is awkward and enemies do too much damage.  (Edit) The game has gotten better but backtracking could be even a slight bit more linear than just remembering where you needed to use a new item. Game is much more enjoyable now that i have given it a better chance overall worth it if you can deal with the beginning.
Date 2019-12-04 Playtime 34h 26m Rec Positive Axiom Verge provides pixel-perfect maneuvering and a more expansive and diverse weapon set. Love the teleporting ability in combat and especially backtracking for those hidden rooms. The disruption abilities are also a really unique and refreshing take.   My only criticism is that the grappling hook doesn't offer really anything new to the table as it just seemed to fall flat and sort of a brief segway to progress into later portions of the game, and loses it's purpose and function once the teleport ability is acquired.
Date 2019-12-04 Playtime 10h 56m Rec Positive This is definitley a top notch indie game.  It's very reminiscent of the early Metroid games, especially Super Metroid, but it is definitely it's own game.  That said to cover some basics:  Pros: Gameplay Graphics Story Exploration Atmosphere Soundtrack  Cons: Difficulty Keyboard Controls  The graphics are very good for something so simple (just a game made by one man, after all).  It's very atmospheric, with an amazing story and tons to explore.  The music is great, and really fits in.  The difficulty feels a little hit and miss.  It's heavily encouraged to do things hit enemies from behind cover, but if you're out in the open, you die very fast.  You may be dead before you learn about what a new enemy can do, in a few rare cases.  Death is a minor penalty, though, as you only lose your location.  Enemies come back, but any items you got, bosses defeated, etc. are all kept regardless.  The keyboard controls feel awkward, which is easily fixed by setting them to keybindings you feel comfortable with.  Unfortunately, keyboards can't handle that many button presses at once, and this was never addressed.  My only other gripe is a bit minor.  As a programmer, the whole "glitch in real life" thing is pretty silly.  It's like being afraid of badly drawn art, or an engine that squeals once in a while.  I guess plenty of others like that, and there's plenty of these so called "glitched" areas in the game to be found.  Overall, it's a pretty low price compared to many games, so I'd suggest giving it a go.  Just be ready to die a few times while adjusting to new mechanics, and remember that death is a minor issue in this game, and you'll be good.
Date 2019-12-02 Playtime 17h 22m Rec Positive very enjoyable Metroidvania. diverse choice for weaponry and the tunes are very catchy. hard to put the controller down.

Date 2019-11-28 Playtime 24h 0m Rec Positive Одна из лучших метроидваний, имеющая свой особый мир, в который хочется возвращаться снова и снова. Особенно радует пиксельная графика, музыка и то, что игру сделал один человек - все это заслуживает высшей оценки.
Date 2019-11-27 Playtime 15h 1m Rec Positive By now everyone's heard the story behind Legend of Zelda.  Miyamoto supposedly wanted to recreate the feeling of exploring the woods near his childhood home.  James Cameron (or so I heard) got the idea for The Terminator from a dream where he saw that image of the metal skeleton slowly rising up from the flames.  Is it completely true?  Who knows.    Authors love to say that kind of stuff in hindsight to make their creations sound more profound and universal.  One thing's for sure, though: really enduring works do tend to come from someplace deeper than just "I wanna sell you a game."  There's usually a reason behind them, something more substantial that the creator is seeing and feeling.  I don't know who came up with Metroid, but I'd be willing to bet there's a story behind that, too.  Back in the day it stood out not only for its mechanics, which were innovative enough that they still bear its name, but because it created a distinct and surprising atmosphere.  You can tell something's up from the first few bars of the theme that plays on the title screen.  Hey, that doesn't sound like a run-of-the-mill space-bounty-hunter-chasing-aliens shoot-em-up, which would have been the natural choice.  It almost sounds like a horror game; and in some ways it is.  Just look at the background.  It ought to be a heroic action scene with Samus firing a laser or something like that, but instead it's a barren landscape under a black expanse of space.  Of course you can read too much into anything, but it's hard not to think that, consciously or unconsciously, there was a method to design choices like this.  All of these elements lend it an unexpected feeling of isolation.  Maybe today it's harder to appreciate the sense of vastness that Metroid communicated in the 8-bit era.    There you were, dropped onto a desolate planet, totally alone.  Nobody to help you; no home base to back you up or brief you on the situation.  Just you, hostile unknown enemies, eerie alien statues, and miles and miles of dark, twisting caverns.  Nothing between you and oblivion but a suit of cold metal armor.  It was all on you to complete your mission and find your way out.  That was all you really needed to know.  Super Metroid may have been a better game in pretty much every way, but it never had quite the same edge.  Then the later games did what sequels always seem to do: over-explain everything and spoil the mystery.    So when I play a tribute-type game like this, it makes me wonder what its author was seeing.  Was he seeing Metroid, or his own creation, unique enough that it can stand on its own?     Well, it's different, that's for sure.  If Metroid took a visceral, horror-type angle, this one's much more cerebral.  It's sort of trippy concept sci-fi; 2001 to Metroid's Alien.  That ends up being both a blessing and a curse.    You start off in pretty much the same place: stuck on a strange planet all by yourself.  Since they're not going for a dark and oppressive atmosphere they have more freedom to go wild with the environments, and they put it to good use.  There's a tremendous amount of variety here for an 8-bit-style game.  You'll explore everything from deep caverns to bizarre outdoor alien vistas.  Vivid colors and crazy visuals are everywhere and really make each section stand out.  It could have degenerated into total chaos, yet there's also a thread of coherence that ties it all together.  The ghost of H.R. Giger does a lot of the heavy lifting on that end.  Despite what I just said up above, on the surface this game actually has more similarities to Alien than Metroid does.  I mean, if you've seen any promotional images, you probably noticed that creepy face which could have been shipped here directly from LV-426.       In general a biomechanical theme runs throughout.  Every zone is filled with weird bubbles and pustules, interwoven with machinery of uncertain origin, glitches in the fabric of reality and pulsating blobs that might be organs but you probably shouldn't touch them to find out.  Not to mention the bosses, which manage to convey menace in their malformed immensity but also a sort of pathos, like each one is lost in a haze of confusion and sadness.  You feel repulsion and pity at the same time.  You might be wondering if there's a point to all this bizarre stuff, and I'm almost certain there is.  See, it has to do with dying, or maybe not; and then being transported to another dimension.  Or was it another timeline?  And then there are these creatures that, uh,  Ok look, I'll level with you: I didn't really understand what it was about.  This guy seems like he had tons of ideas, though, and I'm sure it makes more sense if you play it a few times, or at least if you're better about reading though scattered notes than I am.    This is one of those stories that takes a lot of explaining, and a good chunk of it is done via computer logs hidden all over the place; and even when you do find them, half the time they're written in some kind of alien glyphs.  I assume there's some way to decipher all of these things, but I wasn't going to screw around all day trying to find it so it'll have to remain a mystery.  The part I did catch seemed pretty intriguing, for what it's worth.    As a "Metroidvania," (that's what they call things like this now) the game itself is much more Metroid, in the classic sense, than -vania in the Symphony of the Night sense: non-linear exploration but mostly linear progression for the unlocks, with no real character customization outside of limited weapon choice.  Like I said, there's plenty of variety to explore, but sometimes they're not very clear about where you ought to go next.    Obviously backtracking comes with the territory in these games, but there's a little more here than you bargain for.  Every time you find a new key item it's like you have to scour every corner of the world all over again just to find that one little door you saw yesterday and forgot about.    The weapons arrive with a similar lack of guidance.  They're not always very well differentiated in terms of their roles, and you're sort of left to find your own way there, too; although I feel like a bit of a jerk complaining about details like this considering that one guy built all of this from scratch.  I guess you've got to put it in perspective.  So to answer my own question from way back when, overall this game really does manage to set itself apart in a lot of meaningful ways--the setting, tone, visual theme and nature of the story--while remaining familiar enough to evoke the original.  Above all it's clearly a labor of love and in the end all of the confusing stuff, which might have annoyed me in something less visionary and genuine, ends up being part of the unique charm.  It was a just little surprising that a game that was so well-received actually turned out to be fairly inaccessible on a number of fronts.  So be prepared for that.  There's a awful lot here, but it'll take some patience to get the most out of it.

Date 2019-11-27 Playtime 10h 0m Rec Positive amazing game for metroid fans 
Date 2019-11-27 Playtime 13h 48m Rec Negative Started out strong, but just got boring and the enemies became trolls.
Date 2019-11-24 Playtime 0h 7m Rec Positive This is literally classic Metroid and that's not a bad thing considering Nintendo never does anything new with classic Metroid anymore
Date 2019-11-23 Playtime 11h 35m Rec Positive Amazing game
Date 2019-11-22 Playtime 41h 13m Rec Positive Awesome metroid-esque game.
Date 2019-11-20 Playtime 9h 14m Rec Positive Excelente metroidvania, para mi se inspira mas que nada en la parte de metroid, pero con una originalidad y una cohesion entre las mecanicas y la narrativa, muy buena. No quiero spoilear las habilidades y armas que llegas a tener pero para que te hagas una idea, una de las primeras es un rayo que glichea a los enemigos y arregla errores que puedas encontrar en el mapa, como te quedas cx. La narrativa para mi fue muy compleja y entendi muy poco, pero toca todos los topicos del sifi y queda bien parado, algo que no cualquiera puede decir. Los puntos malos que le encuentro, es que el viaje rapido es limitado y a vecez es un poco pesado ir de punta a punta de zona, pero no es nada grave, y los jefes son muy sencillos. Un metroidvania muy recomendado.
Date 2019-11-20 Playtime 0h 29m Rec Positive Love the atmosphere and colours. Nice platforming action too
Date 2019-11-19 Playtime 12h 5m Rec Positive I love the oldschool style of this game, it reminds me of NES games at their best :)

Date 2019-11-17 Playtime 16h 23m Rec Positive Classic NES-style metroidvania.
Date 2019-11-17 Playtime 41h 48m Rec Positive Die Ähnlichkeit zu Super Metroid gefällt mir sehr an diesem Spiel
Date 2019-11-17 Playtime 19h 24m Rec Positive This game is sweet. The whole thing done by one person...crazy. Awesome work. I would just like to add that this game is one of the best metroidvanias out there.
Date 2019-11-16 Playtime 13h 16m Rec Positive Fun Gameplay and awesome aesthetics.
Date 2019-11-16 Playtime 17h 24m Rec Positive Pretty good Metroid clone. A little easy in parts.
Date 2019-11-15 Playtime 9h 27m Rec Negative Honestly, most of the game isnt that bad. There's enough weapon variety and map and enemy variety that exploring the map, finding new upgrades and weapons wasnt that bad.  The bad thing about this game (besides getting lost cuz u dont know where the next way to progress is), are the bosses.  90% of the bosses in the game had some very easy way to cheese. I wasnt even looking for a way to cheese but stuff like safe spots where u can poke away at a boss's hp and ur immune to every attack, or simply crouch shooting and never being in danger to an attack like maybe 1 of the bosses was challenging, i didnt die to any others, not cuz i was good, but cuz it was just very hard to die once u figure out where the safe spots are. If u like the exploration, get it. But personally, a metroidvania without any challenging bosses just feels very lackluster, and after finishing my first playthrough i really dont want to do a second one.  tl;dr : good game, horrible boss fights
Date 2019-11-14 Playtime 17h 54m Rec Positive Pour fan de Metroidvania ! Peu gourmand, difficulté bien dosée ; j'y ai joué avec un guide/walkthrough, car trop perdu parfois.
Date 2019-11-14 Playtime 19h 33m Rec Positive a yyyrbyyyrb rinse repeat to win lvl3 cloak fun
Date 2019-11-13 Playtime 59h 25m Rec Positive TLDR: It's amazing for an indie game, but it's got some minor issues. Likes: The graphical style is fun and exciting and I wish more metroidvania games or even Metroid games were like this. The music and atmosphere give off such a potent "foreign planet" feel. The collectible upgrades are the most unique and most fun I've ever seen in a game like this  and the many weapons make for a varied play style. Lastly, I like the mystery behind the plot and the gradual explanation both overtly and through hidden messages. Dislikes: The combat is a bit lackluster. Most small fry are easy to handle, but random enemies and bad placement can make them absolutely brutal. I can't tell you how many times I was stuck debating progressing with the risk of dying or retreating to heal at a save point, both of which could be huge wastes of time. The bosses should be the toughest things, but they didn't pose any threat, especially when I had 100% items. The ending of the game was interesting with a bit of confusion left over, but it honestly feels like nothing was really accomplished. Probably my biggest complaint was that there is little help in making sure you can find all the items. Outside of a map marker that says when you've cleared an entire area, I have no clue where some of the most deviously hidden items are. On the same note the "secret world" areas were what I was most excited about, but I never got to reach a single one, even after walking the entire map with a guide for an hour. Either I was dealt a save file with none or there wasn't enough indication to get me on the right track.
Date 2019-11-12 Playtime 15h 29m Rec Positive Sehr schön gemachter Metroidvania-Titel mit genretypisch langen Laufwegen im weiteren Verlauf des Spiels. Tiefergehende Story muss vom Spieler selbst zusammengefügt werden. Das Spiel schenkt sie einem nicht. Der Soundtrack unterstreicht passend die Atmosphäre. Grafik angenehm zweckdienlich.  Wenn man das Genre mag, sollte man zugreifen.
Date 2019-11-12 Playtime 13h 16m Rec Positive it's awesome. Buy it1
Date 2019-11-11 Playtime 39h 41m Rec Positive this game is fascinating. the story works on some hard wired and ethereal shared neural highway. it spoke to something in my dna. i could not get enough of the lore. it also confused me as to how this was the creation of one individual. it was hard to understand how the scope of this games creation from inception to conclusion could be handled by just one person. and that really added to the experience for me. what the game lacked in robustness from a team effort it made up in curiosity about the mind behind the ordeal. my hats off to the gentleman. the game is damn good not even considering all that.
Date 2019-11-10 Playtime 7h 42m Rec Positive Althoug this game looks good, having cool music, interesting enemy and character design and fun to use items and weapons it didn´t got me hooked as much as I hoped. The world and in general the map are structured in an strange way, completly confusing you at times, leaving you without any clues where to go, what to do next or even worse in what area you are. And that is the biggest problem with Axiom Verge, althoug a Metroidvania should get you lost and believe me  it is one of the best feelings while playing such games. However you  are only able to enjoy this by having a living and intreaging world that impresses with looks and feels unique and good. The world design of Axiom Verge is unique but far from good. Another problem are the completly boring and repetetive bossfights, however they at least look cool. The story on another side is interesting, keeping you wondering what has happend to the games strange alien world. It isn´t a perfect game, but it can be fun, so besides the issues I still recommend it to every Metroidvania fan that wants to play something new. 6/10
Date 2019-11-09 Playtime 14h 27m Rec Positive Axiom Verge borrows its visual style from Metroid 1, but its exploration mechanics are modernized so that you don't get lost in the same confused walking-for-hours way. The placement of obstacles you can't overcome until you get another powerup leaves big ugly holes in your map, and getting back to cover them is as cathartic for your sense of neatness as it is genius level design. Most weapons are optional and has no progression utility, letting you stick with your favorite gun instead of having to constantly switch to blast blocks. The game being set inside a digital world that can be corrupted and hacked creates a lot of new ways to solve problems, and a lot of the new powerups you get felt completely unexpected for a Metroid veteran such as myself. The fact that it's all made by just 1 guy is even more amazing.
Date 2019-11-09 Playtime 15h 37m Rec Positive New skin on old-fashioned Metroid gameplay. Next to no guidance on where to go next, just contextual clues and constantly increasing movement capabilities. Wonderful music. A million secrets, that are common enough that you find a lot, but hidden enough that you feel clever for finding them. The story is ambiguous, but compelling.  You'll be dying for a sequel the moment you finish.
Date 2019-11-09 Playtime 3h 49m Rec Positive Neat Metroidvania game.
Date 2019-11-07 Playtime 10h 54m Rec Positive 爆発事故に巻き込まれた主人公が目を覚ますと、H・R・ギーガーが6日で作ったような悪夢のSF惑星にワープしていた。恐らくヒロイン枠と思われる超巨大ロボから「要するにメトロイドヴァニアですよ」と説明を受け（意訳）、怪物たちをなぎ倒しながら物語の謎を探っていく。  良くも悪くも典型的なジャンルゲームで、敵を倒しながら前へと進み、怪奇なデザインのボスを倒し、新しい能力を手に入れて、新しい道を開拓して…といったことが好きな方にはお薦めできる。こう書くと「任天堂がスチームにいないからって、亜流的なものでセコく稼いでるだけでしょ？」と思われるかもしれない。実際私も最初はそう思っていた。しかしマップが広がっていくとともに、物語の謎も次第に明らかになっていく仕掛けがゲームとして上手く噛み合っており、「いやいや、まさかそんな…！」とかつぶやいてるうちに一周クリアしてしまった。
Date 2019-11-06 Playtime 16h 16m Rec Positive Exploration, discovery, this is an excellent Metroidvania that has an interesting story element as well. All the elements work well together
Date 2019-11-05 Playtime 13h 21m Rec Positive This game is amazing. Just go on and play already. I could tell you about why I love the graphics or gameplay, but let's not drag this out any longer: grab a controller. Do it.
Date 2019-11-05 Playtime 15h 7m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an astounding Metroid style game that I could hardly bare to put down from start to finish. Initially it strongly resembles Super Metroid but drip feeds new mechanics and weapons into the gameplay until the end is a truly unique experience. The games story, art style, and soundtrack are all fantastic and rarely ever felt out of place or exhausted. I really cant recommend enough for fans of Metroid style games.
Date 2019-11-04 Playtime 40h 18m Rec Positive Eu achei esse jogo simplesmente incrível!!!! Ele tem uma forte e clara expiração em Metroid  É um jogo retro com uma pixel arte muito refinada Ele inova em muitas coisas  História muito boa Recomendo muito é um dos melhores indies que já joguei
Date 2019-11-03 Playtime 14h 32m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania. Instant fun, great levels and interesting story
Date 2019-11-03 Playtime 110h 48m Rec Positive Bought this game after watching the gameplay and listening to the music. Bought it again for a handheld gaming console. Redeemed it for free in [b]another[/b] store, just for fun. Would 100% buy it again to gift it to my friend.  I'm not into metroids, but this is a game I like: it's neither easy nor hard, you can play it the way you like, and thus you're gonna have [b]your own[/b] experience.  Have fun!
Date 2019-11-03 Playtime 38h 7m Rec Positive an amazing metroidvania with a fascinating and engaging sci-fi story; satisfying movement, combat, and exploration; beautiful pixel art; and wonderful, atmospheric music. an absolutely amazing feat, being created by a single developer.
Date 2019-11-03 Playtime 34h 14m Rec Positive Otimo Metroidvania! Lembra demais Metroid
Date 2019-11-02 Playtime 8h 30m Rec Negative It's a very blatant Super Metroid clone. Not bad, but it's not that great either. I give it a "meh" score, so if you're a metroidvania addict, you'll probably like it. If you're not, keep looking.
Date 2019-11-02 Playtime 15h 38m Rec Positive As a huge fan of the Metroidvania genre, I'm hard pressed to say that this game is a masterpiece. I wasn't sure if the world would be able to live up to Super Metroid standards, but the entire layout of the game is mind boggling good. There are moments that I either just sit, stunned at the sheer genius, or just keep blasting through the game, barely able to comprehend my own ability to navigate the masterfully crafted world and find all the optional items that I do. Please, for the love of god, if you have any amount of intellect, play this game.  Edit: After completing the game and witnessing the moving conclusion to the story and fantastically exciting final boss, I learned that this game was made by one man. I have decided that this game might be the greatest game of all time.
Date 2019-11-02 Playtime 15h 0m Rec Positive I really like the atmosphere and gameplay.
Date 2019-11-01 Playtime 2h 31m Rec Positive La verdad que no le dediqué muchas horas, y aun así me lo pasé en grande. Me parece un juegazo, y pienso rejugarlo cuando tenga más tiempo. Gran MetroidVania.
Date 2019-10-31 Playtime 70h 16m Rec Positive Absolutely essential game for any serious metroidvania fan. I wish it were longer and more challenging, but that's not really important. It's extraordinarily well done, interesting, and fun. Plus it's the first game I've ever played that let me fire diagonally while crouching and moving. I've wanted that feature since 1996.
Date 2019-10-31 Playtime 14h 17m Rec Positive Love these types of action platformer games. Enjoyable gameplay and fun visuals.
Date 2019-10-28 Playtime 17h 23m Rec Positive Finally got around to finishing this game and it was quite good. The music, art, and mechanics of the game were very enjoyable through the play-through I did. I'm happy I took the time to play through this after I lost my previous save to a computer crash as the time was still well spent in my eyes.  Pick this up if you like Metroid style games with a great soundtrack.
Date 2019-10-26 Playtime 5h 56m Rec Positive Good design with a little difficulty. But I enjoy the process to adapt this difficulty.
Date 2019-10-26 Playtime 1h 6m Rec Positive Metroid ,  Time Spinners , Axiom verge , signs of life , Sundered   names are enough to say everything.
Date 2019-10-26 Playtime 18h 42m Rec Positive I absolutely love this game.  Soundtrack, story, and gameplay are all top notch.
Date 2019-10-20 Playtime 16h 33m Rec Positive One of the Best.
Date 2019-10-16 Playtime 11h 22m Rec Positive If you like metroid, get this game. Axiom Verge has great guns, nice progression, amazing soundtrack and a decent story line. Jumping mechanic is a little bit clunky so is the grappling gun but you get used to them. My only negative comment about this game was literally the grappling gun so its an overall great game and definitely worth the price .
Date 2019-10-14 Playtime 1h 54m Rec Positive A pretty interesting game so far. The gameplay is fluid and I am intrigued to see how the story will progress. It reminds me a lot of the Metroid games.
Date 2019-10-08 Playtime 0h 23m Rec Negative Bad controls scheme
Date 2019-10-08 Playtime 29h 15m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a tough call, to be honest, when it comes to the usually simple question of "Thumbs up, or thumbs down?" I think I'm going to give it a tentative, reserved thumbs up, for a number of reasons:  It's a pretty well-designed game, with good variety to its enemies, environments, weapons, music and so on and so forth. Very retro NES stylings, and the difficulty also makes me think of that general type of game. A lot of jumping, shooting, and some very fiddly platforming, swinging, precision gizmo usage game mechanics. It can be challenging to the point of frustration, certainly. Anyone who finds double-tap key/gamepad input uncomfortable or painful will have a bad time; can't recommend this game in such cases.  Through exploration, you can grow stronger, to the point that you won't need to play amazingly well to get through it. Some of said exploration presents the aforementioned fiddly precision stuff, though, which might not be great for novices to platform games. Here lies much of my hesitation, along with rather a lot of blind backtracking and trying to remember where you saw that place or thing that you want to find again once you have a new tool or two. You do have the option to place some map markers, but only while standing in the spot you want to mark.  The game has charm, as small-team or, as in this case, single-developer games often tend to. It has wholeness of tone and vision. That's all worth something.  The price is a bit steep. It's not a super-long game, even with the amount of backtracking you'll need to do just to find the main route through it. If you use a walkthrough any time you're uncertain, you'd probably shave further hours off; consider exploring any promising areas using your latest equipment acquisitions instead, as a more mileage-friendly alternative.  On the topic of price, the game's console release may be related to that. A certain publisher tried to stiff the developer for his share, and this after promising to donate part of their own share of the profits to supply health care needed by said dev's son. While I don't feel pity-purchases would be a good trend to start - we should first and foremost look to improving public health care availability - I do feel compassion-based purchases are allowed, where they make sense to the buyer and give you a positive feeling or two. We all like to remember we're human, right?  So yeah, in summary: The game is good. Great in places. An interesting experience. Some enjoyable tunes to be had. Price is a bit steep, but the dev did a very fine job for a single person, and deserved better than he got. I wish him well; who knows, maybe he'll make another game that will turn out even better. Maybe we can play a part in that.
Date 2019-10-06 Playtime 26h 11m Rec Positive I did a low tech no death hard more time limited run to save time on achievements. Boy was that a bad decision.
Date 2019-10-03 Playtime 23h 59m Rec Negative Daumen runter weil es im Epic Games Store mal Gratis war und es somit ein Schlag ins Gesicht aller ist die sich dieses ''Spiel'' für Geld gekauft haben !  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/NTTEGS]SAY NO TO EPIC GAME STORE![/url]
Date 2019-10-01 Playtime 17h 45m Rec Positive Very good. Nice music, nice pixel graphics, nice gameplay. Only complaint is that there is no fast travel. But it;s still good. I liked it.
Date 2019-09-30 Playtime 39h 11m Rec Positive this is a pretty clever game that takes the idea of a MetroidVania and gives you a little bit more. the story is a little hollow and even the lore digging in game doesn't quite help. i love this game. it gives you a really nice tool box and really grabs you with all the stuff you can do in game. good luck and have a great time with this gem!
Date 2019-09-29 Playtime 8h 51m Rec Negative This is a Metroidvania game focusing more on the "Metroid" rather than the "vania". What that means is that your character focuses on shooting rather than doing melee attacks and the setting is sci-fi rather than medieval fantasy.  What I found interesting in this game is that combat is focused more around tactics rather than good reflexes. Basically, for any enemy, if you're attacking them while trying to dodge their attacks, you're doing it wrong.  You're supposed to kill enemies in a way where they can't counter-attack. For example, enemies' attacks never pierce walls, but some of your weapons do. So it's a good idea to attack enemies through walls. Also, if an enemy can only attack horizontally, then you should attack them vertically, or vice-versa.  In regards to bosses, combat is about having the right tool for the right boss. This game has a lot of different weapons and certain weapons are very effective against certain bosses. Using the right weapon is the difference between a boss fight being fairly easy to borderline infuriating. So it's a good idea to explore around and get new stuff.  While the above is all well and good, the problem is that this game lacks depth. When you use the right tactics and/or right tool, combat becomes far too easy. It's just about aim, shoot, and maybe every so often move around. This is because enemies only have like 1 attack. Even bosses only have like 3 attacks tops. Not only that, but your own character can't do much apart from shooting. There's no double-jump or other evasive abilities, so the enemies' attacks are easy to dodge (i.e. because if they were too complicated, your character wouldn't be able to dodge them). So enemies have few attacks and those attacks are easy to dodge….. That's bad.  This wouldn't be SO bad if the game had a lot of different tactics and tools, but the problem is that it really doesn't. There are maybe like….3 tactics in this game (attack enemies from far away, attack enemies through walls, attack enemies from an angle where they can't counter-attack). While there are a lot of weapons (23), you're probably not going to find them all in one playthrough (unless you use a guide). Unless you cheat, you'll get like 6-10 weapons in a single playthrough. That brings me to my next main gripe.  One of the main characteristics of a Metroidvania game is that you're supposed to explore around and find new stuff. That's often quite fun….. But the developer of this game went a liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittle overboard in hiding this stuff. See, in most Metroidvania games, you know there's an item hidden because you can't MOVE to it (e.g. missing double-jump, swim ability, etc…). Therefore, the map will often by blacked out so you will always know to come back to that area later on. Even in some of the Castlevania games, where you have to hit walls to break them to reveal secrets, you will always know to only hit left and right walls, and only if there's no visible room next to those walls. In this game….. It's not that simple. Sure SOME stuff you get through general movement, but there are also 5 other ways you get them:  	• Drill: You need to be next to a block and drill it to break it. These blocks can look EXACTLY the same as other blocks  	• Drone: You need to shoot out a drone that's smaller than you so that you can fit through tiny spaces. These "tiny spaces" are not always obvious and purposefully difficult to see (i.e. if the room is filled with dark blue blocks that you can't walk through, instead of the tiny space being black like other traversable areas, it will be a slightly less dark blue block that's within all the other dark blue blocks) 	• Glitch gun: You have to use a gun to make platforms/doors/whatever disappear or re-appear. Again, you can only do this in specific places, and it's not always obvious what blocks you're supposed to use the glitch gun on. 	• Glitch Dash: You're supposed to double-tap and "glitch" past walls/ceiling/floors. You can glitch past 3 lines of walls/ceilings/floors. The map will look complete even if you can glitch dash through something. 	• Passcode: You have to input a password in a menu to make an obstacle disappear. First you have to find the password, and let's just say finding the passwords is RIDICULOUS. Just Google it and tell me that the average player would LOGICALLY and NATURALLY figure out that's how you would get the passwords.  Not counting the passcode, because that's next level bullshit itself, there are 4 different ways to uncover secrets. Imagine in every room using 4 different abilities on every block just to discover a secret……This is tedious and boring as hell. If you're the type whose a perfectionist and want to get all the items, if you don't want to go insane, use a guide. HOWEVER, even a guide won't be able to help you for "secret worlds". See, in every playthrough random "secret worlds" are spawned. These worlds are procedurally generated, so the location of these worlds is different for every playthrough. So a guide wouldn't really help…. It seems the developer REALLY wanted you to work for these secrets….. But here's the thing. Playing video games is supposed to be fun, not work -_-.  There's a story, but it's a typical good guy vs. evil guy. The game makes you think there's more to the story. I.e. your allies might actually be bad people and the bad guy might be good. But at best, it's setting up for a sequel. Long story short, you find out that the bad guy committed mass genocide so that he could get access to advanced technology…….yea…… not really much grey area there :P. So at the end of the day, the story is about your character helping aliens kill this genocidal maniac. Not all that interesting.  While this is an OK game, it's seriously hampered by shallow combat and annoying exploration…. You know…. Kinda core mechanics in a Metroidvania game :P.
Date 2019-09-24 Playtime 29h 39m Rec Positive It's one of the best Metroidvania's on Steam, topped only by Hollow Knight. Unlike Hollow Knight, this game has a very strong Metroid vibe.   Axiom has a bit of a cryptic narrative that is not required for enjoying the game, but it's well done and non-intrusive. You can even play on 'speedrun' mode where story elements are removed from the game.   The only weakness are the boss fights, their patterns seem very static and uninteresting. There is one really awesome boss fight that I won't spoil.   The music is amazing.
Date 2019-09-24 Playtime 21h 57m Rec Positive I'd put this game up there with Super Metroid. That's how much I enjoyed it. The mechanics are tight and always fun, the character development (both in terms of skills and story) is excellent, and the ability to customize your play style keeps things exciting. The art style is delightfully varied between areas and reminds me of my favorite games from SNES, and the story is anything but an afterthought. Seriously, this game is worth it if you enjoy Metroidvanias in any way.
Date 2019-09-24 Playtime 17h 12m Rec Positive finally a Metroidvania that actually has the "metroid" part, one of the best sidescrollers i've played in years.
Date 2019-09-21 Playtime 19h 10m Rec Positive Axiom Verge a slightly flawed game, but that said I almost cant put into words how much I enjoyed playing it.  If you are a fan of the original Metroids, this will put a smile on your face.  Playing Axiom Verge I was taken back to second grade playing the original in my buddies living room floor.  The controls are tight, the pixle art is spot on, and the music is energizing if a bit repetitive.  The down sides are that there are too few types of enimies, with most falling into just a couple types.   The writing is not translated well and the story is a little hard to follow.  However, as stated above none of these hurt my enjoyment of the game.  If you like retro metroidvanias do yourself a favor and pick this one up.  If you want a shiny modern game with all the bells and whistles you might be underwhelmed though.
Date 2019-09-18 Playtime 7h 28m Rec Positive Axiom Verge's controls can be a bit complicated, but that's likely to appeal to you if you like picking out the perfect weapon for a job. Overall, it's a good pixely metroidvania, with a smartly packed-together world and some unusual sci-fi story beats.
Date 2019-09-17 Playtime 20h 59m Rec Positive an amazing game, if you like quality.  Must-buy
Date 2019-09-16 Playtime 7h 44m Rec Positive Pretty fun metroid clone. Nice art style, fun equipment and good gameplay. The exploration can be annoying at times. It's easy to get lost/stuck.
Date 2019-09-16 Playtime 26h 27m Rec Positive Excelente Juego!!!..una obra de arte en todo aspecto!...Recomendado cien por ciento
Date 2019-09-10 Playtime 12h 17m Rec Positive Just finished up my first run of Axiom Verge, it was bretty gud. It's very much more metroid than vania, and it does it super well, especially for being made by ONE GUY. The OST, the aesthetic, the story, the movement all felt so good, the world feels handcrafted and it's the PERFECT size to not make backtracking feel like a chore, but to make you pause to consider your movement. Sadly the combat is like 90% facetank the enemy/boss with one particular gun that outclasses all the others on account of it being able to clip through walls and other enemies. Maybe that's different on hard mode, but it made the game feel like such a breeze, not that it stopped me from putting almost 10 hours into my first run. I would say it's worth 20 bucks if you intend to put the time in to find secrets, maybe do a second run or try speed running it, otherwise wait for it on a sale, then it's for sure worth it.
Date 2019-09-09 Playtime 31h 50m Rec Positive As an older gamer who enjoyed Metroid, the look and feel of Axiom Verge hit that nostalgia sweet spot. However, with the flood of sub-par games and manufactured hype these days, I was pretty cynical. Played it safe and picked up Axiom Verge on discount. Bottom line, bloody awesome game, definitely worth the retail price.  Big thanks to the developer. Job well done.
Date 2019-09-09 Playtime 37h 20m Rec Positive This is an excellent metroidvania. I've finished it twice and moving on to a third time now. It's got a really fascinating setting with an interesting story behind it. Many of the weapons are kind of lame but some of them are really impressive. Also tons of secrets, seriously, we're talking doom or metroid 1 style secrets, so be prepared to search really hard for stuff. Lots of fun and easy to sink a lot of time into.
Date 2019-09-08 Playtime 2h 49m Rec Negative Boring
Date 2019-09-06 Playtime 18h 26m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania game
Date 2019-09-04 Playtime 12h 52m Rec Positive Not finished yet (cuz I'm a psychopath achievement hunter maniac :D ) but honestly, this game is a masterpiece! Reminds me of those good old NES games (all thought I was born in the late 90s, always loved this era and I'm still playing them) and especially Metroid. Every single element of the game is well-made and precise. GORGEUS pixel art and AMAZONG soundtrack. Extremely recommended!
Date 2019-09-03 Playtime 12h 40m Rec Positive Just beat this game today. It's extremely good. The end of the game doesn't have a lot of direction, and since the world is kinda huge it makes it hard to find where you need to go, but if you use your map and have some patience it's not so bad. The controls for this game are also somewhat clunky, I never got used to the [spoiler]grapple physics[/spoiler] and hated those the entire time. Those are my only complaints, though; this is otherwise a fantastic game. The music, story, gameplay, world design, and graphics are all great. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes Metroidvania games.   My stats: Difficulty: Normal In game time: 06:05:46 Items: 46% Map: 78% Death Count: 25  EDIT: went back on my save file and got 100% items. Difficulty: Normal In game time: 11:10:27 Items: 100% Map: 100% Death Count: 28
Date 2019-09-02 Playtime 18h 25m Rec Positive Cool music.
Date 2019-08-31 Playtime 15h 39m Rec Positive Best Metroid game in the last ten years.
Date 2019-08-31 Playtime 2h 5m Rec Positive A Slave To It's Conventions.
Date 2019-08-29 Playtime 19h 47m Rec Positive Highly recommended, excellent Metroidvania game! If you enjoy the genre this is a must for you! The Soundtrack is great too!!
Date 2019-08-28 Playtime 10h 43m Rec Negative Had high hopes for this game, it's not bad but it's not good or great either. Played a lot of better metroidvania games, hollow knight and the castlevania series is 100x better. This game doesn't even hold a candle to those.
Date 2019-08-28 Playtime 70h 41m Rec Positive Just play it! you won't regret it! I wish i could play more like this :)
Date 2019-08-25 Playtime 52h 11m Rec Positive In attesa d'una rimpatriata della  mitica Samus Aran, potrete spezzare la  monotonia con questo piccolo capolavoro...pollice in alto...
Date 2019-08-25 Playtime 12h 35m Rec Positive クラシカルなメトロイドヴァニアスタイルのアクションゲーム。 メトロイドが好きな人なら絶対楽しめると思う。
Date 2019-08-22 Playtime 4h 55m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a really solid metroidvania that pays homage to Super Metroid. If your into metroidvanias or a big fan of metroid then you’ll like this.
Date 2019-08-16 Playtime 12h 55m Rec Positive Quick Description: -Axiom Verge is the love letter to Super Metroid that so many of us have been waiting for. Although it's heavily inspired by SM, it has it's own identify and stands tall.  It takes what made SM so great, and expands upon it; adding a boatload of weapons, secrets for days, dynamic bosses, and the sweet sense of exploration that made the original so iconic.  It's not perfect, but it's the closest you will come to a modern day SM.  What's Good: -Axiom Verge's greatest strength is how well rounded it is.  It offers pretty much everything that you would want from a metroidvania.  It has really good combat w/ tons of weapons, there are a plenty of dynamic and interesting bosses, offers a big interconnected world w/ gated abilities, there are secrets for days, the difficulty curve feels just right, and there is some light platforming. -This is a pretty big world to explore w/ plenty of different biomes.  It will take most players at least 10-15 hrs to finish this.  If you are looking to find every secret, then you'll probably need to put in about 20 hrs.  It's damn impressive that this entire game was created by 1 person. -This game sports a solid soundtrack that fits the theme perfectly.  There are plenty of upbeat tempos and others that fill the player w/ dread of what's to come.  Sound effects are also really sharp. -Like SM, AV creates a perfect sense of eeriness and wonder.  You will awaken on a distant planet surrounded by aliens w/ bad intentions.  The early biomes are pretty intimidating b/c you have very few weapons and there isn't a ton of information.  Finding a secret or unlocking an upgrade that allows you access a previously inaccessible area feels awesome. -There are so many different weapons and each one has a very unique feel.  Some are better for long range while others are basically hand cannons designed for up close and personal.  It's really fun finding a new gun and experimenting w/ it.    Could Use Some Changes: -The colors feel a bit bland overall, which can make it difficult to distinguish whether something is a platform or just background more confusing than it should be.   -I wish that you could mark more than two areas on your map b/c theres a ton of backtracking.  I was say that this game lacks a few modern accessibility options that we have grown accustomed to.  -The biomes are a bit too simple w/ few significant landmarks making it difficult to remember where to go and where you have been.  Meaningful visual stimuli or landmarks are really important in metroidvanias w/ a lot of backtracking.  I got lost quite a bit in this one unfortunately.  Thoughts: -Axiom Verge is a well designed and fun metroidvania that pretty much every fan of the genre should play at some point.  I had a hard time deciding exactly what score to give this b/c I'm such a huge fan of Super Metroid, so I naturally really enjoyed my time w/ Axiom Verge.  Even when I put my nostalgia goggles away, this is a really fun game, but isn't as good as the best in the genre.  I think it's falls somewhere in the middle.  Consensus: -Solid Game (Tier 3 and makes up 35% of my reviews).  I had a great time playing this and can't wait to play the sequel.  Axiom Verge 2 came out earlier this year on Epic and will launch on Steam some time in mid 2022.  This is an easy recommendation for any metroidvania fan out there.
Date 2019-08-16 Playtime 14h 21m Rec Positive A game from another world.Great soundtrack, great artwork and great storyline.
Date 2019-08-16 Playtime 16h 20m Rec Positive Замечательная атмосфера!
Date 2019-08-12 Playtime 18h 49m Rec Negative Beautiful storytelling that is revealed to you gradually and depending on your efforts.  Exciting ares to explore, and plenty of secrets & easter eggs!   Controls are okay, but definitely clunky.  Music is alright.  Would have recommended if the control issues were patched.
Date 2019-08-10 Playtime 12h 5m Rec Positive Finally knocked another one off the backlog! For reference, this review is based off of one playthrough. Statistics: [b]Normal difficulty, ~60% items collected, ~80% map completed, 11 hours and 22 deaths (with a few being intentional, trust me).[/b]  [b][u]PRESENTATION:[/u][/b] Does what it sets out to accomplish. There's a sense of authenticity to the retro aesthetic, almost as if the game came from a souped-up NES. The atmosphere hits all the classic sci-fi notes, and it can be genuinely unnerving at times. An underlying "glitch" theme helps set the game apart, but the graphics start to feel a bit samey after a while. The area themes can get repetitive too. But the boss music is a solid banger, and it gets even better when you're nearly dead. Seriously, the beeping noise from low health syncs with whatever song is playing at the moment. Awesome.  [b][u]STORY:[/u][/b] Passable, but a bit underwhelming. The plot sets up intrigue, but there's not a whole lot of it. Instead, I felt like the game often got too carried away in its own lore. I suppose it could be down to personal preference since some people really like digging into this kind of stuff. The protagonist, Trace, was easily the best part. I found him to be very relatable thanks to some great writing. It was always amusing to see him react to his otherworldly surroundings.  [b][u]GAMEPLAY:[/u][/b] It's Metroid for the modern age. Not Metroid[i]vania[/i], just Metroid. It's actually a refreshing change of pace.  If you've ever played Metroid (take another shot), you know what to expect. You explore large areas looking for gear, abilities, and upgrades. Then you use all that stuff to make progress and open up new areas. There's a fair bit of backtracking, and yes, it can be annoying at times. But the game often mitigates this by trapping you in certain areas so that you don't become overwhelmed. Having a good memory and sense of direction is a must, but I wish the game offered more options for note-taking. There's also plenty of secrets, some of which is fairly well-hidden. Poking around everywhere isn't half a bad idea.  What really makes Axiom Verge great is the tools you're given. I won't spoil anything, but most of upgrades in this game are extremely unique and cool. The best ones have functions in both exploration and combat. Speaking of combat, you're given a standard rifle to start with. Throughout the game, you'll be able to find new and varied shot types to spice things up, Some are a lot more useful than others, and the default shot alone can get the job done about half the time. But you've still got a versatile loadout to play around with, and I found myself frequently switching shot types depending on the situation.  There's a few boss battles too. It's mostly a test of trial and error: bosses become very easy once you know their weak spots and the best weapon to use. They still manage to be satisfying for the most part, although the final boss is a bit of a clusterf**k.  [b][u]EXTRAS:[/u][/b] Mainly two things: a Hard difficulty and a speedrun mode. Although I haven't tried it, the hard mode doesn't seem very appealing to me. I thought the Normal difficulty was just fine; Hard might end up making the game more tedious if anything. I'm not a speedrunner either, but the speedrun mode seems to be fully fleshed out with quality-of-life features and leaderboard support. I'm sure lots of people will appreciate this. For me, I was satisfied with just one playthrough of beating the final boss, no more.  [b][u]FINAL VERDICT:[/u][/b] If you're an old-school Metroid fan, this game is made for you. You need to buy it. Even though I'm mostly only familiar with the [i]-vania[/i] side of Metroidvania, I still had a good time. If you actively dislike these kinds of games, I'm not sure Axiom Verge will do much to sway you.  Regardless, this is a very well-crafted game. It pays a lot of respect to its inspiration while also bringing creative new ideas of its own to the table. Give it a shot.  10 – Nearly Flawless  9 – Fantastic  [b][u]8 – Great[/u][/b]  7 – Good  6 – Above Average  5 – Average  4 – Below Average  3 – Bad  2 – Terrible  1 – Worthless
Date 2019-08-08 Playtime 14h 34m Rec Positive Really good metroid like 9/10 , Maybe an Axiom Verge 2 ? Because the story was really nice !  The game in hard mode was really insane.  If you want to done all achievement, Thanks to SirTapTap for his work.  
Date 2019-08-05 Playtime 4h 47m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a metroidvania whose quality adjoins the games from which the genre germinated.  Full review at [url=http://www.geeksundergrace.com/gaming/review-axiom-verge-pc/]Geeks Under Grace[/url]   
Date 2019-08-05 Playtime 13h 25m Rec Positive This is a great game that really scratches the classic Metroid itch.  Highly recommend if you are a fan of the genre.
Date 2019-08-05 Playtime 11h 1m Rec Positive As good as classic metroid although the story it gives is somewhat subpar. 3/5
Date 2019-08-04 Playtime 19h 30m Rec Positive Nintendo как всегда молодцы, не подвели! Этот новый Metroid просто супер!!!
Date 2019-08-03 Playtime 34h 37m Rec Positive Top Spiel! Wer Metroidvania mag wird AV lieben. Eines der wenigen Spiele, was ich mal wieder durchgespielt habe.
Date 2019-08-01 Playtime 20h 15m Rec Positive Can I have your email address? I'm very interested in this two-dimensional game. I want to talk to you about it.My email is 13795985188@163.com
Date 2019-07-31 Playtime 60h 8m Rec Positive My first introduction to Metroid-Vania style games and I couldn't have been taken on a better ride, very well made in all aspects, blown away by the fact this was made by one person... truly a lot of love was put into this game.
Date 2019-07-30 Playtime 0h 46m Rec Positive Me gustan los plataformeros y metroidvanias, pero no enganché con este juego, aún así le dejo el positivo.
Date 2019-07-28 Playtime 28h 28m Rec Positive Generales: Es un juego estilo metroid, eso es lo que me llamo la atención. Cuando lo comencé a jugar pude ver la inspiración de la cual está hecho este juego.  Jugabilidad: Estilo run and gun, estilo metroid, con bastante exploración. Es un plataforma-aventura de disparo. La progresión del personaje está muy bien trabajada, vas mejorando la vida, el ataque del disparo, el alcance del disparo, los estilos de disparos (tipos de armas), son muy variadas y algunos ítems que te permitirán llegar a zonas que antes no eran accesibles. También en algún momento te dan un dron que lo usaras y será muy útil y hasta determinante en tu aventura. El juego es exigente, pero no llega a ser difícil, ya que te va dado poco a poco las herramientas para pasarlo, si no exploras las armas adecuadas y no subes tu vida o mejoras de disparos, te será muy difícil pero si avanzas explorado, si estarán las cosas más equilibradas. Los jefes si son duros, debes elaborar una estrategia de ataque y revisar sus patrones para salir victorioso, ellos y en general el juego no son un paseo, tiene su nivel, sin llegar a ser difícil. Duración: Unas 20 horas, dándote tu buena exploración.  Música: Es buena, no llega a ser una obra maestra, pero cumple con su cometido de meterte en el mundo que estas explorando. Gráficos: de la vieja escuela, son gráficos retro del típico juego plataformas-aventura.  Juego 100% recomendable. Saludos. 
Date 2019-07-25 Playtime 12h 17m Rec Positive i have no idea where to fucking go  so i have fun exploring this world and every little corner of it  best played w/o a guide of any sort aka the best way to play every game  edit: there's a randomizer beta and i tried it and got stuck lmao
Date 2019-07-25 Playtime 10h 37m Rec Positive 目前看收集已经完成了一半，大概六个小时。 和《超级银河战士》有极大相似之处，除了游戏类型和大量探索，《公理边缘》的8bit画风，还挺阴森诡异的音乐，包括操作比如45度锁定射击，钩锁，三叉炮，太像了。玩过2d银河战士的同好能很快上手这款游戏的操作。  较超银好的地方，故事和直白的引导做的更好一些；武器很多，可能有二三十个，够炫不过太多用不太上，可能就打boss的时候需要特殊枪的技巧其它时候还是初始枪好用。  不足的地方，之前说直白的引导做的好，这样的引导让前半部分游戏成了线性的，没有自由探索的空间。在路上会遇到阻碍需要得到能力，碍于障碍看上去很普通不能留下影响，回头的时候不好找。  7.5/10 如果之后能走着走着不自觉回到起点那游戏还能加一分
Date 2019-07-25 Playtime 34h 22m Rec Positive 10/10
Date 2019-07-23 Playtime 7h 7m Rec Positive Properly made old school game - wish he'd do another and show some of these more recent pretenders how it's truly done :)
Date 2019-07-23 Playtime 11h 19m Rec Positive Great metroidvania
Date 2019-07-21 Playtime 28h 3m Rec Negative Je m'attendais à mieux. Je me suis fait un peu chier tout au long de l'aventure. Gros bémol pour la DA, sans déconner les tableaux sont pas tops quoi. On peut faire de chouette truc  en pixel art mais là, c'est d'un basique. Je suis déçu. Des bisous.
Date 2019-07-21 Playtime 16h 8m Rec Positive Excellent Metroid style game. Great graphics and level design, brilliant story and an exceptional soundtrack. Worth every penny.
Date 2019-07-20 Playtime 22h 40m Rec Positive Generally a very good game, but sometimes challenging.
Date 2019-07-20 Playtime 8h 34m Rec Positive One of my personal favorite entries in the Metroidvania genre of games. Axiom Verge takes heavy influence from the Metroid franchise, but in a respectful way while having its own charm and identity. The controls are tight, backtracking doesn't feel tedious, and the upgrades are some of the most unique I've ever seen in this kind of game. Very well done.  Also, those red bubbles are the digital equivalent of bubble wrap. I could shoot that stuff for an entire afternoon and not get bored.
Date 2019-07-20 Playtime 14h 42m Rec Positive Axiom Verge plays with the Metroidvania genre in ways completely unique to it. The Gigeresque imagery and tone of the game work incredibly well into its mechanics, and the game has a good amount of length to it; everything about this game meshes perfectly together, from its mechanics to its story and music. The world is incredibly fascinating to explore. 8/10.  The boss fights are unfortunately quite dull, the only blemish on the experience.
Date 2019-07-17 Playtime 24h 13m Rec Positive This story was so compelling, it kept me up at night for weeks...damn you Athetos!
Date 2019-07-17 Playtime 2h 53m Rec Negative + Graphics and other aesthetics - Enemies - Abilities - Shooting isn't fun - Map is hard to navigate  2/5
Date 2019-07-16 Playtime 13h 22m Rec Positive Excellent metroidvania with a kickass soundtrack that really makes the bass in my subwoofer bump. Great homage to Metroid with fun gameplay and a ton of unlockables. Well worth the money.
Date 2019-07-16 Playtime 1h 4m Rec Positive I am only one hour in but this is just as good as Super Metroid maybe even better dare i say.  
Date 2019-07-15 Playtime 10h 26m Rec Positive A love story to Metroid from which is borrows its mechanics and aesthetics from.  The game applies very heavily toward the platforming aspect which pretty much requires the use of a controller to pass the more difficult platforming sections without becoming to the point of frustrating.  It helps that the save points are always close by making it easy to pick up and down whenever a section has been completed.  With any metroidvania game, there is a bit of backtracking. The backtracking is fluid and there is a use of a transit hub which makes it easy to get into other sections without the laborious retreading ground over and over again.  The background aesthetics are varied as much as they could be based on 16-bit look.   Buy this game if you are into a 16-bit Metroidvania (more on the Metroid side) and a free weekend. 
Date 2019-07-15 Playtime 15h 31m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a beautiful metroidvania game with a thought-provoking plot. The game took me about 15 hours to beat, but would take longer for a completionist playthrough. My review will cover four facets of the game: its aesthetics, gameplay, plot, and puzzles.  The graphics and soundtrack to Axiom Verge are both top-tier. Each sub-area of the map has its own distinct artistic style and musical theme. Axiom Verge is the most aesthetic game that I have ever played.  The gameplay is solid, and what you would expect from a metroidvania. There's quite a lot of enemy and weapon variety (although I generally stuck to only a couple of the weapons). The difficulty rises at a slow and steady rate over the course of the game, and I think the Normal difficulty, which is what I played on, was generally good at being challenging but not frustrating. One (small) complaint that I have is that the bosses seem uninspired compared to most of the other enemies- each boss seems to have been designed with its own 'trick' in mind, and once you figure out the trick, beating the boss is simple and somewhat bland.  Axiom Verge's plot was more complex than that of most games, and touches on interesting ethical questions. You have to pay close attention to all the dialogue in the game, as well as read the notes scattered throughout the map, to figure out what's going on. But the game encodes some of the notes in alien text, for which you need to find translator devices to decode. I never found a single translator, which is probably why I found the plot somewhat mystifying. I'll need to watch a YouTube video or two to fully understand the plot. This isn't necessarily a flaw of the game, but it's an element of its design that some may not enjoy.  Finally, the game has what I would describe as 'puzzles.' Several times throughout the game, you will need to wander throughout the map trying to figure out where you're meant to go next. None of these progression points are declared to you, and a couple of them are actually hidden. The designer's decision to occasionally hide the pathway to progression is, in my opinion, poor design, and is my only real complaint about the game.  I highly recommend Axiom Verge if you enjoy solid metroidvania gameplay, stunning graphics, mesmerizing soundtracks, and engaging plots.
Date 2019-07-14 Playtime 9h 6m Rec Positive One of the better Metroidvanias I've played in a long time.
Date 2019-07-13 Playtime 17h 30m Rec Positive A really fun metroidvania that has a pretty decent story, the weapons are neat and the bosses are really well designed, my only gripe is there are no indicators telling you if you're in a room with an item
Date 2019-07-12 Playtime 17h 10m Rec Positive Un splendide hommage aux Metroids 2D.
Date 2019-07-12 Playtime 8h 46m Rec Negative This game is unplayable on a Macbook Pro. I sit on the laptop, clutching controller. No game. We have better games in the future.
Date 2019-07-10 Playtime 9h 17m Rec Negative The story is amazing and reminded me of Bioshock and System Shock because there was no handholding and you had to collect notes to learn everything about the world; moreover, the cyclic nature of the narrative was amazing. However, what undid the game for me was the level design, music and art style.  Regarding level design, it sometimes seems too arbitrary or even repetitive. The backgound often merges with the foreground and you have trouble telling them apart. Also, the "hidden secrets" are scarce and random, you will sometimes see an open crevice or something that holds an item only to find a dead end, but further in the game the same crevice may hold a secret. There is also virtually no way of telling which tiles are breakable or not, you just have to randomly jump at every corner scanning and drilling  because you have no idea if it can be broken. There is no way of differentiating anything. The enemy design is terrible, the bosses and the Rusalki look amazing, but the random enemies in each level seem like living household items, you will often find yoursell calling it "it", because there's no way of describing anything.  The music is memorable in the sense that you won't forget how bad it is. Each level has a horrid soundtrack with terrible synth, and the ones that have "vocals" are just unbearable (I'm looking at you, Kur).   The art style is heavily inspired by Geiger's work, however, this is only in some places. The color palette chosen for some levels is unbearable and tasteless, sometimes I would have to stop playing because of the eyesore. There are several textures that are way too dark and can't even be seen properly.  This game takes a lot from Metroid in gameplay, but it doesn't make the cut. I truly wish this didn't have a planned sequel, because it doesn't deserve so. I congratulate Thomas on doing this by himself, but to me, this is just a regrettable purchase, being a Metroid/Castlevania fan, this just breaks me. Again, a lot of praise to the story, beautifully written and mysterious, the gameplay, however, broke all the immersion for me.
Date 2019-07-10 Playtime 7h 13m Rec Negative I bought this game on sale for 10 dollars.  Despite clear indications that this game was made with alot of love and heart for the original Metroid on NES, said game simply does not hold up very well.    The enemies are bullet sponges (particularly near the end).  The platforming is annoying.  The use of the "glitch gun" is tedious.  The weapons are forgettable.  Most of the bosses are a joke.  And lastly, although the graphical style attempts to be interesting, each area design ends up looking very homogeneous.  Because of this, I would only recommend a purchase at a price point of 5 USD or below.
Date 2019-07-09 Playtime 6h 59m Rec Positive Must-play if you like Metroidvanias.
Date 2019-07-09 Playtime 1h 12m Rec Negative Xbox One controller non-functional. Crashes on startup more than half the time.
Date 2019-07-08 Playtime 17h 11m Rec Positive Hehahaaha, scratch that super metroid itch
Date 2019-07-08 Playtime 103h 55m Rec Positive If you love Metroid, you'll ADORE this game.  It's hard to cover all the details about why Axiom Verge is great, but I'll try to boil it down to the main points.  First, the gameplay.  Without that, you don't have much of a metroidvania game.  Lots of weapons, secrets all over the place, labyrinthine layout, escalating difficulty (both enemies and puzzles), tricky bosses, multi-tiered stunts that require control mastery.  This game has it all.  The time it will take to master Axiom Verge is more than worth its time and price investment.  Next, the graphics.  It "looks" very much like a Metroid game, despite not being a Metroid game.  If that is something you enjoy, great.  If not, well, the graphics might be off-putting due to pixel art.  Still, there is nothing wrong with the cohesion brought by simplicity.  Jumps don't need to be pixel-perfect, hitboxes are sensible, pacing is just right, and nothing about the animation and speed of enemies in the game seems "cheap" at normal difficulty.  Hard difficulty is another matter, but what do you expect.  Next, the story.  The art fits perfectly with the story, which is about as mysterious as it comes.  The plot is very "meta" like what you find in a novel by William Gibson or Philip K. Dic.  (Note:  misspelled because Steam censors certain words even if they're just names).  What is especially cute about the story is that it tries to offer a real-world explanation for why pixelated "glitches" might occur right before your eyes.  Or something close to that.  Surreal is kind of the name of the game for this title.  Finally, the nice touches.  This game has lots of them, even going as far as exploring the concept of Metroid "secret glitch worlds" and the original 8-bit title's password system.  And I can't do justice to all the others.  Recommended?  Oh yeah.
Date 2019-07-07 Playtime 22h 37m Rec Positive Это восхитительно! Вначале показалось что скучно и однообразно, графика показалась совсем слабая, но пройдя тройку боссов и получив очень необычные способности геймплей полностью изменился, стало действительно интересно играть и собирать по крупицам информацию о "крошащемся мире". Игре получается приятно удивлять а это лучшее что может дать игра в море графически навороченных но скучных, однообразных, коммерческих "супер"выкидышей. Большое спасибо Tomas Happ за Axiom Verge, такую игру осилить в одиночку, это просто невероятно!
Date 2019-07-07 Playtime 0h 54m Rec Negative Progress feels very slow, many artificial slowdowns. Hot Steam, duck and cover enemies and stuff like that. You get many powerups very quickly but they are all very situational and switching between them slows you down even more. In addition to that the level design gives you the permanent "did I miss anything?" anxiety while pidgeonholing you into specific parts, feels very weird.  Story intrigued me immediately but is delivered in snippets. Typical "go figure out why you are doing this" kinda flow. Weapons are changed with a circle menu on right thumbstuck - I would have preferred a button to cycle through them to change more dynamically.
Date 2019-07-07 Playtime 30h 31m Rec Positive Absolutely fantastic and amazingly well-done Metroid-like Metroidvania.  So much of that isolated alien atmosphere.  Tremendously good soundrack.  Great game.
Date 2019-07-07 Playtime 5h 39m Rec Positive Потрясающая игра. Мрачная атмосфера, местами даже немного пугающие локации, интересный сюжет. Игра отлично передает атмосферу одиночества главного героя и безысходность него  положения. Я очень рекомендую эту игру.
Date 2019-07-07 Playtime 16h 36m Rec Positive Хотите вспомнить ваши лихие 2000-ые годы? Эта игра для вас.
Date 2019-07-07 Playtime 11h 38m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a great game. I liked the various weapons and the tools you get and how they were utilized to defeat enemies or transverse through the map. There is a good amount of exploration in this game with the different upgrades and abilities you can find. I also really enjoyed the bosses, some of them were quite challenging and unique. If you enjoy Metroidvania type games I would recommend this one.
Date 2019-07-07 Playtime 2h 29m Rec Positive Блин... Ну я хрен знает... Выбирая из двух стульев, я таки рекомендую игру, хотя у меня она вызвала смешанные эмоции, и, скорее, не понравилась. Тут отдана весомая дань уважения классическому Метроиду, приятный пиксельарт ( особенно, если рассматривать боссов ), классная музыка, и интригующий сюжет. Но при этом у неё местами проглядываются проблемы с геймдизайном ( из-за чего, порой, не ясно, куда идти ), локации не особо интересны в плане визуала, и каких-то деталей, и при всей достаточно высокой динамике ( если, как и я, находить усилители достаточно часто ), то сложно составляет только поиск всяких секретов в стенах, да геймдизайнерские просчёты, вроде не обязательных обширных и не простых локаций, в которые ты полез только потому, что больше некуда, и не понятно, куда тебе, в итоге, идти, поскольку вернуться на прежние уровни ты не можешь ( хоть в лепешку разбейся, а не допрыгиваешь, хотя у тебя увеличенный прыжок, а закинутый жучок встречает преграду, через которую не может пройти ). Вот и думай, что делать.  Но, не смотря на мою финальную гневную тираду, у меня рука не поднимается поставить игре "не рекомендую", поскольку я вижу, что в неё была вложена уйма стараний, и энтузиазма. Пусть я и оформил рефанд, из-за того, что для меня она скучна, это не значит, что и для вас она будет такой же.
Date 2019-07-07 Playtime 32h 54m Rec Positive Great game. It's like an H.R. Geiger baby from Contra and Metroid
Date 2019-07-06 Playtime 1h 1m Rec Positive Fun little game with some great retro vibes.
Date 2019-07-06 Playtime 27h 58m Rec Negative If you're looking for metroidvanias in general then this one is good but not great and there are better options available, but if you're searching for a METROIDvania then this is pretty good (because most metroidvanias seem to emphasize the "vania" part).  Axiom Verge differs from other popular metroidvanias in that it has an emphasis on: ranged weapons, weapon variety, backtracking, retro graphics, sci-fi, and checking every single block with your latest traversal item. If those things appeal to you then Axiom Verge might be the best option for you.  On the other hand... The boss fights weren't very interesting. Some of the backtracking is very poorly telegraphed so you get a new traversal item and just kind of have to wander around until you enter the right room and remember seeing the relevant thing that you saw hours ago (and one of the traversal items involves noticing single block differences). Also the end of the story is a bit unsatisfying.  So if you really want to play something like Metroid or Super Metroid and *only* metroid (no -vania allowed) then this is kinda the only option (Cave Story+ uses ranged weapons but has low variety and minimal backtracking, most other options prefer melee). But if you're looking for a quality metroidvania in general then there's a plethora of other options like Cave Story+, Momodora, Ori, Hollow Knight, Salt & Sanctuary, and even Rabi-Ribi, and Touhou Luna Nights.  Overall I can't generally recommend this good but not great game when there are such great alternatives.
Date 2019-07-06 Playtime 39h 6m Rec Positive Love it.  Totally worth the price.
Date 2019-07-06 Playtime 11h 43m Rec Positive A great metroidvania style game more in the vein of Metroid than the vania part. So it takes it's time giving you upgrades to your main weapon for better killing power or just traversing the levels in front of you. Some of which end up huge stretches that is fun to explore.  Ordinary combat isn't much to talk about, you run and gun enemies. I like the addition of stationary aiming though you can do that while running, it's difficult to pull off right. Boss encounters are greatly fun and I love the feeling you get when you beat a particularly difficult one.   The story takes its time as you traverse alien landscapes with an equally out there soundtrack going on in the background as you realise what's going on with the pieces given to you. It's an out there story fitting with how alien the rest of it feels.
Date 2019-07-06 Playtime 14h 51m Rec Positive As a metroidvania style game this is game is excellent.  This really took me back to the days of playing the original Metroid. I really liked the weapons and the bosses and how the game progresses. If you’re looking to play a really good homage to Metroid, I highly recommend it. 
Date 2019-07-06 Playtime 17h 55m Rec Positive Great game, wish there were more games like it.
Date 2019-07-05 Playtime 21h 31m Rec Positive Extremely fun Metroidvania. Very impressive that it was all made by 1 guy. Probably coulda used less weapons or a way to change which are bound to keys. Definitely recommended though
Date 2019-07-05 Playtime 4h 40m Rec Positive I recommend this game. 10/10
Date 2019-07-05 Playtime 6h 8m Rec Positive Nice addition to the genre, doesn't miss out on any fronts, worth it I'd say.
Date 2019-07-05 Playtime 12h 12m Rec Positive Great looking pixel art, loads of unlockables, excellent atmosphere. This game has all the makings of an awesome metroidvania game. There are a few cons that are pretty inherent to the genre, such as lots of backtracking, and progression can be unclear in some parts of the game. It can be confusing if you've set the game down for a while and decide to pick it up again.  All in all, if you are a fan of the metrodivania genre this is a must-have.
Date 2019-07-05 Playtime 12h 18m Rec Positive An excellent metroidvania heavily inspired by Super Metroid, playing this was a great blend of nostalgia and originality. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys metroidvanias or who wants a taste of the genre.
Date 2019-07-04 Playtime 11h 33m Rec Positive A love letter to Metroid. Cool exploration, hidden secrets, creepy atmosphere and an awesome soundtrack
Date 2019-07-04 Playtime 3h 21m Rec Positive The closest I've ever come to playing Super Metroid without an emulator since I am NOT about to go digging through decades of storage to find my SNES.  The game thus far is pretty good and handles very well.  There are a variety of weapons, some of which I have no idea when they'd be useful (yes, I'm looking at YOU, Three-Way Shot), but I'm only a handful of hours in so maybe I'll figure it out later.  There are also a variety of tools, some of which are really neat to use and can even alter enemy behavior which is a refreshing change from "kill it ASAP" and a nod to Metroid's Ice Beam that was used to turn enemy units into stepping stones.  The map is nicely done, in Super Metroid style, and gives you the option of adding notes to rooms for future reference when you need to backtrack.  Oh, my goodness, will you need to backtrack.  In fact, I don't think it's an exaggeration to state that the amount of backtracking in this game outstrips any Metroid game I've ever played; but it doesn't feel terrible.  Just go into this game fully expecting that several rooms in the starting zone are not meant for you to get through initially.  So far the game is a lot of fun to play and easily worth the purchase.  I got it during the Summer Sale and suspect I might have shortchanged the developer.  If you like metroidvanias, then definitely get this game.
Date 2019-07-04 Playtime 41h 13m Rec Positive This game really reminds me of when i was a kid playing Super Metroid, but still feels like a fresh new game.
Date 2019-07-04 Playtime 49h 7m Rec Positive Really enjoyed this game.  Can't believe it was developed by a single person.  Incredible homage to Metroid.
Date 2019-07-04 Playtime 7h 55m Rec Positive This game is great. I love the atmosphere the world it has built. The game play is amazing and just the right amount of hard. I really need to try to finish it.
Date 2019-07-04 Playtime 23h 58m Rec Positive 기괴한 컨샙의 게임 분위기에 감탄하고, 메트로이드 느낌을 잘 살린 게임성에 더 감탄했다.
Date 2019-07-03 Playtime 42h 33m Rec Positive Excellent metroidvania.
Date 2019-07-03 Playtime 8h 47m Rec Positive cool
Date 2019-07-03 Playtime 6h 51m Rec Positive pretty sweet
Date 2019-07-03 Playtime 15h 23m Rec Positive Este juego se nota que esta mas basada en los juegos de Metroid en si que en el consecuente genero de Metroidvania, que añade algunos puntos a favor como el sentimiento de soledad en un sitio desconocido que es uno de los identificadores la saga, y reste juego lo logra replicar bien gracias a su ambientación y a su soundtrack.  El sistema de combate es bueno y ir explorando y acabando con los enemigos es satisfactorio, sobretodo porque hay maneras distintas de acabar con los diferentes tipos de enemigos y unas son mas eficientes que otras.  Uno de los puntos malos que tiene es el soundtrack, que si bien cumple su objetivo no sobresale en ningún punto. No recuerdo ninguna canción de ninguna parte del juego.  Otro de los puntos negativos del juego son los jefes que no son retadores, una vez encuentras algún punto debil del bicho (que no es muy dificil de encontrar) lo atacas de la misma forma una y otra vez hasta que cae, cosa extraña porque no es asi con algunos enemigos que rondan por el mapa.  En si es un muy buen juego pero tiene algunos detalles que deslucen el producto final, y si estoy publicando esto por el evento de las ofertas
Date 2019-07-03 Playtime 20h 15m Rec Positive I am a huge fan of the "metroidvania" subgenre and this game hits the nail on the head of the proper way to make on. It has a fascinating story, simple but interesting visuals, creative bosses, a mysterious atmosphere, etc. All in all a magnificent game.
Date 2019-07-03 Playtime 24h 58m Rec Positive This game is fantastic.
Date 2019-07-03 Playtime 25h 9m Rec Positive Excellent metroidvania. I have not seen anything like this in awhile!
Date 2019-07-03 Playtime 31h 31m Rec Positive Great indie game, consider picking up if you like Metroid or Metroidvanias in general.
Date 2019-07-03 Playtime 11h 44m Rec Positive game is amazing! Really feels like playing super metroid with robots.
Date 2019-07-03 Playtime 0h 43m Rec Positive If the devs had only made the soundtrack and not the game itself, I still would have bought it.  10/10 would replay for those sweet synth waves
Date 2019-07-03 Playtime 18h 28m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a pretty standard Metroidvania, with all the trappings that entails: a big branching 2D map, upgrades that let you traverse new areas of that map and find more upgrades, infinite ammo and respawning enemies, and elaborate boss fights. It does all these things pretty well, although the boss difficulty is aaaaaaaaall over the fucking place, the controls for some mechanics can be fuck-y, and there are way more weapons than you actually need (especially considering the motherfucking Kilver is the fourth one you find)—besides that, though, it's a fun challenge to traverse everything and figure out where you need to go next, the various abilities are integrated really well, and the difficulty ramps up pretty smoothly. The gameplay is quite solid overall, and the game's worth buying just for that.  The game's presentation is where things get more interesting. It goes for this overwhelming sense of alien, you-don't-belong-here otherness, in both music and visual aesthetics, that makes for a really great horrific atmosphere—reminds me of the best parts of Aliens vs. Predator (the 1999 one). It's just stark, oppressive, and vaguely hostile; you get the sense that the basic environment loathes your presence and wants you out as soon as possible. All of this is rendered in quite solid pixel art (which veers into gorgeous for the bigger setpieces) and a sort of 80s retro effect that occasionally enhances the feeling of alien-ness. The story doesn't quite manage to capitalize on this wonderful atmosphere, however. It's both pointlessly complex and confusing, and conveyed by offputtingly basic prose; it also just kinda ends after the final boss fight, with very little sense of accomplishment and a lot of plot threads left dangling, in favor of a sort-of gotcha ending that isn't at all a satisfying conclusion to the past several hours of game. It's a shame, but ultimately you can just ignore the text dumps and luxuriate in the gameplay and atmosphere. I recommend the game on those strong points; they make it very much worth a purchase.
Date 2019-07-03 Playtime 14h 41m Rec Positive i really recommend this game if you're into metroid, it definitely has the feel of super metroid but has a lot of interesting upgrade ideas that help it feel separate
Date 2019-07-02 Playtime 17h 10m Rec Positive It's good, buy it.
Date 2019-07-02 Playtime 167h 38m Rec Positive It's good.
Date 2019-07-02 Playtime 10h 6m Rec Positive Very reminiscent of the old Metroid games.  Very well made and fun.
Date 2019-07-02 Playtime 14h 37m Rec Positive A great Metroidvania
Date 2019-07-02 Playtime 38h 41m Rec Positive if you like games you'll like this
Date 2019-07-02 Playtime 15h 40m Rec Positive The game plays like old Metroid with polished controls and fun weapons.
Date 2019-07-02 Playtime 26h 17m Rec Positive Overall an amazing metroidvania with solid roots in super metroid and other games of the sort. The story is absolutely amazing and also mind bending in some areas but it's an absolute blast to play through and there are TONS of secrets to find.
Date 2019-07-01 Playtime 69h 2m Rec Positive This was a fun game with cool story.  This was the first metroidvania I've played, and now I want to play more of them like Hollow knight.  Thank you dev.
Date 2019-07-01 Playtime 6h 35m Rec Positive Good game
Date 2019-07-01 Playtime 10h 3m Rec Positive Very Metroid. Will play again and again.
Date 2019-07-01 Playtime 10h 4m Rec Positive si te gusto super metroid este te va a encantar
Date 2019-07-01 Playtime 16h 44m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvania games ever made
Date 2019-07-01 Playtime 5h 12m Rec Positive If you like Super Metroid, this is for you.
Date 2019-07-01 Playtime 15h 46m Rec Positive I don't even know where to begin with this review... This game is close to perfect.  The controls are tight, and the level design makes full use of the Metroid-style run and gun gameplay with the "classic" lock to aim button. I've played plenty of Metroid-clones and MetroidVanias, but none have ever come close to the level of utility and uniqueness that this game has with the mix of weapons and power-ups that you get along the way. They feel gratifying to use right, but the game knows how to punish you for taking weapons for granted. It forces you to shake things up every now and then. The music is so well composed and really merges modern day effects on 8-bit generated music. Everything sets it's own atmosphere perfectly and it keeps the tension flowing, even when it's just an empty corridor. The visuals are basic in the best way possible. It makes the tight and fast combat easy to keep tack of, and doesn't come across as cluttered or overcrowded. The enemies are other-worldly, yet easily recognizable. [spoiler] The head and body of Ophelia still have me drooling over how awesome the gothic-mech mashup works, especially in the later half of the game... [/spoiler] Best of all, the "address" mechanic of glitching and rearranging the world around you is so well implemented, and made me want to smear my characters face against every wall and shoot everything to find the secret worlds. Glitching enemies makes them behave differently, adding a new tier of combat to the standard run-and-shoot... My only downside to this game is that every so often you'll come across a room that just decides to make your day worse. The difficulty can ramp really fast and drop just as quickly between some rooms, and it really tested my patience with a few vertical platforming rooms that were full of laser-shooting enemies.  Outside of the occasional difficulty spike, I thoroughly recommend this game.
Date 2019-07-01 Playtime 25h 44m Rec Positive This game is pure gem considering it was made by one person. One of the best metroidvania games with full fan service, excellent soundtrack and solid story of Trace. This one is not to miss for metroidvania fan.
Date 2019-07-01 Playtime 17h 44m Rec Positive For someone who was late to this little gem, must say it's absolutely stellar. if you haven't already, give it a shot.
Date 2019-07-01 Playtime 52h 10m Rec Positive Great music, Great game. Good replay value, although sometimes it seems a little hard to figure out where to go next.
Date 2019-07-01 Playtime 15h 32m Rec Positive A good metroidvania. Impressive that the whole thing was developed by only one man. The soundtrack can get grating at points and the color pallete can get sickly repetative, but other than that it's a very solid metroidvania.
Date 2019-06-30 Playtime 32h 36m Rec Positive Fantastic metroid-esque platformer. With very tight controls.
Date 2019-06-30 Playtime 24h 40m Rec Positive This remained on my backburner for too long, so this review is likely to be too late. But I'm finding this game a small love letter to Metroid. Starting from its setting, down to the general design and gameplay, it reminds me a lot of the original Famicom gem.
Date 2019-06-30 Playtime 19h 9m Rec Positive A really well done metroidvania, had a great time playing it. Hopping that we get a sequel of some kind, Id like to see more set in that universe.
Date 2019-06-30 Playtime 19h 49m Rec Positive A polished and earnest homage to the 8 and 16-bit platformers of yesteryear. Well worth the price.
Date 2019-06-30 Playtime 9h 23m Rec Positive pew pew pew
Date 2019-06-30 Playtime 18h 28m Rec Positive Very good Metroid-like game.
Date 2019-06-30 Playtime 29h 47m Rec Positive Sehr gutes Spiel.
Date 2019-06-30 Playtime 26h 30m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvanias out there
Date 2019-06-30 Playtime 4h 29m Rec Positive Commander Cody, the time has come, execute order sixty-six.  Good Game
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 2h 40m Rec Positive Excelent nostaligc yet actual game! the music is great, and much fun to play.
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 30h 53m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvanias, if you like the original Metroid 2d games. The feeling is very close to a real Metroid, and so is the atmosphere and the graphics. The soundtrack and effects are pretty good. The combat is also similiar to Metroid, with a bunch of different Weapons and gadgets to collect.  The game's biggest weakness is it's hard-to-understand story, but personally, I think that is not the main draw of a Metroidvania anyways. Give it a try, if you like Metroid.
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 12h 57m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an absolutely amazing metroidvania. Everything about the game is absolutely top notch.  The game's clearly heavily inspired by the Metroid part of Metroidvania. The graphics look quite retro, with more modern particles and effects thrown in. The exploration is very satisfying. I feel the game gives the player enough hints through the landscape and items, that you never really feel completely lost.  Personally, my favorite part of the game is the upgrades. There are some REALLY interesting mechanics that I haven't seen too often. Most upgrades feel unique and novel, while there's a few that are pretty standard fare for a metroidvania. I'm as thrilled with the weapons. Each of them is unique, but there's an awful lot of them. You'll probably tend to stick with 3 or 4 main ones and the rest will just sort of go unused.  The bosses are fun to fight and challenging. I also love how the boss slowly gets redder as you do damage to it. Basic enemies are pretty neat too. One of the upgrades you get allows you to play with the enemies behaviors, and that just unlocks even more possibilities for dealing with them.  Overall, Axiom Verge is probably one of my favorite modern metroidvania. If you're a fan of Metroidvanias, I think you'll almost certainly enjoy this one.
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 33h 49m Rec Positive Very well made metroidvania with an outstanding soundtrack.
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 16h 41m Rec Positive Muito bom, deveria ter uma continuacão por que merece, espero que saia um dia o 2 dele
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 18h 37m Rec Positive A great metroidvania, must play if you're a fan of the genre
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 21h 27m Rec Positive 虽然是几年前的游戏，但是玩起来还是有点欲罢不能。武器感觉有点过多，常用的也就几个。开图、解密靠自己是真的很难100%，通一遍可能没心情再玩一遍了。
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 32h 52m Rec Positive Dobra gra z ciekawą fabułą.
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 15h 0m Rec Positive Ottimo Metroidvania, tanti oggetti da trovare, potenziamenti da sbloccare e tante armi diverse utili in molte occasioni diverse
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 44h 14m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an old-school metroidvania with some new ideas. Being a one-developer project, it has a strong individual style, but also some rough edges.  The game has very good art design and music - the world really feels strange and alien. It also has some fresh mechanics mixed in with the usual metroidvania fare, like remote-controlled drones and phasing through walls. Gameplay is simple but solid, with a few exceptions like the thankfully seldom-used grappling hook. Also very speedrun-friendly, if that is your thing.  Axiom Verge is not without some flaws though. Bosses, while impressive to look at, are very one-dimensional. Of the huge arsenal of guns, very few are as good as the one you start with. Sound design is unimpressive, in contrast with the music.  Despite its flaws, I would definitely recommend the game to any metroidvania fans.
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 6h 56m Rec Positive Thomas Happ, tek başına Nintendo’nun yapamadığını yapıyor. Axiom Verge ve Super Metroid arasında bir seçim yapamayacağınıza bahse girerim.
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 11h 22m Rec Positive Одна из лучших метройдвайний десятилетия!
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 15h 46m Rec Positive Good Soundtrack Good Gameplay  Do I need to say more?
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 16h 57m Rec Positive Не метроид, но метроид )
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 14h 6m Rec Positive While I have played other metroidvania games over the years that are amazing in their own ways (Hollow Knight, Bloodstained, Mummy Demastered), Axiom Verge stands out as my favorite by far. It encapsulates what I enjoyed from playing Metroid Fusion / Zero Mission as a kid. Axiom Verge's isolating alien world is masterfully presented through the game's visuals, gameplay and soundtrack (which I still listen to often), being soley developed by Thomas Happ.  While I wholeheartedly love this game, there are a few things to note:  - This game is a bit stripped back in terms of skill based upgrades (lack of a shinespark or walljump to name a few), but makes up for it with its own unique abilities, along with a hefty arsenal of gun types to discover.  - My first playthrough where I "100%ed" the game took me about 12 hours over the course of a week while on winter break. Replacing the tricky shinespark puzzles are now archaic password codes that are not only tricky to figure out, but you also have to find the specific room to use it in. A bit of a step backwards imo.    - Some sounds in this game are extremely hard on the ears, those being enemy screeches and the defection noise. This is a bit jarring especially during some boss fights, where the blood pumping music is drowned out by annoying defect sounds.  - There is a Hard Mode and Speedrun Mode for subsequent playthroughs, but I personally haven't touched them yet.  -Game Maker's Toolkit has an introspective video on Axiom Verge which piqued my interest for the game in the first place: https://youtu.be/ZGWHxQ2WcBE
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 15h 33m Rec Positive Un muy buen metroid con una muy mala historia
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 36h 12m Rec Positive I am not far into it yet, but if the term metroidvanian means anything good to you, odds are you will like this. Especially if you are a fan of the old 2d metroid games. This game just scratches all the right itches for me.
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 32h 23m Rec Positive 9.5/10.  Almost as good as Super Metroid.  Almost.
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 9h 14m Rec Negative The best description I would use to describe this game would be missing the point of what the Metroid games great. It has quite a beautiful artstyle and downright amazing pixel art, but the Metroidvania part of the experience is where everything falls apart for me. It's starts off pretty well with the player slowly getting some upgrades and even killing a boss, but the health distribution and enemy attacks are pure horseshit. You would have to go through an entire boss fight that has multiple phase without healing AT ALL. This just creates a frustrating mess for the player that I even dropped the game when I encountered possibly the worst boss I ever had the displeasure in fighting. Overall not a great experience for me.
Date 2019-06-29 Playtime 43h 9m Rec Positive Brings back the 2D Metroid feel that I've come to love for a long time.
Date 2019-06-27 Playtime 42h 19m Rec Positive Uno de los mejores 5 metroidvania que puedes encontrar fuera de los ya consabidos Metroid y Castlevanias. Música ochentera brutal, una muy buena historia y ambientación (de las mejores en este tipo de juegos), final bosses brutales todos ellos, y a excepción de alguna cosa (prefiero las mejoras de arma de Metroid a multitud de armas, algunas de las cuáles ni siquiera usé), me ha parecido un grandisimo juego, un must have para todo aquel que le gusten las aventuras y juegos con sabor añejo. 9/10
Date 2019-06-26 Playtime 16h 53m Rec Positive 10/10 So far, this is amazing.  Exactly what it should be.
Date 2019-06-24 Playtime 20h 54m Rec Negative i  played this game when it released for free on the epic games store - even though i already purchased it here, and because i played that other version of the game my gameplay might seem incredibly short for someone to write a review about a game. however, i did finish and eventually even 100% the game after almost 14 hours. and while i played axiom verge to the very end of its campaign, and collected all the items, saw the entire map - i honestly don't believe that the 14 hours i put into this game was worth it.  in all honesty, the only thing i thought axiom verge did right was gameplay, and even then it was shaky at best. this game was addicting for me but for very little reason beyond the exploration and the combat. weapons can be extremely creative in how they're presented and how they attack the enemies, even though there's no visible reward for fighting any of the enemies that you find beyond getting further a little faster. if you can enjoy a game for just its gameplay, and metroidvanias, then i can certainly recommend this to you. but in my own opinion, the rest of the game is just too unbearable, and not memorable in the slightest.  combat is interesting, but bosses most certainly are not. they're slow, boring, and often too easy or too hard. bosses also have specific soft spots where they are vulnerable, which was fine except for the fact that they were not telegraphed to the player in any way. i was incredibly stumped on the second boss until i looked up that it was only vulnerable in its bulging yellow sacs, and by then it was a piece of cake. the final boss is so easy that i found myself ignoring the robots he summoned and just going for the weak point without caring for the other enemies. in comparison, the wasp boss in edin is so outrageously impossible to hit that it essentially requires the voranj gun in order to beat.  my other major gripe were the collectibles, which were interesting at first and awful by the endgame when i tried to find them all. i had to resort to a guide to find some of them - which were hidden behind fake walls, behind rock that didn't look drillable but in fact was, or in some remote depths of a cavern that was three hundred feet in the air. it was contrived and boring at best, and i had no idea how one person was supposed to be able to find them all on their own.  but in all honestly, where axiom verge fell flat the most was in its story, which made the experience worse from the very beginning. not only is the plot generic and uninteresting, the dialogue made it difficult for me to relate to the protagonist, who honestly sounded like a 80-year old white man stuck in, clearly, another dimension. plot twists were incredibly easy to guess, and when the antagonist finally revealed what awful crimes he had committed, i actually felt myself sympathizing with him, especially since at that point i found trace to be so annoying as a character.  tldr; good gameplay, bad collecitbles and story. worth it if narratives aren't important to you in video games, most likely on a sale.
Date 2019-06-23 Playtime 7h 45m Rec Positive This is not the level of metroid. It's much simplier. But! This game is created by one person in any way of it game tries to look not like metroid with using of basic mechanics. Weapon circle, grapple, teleport and so on. It's much different from metroid in the way how you play. Great story. Phantastic visual.
Date 2019-06-23 Playtime 1h 31m Rec Positive Best Metroid/Metroid-inspired game since Metroid Prime. Can't wait to see what secrets lie as I climb deeper.
Date 2019-06-22 Playtime 20h 12m Rec Positive A 2d sidescrolling metroidvania, very clearly on the Metroid side of things. Explore an alien world, collect weapons and tools, the usual.  It's really hard to find a flaw here. If anything I guess it would be the characterization of the player-character. It's a very nearly perfect game, a worthy successor to Super Metroid and a masterpiece in its own right.
Date 2019-06-14 Playtime 1h 33m Rec Positive Fantastic game, I got it for free from the Epic store and plan to buy it on the switch to support the devs! Awesome soundtrack and some of the best exploring and game mechanics I have experienced in any platform/metroidvania game. Some of the bosses can be annoying, but which game with bosses are actually fun other than Mario games? 9/10 +1 fun factor :)
Date 2019-06-14 Playtime 8h 41m Rec Positive A very strange platform game, not really scary but has its creepy moments. The ambiance, the creatures. Interestingly, the gameplay seems to be close to Metroid. Its a really nice touch. Small issue here is keyboard is little more complicated to play, mainly because of the option menu when you try to change control setting. Using the controller is much more easier to understand. I recommend it because overall its a interesting game.
Date 2019-06-12 Playtime 12h 34m Rec Positive Good game but a bit overrated.
Date 2019-06-08 Playtime 19h 59m Rec Positive Один из лучших клонов Metroid, когда-либо сделанных. Отличный левел дизайн, отличное управление, отличная музыка, тонны секретов и бэктрекинга, да ещё и сама история интересная, хоть и заканчивается клиффхэнгером; в общем, всё как положено.  P.S. Если для вас это не первая игра в жанре и вы собираетесь собирать по пути максимальное количество айтемов - играйте на харде, иначе под конец будет совсем просто.
Date 2019-06-07 Playtime 14h 30m Rec Positive One of the best "metroidvanias" on the PC. Great map design, good gameplay and an intriguing story. Highly recomended.
Date 2019-06-06 Playtime 5h 14m Rec Negative it's meh.  decent.  love that it's made by one guy,.... nostalgic... good sound. story is ok. the weapons imaginative. if you like metroid... old style... this rocks. if not... this sucks.  i hated metroid.... sooo this didn't do it for me.
Date 2019-06-05 Playtime 7h 33m Rec Positive De Metroid 5 todat Nintendo die eindelijk maakt. Vreemd, desoriënterend en toch ergens vertrouwd.
Date 2019-06-05 Playtime 19h 35m Rec Negative i keep trying to finish this game and keep getting bored of it towards the end. the controls are annoying and  it just isn't very compelling.
Date 2019-06-05 Playtime 32h 14m Rec Positive As far as gameplay this is one of the best metroidvania's I've played: the controls are good, the world is well put together. Plenty of backtracking, but the backtracking isn't annoying, and the weapons are differentiated and imaginative. The story is even well-written and engaging--if you manage to discover all the hidden story pieces. The graphics are perfectly out of NES (with a cheat cartridge for glitching). Also, movement through the game was  perfect with various upgrades allowing jumps, grappling, glitching through walls and even use of a remote drone. The coolest thing was the way you could combine these together to do even more amazing things.  The biggest problem is that the environment isn't immersive. The story is that I went to an alien world and now I'm exploring. Another World and Waking Mars both did this very well. But here, as soon as I come, I'm asked to kill certain things, and my character does so without any hesitation. I feel no sense of surprise or anything. Just one second a scientist, now I'm a soldier... no problem. It felt way more like a plot thrown on to make the game work. But the funny thing is, the plot is great. But it only gets to you through notes strewn about. So it feels like the game maker and the writer worked at separate times vs a strong unified whole.  Boss progression and design was mixed. in the beginning, it was awesome--bosses were challenging but manageable and got harder in proportion to my progression. Then, boom, the final bosses are insane--unless you pick up a hidden flamethrower, and then you can just kind of stand there and waste them. So either insane or simple.  Overall, this is definitely a must buy. So many things were done really well, and anyone making a modern metroidvania should definitely start here. But... it could have been so much more if they had made the game more immersive. Given that the introduction was almost identical to Another World, I think they had that idea in mind, but it just didn't feel that way. And even the amazing plot with possible twists was hampered by the fact that you had to recover a bunch of hidden items to really even get the most basic elements.
Date 2019-05-30 Playtime 12h 22m Rec Positive Un métroivania dans le haut du panier. Tout est fait avec amour, la musique, le level design, les graphismes, l'histoire. L'arsenal est très varié et la difficulté est croissante. Petit bémol sur les boss fight qui ne sont pas inoubliables.
Date 2019-05-25 Playtime 3h 18m Rec Negative Axiom Verge's main issue is one that was also present in the original Metroid: Its presentation is not good. At all.  The areas are just the blandest things imaginable, the music can become ear-grating at times, and the environments don't make sense. The story is also a problem. It is the most confusing thing I have ever seen. As a result of that, I found myself skipping through the story segments, and the game started making even less sense to me.  Overall, would not recommend. Maybe to someone that's the number 1 fan of metroidvanias, but not to the general public.
Date 2019-05-21 Playtime 13h 50m Rec Negative this game is pretty much super metroid minus the metroid skin, and made by someone who has a deep passion for the game they made.   however it's not a game with much replay value, it's very much a one and done for me, no matter how amazing the artwork can be, it's another  "retro nostalgic" game, good music, good  graphics won't save a game that's overall boring. get it on sale, it's worth at least one playthrough if you're a diehard metroid fan, otherwise, just pass, save yourself some money.
Date 2019-05-20 Playtime 2h 10m Rec Positive Good game ,but we need Chinese~
Date 2019-05-17 Playtime 36h 21m Rec Positive Really pulled me in like back when i played through super Metroid a total of 6 times.
Date 2019-05-17 Playtime 30h 51m Rec Positive Nice game, but too difficult for me. Note that you'll definitely need a controller, but not the xbox 360 one: even if it's by large the most used controller on steam and the controls themselves are re-mappable, it's just not good for this game, you need a quality d-pad. Same with the steam controller, you need a true, precise, nintendo-like d-pad.
Date 2019-05-09 Playtime 10h 6m Rec Negative Uma merda, o cara ficou tão focado nos cenários (que são esplêndidos, por sinal) que esqueceu que tinha que inserir uma história, uma personalidade pro protagonista e uma trilha sonora adequada. Sem falar nos chefões ridiculamente fáceis, eu só precisava ficar parado e atirando noooossa, que desafiante!
Date 2019-05-09 Playtime 70h 34m Rec Positive BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!
Date 2019-05-05 Playtime 7h 14m Rec Positive Хорошая игра, очень похожа на Super Metroid на Super Nintendo.
Date 2019-04-30 Playtime 10h 31m Rec Positive Best Metroid game I've played in years.
Date 2019-04-25 Playtime 11h 4m Rec Positive In a sea of hollow surface-level Metroidvania aspirants, Axiom Verge is a flawed gem that shines alongside the unfortunately small handful of games made by people who actually understand the appeal of Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night.  +Visual style and enemy designs are excellent +Tangible, effective sense of progression and empowerment +Abilities do more for you than just give you access to new areas +Advanced movement is inventive and satisfying to master +The game's fragmented lore is fantastic...  -...But the story itself doesn't hit the same beats and ends with an anti-climactic whimper -Trace is just not a very interesting protagonist -The 20+ unique weapons, while fun to play with, are not well balanced; only a few are actually worth using -Enemy AI, including that of the bosses, is generally shoddy and easily cheesable -The audio is not easy on the ears; the loud and thumpy soundtrack goes from 0 to 11 depending on the area you're in and the "impenetrable" sound effect in particular is maddening  It might not achieve the full scope of its own ambition but what Axiom Verge does accomplish lets it stand shoulder to shoulder with other genre indie classics like Hollow Knight and Guacamelee. I'm excited to see what Thomas Happ makes next. Buy this game on sale, do yourself a favor and tweak the audio a little bit and you're in for a good time.
Date 2019-04-24 Playtime 41h 3m Rec Positive This game is stroking Super Metroid so hard it's not even funny. It's flippin' great! You will have to THINK to beat this game, and then you will realize how much you missed, and you'll go back through to try to find everything. The platforming and puzzles are great, the cyber theme is unique, and the game is really trippy. The game looks a little buggy at times, but it's intentional. This game played flawlessly on my PC. Support the one-man developer and buy this thing!
Date 2019-04-23 Playtime 15h 38m Rec Positive unbelievably good. Wish I could find more titles like this, but part of what makes it so good is that there is nothing quite like it  EDIT:   Beat this game months ago and literally still can't find anything like it. The messenger might be the closest thing, but it doesn't have the punch that axiom verge does.
Date 2019-04-23 Playtime 31h 3m Rec Positive Axiom Verge made me think on how I suck for Metroidvanias and how much I suck at dodging bullets, gave me headache and I got depressed, 9/10 a lot of guns and really fun game, love all the mechanics.
Date 2019-04-23 Playtime 5h 27m Rec Positive It's a good game. Didn't personally like it enough to finish it but I definitely recommend it to anyone who thinks it looks good. Because it basically is as good as it looks.
Date 2019-04-22 Playtime 18h 19m Rec Positive Puntos Positivos +Buen Gameplay +Buena Dificultad +Buena Historia +Buenos Secretos +Dura minimo 20 horas si quieres sacar el 100% con todo y logros +Buen Soundtrack +Mas de 15 armas diferentes. (En total son 22 si no estoy mal pero solo puedes conseguir 20 ya que las otras 2 son aleatorias y cambiara dependiendo de la partida) Spoiler +Mundos secretos valen la pena buscarlos +Te hace rejugarlo para probar las armas que te hacen falta (2 si fuiste al mundo secreto de nivel dificil y conseguiste el arma de esa partida) +Secretos,Tiene muchos y referencias y son muy buenos.  Puntos Negativos -Duracion el juego sin completarlo al 100% dura como unas 3 horas o 4 y eso que si no exploras y vas directo a la mision principal -Armas, Hay 22 armas pero de esas 22,18-14  son buenas y las otras simplemente se quedan atras por el poco daño. -Tal vez un modo facil aunque es inecesario puesto que la dificultad lo hace mucho mas entretenido  Conclusion:El juego es exelente y solo le rebusco puntos negativos puesto que el juego es muy completo y no tiene casi puntos negativos,Realmente puedes jugarlo y no darte cuenta de los puntos negativos que mencione, Tal vez el de las armas pero dependiendo de cuales consigas no notaras la diferencia puesto que *SPOILER* la mayoria de armas hacen el daño que deberian hacer y estan balanceadas almenos que spamees con el lanzallamas y lo hayas conseguido puesto que necesitas un codigo para conseguirlo.
Date 2019-04-22 Playtime 1h 54m Rec Negative In 1989, I would have given [i]Axiom Verge[/i] the highest praise I could bestow upon any game. I would have proudly raised it upon my shoulders and hailed it as the coming of a new age for video games. I would have climbed the highest tower in the land to joyously proclaim forth the glory of this divine product that would surely shape a new era for society.  At least, I might have.  It’s hard for me to tell, you see, because the year is not 1989, and it wasn’t when [i]Axiom Verge[/i] came out in 2015, either. The reason I mention this is because for all the incredibly detailed pixel art and indie charm, [i]Axiom Verge[/i] plays in essentially the same way as any of the early Metroidvania titles. It acknowledges none of the mechanical advances that have taken place in the decades following the genre’s inception. It lacks the creativity and punchy controls of [i]Guacamelee[/i], doesn’t even approach the replay value of [i]Rogue Legacy[/i], and ultimately fails to offer anything new or interesting that you couldn’t have had on your NES back in the old days.  For those of you who are just looking to go back and have a [i]Metroid[/i] flashback then this is exactly the title for you. It does nothing to differentiate itself from Samus Aran’s early adventures, so if that series’ contemporary entries have you left you wanting then go forth and have fun! But if what you seek is something more modern, something that takes the retro aesthetic but leaves the retro design and controls, you might want to pass up on [i]Axiom Verge[/i] and slide your cute little self into something that plants itself more firmly in Camp Modernised Tribute than Camp Carbon Copy.
Date 2019-04-19 Playtime 22h 58m Rec Positive Wer Metroidvania mag, wird dieses Game Lieben! Es ist Bockschwer, es gibt einen Haufenweise Upgrades & Waffen. Vom klassischen Highjump über nen Enterhaken,  (der sich nicht wirklich leicht handhaben lässt,) über Mutationen ist alles (naja fast alles) dabei. Waffen, Tazer, Splittergranaten, Laser alles was das Herz begehrt, aber das war noch nicht alles! Ein Laserbohrer, ein Hackingtool das Gegnermanipulation ermöglicht, Drohnen,  und die Möglichkeit durch Wände zu glitchen runden die ganze Sache ab. Ach ja und der Soundtrack kann sich natürlich auch sehen hm ich meine hören lassen... Ihr werdet sterben... mehrfach! Viel Spass!    
Date 2019-04-15 Playtime 25h 49m Rec Positive Very nicely done game that feels so much like Super Metroid, yet adds lots of fresh ideas that keep it from feeling like another rehash of the same ol' thing.
Date 2019-04-14 Playtime 12h 14m Rec Positive Axiom Verge é um clone de metroid. Um belo clone de metroid. Com gráficos que celebram a era 16 bits e um design de mapa muito bom, a diversão aqui está de descobrir o que aparecerá na próxima área - que inimigo vai encontrar, que upgrade de armas ou itens vai obter, como vai ser o próximo boss. A ambientação das áreas e o design dos inimigos é muito legal. Tem a quantidade certa de backtracking para um bom metroidvania. Destaque pro design dos Rusalki, na dose certa de assustador e interessante.   Como downsides achei várias das armas do jogo bem ruins, me foquei em usar umas poucas, e algumas vezes no jogo eu fiquei um pouco perdido - fiz jornadas bem longas de backtracking que deram em becos sem saída. A lore do jogo, que você vai destravando achando páginas de diário, é meio confusa.   No mais, ótimo jogo! Recomendo, e vai dar vontade de sair dele e ir direto jogar Metroid!
Date 2019-04-13 Playtime 11h 17m Rec Positive I haven't beat the game yet, but it's already clear that is a very well-designed game. It reveals itself very cleverly and offers a good story with a dark, glitchy, alien atmosphere. Enemies are tough, though not overpowered, and a little thought and strategy is rewarded. The many power-ups feel meaningful and open up new parts of already-visited areas in a satisfying way.  Even the level/room design must have been very thoughtfully considered.  The only criticism I can think of is that the map is pretty big, and it isn't always clear where to go — I had to Google it a couple times to get a nudge in the right direction.  Works perfectly on Logitech F310 gamepad on "D" mode.  I wholly recommend this game.
Date 2019-04-13 Playtime 11h 33m Rec Positive Great homage to the Metroid series with a number of interesting mechanics that make it stand out in it's own.
Date 2019-04-12 Playtime 8h 43m Rec Positive Simply fantastic.
Date 2019-04-12 Playtime 16h 38m Rec Negative This game fails at everything that metroid does well.   Pros: The face guys look neat  Cons:  Horrible story where the main character turns into a wimp who doesn't want to kill anything because killing is bad and yet he kills all these animals and robots that could be sentient yet he doesn't want the big robot faces killed... Not to mention his evil self is trying to save humanity from war, death, famine at the cost of the robot creatures? Yet he is a "selfrightous jerk" according to the main character... Maybe I just didn't understand the crappy story and text that was in some papers I picked up on the way that was in some weird alien text.  Some of the creatures sound like ear rape, don't wear headphones for this.  Bland monotone area after area. Crappy creatures, many that just don't really fit the environment.  Easy boss fights where you just need to stand at a point and shoot. (Last boss fight just switch to the light blue laser that goes through stuff.)  Crappy weapons that don't combine or really hurt the creatures. No auto fire in a game where many of the weapons will take 10 shits to kill a guy and the upgrades hardly help... Having the 12 weapons and yet it stores them on the number keys 1-0, so after you get 10 and collect the 11th and 12th, once you switch off the 11th and 12th there is no way to get back to them... not that I could figure out after mashing every key on my keyboard three different times.  Not quite sure where to go once you get an upgrade because the map is all so boring and monotone it's hard to remember... better put down those markers.  Pain in the butt controls that make moving the guy and firing a chore. Wait till you get the grappling hook and teleport abilities.  Speedrun? There are four other ways you need to travel, and not one is very easy to master... Not to mention, dying lets you keep all the stuff you gained and you just go back to your last save point, which is another way of travel you'd want to plan out... Unless the speedrun doesn't work the same as normal version...  Every power up you get hardly feels like a power up... Wait till you get the item that increases weapon damage/size/range... and you hardly notice a difference... apparently the weapons that aren't projectiles can't get their ranged increased either...   
Date 2019-04-11 Playtime 0h 17m Rec Negative No auto fire? Seriously?
Date 2019-04-08 Playtime 15h 25m Rec Negative Игра хорошая, но зависает на смерть при переключении на другое окно, поэтому играть в нее очень сложно.
Date 2019-04-07 Playtime 11h 12m Rec Positive This in my opinion is the closest game u will get to a metroid like nes game. Just the dark elements, the music, and even the story just sucked me in. Even when I beat the game I wanted to get back in there an go again. Would like to do hard mode or even see how I do on speed run mode.
Date 2019-04-07 Playtime 17h 51m Rec Positive Metroidvania como tem que ser.
Date 2019-04-06 Playtime 17h 50m Rec Positive Tanto di cappello a Thomas Happ. Gioco bello e godibile.  Una discreta trama. Ottima l'ambientazione e le musiche.
Date 2019-04-06 Playtime 14h 19m Rec Positive Wanna go to hell? So/Neither do I! in this game, you are basically in video game hell, but its the type of hell that you go "this is really weird why do i exist".   Really good game 10/10
Date 2019-04-04 Playtime 14h 6m Rec Positive Un juego al estilo de los primeros metroid, con muchas cosas tomadas prestadas de aquellos juegos pero con una identidad propia. Es como jugar el clásico metroid del nes pero con mecánicas mucho mas fluidas y llamativas. Tiene un mapa de un tamaño decente, ni muy extenso ni muy pequeño. A ratos te quedas atascado en ciertas zonas, sin saber que hacer y lo recorrerás varias veces hasta descubrir como avanzar. Los pixel graphics de este juego son maravillosos, muy bien definidos tanto en las diferentes zonas como en los enemigos. Tiene varios jefes pero al principio, varios de ellos se sienten demasiado fáciles. El soundtrack a mi parecer es un poco flojo. No esta mal pero es muy plano y no hay ninguno que sobresalga, que te den ganas de pausar y escucharlo, salvo por el tema de combate contra los jefes (que es el mismo del jefe final, eso es algo desilusionante) En cuanto a la historia, no esta mal pero tampoco es brillante. En general es un gran juego, muy recomendado sobre todo si eres fanático de este tipo juegos.
Date 2019-03-31 Playtime 18h 24m Rec Negative I like the idea behind this game and I really want to love it, but one thing is killing the whole experience. If you are stupid enough, like me, to want to play the game with a game controller - STAY AWAY. STAY FAR, FAR AWAY. The problem is that the developers think it's a clever idea to FORCE you to map every command they have created, to a button of the controller. What's the problem you ask?   Well, this is a sometimes fast paced action platformer, having you double press/flick the directional stick to do "teleportation". If you are like me, who really cannot do that without pressing that stick DOWN as you do that - well, then a MENU pops up. So yeah, I can't play this game until this is fixed.
Date 2019-03-30 Playtime 10h 52m Rec Negative Я люблю серию metroid.  Я люблю жанр metroidvania в целом.  Но мне не понравилась эта игра.  Отсутствие внятного сюжета, унылые однобразные локации - такое можно было простить только метроиду, потому что он обладал какой-то особенной магией. Здесь ее нет.  В метроиде чуть ли не  в каждой локации были секреты - здесь их мало. С трудом пробившись маленьким дроном (кстати, сомнительная альтернатива морфошара) сквозь орды врагов мы находим...какую-то сюжетную заметку. Зачем она нужна, если за сюжетом вообще неинтересно наблюдать Второе - корявый и скучный дизайн уровней, иногда прыгать нужно, отталкиваясь буквально от пикселя, чтобы добраться до нужной платформы. Я даже бросил это дело, подумав что помимо улучшенного прыжка, нужно найти двойной прыжок или что-то еще, пока бесцельное блуждание вновь не привело меня к этому месту и после трех-четырех попыток случайно таки допрыгнул. Мы находим кучу стволов, но половина из них вообще без надобности.  Скучный ГГ Безликие боссы На протяжении всей игры не покидало ощущение, что вот вот сейчас начнется что-то эпичное... но ничего не происходит.  5 из 10. С натяжкой за реверанс в сторону бессмертной классики
Date 2019-03-26 Playtime 10h 30m Rec Positive Amazing little game. I had a lot of fun with it. It also has replay value.
Date 2019-03-25 Playtime 109h 41m Rec Positive This game is like a larger, bizarre and darker Metroid-game.  I love it and recommend it!
Date 2019-03-25 Playtime 37h 9m Rec Positive I liked everything in the game.   Obviously it's a love letter to Metroid, but it's a great (new-retro) platformer by itself.  Story is great and the game is long enough to let you get immerse in it.  Music is pretty good also.   Good work Happ!
Date 2019-03-24 Playtime 16h 5m Rec Positive È un giocone in particolare per i fan di Metroid.  Fatta la premessa iniziale, Axiom Verge nel suo essere follemente e genialmente retrò si porta appresso anche qualche magagna dei tempi andati e cioè qualche pessima idea di game design come i muri non muri che rovina un po' la parte di completamento al 100%. Per il resto nulla di dire se non che il tipo che lo ha fatto è il Leonardo da vinci dei videogames visto che ha tirato fuori un gioco del genere da solo.

Date 2019-03-20 Playtime 1h 15m Rec Positive Good game.  Plus, screw Badland Publishing.
Date 2019-03-20 Playtime 10h 10m Rec Positive I don't like Metroid, I always felt the controls were goofy and the game hard to keep track of where you are in the world.    Axiom Verge is a game in that vein but it gets absolutely everything right. From the music, the graphics, the gameplay, the bosses and the story. The entire package is exactly what I've always wanted from a metroid game, but never quite got.
Date 2019-03-20 Playtime 25h 46m Rec Positive Coming right from a video explaining the events over the past year or so, I felt obligated to at least give a thumbs up to this masterpiece. [b] Thoughts and critique on the game under this paragraph. [/b] I honestly don't know what it's like being a father, let alone of a son who has a rare disease, but I do know what it feels like to be ripped off: I sent my old processor before getting payment ($200). I felt rage, stupidity, and most importantly: helpless. That was over only $200. I don't even want to think about what Tom had to feel through all this absolute bullshit. My heart goes out to you and your son.  Now, onto the game: I love it so much. [u] Pros [/u] Each upgrade is better than the last, which is detrimental toward the progression of metroidvainias. It is very close to Super Metroid, in the way that you start off small, slow, and always facing obstacles, but each upgrade lets you jump a hurdle.  Awesome enemy design, especially the bosses. While there are some recolors of the same enemies at some points, there are still plenty of diverse enemies, [spoiler] all able to be corrupted with their own unique effects. [/spoiler] The bosses are all very different from each other, and all look/fight equally menacing, making them all memorable and generally fun to fight.  The environment in a game like this is very important, and Axiom Verge does it very well. Each different location has it's own unique look, while still staying true to the retro style.  The story, while it can be confusing at times, is pretty damn cool, but this is coming from someone who prefers gameplay over story, and who pays more attention to whether or not I'm having fun rather than if I like the story or not, so I don't think I can really say if it is objectively well written.   [u] Cons [/u] Many of the weapons are completely useless. Most of the time, I just stuck with the basic blaster, and the "electric shotgun". Most of the others weren't worth using it seemed.  Some of the sounds in the game are very loud, and some are very quiet. When ambushed by one of the guys who stand still until provoked, you are assaulted with loud, and when shooting an invincible enemy, you are again assaulted with loud.  Some parts of the game have ridiculous difficulty spikes. This is normally when entering a new area in the later game. It gets pretty frustrating, but I might just be nit-picking at this point.  ______________________________________________________________  I have played this game three times so far: once on PS4, and twice on steam, and I feel like I still haven't given enough to Tom to equal the amount of enjoyment I got from this game. I am thinking of buying the WII U Multiverse edition just to do so, and to help someone who damn sure deserves it. I urge whoever reads this to purchase this game, even if you got it from the epic games store for free, because honestly if you are browsing steam then you probably don't need $20 more than Tom Happ right now.
Date 2019-03-18 Playtime 16h 48m Rec Positive One of the greatest re-imaginations of a metroid-like game on PC.  Gorgeous pixel-graphics, absolutely fabulous soundtrack, intriguing storyline and tight controls.  Can only recommend. My only point of critique is the wasp. Man do I despise the wasp...
Date 2019-03-18 Playtime 0h 18m Rec Positive Bought this to support the Dev. As a fellow father my heart goes out to him and I hope this small purchase contributes a little bit of good fortune for his family.
Date 2019-03-16 Playtime 11h 18m Rec Positive its good
Date 2019-03-15 Playtime 22h 35m Rec Positive Must have. Must play.
Date 2019-03-15 Playtime 6h 24m Rec Positive Axiom Verge looks like it was pulled straight from the mind of HR Giger during a fever dream. It's not just influenced by Metroid, but it's also as good as classic Metroid games from the gameplay, weapon variety, atmosphere and story. Don't pass on this.  Easy 10/10
Date 2019-03-13 Playtime 24h 19m Rec Positive If you like metroidvanias JUST PLAY THIS If you don't like metroidvanias YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE MSSING
Date 2019-03-11 Playtime 15h 8m Rec Positive I recommend this game with the caveat that it has serious problems. Others in reviews have discussed story, art and music; I want to discuss the balancing issues in this game. Normally in a metroidvania you get either defence upgrades, damage upgrades or both. Axiom Verge has no defence upgrades. Normal map enemies will do around a quarter to a third of your health damage output each hit. Damage upgrades most often come piecemeal. That means you need to collect 6 pieces of an item to combine as one upgrade. The main problem with that is items in this game are difficult both to find and acquire. So, compared to the basic enemy, you're doing baby damage most of the time. The game is packed with a lot of useless weapons, half of which you'll only test once and then never touch again. I can't help but think balancing issues could have been fixed by reducing weapon variety and focusing on upgrades and making the new coats you get give you a moderate boost in defence.   The unfortunate reality is that this game is often frustrating to the extreme. Going from save point to save point can feel like a gauntlet run. The reward for finding items feels less because you're only getting pieces of an upgrade. On the other end of the spectrum, bosses are amusingly easy and only require maybe one run before you figure out their exploit.   Controls are ok. Oftentimes I found myself dashing when I didn't mean to and then not dashing when I really needed it. Enemy placement on the screen is another irritant; you'll often jump across to the next screen only to find an enemy conveniently placed in your way and ready to attack. Boulders, for some reason, can tell which side of a platform you are and will somehow consciously drop toward you despite, you know, being a non-sentient rock.   It's little issues like these that make Axiom Verge feel like Death by a Thousand Cuts. The overall experience is decent but be prepared for your patience to be tested throughout.
Date 2019-03-10 Playtime 7h 40m Rec Positive The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.  Great film, and the title of that film sums up how I feel about this game. Axiom Verge is a great game, but surely is no masterpiece.  Being a Metroidvania from 2015, it does make particularly bad errors that the genre has long since resolved. I appreciate the hallway statue thing that connects the left side of the world to the right, but having that as your only fast travel system kinda hurts this game a little. I mean, the game has a futuristic tone, and you guys couldn't add warps? I know this is supposed to be more Metroid than Castlevania, so I'm not trying to make the argument "should be more like Castlevania", but warps would make more sense in this kind of game than a Castlevania game any day.  My other criticism falls into some of the above world textures. The areas where you explore the planet's surface is stunning, but it's always mired by the ugly background palettes of the grassy landscape and mountains. It's certainly a thing that bugged me enough to mention it.  My final issue are with the bosses. They aren't good bosses. One boss you can walk through and attack it from behind and it becomes helpless (I found this out on my own). Another boss, this scorpion type boss has this fire attack that is kinda pointless? It only attacks right in front of him but there is no reason you should even get close to him with how the boss is structured. So the boss is given an entirely useless attack for reasons I guess. The bosses just have this feeling of cheapness to it that I can't put my finger on. I get what they were trying to accomplish.  Oh, I have one more nitpick. Navigation can be a pain, which can be resolved by the above mentioned suggestion, but I find just generally getting around can be rough until late game. Enemies seem to always get in your way and there's no quick and efficient way to backtrack anywhere.   So now that I've gotten through the bad and the ugly, I'll get to the good.   The game just feels good. I love how the game gives you multiple beams and lets you choose what you like. The gun I chose to use most often I know would certainly not be every man's choice and I like that. Also the glitch gun gimmick was cool too. It always gave me an odd sense of satisfaction to glitch things out. I feel also the game is gorgeous (when it's not mired by its poor palette job occasionally).  The story was neat and it introduced interesting concepts, characters, and settings. I liked all the characters in this game. The music is very memorable, specifically that creepy one with the singing. I just wish there was a better location for that song because it does annoy you after you explore the area a few too many times. It is certainly my favourite song in the game, despite how annoyingly presented it is.  For a game that was technically made by one person, this game is quite stunning and I admit I'm a fan. I just wish he took extra time to fix many of the game's serious limitations.
Date 2019-03-07 Playtime 15h 59m Rec Positive while this is one of the best metroidlike games of recent years i still have some criticism:  - while pixelart is a charming artstyle, if you commit to it do not use stuff like zooming or other things that break the snap to pixel artstyle, doesn't look good imo - everything is really samey and based on a couple of tiles that are just placed randomly and repeat. while i understand that it makes it easier to design levels fast and easy, its just does not look good (still a nice callback to super metroid which had a similar style) - the boss battles are boring and really easy. they do not respond to anything you do and just repeat a predefined pattern that gets faster the more damage they take. feels pretty uninspired - the game does the same mistake as metroid. it hides items in random spots around the map just behind tiles that all look the same. while backtracking and exploring are still fun, just hitting every tile and wall you come across gets with every item or mechanic you have becomes annoying after a while - some items are literally impossible to find without a walkthrough - the game has very hard to get speedrun- / hardcore-achievements that are pretty much impossible to get - hate it - also the game has 3 missable achievements that you cant get anymore once you cross a certain point in the game - the game does not have any fast travel mechanics and because the map is REALLY REALLY big, doing exploring is a bit tedious - speaking of backtracking, another thing thats not that good, the progression of the game is all over the place, every time you find another usable item you have to search the entire map where the main progress route continues, probably to pad out game length - oh boy and the idea to put the dash skill on double tapping left and right is really bad, you will very often just randomly fall off of platforms - the grapple hook controls feel really wonky - secret worlds are useless / not really fun and annoying - they mess up your item counts and contain nothing of value - there are way too many weapons (over 20), and most of them are entirely useless, the green lightning is stronger than everything else in the game and you dont need to use anything else - a bit too much ripping off metroid and system shock  if you are looking for positive stuff in the game, check out other reviews - i just wrote down what annoyed me, which imo is much more important when deciding when buying a game
Date 2019-03-01 Playtime 38h 10m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a Metroidvania done in pixel art, with haunting music and an atmosphere that creates a very much "mutant freak horror experience" within the game. The game is particularly notable among other Metroidvanias for straying away from the "one weapon" motif of other games and instead having an extensive array of weapons that can all be used from one gun. The game also contains several movement options that, as far as I know, are unique within the genre.  The game does not relent with its difficulty, and being willing to get lost is a must for this sort of a game. It does not hold the player's hand in terms of exploration, only blocking off paths with "must have this upgrade" before then asking the player to find a way to use the upgrade to even find the way forward. What looks insurmountable near the start of the game may well be something the player HAS to come back to in order to progress. However, none of the moments of discovery feel cheap or unearned. Every bit of progression has that wonderful little "ah ha!" moment to it, resulting in exploration feeling rewarding rather than a slog. Bosses are freakish and difficult, but always have a trick or strategy to eliminating them that leaves the player with a sense of empowerment at discovering it and annihilating one of these mutant freaks.  The story is confusing and not everything is as it seems, adding further to the atmosphere. The player, while not told through subtext as much, has equal parts "in your face storytelling" as subtext and there are many, many things deliberately left unanswered in core gameplay that must be discovered through notes, hinting at a much deeper story than at surface level...which is already deep with unexpected twists. This leads to a game where the theories keep on growing, though not as much as other games that are purely subtext.  The gameplay is very much retro in feel, yet manages to mix in enough quirks to make it feel fresh. Glitchy looking sprites, where once undesired, are a core mechanic to the game. The player is required to exploit, clear, or generate glitchy material in order to bypass puzzles and progress through the game. A heavy sense of "memory disruption" is present in the game. Brought back is the "try every breakable wall for secrets" with a laser drill which is easily activated and very, very easy to point and drag along walls to try and find a new path. Later powerups make this process even easier, showing a brilliant design tactic to keep a "hidden walls" sort of feel with a twist that makes it convenient and FUN.  I think that what sums up my thoughts overall is this: Axiom Verge brings so much new to the table that it's hard to keep up with it. Old ideas are refined and made fun again, new ideas are experimented with, and most of the game is a success. The old style retro feel and look may not appeal to everyone, however. The difficulty can be frustratingly high at points, the exploration can be mind boggling and getting lost for too long is never fun. However, this is still a game worth trying and earns one of my highest recommendations as a game to play, even if you are well versed in Metroidvanias.  TL;DR, just wanna see a score for the game, yadda yadda: 9.5/10, excellent retro style Metroidvania with cool quirks and refreshes on old ideas.
Date 2019-02-27 Playtime 125h 4m Rec Positive Picking up a game that has gotten lots of praises, usually makes you wonder, is it really as good as they say? For Axiom Verge, definitely yes. Started playing having expectations and it lived up to them.
Date 2019-02-26 Playtime 10h 43m Rec Positive Amazing Game, highly looking forward for future productions
Date 2019-02-24 Playtime 25h 10m Rec Positive There's a lot to love about Axiom Verge. It's easily one of the best Metroidvania titles to have been released in recent years, with everything from the graphics, to the music, to the minute to minute gameplay just being incredible. The set up for the game is that you play as a scientist named Trace, who wakes up in a strange world after an explosion that should have killed him, and he needs to explore the world to find his way home. It sounds like a pretty typical setup, but the plot gets *really* confusing from there, despite being well written.  if you ever wanted a game that plays like Super Metroid on PC, then this is it. Everything is tight and responsive, and if you die it's not because of the game being cheap; it's solely on you. It's also built heavily around exploration as there are many upgrades, collectables, and items to help you on your way. Which leads me to the second issue I have with the game besides the story, and its the number of weapons. There's actually too many of them.   If you don't go far out of your way, you'll probably find about 5-6 weapons as you go alone, but there are in fact TWENTY weapons, not counting a couple of hidden ones in randomized secret areas. And a lot of these weapons are in fact kind of pointless. For instance there's a gun whose sole pupose is to be shot at walls and ceilings and it then travels along and damages any enemies there. Okay cool but why not just use literally anything else? There's also a weapon that will travel through enemies, but not through walls, yet you find other weapons that travel through BOTH,  Honestly a lot of the weapons could've been removed completely or just made as upgrades to existing weapons.   But besides that, and the convoluted story, everything else about this game is fantastic, and you owe it to yourself to pick it up and play through all of it.
Date 2019-02-24 Playtime 14h 46m Rec Positive I didn't enjoy the back tracking and pixel hunting. Also, once you get newer weapons, rarely do you use the old weapons. Some of the powers, like the drill, are not used much.  Overall, the game was very fun and I recommend for anyone who likes metroid style games. Music, sound, graphics and game play are all great! Have Fun!
Date 2019-02-23 Playtime 12h 2m Rec Positive One of the best Metroidvania games out there. Lots of rooms to explore, weapons and upgrades to collect. Flawless gameplay and awesome backstory. GET IT RIGHT NOW! 10/10  Follow my curator for more: https://store.steampowered.com/developer/NukGames/
Date 2019-02-19 Playtime 13h 33m Rec Positive Frustrating sometimes, but most of the time, it's fun, but there's one thing i hate, there's no button for dash.
Date 2019-02-19 Playtime 13h 14m Rec Negative What if we made a 1:1 Super Metroid clone but with really ugly visuals and noisy music? But let's add a dozen of worthless single case use weapons instead of beam upgrades so that Nintendo doesn't sue us for copying too much.
Date 2019-02-16 Playtime 22h 8m Rec Positive Никогда не играл в Метроид и метроидвании, но всегда интересовал данный жанр плафтормеров. Axiom Verge приглянул довольно давно, но приобрёл лишь недавно. И вот мой вердикт:  Игра мне очень понравилась! Так же был приятно удивлён, что есть русский язык. Мне казалось, что его тут нету. Сюжет довольно интригующий, хочется постоянно узнать больше. Музыка конечно же шикарная. Графика тоже великолепная, анимации плавные. В общем с этим всё в порядке. Исследовать локации интересно, порой находишь неожиданные секреты.  Понравилась механика "влияния на игру", которая заставляет чувствовать, что ты обходишь те или иные трудности путём "искажения" или "взлома" окружающего мира.  Боссы понравились. Не скажу, что они запредельно сложные, но мои лапки давно так не мокли :D  Конечно же я проходил игру на уровне сложности нормальный. Также не нашёл все предметы и записки. (а записки то очень интересные хочу я заметить)  Если вы никогда не пробовали играть в метроидванию, то однозначно брать! Эта игра вам понравится! Я брал с не очень большой скидкой в 10%, но она полностью оправдывает себя и за полную цену.

Date 2019-02-15 Playtime 20h 0m Rec Positive But Athethos is win.
Date 2019-02-14 Playtime 18h 55m Rec Positive This is coming from someone who hasnt played many Metroidvania games and also received the game as a gift.  I loved this game, from start to finish. Good amount of secrets, some easy, some hard, some takes time to figure out, some you problaby wont figure out by yourself. Music never got boring or too much of, and its pretty solid too.   This game has made me want to play more metroidvania games right away. I feel like I can never have enough of them as it is. I am absolutely coming back to this game even tho I played until I got 100% in game.   Even tho I got this for free, it is 100% worth the price.
Date 2019-02-13 Playtime 44h 9m Rec Positive 9/10  An amazing, incredibly well done metroid-esque game. Actually, "metroid-esque" hardly seems appropriate for this game, as it very clearly was created with the original Metroid games in mind. Even the aesthetics of the game are similar.  Gameplay is very much what one would expect from a game like this - platforming controls where progress is made by finding upgrades and new weapons for the character. Weapons can be fired in all 8 directions, plus the player can also lock the character in place for better aiming. And there are a ton of upgrades to find - not only finding new weapons and abilities, but also improving them. As an example, weapons not only get their damage improved by finding power nodes, but you can also find range and projectile extenders to increase the effective range and projectile size.  The game also does a good job of being creative, avoiding the usual upgrades found in games like this. Not that I dislike abilities like double jump and running, but the game feels fresh by replacing these abilities with others that work differently, but serve similar purposes.  It's also certainly not a short game at all. Doing as much exploring as I could, I finished the game at a little over 16h, with 99% map completion and 88% items. There is one achievement for beating the game in under less than 4h.  The story is also very creative, avoiding the usual stereotypes and creating something of its own, with an ending that leaves an opening of possible theories on what really happened throughout the game.  I specially loved how there is one ability you acquire in the game that, in addition to allowing the player to hack certain parts of the game to create platforms or open passages, also allows the player to hack enemies. Enemies that are hacked will have a great variety of effects: some will simply slow down or stop moving entirely, while others will stop hurting the player and instead hurt other enemies, others might generate health instead of projectiles/minions... And there are even a few very creative uses for hacking enemies, which I won't spoil.  My only problems with the game were two: enemy/boss design and dash controls.  While the game's keys can be remapped, after the dash ability is acquired, double-tapping any direction will cause dash to be used. This is hardly practical, as I ended up accidentally dashing very often, which sometimes caused me to take damage. I'd much rather press a direction + a specific key for dashing, in order to avoid this.  Regarding enemies and bosses, for the most part they're well designed and look great, but there are a few enemies in the game that just don't feel right with how they move too quickly and sometimes feel overwhelming to deal with. Later on in the game, you'll have the firepower to take care of them before they become a problem or otherwise be able to dodge using the dash, but until that happens, they can feel very annoying and cause some unneeded deaths. And likewise, bosses are great for the most part, but there are a few bosses in the game that have some weak spots that are just way too hard to hit and aiming a little too high or too low will just cause projectiles to have no effect. In my case, I just ended up firing randomly at the boss using weapons with greater reach and just hope that I hit the boss - which is hardly what I'd have wanted, but that's what worked.  Overall, this is still an amazing game, definitely recommended, even at full price.
Date 2019-02-12 Playtime 23h 13m Rec Positive En el episodio de hoy de Manqueando... "Axiom pero que conyo es esto???"  No creo que a estas alturas haya mucho que decir de este juego. Es un Metroid de manual (pero de manual hasta el punto de que tiene los mismos gráficos podria decirse).  La historia es rara de cohones. El control es bueno, y la dificultad está bien ajustada. Tiene una cantidad ingente de armas, gadgets y demás. La música tambien es buena, bastante, la verdad.  Y ahora vamos con las pegas, que tambien tiene.  No hay viaje rápido como tal. En este caso es un escenario que une 6 de los 8 mapas (hay 2 que quedan descolgados aqui), y en el que te montas en una cabeza gigante (lo juro), o bien bat-caminando te lleva de un mapa a otro. De modo que la navegación por el mapa es mejorable.  Tampoco es que se tenga muy claro lo que hay que hacer. Me he tirado horas dando vueltas atascado sin saber donde ir o que hacer, hasta que me topaba con la solución por casi casualidad.  Hay unos codigos que te permiten abrir zonas en determinadas habitaciones, pero he tenido que mirarlos, salvo los de la traducción, no sé de donde leches los saca la gente. Pero esto podria ser solo cosa mia, ya que fui a un colegio público.  El mapa es bastante simplón. Más que el del Metroid, algo que a estas alturas... pero no es un mal mapa tampoco.  Y... poca cosa más. Tiene algunas mecanicas originales, las armas son una ida de olla (a cual más extraña), y en general está bastante bien, salvo por los detalles mencionados. Y teniendo en cuenta que el juego lo ha hecho UN TIO SOLO... bravo, señor.  De modo que le cascaremos un 8, lo recomendaremos y más adelante le echaremos algun replay más.  Y en el próximo Manqueando... "The Mummy demastered"

Date 2019-02-08 Playtime 9h 14m Rec Positive No idea why i haven't reviewed this game already, It's honestly a Metroidvania masterpiece. Very underrated & totally worth full price and, hell, the soundtrack if you like good music too. The game has it all. Atmosphere, music, and an interesting story with EXCELLENT bosses.  9/10  Also works very well on keyboard
Date 2019-02-08 Playtime 93h 5m Rec Positive Super Metroid, Fester's Quest, Blaster Master this is the game nostalgia I felt playing this game. Very Super Metroid like game with challenging secrets and cool story. The challenge in creep as well as boss difficulty goes down as you collect more health/power but the difficulty finding secrets probably goes up since you find yourself you have explored the entire map but still need to find many items (which is only required if you want 100% of the game).
Date 2019-02-07 Playtime 10h 14m Rec Positive A truly great metroidvania, even greater considering it's just an indie game!  Captivating and disturbing story, amazing soundtrack and atmospheres and a beautiful gameplay with little flaws (the "main" one being the absence of an efficient and early teleport to move throught the various worlds, making the backtracking quite annoying at times).  Definitely advised if you like the genre: you won't regret playing this!
Date 2019-02-07 Playtime 18h 2m Rec Positive Axiom Verge es un buen juego, lo disfrutaras si te gusta este género, sin embargo si no estás muy acostumbrado puede hacer que te frustres un poco. Vale la pena experimentarlo.
Date 2019-02-07 Playtime 13h 57m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a great Metroidvania although it's far more Metroid than Castlevania. The game is packed full of different environments, weapons, tools, enemies, upgrades, and secrets. I spent a lot of time looking for hidden upgrades and rooms and was blown away by how many there were and how well they were hidden. You'll end up doing quite a bit of back tracking in the game as it is a metroidvania but it never got super tedious as it has for me in other games of the genre. The music was unique and enjoyable on my end but I felt some of the tracks could be longer. The bosses were a ton of fun and the story gets pretty nuts near the end with very well done cutscenes. I thoroughly enjoyed Axiom Verge and it's a great time for 2D Metroid fans.
Date 2019-02-06 Playtime 10h 52m Rec Positive Game's real good, soundtrack is top-notch, and there's exactly the right amount of plot for its genre.

Date 2019-02-05 Playtime 15h 13m Rec Positive Axiom Verge draws heavily from Super Metroid Prime. So if you liked that game, you can't go wrong with this one.  Exploration is so so fun. Some of the secrets are so intricate, you'll feel like a king when you solve them.   Combat is a blast, and corrupting enemies never gets tired.   The story is very good -- I can't say there's a whoooole lot there, but what's there is very sci-fi heavy, and very well told.  Definitely a buy.

Date 2019-02-03 Playtime 3h 43m Rec Negative bad
Date 2019-02-03 Playtime 10h 22m Rec Positive If you want straight up information about this game, it's probably the closest thing in feel and mystery you'll get to something like Super Metroid. It's creepy, it is odd, it can be dark, and the story is rather simplistic but effective. That being said, it isn't exactly a clone, the story isn't anything like that game and the weapons and abilities are way more weird and varied. You'll love it if that is what you are looking for.  That being said, there are some gripes I have with Axiom Verge. The music, for one, is not exactly ambient at times and can get grating when you are spending hours in a certain section of a game - which you defiantly will at times. Travelling back and forth can be confusing, especially since the game has a transportation system that is nearly completely secret for the majority of the game. There are immense labyrinthine secrets that make you feel like you are making game progress, but you aren't, and you'll get completely lost and turned around. And, once you get to the outdoor sections of the game, you'll find yourself faced with obscure puzzles that seem completely impassible unless you do something very specific.  None of that really makes the game 'bad' just complex and difficult. It expects a level of thinking, remembering areas, functions, and NPC locations from players. And, it's always great when a game doesn't treat it's audience like they need their hands held.
Date 2019-02-02 Playtime 36h 7m Rec Positive Genre: Metroidvania Atmosphere: Somber Progression: Non-linear Gameplay: Explorative tactical   [b]Pros:[/b]  - Massive world - Rick environment - Engaging story/plot - Lots of secrets to uncover, some are VERY tricky to find - Tons of collectibles: Weapons, skills, upgrades - Speedrun support for expert players - Smooth learning curve for beginners - Great soundtrack - Well-componsed aesthetics - Interesting boss fights - Multi-layer gameplay: Collected items increase depth of previously simple locations  [b]Cons:[/b]  - "Q" to exit options of the main menu... I couldn't even successfully rebind it to Esc, so I just had to get used to it - The endgame exploration can become a bit bland with everything familiar and most enemies no longer posing a threat - Dashing uses a double-tap mechanism, which may accidentally trigger as you try to inch toward or away from something - Limited replay value, but speedrunning is a valid and supported option

Date 2019-01-30 Playtime 20h 58m Rec Positive A love letter to the genre that stays true to itself. The design focus is apparent, and well executed. I'd reccommend it to anyone. Even its flaws are charming. Still listen to the soundtrack, it's great.   :)
Date 2019-01-30 Playtime 3h 10m Rec Negative Un peu deçu pour être honnête, sans doute en attendais-je trop ? Le jeu est pas mal seulement il ne parvient à me transporter comme l'avait fait super metroid à l'époque. Alors oui c'est bien mais ça manque d'âme, la bande son ne permet pas d'être transporté non plus. Bon c'est un peu dur. Le jeu est pas mal tout de même. J'en attendais trop je pense.
Date 2019-01-30 Playtime 14h 33m Rec Positive My recommendation of this game comes with several, very large astrisks. I played this game to the end, and enjoyed large chunks of it; the weapon design is good, the powerups are cool, the corruption gun is REALLY cool, and the level design is good until you have to backtrack through it. But I have a great many complaints. The first is the backtracking. I hate pixel hunting, and this game DOES force you to pixel hunt, looking through room after room after room trying to find the one place you need to go to get the next upgrade. The second is the story. It gives you a whole bunch of incredibly interesting and fascinating ELEMENTS, but by the end, it just decides, "eh, fuck it, you get no answers, have a disappointing DPS race for a final boss and an ending that answers nothing and resolves nothing". This is doubly disappointing because most of the other bosses were relitively solid in terms of design. So yeah, third problem is that the final boss is trash. And finally, the grappling hook is a little finicky. That's more of a nitpick than a big problem but still worth mentioning. I suggest you get it on sale and look up a guide if you get stuck instead of pixel hunting.

Date 2019-01-15 Playtime 20h 59m Rec Positive I'm a huge fan of metroidvania games since 'metroidvania' wasn't a genre. When I first played Super Metroid on SNES on the 90's I felt in love and since then I always look for every single game that resembles this kind of gameplay: get upgrades, fight tricky bosses, backtrack to discover places you wasn't able to go without a certain upgrade, look for secrets, etc.  Simply put, this was the best metroidvania since Super Metroid, which is my all time favorite. The gameplay is very fluid, killing enemies and bosses are rewarding, secrets are tricky to find, graphics, OST, every single aspect of this game is perfect for a metroidvania fan.   The story is interesting and have some bits which made it stand out from the average 'abandoned planet with high tech stuff hidden and a story behing its collapse' cliché. Also it has a certain kind of creepyness which adds a lot to the game atmosphere.  It's one of the few games I'd give a 10/10. Just go for it.

Date 2019-01-12 Playtime 9h 38m Rec Positive Lovely game with a few downfalls that don't change the fact that it is lovely. Also can't be picky when it comes to games like Metroid.  And no I don't mean "Metroidvania" games, I mean games that try to replicate the Super Metroid feeling. "Metroidvania" games have the mechanics but in most of them, atmosphere and gameplay is nothing alike.

Date 2019-01-12 Playtime 14h 19m Rec Positive Cool story, interesting gameplay mechanics, the backtracking isn't bad, music is good. Bosses are a little underwelming for how awesome they look but its something I look past. Great game. Totally worth a playthrough.
Date 2019-01-11 Playtime 10h 18m Rec Positive Played a lot of Hollow Knight but wanted something more focused on story.  Someone recommended this.  At first I thought the story was kind of silly.  Then there was a twist and then I beat it and am just very, very glad I did.  Disappointed I didn't get a lot of unlocks, but wasn't really a focus.  Blown-the-fuck-away this was made by one person.  It does everything metroidvanias are supposed to and then does them well.  Fantastic.
Date 2019-01-10 Playtime 11h 52m Rec Positive With a rich sci-fi universe that remembers Alien, beautiful pixel art and an amazing memorable soundtrack, the game delivers a great experience. Trace is one of the best characters I've seen in a videogame, and the story lives up to its protagonist, with amazing twists, cutscenes and iconic characters.  The game never tells you where to go, like Metroid games did, and it works in most of the game.  The biggest problem of the game, in my opinion, is feedback. The game tries to be as close as possible to a SNES game, and it succeeds very well, but there are some problems like: - What kind of rock you can destroy and what kind you can't? There are no pattern in this interactable objects, and in some moments you can destroy a rock that is exactly the same as the one you can't. - Enemies have no anticipation of attacks, then you end up being forced to take damage without having time to react and try to dodge. I know that, like SNES games, the difficulty is something very present, but this becomes rather frustrating if you die and have to go back to the last save point, which is on the other side of the map and go all the way over again. - The level design could be good if the player had more mobility options, but the game doesn't help you in anyway. If you jump too soon, you hit the ceiling. If you jump too late, you fall, and the game does not have something like a double jump or the hand to reach the highest platform, as it is very well done in Dead Cells, for example. - The feedback from when the player takes damage is so poor that you can barely notice. - In some stage is difficult to identify where you can go because the background and the foregound are pretty similar. - And so much more...  Axiom Verge could be one of my favorite games, as it captures the essence of what makes games like Super Metroid great, but fails to improve itself with today's technology, choosing, instead, to be more nostalgic.
Date 2019-01-09 Playtime 6h 39m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a 2D action plat-former heavily inspired by Metroid. You play as Trace a lab scientist who gets caught in a explosion during a experiment which sends you through a breach into another world. To say anything more would enter spoiler territory but let’s just say it continues on with a out of this world science fiction plot that is actually really well written. There are some very funny conversations that happen throughout the adventure that I really enjoyed as well. Gameplay is solid. Platforming and shooting feel very deliberate and responsive. Boss fights are challenging and rewarding. Exploring is what these games are all about and this delivers as expected and is probably its strongest feature in my opinion. However the world is not very interesting. Sure the map is filled with twists, turns, and secrets but it just doesn’t offer much in the way of variety. Some areas look a little different and offer up different obstacles but not enough to stand out. I also found the soundtrack annoying after a while. Each area has a different track which repeats on a loop. Some tracks sound awesome but since you spend quite a bit of time in each area I personally feel the music over stays it’s welcome. These grievances I have are minor issues and at the end of the day I would easily recommend this game to anyone👍
Date 2019-01-09 Playtime 7h 3m Rec Negative Even though I was a huge fan of the Metroid series, I could not fall in love with this game. Don't get me wrong. It has some really cool moments like the sound design, some of the bosses and some of the music. However, it's the bad parts that stick out to me the most. For instance, the level design was incredibly confusing even for a Metroid clone. As a result, I was always stuck. When I get stuck in a Metroid game, it's usually because I'm trying to figure out what to do next. In this game, it's because I get lost very easily even with a map. This is likely because some of the visual design of the levels look like a mess. Even when I got stuck in Metroid Prime, there was always a pathway in a logical place I haven't checked yet. Here, it's that problem but made much worse. I can appreciate the love for the Metroid series expressed in this game but it still felt like it kept a lot of the bad parts and left out some of the good parts. You're probably noticing that I've been comparing this to Metroid a lot. That's because that's what damns this game the most. It wears its inspiration on its sleeve and doesn't have an identity of its own. People aren't going to be talking about how the game is on its own; it's going to be constantly compared to Metroid. Cave Story was a much better Metroid homage not only because it kept out a lot of the annoying parts of Metroid out but it establishes its own original ideas so well that discussions about the game don't mention Metroid. So, I would highly recommend that game instead.
Date 2019-01-09 Playtime 17h 47m Rec Positive An awesome Metroidvania game, it just has it all: good ambience, nice music, cool weapons and gadgets, a pretty interesting story (which leads to some interpretations, and this is nice. Somehow similar to Salt and Sanctuary, another pretty good game), and some fun mechanics. Any Super Metroid fan and Metroidvania fans in general will love it - this is a masterpiece on the genre. Would love to play a sequel.
Date 2019-01-06 Playtime 1h 56m Rec Positive An overall charming metroid that draws you into a one of a kind universe.
Date 2019-01-06 Playtime 27h 12m Rec Positive Incredible experience if you are remotely a metroidvania fan you must play this.  Cool story and awesome progression.  Design is not too difficult like some other indie games.  I highly recommend this game I was totally addicted.
Date 2019-01-05 Playtime 12h 43m Rec Positive It's a good game
Date 2019-01-05 Playtime 18h 59m Rec Positive Basically everything about this game is fantastic. Great pixel art, nostalgically good music, fun gameplay .  It also happens to have a really, really good story going on.
Date 2019-01-05 Playtime 20h 45m Rec Positive I used to shit on this game, then i played it.... Kino... fucking kino.....
Date 2019-01-05 Playtime 11h 48m Rec Negative This game is very close to being great. Lots of fun if you like Metroid-style games, but man, some of this gameplay is whack. Bosses are not an issue in this game. You will likely accidentally stumble into the method of cheesing them to death on your first try at them. Regular enemies meanwhile are a death sentence. I'm 50% through the map, and I'm finding it extremely difficult to enjoy this anymore. Three-story tall grub monster with a cannon on its spine? No problem, I'll kick it's ass with my starting gun the first try. Want to GET to a boss later on in the game? Sorry, your reaction timing, pixel-perfect character placement, choice of weapon, and lack of total memorization of enemy patterns and inability to see the enemies that can sense you off-screen mean that you'll be murdered by something the size of a fucking sparrow. Fun. No easy mode included, so unless you feel like putting in a lot of effort to get gud, it's a swift grind to a startling halt halfway through the experience. At first I really wanted to try and improve and get past areas to experience more of the fun of exploring and unravelling the story, but now I just sort of occassionally come back to it to find out it's still miserable to try and progress past another screen, and I go "meh, this is not worth my time" and go play Super Metroid because I feel like having fun with my limited time for playing videogames. If you're into really hard games that border on sadistic this might be for you. Maybe I'll come back to it after I forget how teeth-grindingly disheartening and tedious it gets and luck out and make it past the screens I'm at, but man, what an unfun kick to the nuts halfway through the game. Really was digging some of the weird touches like how all the areas seem Sumerian/Akkadian names while the AIs all seem Russian or Slavic (maybe?) and have weird broken English speech patterns, but I just cannot understand why this is supposed to be considered fun after a certain point. I literally spent half an hour trying to get past some screens get to a boss fight where the point is to lose. It's some of the most bizarre difficulty whiplash I've expereinced. Good music and seems polished enough (despite the aforementioned difficulty schizophrenia), so I guess I recommend it? I don't know. Super Metroid's still fun. Edit: tried to have fun with this again. Just frustrating and doesn't seem to respect my time.
Date 2019-01-04 Playtime 11h 10m Rec Positive I always loved metroid and castlevania games. Metroidvania if you will.  Especially the genre they created. Going back to nes till black and white handheld, Now that I said that i dont understand any negative views of this games. It's an indie classic genre. I always liked Samus. In fact she is really the only female I like playing as. But being a male I wished she was of course.lol This game is the male samus essentially but the guy has different elements. The story and art as well are also great nastalgia, even playing on the old nes glitch look... when you would have to turn it off and on. 2D side scrollers are the best. I have kids and i can tell 3d you get lost but in 2d you know where your at. Again this is like a classic game. And it is awesome. I give this game a 10 out of 10. The controls the function. All great....
Date 2019-01-02 Playtime 65h 11m Rec Positive Великолепная игра, проходя первые часы - думал насколько же скучно, но потом понял что куча пасхалок и секретов. Приходится возвращаться к пройденым местам, но это не сложно, а иногда даже весело. 7/10, рекомендую.
Date 2019-01-02 Playtime 8h 52m Rec Positive Before this game I hadn't played many Metroidvanians but I found this to be a fun and rewarding game.

Date 2019-01-01 Playtime 20h 5m Rec Negative Какого хера каждый "патч" что - нибудь ломает ? Я за3бался разбираться, что на этот раз отвалилось. А сама игра за3бись , да.
Date 2019-01-01 Playtime 8h 52m Rec Negative TL;DR - Good soundtrack and especially good sound design (Low HP beeps sinc with music, enemy abilities are sampled in music, etc.)  - Good zones  - Interesting atmosphere  - Good early-mid game  - Majority of bosses were meh at best  - Very bad late game  - Story ending is not satisfying (potentially could have branched to two seperate endings based on a player choice but your character chooses for you, and I would have disagreed with the default character choice.)   Enjoyed the early-mid game very much, clearing zones and acquiring handy abilities. Late game is attempting to avoid enemies by any means necessary using your little buddies invincibility frames and speed as he launches etc, clearing all the rooms and being able to look for secrets became a pain due to enemies ramping up in HP, Speed, Damage and amount per screen all at once causing you to die rapidly. Although the game has a fair amount of weapons majority of the time I stuck to the starting gun as it was the best. Most weapons I used no more than to see what they did, tested the damage and then never used it again. Bosses tend to be gimicky, once you discover the gimick it's a cake walk, or I was able to just stand under the boss and shoot it to death before it could shoot me to death which happened twice.
Date 2019-01-01 Playtime 12h 32m Rec Positive Great game. 10/10
Date 2018-12-31 Playtime 12h 31m Rec Positive Before this game I hadn't played many Metroidvanians but I found this to be a fun and rewarding game. At the time of writing I've seen better games but I'd still say Axiom Verge is worth a play through. It's level design isn't superb but it does demand you to practice and master it to be successful. I recall the game being fair but hard up until the final boss which was a joke.
Date 2018-12-31 Playtime 7h 35m Rec Positive This game is soooo awesome! I realy hope Tom Happ will make a sequel or/and a preaquel. I would realy love to see "the complete story" 10/10 game on my tab
Date 2018-12-30 Playtime 17h 46m Rec Positive Great, but not perfect.  Level design felt pretty good, but boss design could have been better. A lot of useless weapons, but the powers were generally fun.  The world was fun to explore, and powers we got along the way opened up shortcuts. Axiom Verge executes on the Metroidvania formula pretty well, and I enjoyed my time with the game.
Date 2018-12-29 Playtime 10h 56m Rec Positive It's like if Megaman and Metroid had a baby.  Mechanically this is definitely one of the best metroid-likes. There's loads of innovations in this game, a ridiculous number of weapons, the story is weird and interesting, and the environments are great.  [spoiler]The drone sidekick, the secret glitch zones, and the zoomed-out giant boss fights really set this game apart from the rest.[/spoiler]  But ultimately it's a bit of a short game, and I don't see my self going back.  I only discovered maybe half of the weapons and even then I only used a few of them regularly (but it's a big plus that probably everyone will find a play style they like among them). My biggest gripe is probably the double-tap to dash rather than just having a dash button, because you end up constantly doing it on accident.

Date 2018-12-22 Playtime 58h 13m Rec Positive Najlepsza współczesna metroidvania, w jaką grałem. Atmosferą dorównuje Super Metroidowi, złożonością eksploracji i wyposażenia Castlevanii Symphony of the Night, a i satysfakcją z gry wcale im nie ustępuje. Soundtrack również zasługuje na szczególną uwagę. Trudno uwierzyć, że tak dobra gra wyszła spod ręki jednego człowieka. Absolutnie nie mam zastrzeżeń.
Date 2018-12-18 Playtime 40h 40m Rec Positive Do NOT miss out on playing this one.  It´s great!
Date 2018-12-15 Playtime 0h 37m Rec Positive good game
Date 2018-12-12 Playtime 17h 40m Rec Positive Lovely game with lovely music and lovely graphics.
Date 2018-12-12 Playtime 18h 31m Rec Positive A few minor issues but over its a must cop if you like Metroidvanias. In the upper tier of the ones available on steam.  Its a good metroidvania a lil similar to super metroid. There are some cool weapon and powerups. It has pretty diverse map with some solid ability gating. One flaw i see in this game is that some of the powerups come too late in the game and its like you dont even cant a chance to enjoy the game play with them. By the time you get the red trench coat your basically at the end of the game with the final level left. And once you get that that when you can get the final weapons. Another issue I had with the game was the lack of teleport system to get around. Theres a lot of backtracking when you want to look for stuff and you have walk the whole way. Also the map could be a lil more detailed. Beside those few issues I say its a must cop if you enjoy this genre and it plays quite well on keyboard if anyone is wondering.
Date 2018-12-10 Playtime 25h 43m Rec Positive Bardzo fajna gra. Pamiętam jak miałem niezły hype przed jej wydaniem i gdy w końcu mogłem zagrać to sprostała moim oczekiwaniom. Przyjemnie się gra, ma niezły klimat i dość ciekawą fabułę (która nie ma specjalnych zawiłości, ale jest parę twistów i tajemnic).  Ma interesujący zestaw zdolności jak na metroidvanię (jedna z niewielu bez podwójnego skoku), a niektóre z mechanik są genialne. Przede wszystkim broń, która pozwala na różne sposoby glitchować wrogów i niektóre elementy otoczenia. Jest wiele sekretów, które to wykorzystują, a gracz zostaje odpowiednio wynagrodzony za szukanie poza główną ścieżką - głównie nowymi brońmi albo notatkami, które przybliżają nam historię świata, w którym się znajdujemy. Szukanie wszystkiego jest satysfakcjonujące, a świat ma na tyle zbalansowany rozmiar, że nie robi się zbytnio nużący przed zdobyciem 100%.  Co do samego świata, to jest utrzymany w dość mrocznym klimacie, a lokacje zawierają sporo szczegółów, które same w sobie opowiadają nam swoją historię. Całość oprawiona jest przyjemną muzyką, co w połączeniu z ładnym pixel artem otoczenia, sprawia że niektóre miejsca naprawdę robią wrażenie jak się je odwiedza pierwszy raz i zostają w pamięci. Niektóre wydarzenia serwują nam też niezły mindfuck, np. miejsce, w którym nasz bohater ma halucynacje, a które po ponownym odwiedzeniu wygląda całkowicie inaczej. Wielekrotnie może się też zdarzyć, że będziemy się zastanawiać nad tym, co się właściwie wydarzyło.  Trochę minusów niestety też się trochę znajdzie. Chyba największym jest liniowość. Tytuł jest metroidvanią, ale jedną z tych mniej eksploracyjnych, gdzie zdobywamy jakąś zdolność i idziemy do następnej, przy czym najwięcej czasu zajmuje to za pierwszym razem, bo później idzie się tą samą ścieżką. Oprócz tego, gra nie przewiduje żadnego sequence breakingu (w sensie fabuła nie jest na to przygotowana), a takowy przydaje się tylko do speed runów. Wśród sekretów nie ma tażke ukrytych większych lokacji, czy bossów. Pod tym względem gra wypada średnio, jednak za pierwszym przejściem to aż tak nie przeszkadza, dzięki tajemniczośći, która wycieka z każdego miejsca. Mamy mimo wszystko wiele ścieżek, po prostu tylko jedna z nich prowadzi tam, gdzie akurat powinniśmy iść.  Drugim z minusów są przeciwnicy, a głównie bossowie. Nie ma zbyt ciekawych walk, które wymagałyby czegoś innego niż unikania ataków i strzelania w czułe punkty. Sami przeciwnicy są ładnie zaprojektowani, ale ich AI nie jest odkrywcze, a niektóre lokacje potrafią być frustrujące przez ułożenie wrogów. Można jednak powiedzieć, że są zróżnicowani, bo każdy ma inne zachowanie + glitchowanie każdego przeciwnika i sprawdzanie jaki to da efekt sprawia niezłą frajdę.  Całą grę oceniam bardzo pozytywnie. Serdecznie polecam dla wszelkich fanów platformówek, metroidvanii, czy serii Metroid. Jest to jeden z tytułów, w które warto zagrać.
Date 2018-12-09 Playtime 11h 4m Rec Positive Au début, ce jeu ne m'attirait pas graphiquement à la vue des screenshots, mais une fois testé j'ai été happé par l'ambiance. C'est un très bon metroidvania qui possède sa patte particulière avec son univers, sa bande-son. On s'adapte très vite au gameplay, l'évolution de son équipement s'enrichit au fur et à mesure (seul le grappin fait tâche, à cause de son maniement laborieux), la map est suffisament grande pour avoir à fouiller partout (il y a même des zones secrètes qui changent d'emplacement à chaque partie.. et cachent des bonus/armes supplémentaires). Le scénario est original, particulier aussi car il reste des zones d'ombre sur l'explication de la fin. A ce prix et cette qualité, je ne regrette pas mon achat.
Date 2018-12-08 Playtime 24h 18m Rec Positive Muy bueno si te gustan los metroid vania al mejor estilo de los buenos viejos tiempos
Date 2018-12-08 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive Very solid Metroidvania, highly suggest this one. Also kudos to whoever did the music!
Date 2018-12-08 Playtime 9h 3m Rec Negative To preface, I never finished this game. I think I got about 75% of the way through.  [h1]Cons[/h1] - Goofy protagonist character design - Additional beam weapons seem either unnecessary or underutilized [i]Different beams were occasionally used in activating switches or solving puzzles, but this felt like a minor gameplay element. In combat the Voranj felt practically broken, while the rest of the beams felt equally mediocre.[/i] - Combat feels clunky and difficult to avoid damage (can't move while aiming up or diagonally) - Story feels like a fan-fiction - Backtracking experience and occasionally getting lost - Ultimately didn't hold my interest (I picked up and put down the game multiple times)  [h1]Pros[/h1] + Unique upgrades and gameplay mechanics [i]i.e. Modified Lab Coat allows teleportation through walls, Address Disruptor corrupts/de-corrupts enemies and walls to reveal pathways or platforming opportunities[/i] + Great soundtrack, setting, and overall atmosphere + Bosses
Date 2018-12-08 Playtime 13h 19m Rec Positive This is a 2D metroid like game, but with a twist of gameplay all of its own. The game gives the player the feeling of being powerful but not overpowerd. The game music is amazing aswell, its newage but stcks to the roots they were trying to capture. Overall this game is amazing, sure lacking a little polish but that gives it charm all of its own.
Date 2018-12-07 Playtime 13h 5m Rec Positive /Axiom Verge, é um jogo que lembra mto o clássico mto famoso, Metroid do Snes, principlamente na passagem de sala, várias armas, possui uma ótima jogabilidade, enredo excelente, Spoiler " pélo final parece q tem continuação" gráficos lembra bem os jogos do Snes, agora deixou a desejar na falta de mais chefes, pois tem mtas armas e poucos chefões fora q a dificuldade deles é fraca demais, poderia ter mto mais chefes, tbm poderia ser maior o mapa, pq isso tbm achei mto péqueno, bom recomendo para os fãs de metroidviana, pelo menos eu amo games plataformas.  RECOMENDO 8/10.
Date 2018-12-07 Playtime 25h 25m Rec Positive Great game. Not much to pick at.  Too many weapons. I should say too many "useless" weapons. Half of them I never used.  There was 1 weapon I couldn't find on my own; the pink blaster one. It was hidden in such a ridiculous place I never would have found it if I hadn't have looked it up. There was a code tucked away almost off-screen in the lowest level of the game, and then you had to decipher it. It just looked like etching in the background.  Original story with a very unique setting and character designs. Nice change from the same-old power-ups in other Metroidvania games.  Would recommend. No replay value though
Date 2018-12-06 Playtime 21h 15m Rec Positive Are you a Metroid fan? Look no further.
Date 2018-12-02 Playtime 3h 29m Rec Negative I love a good metroidvania, but this didn't do it for me. The level design was not interesting to explore. Enemy behavior was really limited and encourages the player just to hang back and chip at the mostly static enemy. I found this very dissatisfying compared to games like Guacamelee or Castle in the Darkness or Hollow Knight.
Date 2018-12-01 Playtime 5h 31m Rec Negative I have heard so many people recommend this game as a great metroidvania.  Now that I finally have it, I wonder how many of them have played good games.  This game is okay.  The boss fights are boring, the patterns are fairly easy to figure out and execute, and the items are jank af.  Story is good enough I guess, and I like how the grapple is  a throwback to bionic commando.  But otherwise idk, you might pass on this and not miss anything.  You should only buy this if you already own Valdis Story.
Date 2018-12-01 Playtime 1h 50m Rec Positive 特别好的银河战士类型。。。我支持个。
Date 2018-11-29 Playtime 595h 39m Rec Positive First, a confession, I have a crippling backlog of games I've only played long enough to get through the tutorial.  Likely lots of you do too.  When I got this one in the summer, though,  I was confident it was going to consume my gaming attention for a while.  It's got the visual style and the trailers looked like it had the gameplay mechanics drawn directly from a combination of Super Metroid and Contra and simialr games I cut my teeth on way back when.  I sat down and started playing it on a modestly-spec'd laptop and within minutes one of my buddies from those early days of gaming asked me what I was doing.  Another couple of minutes after that he was hooked too, saying "this *is* Metroid!"  There's really no higher compliment I can think of to give this game.  It encourages exploration.  It's creative.  The weapons are cool, varied and very creative (including a 4th-wall breaking one that would've utterly blown my mind back in the 1994).  The art is complex and detailed but I never found I was having trouble following what was going on.  The bosses are just challenging enough that you aren't likely to beat any of them on your first encounter, but not so frustrating you'd give up and walk away.  The music is perfectly thematic and spot-on for a high-end Metroid-style game from that era.  Most importantly, though, it's *fun*.  And, equally important for me, it runs smooth as silk on both my old Debian 9 installation and my much newer Ubuntu 18.04.  Both machines still serve a purpose for me and both of them run this game as well as I could ask.  As a final thought, this game brought me back to the days when I first encountered Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse, the pinnacle of that series for me.  Every part of it, every failure, every return to a checkpoint, every new thing I would find made me want to see what the next one would be.
Date 2018-11-29 Playtime 12h 47m Rec Positive [b] Pretty good game: 8.5/10 [/b]  I wanted this game since the release date. Finally got it around the beginning of this year or at the end of the previous one. A couple of months ago i've started to play it,  played about one hour or so, only to forget about it and coming back recently. Walked around about an hour to finally remember how to open specific doors, and after that i was totally hooked. The gameplay, soundtrack and atmosphere are awesome but what kept me on the seat was the lore and the plot of the game. Man, i couldnt have enough of it.  Totally recommended, even if you are not a fan of the genre.  [b] Kaiserete' [/b]
Date 2018-11-28 Playtime 2h 59m Rec Negative Most tedious gameplay I've ever seen. This game is incredibly boring and clearly uninspired design, I really can't think of anything good to say about it. Mopping the floor provides a more interesting, challenging, and fulfilling experience.
Date 2018-11-27 Playtime 1h 32m Rec Negative Axiom Verge starts fairly well : the story is interesting, everything looks great, the soundtrack is just amazing.  However. I am not far into the game, because frankly I don't want to play it anymore.  The game's design is where most problems lie. It's so rough, so unpolished that the entire game crumbles beneath it.  Many enemies' AI simply tries to match the player's position, meaning that the player will be stunned. After the player is stunned, the AI will move to the position of the stunned player, stunning them again, and again, and again. To be fair, the player can stop this loop with some effort, however the entire ordeal feels clunky and frustrating, since the player's gun cannot shoot where the player is, and most enemies have quite a bit of health.  Another enemy is a simple crawler which shoots the player with a lazer beam when they come in range. This means that sometimes, the player will be going up in a room and suddenly take damage from an off-screen enemy.  Most enemies don't have such glaring problems. However, they all follow the same pattern : they do something you have to avoid, you shoot them for a while, they do the same thing, you shoot them again, et cetera. This wouldn't be a problem if their patterns were a bit more complicated. Or if the enemies died quicker; but they don't. It's downright boring to kill enemies, and killing enemies is the meat of the game.  The bosses I've fought felt bland and uninspired.  Hide behind the conveniently placed platform, shoot, hide from the projectiles, shoot, rinse and repeat for a few minutes and yay! you beat the boss! Jump on the platform, avoid the projectiles while shooting straight forward, rinse and repeat for a few minutes and again, you're done. Et cetera.  I'm disappointed, because the art for the game is frankly amazing and I've had a metroidvania itch for a while now, but this is just not it. This game just makes me appreciate the Metroid series as well as Cave Story's designs more.  I therefore can't recommend the game. 
Date 2018-11-27 Playtime 17h 26m Rec Positive Honestly surprised this isn't more popular. One of my favourite games, really great soundtrack and visuals, and a compelling story.
Date 2018-11-26 Playtime 101h 4m Rec Positive Excellent game! For me this game is extremely well rounded, It has a lot of charm from the metroid series but the soul of it's own with it's in depth world and a story that pulls you in and leaves you thinking even after beating the game. It plays really well with challenging bosses to take on and paths to chose from, with an almost endless feeling amount of secrets keeping you alert at all time's to find them.   I highly recommend this game that left me with a lot of joy
Date 2018-11-26 Playtime 14h 23m Rec Positive Pretty good Metroidvania
Date 2018-11-26 Playtime 22h 59m Rec Positive This game is awesome! It has an interesting story, atmospheric soundtrack and visuals to go with it, a pixel art style that really shows the true potential of pixel art, and a map with visually distinct areas that are fun to explore every cranny of. On top of it it has badass bosses and challenging enemies, with a variety of weapons where there doesn't seem to be a best one. Definitely worth playing.

Date 2018-11-23 Playtime 12h 5m Rec Positive Increíble. Uno de los mejores del estilo Castlevania de los últimos tiempos. Excelente jugabilidad, entorno y música. Súper recomendable.
Date 2018-11-23 Playtime 12h 47m Rec Positive It my be rough around the edges, but everything in this game just screams interesting, from the weapons to the environment and the story.  It may be copying Metroids homework, but it's changing enough to be one of the most engaging Metroidvania-experiences.
Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 14h 57m Rec Positive Great game. Buy it if you like the metroidvania genre.
Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 19h 35m Rec Positive Perfeito para quem queira relembrar o Super Metroid do SNES.  - Boa Jogabilidade; - Trilhas sonoroas excelentes; - Altas referências a outros Metroidvanias.
Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 72h 11m Rec Positive One of my favorite metroidvanias in a while! The speedrun mode and hard mode will keep you coming back!
Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 17h 48m Rec Positive This is one of the best video games I have ever played.

Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 42h 40m Rec Positive Игра Интересная,и сложная, если захотите пройти полностью на 100\100 то придется пролезть во все углы, прошарить каждый секрет, и только тогда,вы найдете вход в доп локации и получите новое оружие или записку а так игра стоит своих денег
Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 16h 22m Rec Positive There's been a bit of a boom in metroidvania-style games from indie publishers over the last few years, and Axiom Verge really stands out as a great example of the genre done right. The game rewards exploration and investigation, the upgrades and unlocks are interesting and inventive, and the mapping and layouts are just obtuse enough to encourage you to experiment and backtrack while not being so difficult as to seem unfair. Most notably, Axiom Verge absolutely nails the atmosphere of dread, isolation, and the sense that you've been dropped into the middle of something much larger and much weirder than you can imagine. The pixel art brings to mind the work of H.R. Giger, while the music drones and whirrs like the workings of some enormous out-of-sight machine. That the game achieves this much is all the more remarkable when you consider that it's largely the work of one individual, and deliberately adheres to the visual limitations of the NES hardware - except when it doesn't, which is used to unsettling effect.   The only real criticism that I can level against this game is that some of the items feel superfluous and underpowered, as I found myself mostly just using one or two different weapons for the majority of the game. Then again, this tendency may just be that those weapons simply fit my own playstyle the best, so this criticism is only minor.  Anyway, should you get Axiom Verge? Yes, absolutely, if you at all enjoy platformers, creeping horror, and gribbly biomechanical visuals.

Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 22h 48m Rec Positive It's by far the BEST Metroidvania out there! Play it and you won't regret it if you like that kind of games.

Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 71h 48m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvanias availiable on Steam. Weird story, weird world - A very fun experience.
Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 13h 46m Rec Positive A true to feel metroid game that pays remarkable tribute to the original NES game. Worth a playthrough, it was a fun trip through a nostalgic genre with an original feel and unique take.
Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 11h 56m Rec Positive Best game in the world
Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 35h 46m Rec Positive If you like metroid, please, by all means, buy this game.
Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 31h 26m Rec Positive .
Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 23h 6m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a great follow-up for anyone who loves the 2D Metroid style games. Plenty to explore, incredible weapons variety, & a lot of the familiar tropes from the genre, but with great twists. Highly recommended if you loved Metroid and want a delightful throwback to play.
Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 11h 41m Rec Positive Excellent Metrodian that brings back everything i loved about this type of game.
Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 26h 58m Rec Positive This game remains one of my favourite metroidvanias.  With depth of story and beautiful environments, I can't not give this game a strong recommendation and anyone reading this should buy it and play it.
Date 2018-11-22 Playtime 16h 22m Rec Positive Excellent metroidvania game. Great soundtrack, many different weapon types that fulfill different roles and the controls are very response. As someone who grew up with NES and SNES the graphics really appeal to me and from a nostalgia point of view, they're spot on.
Date 2018-11-21 Playtime 20h 33m Rec Positive Excellent game
Date 2018-11-21 Playtime 15h 5m Rec Positive Świetna platformówka w klimatach retro z wymagającym poziomem trudności i wciągającą fabułą, aczkolwiek nadaje się jedynie jako jednorazowe doświadczenie. Mimo to gorąco polecam.
Date 2018-11-21 Playtime 18h 3m Rec Positive muito bom
Date 2018-11-20 Playtime 18h 6m Rec Positive A good, difficult metroidvania with an original theme.
Date 2018-11-19 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania.
Date 2018-11-19 Playtime 15h 24m Rec Positive One of the best "retro" platformers on steam. Although more than "Metroidvania" i would call it a "Metroid-like" since  it obviously doesn't take much from Castlevania. Definitely a recomendation for anyone who likes old school platformers and specially for fans of the classic metroid games.  The weapon selection is fantastic and the exploration is really nice if you like looking for little secrets on walls and the such. Yeah, some of the secrets are pretty much impossible to find by yourself but most of them you can find on your first run if you take the time to explore properly and even if you don't like to explore like that you can still play the game and beat it just fine by following the most basic rule of Metroidvania games; visit every room you can enter.  If anything, i would have liked the game to have a save room teleporting mechanic since travelling between the different areas can be a little annoying. Also, a melee weapon could have been really fun.  All in all it's a great game for any fan of the genre but don't play it if you're looking for a game that tells you where you need to go next like Guacameele.  
Date 2018-11-17 Playtime 11h 23m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a decent Metroidvania. The graphics, music and general aesthetic are enjoyable for the most part. I had fun with the various abilities and it was cool using the glitch gun to see what effects it had on things. There are tons of secrets to uncover. It's impressive that this game was made by one person, but there are still some flaws. There are like 20 different guns, yet I never used any other than the first 3 I found because most of them were useless. Sometimes I found a cleverly hidden secret path only to have it lead to a lore book or something else not very exciting. I would recommend this game on sale if you're in the mood for a Metroid-style game.
Date 2018-11-14 Playtime 15h 17m Rec Negative The boss fight is unbelievably boring and stupid. It destroys the whole game.
Date 2018-11-13 Playtime 26h 29m Rec Positive best game ever, if u are missing supermetroid u need to play that shit!
Date 2018-11-12 Playtime 25h 31m Rec Positive Excellent platformer game. I like the non-linearity, great soundtrack and the 8-bit graphics is phenomenal. Even the story is great. It is a difficult but rewarding game.
Date 2018-11-10 Playtime 17h 0m Rec Positive The game overall is quite short, clocking in around seven hours for my first full playthrough. For 20$, that may not sound like a good deal for you unless you’re looking for a Metrodvania style game. Those that are interested in this type of game probably have already bought the game already. If you’re interested, but want to wait, I would recommend purchasing the game on sale. My experience with game was overall positive. The pacing of the game doesn’t overstay its welcome and concludes with an interesting story.
Date 2018-11-06 Playtime 43h 12m Rec Positive Do you like MetroidVania? Buy this game right now!
Date 2018-11-04 Playtime 12h 22m Rec Positive Un metroidvania entretenido con una historia simple pero sólida.
Date 2018-11-03 Playtime 6h 0m Rec Negative Not as good as it could be, and many of the problems with this game are fairly unnecessary:  1) Annoying unavoidable enemies - Many enemies are completely unavoidable as far as damage goes, unless you are willing to try and scum them from offscreen. This leads to choosing between fun experiences versus not taking damage. E.g., large creature that blocks the entire horizontal hallway with deadly steam.  2) Weird slowdowns like a slow saving animation, slow transformation when using a certain ability, slow level transitions at times (load issues? I'm on a blazing fast SSD).  3) Incredibly uneven music. Some tracks are beautiful and others (annoying Middle Eastern-ish droning sound?) can become extremely grating while in those areas.  4) Weapon options are 80% useless. Lots of interesting unlocks to find for your main weapon, but most of them are objectively worse in every way other than looking cool (e.g. forking laser).  Ultimately, I can't recommend this game to even Metroidvania fans. Some of the secrets are pretty BS, too. I'd recommend Ori, Hollow Knight, or Guacamelee first.
Date 2018-11-02 Playtime 27h 44m Rec Positive one of the best metroidvania I have play
Date 2018-10-31 Playtime 1h 31m Rec Negative Axiom Verge is a modern 'retro' take on Super Metroid. It looks and sounds great, but sadly the audiovisual magic does not translate to the gameplay (which isn't inherently bad, simply uninspired).  I quickly realised I'd rather be playing Super Metroid and I'd recommend that you do the same.
Date 2018-10-27 Playtime 25h 42m Rec Positive лучший метройд за ваши деньги
Date 2018-10-26 Playtime 26h 24m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvania games out there, I had a lot of fun with this! 
Date 2018-10-19 Playtime 12h 14m Rec Positive O melhor Metroidvania feito nos últimos anos .. Uma boa variedade de biomas , Armas e inimigos . É um jogo pra quem gosta desse tipo de gênero . Jogabilidade bem adaptada pros dias de hoje e uma boa história scifi a la anos 90. Apesar de ter muita influencia de SMetroid não deixa de ter sua originalidade .. não é uma cópia e sim uma homenagem .  Nota : 8/10 (Dava pra ser um pouco maior o tempo de jogo e o final deixa um pouco a desejar)   Obs: O jogo é relativamente fácil pra quem ja jogou os clássicos desse estilo , sendo bem tranquilo achar a maioria das entradas secretas e prever os movimentos dos bosses.
Date 2018-10-17 Playtime 20h 52m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a good purchase if your looking to crave your Metroidvania itch. Love the atmosphere of the levels and the killer soundtrack. The story is pretty straightforward and there is backstory subtly added for you to discover. The combat is fun, my only complaint is that I didn't find much use if any for most of the different weapons.
Date 2018-10-16 Playtime 9h 11m Rec Positive Nice leveldesign and extremly great music.  In my opionion the best metroidvania game out there.
Date 2018-10-15 Playtime 6h 40m Rec Positive Need more games like this. If you're an old school kid from the 90's and loved Metroid on NES and SNES, or just loved platformer games in general, then get this. It's awesome. Want more. Give us moar plz.
Date 2018-10-12 Playtime 15h 0m Rec Positive I recommend this game if you're very into metroidvanias and want something to scratch that Metroid style itch.  If not I vote you pass on it. Something about this game isn't very memorable. It doesn't have great boss fights either. It does have a crazy big weapon selection, some cool concepts with phasing, but overall it was just an okay game.
Date 2018-10-11 Playtime 6h 9m Rec Positive I normally don't enjoy Metroidvanias, but for this game I'll give an exception: It is [I]good[/I]! The ending feels a bit rushed, but other than that it's one of the most satisfying games in the genre. Exploring the world is a joy, and fighting baddies is difficult but (mostly) fair. You won't get anything particularity unique out of this game, but it polishes up a number of game design aspects in ways that some devs may find intriguing. If you have a few spare hours, give it a go—you won't be disappointed!
Date 2018-10-11 Playtime 8h 28m Rec Positive Es un juego muy entretenido, me recuerda a cuando jugaba metroid aunque mas lento y frustante, pero eso no le quita lo bueno.
Date 2018-10-08 Playtime 14h 51m Rec Positive As close to a Metroid clone as it get's. Combined that element with H.R. Giger inspired art design, it's a beautiful 8-bit retro game. The protagonist is nowehere near as likable as Samus, but that's expected.
Date 2018-10-03 Playtime 30h 49m Rec Positive Świetna platformówka w stylu Metroida. Już pierwsze chwile spędzone z grą dają poczucie, że jest to bardzo solidna produkcja, która na pewno wciągnie na wiele godzin. Jeśli ktoś grał w jakiegoś Metroida od czasów SNES to będzie się tu czuł jak w domu. Choć wiele mechanik się zmienia to idea eksploracji mapy jest ta sama, czyli sukcesywnie zdobywamy nowe umiejętności w celu dostania się do wcześniej niedostępnych obszarów. Przy okazji znajdując rożne bronie, polepszenia i inne znajdźki w mniejszym lub większym stopniu posuwające wątek fabularny do przodu.  Jeśli chodzi o oprawę graficzną to momentami widać tu pewne niedoskonałości, zwłaszcza w późniejszych etapach, ale w ogólnym rozrachunku jest bardzo dobrze, zwłaszcza, że gra jest dziełem jednej osoby. Muzyka to fantastyczna robota i naprawdę mocno wpływa na klimat przedstawionego świata.  Podsumowując Axiom Verge to bardzo dobra gra, świetnie zrealizowana, wciągająca i okraszona ciekawą fabułą.  Zdecydowanie polecam!
Date 2018-09-25 Playtime 26h 14m Rec Positive Alright, I have to do something of a rewrite of my original review as I initially felt the game was a bit of a mixed bag... but it ended up being very memorable and I wanted to play it again after beating it so yeah, my opinion is different now so the review should be too; hopefully more concise this time as well.  Overall, it's an exceptional game and possibly one of the best Metroidvanias, bringing a great gameplay experience and a more interesting story than most in the genre. High points include: the environments, the music, the story, the level design and the progression(item-wise) - the fact that this was literally a one man design team is frankly ridiculous,  The low point, in my opinion, is the combat; some enemies have frustrating patterns or are too sturdy.. and many do a lot of damage and can slow down the exploration/kill you incidentally, some of the boss designs were also too frustrating(a couiple in particular, which definitely left a bad taste in my mouth), and we have a TON of guns to choose from(which the different guns of equal strength is a GREAT idea)... however most were pretty weak or super situational, I would've much rather had fewer better guns that the game was balanced around.  At the end of the day, though, it's a great game, extremely worth playing, and any fan of the genre should pick it up and go through it; at least stick it out ~4 hours where the story really picks up. Highly recommended.
Date 2018-09-24 Playtime 22h 59m Rec Positive Très bon jeu qui plaira à tous les amoureux de Metroidvania, bande son très sympa, gameplay aux petits oignons et diverses surprises qui confèrent à ce titre une vraie personnalité qui lui est propre et n'en font pas un simple clone de super Metroid sans saveur comme on a pu en voir pulluler sur la toiule. Comptez environ une quinzaine d'heure pour faire le trour de l'histoire, après seuls ceux qui visent le 100% auront encore du travail...  Je recommande ce jeu : 4/5

Date 2018-09-17 Playtime 15h 52m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an amazing introduction to players who, like, me, got into metroidvanias through it. It may not be Hollow Knight, but it has some of the best soundtracks ever made for a videogame. The only real issue is the backtracking. Do NOT backtrack unless you're sure you can't progress anymore, or you're going to lose a lot of time. 8/10. Pretty fucking great.
Date 2018-09-17 Playtime 6h 48m Rec Positive 画风诡异的银河战士
Date 2018-09-17 Playtime 20h 24m Rec Positive Juego recomendable si se tiene MUCHA paciencia, tiempo y si te molan los 'Metroidvanias'. Los tiempos de carga en los puntos de guardado (véase el mensaje de 'partida guardada') y las entradas de los bosses se me hacen largas y pueden llegar a cortar la rapidez del juego. En cuanto a los gráficos y banda sonora el juego es estupendo, nada que decir en contra. Los controles son buenos, pero el personaje se atasca al mantener 3 o 4 teclas a la vez.  7.75/10 Bastante recomendado.
Date 2018-09-16 Playtime 1h 53m Rec Positive 10/10 
Date 2018-09-10 Playtime 27h 49m Rec Positive Amazing game. Played through it on PS4 a few years ago and loved it, and had just as much of a blast on the steam version. Highly recomend. One of my all time favorites.
Date 2018-09-10 Playtime 16h 3m Rec Positive This was a fun game for a semi-casual player.  I imagine that if I were a speed running freak, I'd like this game even more.  Smooth gameplay and movement with a variety of features and weapons made for a great time.  The story was also interesting too, with an extra tidbit to the ending if you go the extra mile during gameplay.  I'd recommend it to any lovers of Metroidvanias or retro-style games.
Date 2018-09-09 Playtime 18h 4m Rec Positive A pretty standard Metroidvania game, albeit a well-done one. Interesting sci-fi narrative, and fun to play at first, but for me it falls apart in the third act. The ending I got felt confusing and unsatisfactory, and I suspect there may be another ending hidden in there, but honestly I'm not interested enough to play it again and find out. Worth a look if you can get it at a discount.
Date 2018-09-09 Playtime 18h 4m Rec Positive Simply one of the best medroidvania game i played. Good, atmospheric music is a bonus :)
Date 2018-09-07 Playtime 29h 31m Rec Positive Excellent metroidvania game. Oozing with the old school vibe of the classic 8 and 16 bit sidescrollers...those were the days. Nostlgia aside the combat is not the most challenging but is enjoyable, the exploartion is top notch, the soundtrack is excellent and it has several inventive gameplay mechanics. Highly recommended.

Date 2018-09-03 Playtime 10h 11m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an embodiment of the good design principles of the metroid-vainia genre. The movement is solid, the soundtrack and level design are very interesting, and there's enough of item-based puzzle solving to keep you challenged without challenging your progress. At some points I was a little lost as to where to go next and I think the map could use a little more detail, but all in all I think Axiom Verge is great. If this game is like a more optimized 21st-century version of the oridignal NES Metroid, I can't wait to see what the "Super Axiom Verge" game will be!
Date 2018-09-02 Playtime 19h 10m Rec Positive Bardzo dobry tytuł. Mistrzoswtwo w gatunku,
Date 2018-09-01 Playtime 22h 22m Rec Positive it's not super metroid but its close
Date 2018-08-30 Playtime 41h 41m Rec Positive It's a metroidvania that's practically all metroid and no casltevania. Graphically it reminds me more of Contra (especially the later levels where it looks more alien)- but that's where the comparison ends.   This game is brilliant, and it controls exactly like you expect it to. It runs on any potato, and it requires literally no fucking around with the controller; its native settings are perfect. Just plug in and go.   My only very trivial, stupid complaint is that while the music is fucking awesome, I wish whomever did the music had looped it a bit better. Most songs end with a low fade away and then start back up. Like I said, stupid and trivial, and it's certainly no game-breaker.  I give it a 9.5/10. Best game I've played in years.
Date 2018-08-29 Playtime 19h 39m Rec Positive I was not interested in this game because it seemed to be too similar to metroid. And it really is a clone, but a surprisingly good one. It has enough fresh mechanics and clever level design to be addicting and engaging. I enjoyed AV a lot and would recommend it to anybody who likes metroid or sci fi.
Date 2018-08-29 Playtime 14h 25m Rec Positive This game is awesome!! Bein' a fan of metroivania's style you have all the elements you're waiting for in this game, secrets you'll find by unlocking abilities, action gameplay hard but doable after you train a little bit.  The story  also has it's twist and I really fell for it, I had the urge to finish to game to see how this story will turn and I must say I wasn't disapointed it did surpise me because this kind of game is not really the one where you expect a good written story but it is a nice surprise.  As I grew up with Bionic Commando it was a blast to see a game who reuse the mechanic from the NES game but without the flaws of the original, plus implanted in an organic/ Sci-Fi / Metroide ambiant.  The music is kind of creepy at some point but actually does give the right tone to what is going on around you.  If you search for a good metroidevania's game I can only recommend Axiom Verge.
Date 2018-08-28 Playtime 23h 26m Rec Positive This is such an amazing game, and I love it so much. One of the best platformers I have played, with beautiful pixel graphics and gameplay. There are so many secrets in this game that you can invest your time into, allowing you to discover new strange weapons, abilities and texts, which are all always exciting to find. The secrets in this game are much better hidden than in most platformers I have played. I wish some were not so well hidden, as I would have enjoyed to find all weapons, but overall enjoyed hunting for the 11 that I had acquired by the end. Each weapon is so unique and have their own pros and cons, so they must be chosen wisely in fights. Many times when I thought the game was coming to an end it continuosly suprised me with yet another zone to complete. The music was immersive and suited the game. I highly recommend this game.
Date 2018-08-28 Playtime 17h 8m Rec Positive Cool Metroidvania.  [spoiler]The ending sucks though.[/spoiler]
Date 2018-08-27 Playtime 20h 7m Rec Positive ノーマルでクリア済み。 探索メインのゲームで、やりごたえのあるアクションゲームを求めてる人には向かないかもしれない。 ボス戦なんかも単調であった。 探索部分はそれなりに楽しめたが、エリア間などでの瞬間移動が無いこともあり移動が少々面倒であった。一応エリア間をつなぐ連絡通路のようなものはあったが。 
Date 2018-08-27 Playtime 13h 55m Rec Positive El primer juego 'metroidvania' que juego, y me pareció espectacular. Escenarios geniales, mecánicas divertidas, armas/herramientas únicas, enemigos en su mayoría difíciles, —sobre todo los jefes, lo cual me causó muchos problemas para terminarlo pero no por ello me cansé de intentarlo. Axiom Verge es un videojuego memorable.  Mi valoración: 95/100 - Extraordinario
Date 2018-08-25 Playtime 11h 29m Rec Positive Great sidescroller/metroidvania, with classic looks. Lots of weapons, items, powerups, lore pieces and other things to find, which also provide the game with some very interesting mechanics, such as the ability to "glitch" your enemies into beings that behave differently, which can be a good thing or a bad thing in the given context. I guess the boss battles were ok-ish, some of them were rather bad if you couldn't figure out their "trick", but most should be straightforward, besides the punishment for dying is pretty much none as you respawn at the closest "save egg" anyway (is a plus for me).  The worldbuilding is fantastic in this one, and the story around it is quite interesting as well, though vague, and without closure. Loved finding more information about it after finishing the game and reading what other people thought would be plausible explanations for the events that happen in the game's story.  It's not a very long game by any means, you can finish it within 8-13 hours on normal difficulty, perhaps longer if you decide that you must find everything. I managed to discover 87% of the world and find only 60% (to my surprise) of the items in over 11 hours, without really playing in a hurry. There are also secret areas that are randomly accessed, which is quite neat!
Date 2018-08-24 Playtime 17h 25m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a fantastic Metroidvania style game.  Right from the start, it feels close to playing the original Metroid from the art style and tight controls.  There's tons of weapons, power ups, and other collectibles to find scattered all throughout the game world to keep things interesting.  It has a decent number of world zones and plenty of varied enemies to keep things fresh.  Secrets are everywhere to be found, even after you've been back and forth through the same area a number of times.  Boss fights that can be somewhat challenging without being stupidly hard.  Just an overall great game.  I found that through the majority of the game, it was pretty straight forward for where you needed to go.  It did get a little foggy when it got closer to the end with me searching back and forth multiple times to find what I needed to progress, but I was able to finish the game entirely without having to look up a walkthrough, video, or help guide of any kind.  To give an idea of the game time for a blind run, I spent a little less than 17 hours completing the game on my first run through and I ended with 83% item completion and 97% of the map.  This is strongly recommended for anyone that likes the original NES/SNES Metroid games.
Date 2018-08-23 Playtime 12h 21m Rec Positive This is exactly what I want from a Metroidvania.  ⚫ A powerful soundtrack! Very fitting for the game's atmosphere and have this mysterious and creepy vibe. ⚫ Branching paths with satisfying rewards so you can explore beyond the main route. ⚫ Introducing new and game changing mechanics, this is something Axiom Verge excels at <3 ⚫ Multiple weapons so I can change up my style anytime and experiment with lots of different techniques ⚫ This mysterious ambience that covers the story. It's great way to keep the player on their toes and also makes radical changes in the story really impactful.  Some minor critique would be that secrets sometimes are behind breakeble tiles that have little to no indication of beeing breakeble. Can make you suspect every block whether it's destructible or not.  All this tech mumbo jumbo and otherwise similaritys to great games as Super Metroid and System Shock 2 are just big ups for me, I love this kind of stuff. It's obvious that someone really cared for this gem. It's well worth the asking price! 9/10
Date 2018-08-22 Playtime 16h 40m Rec Positive 9/10  For it's genre, this is a near-perfect game.  Good: - Some of the best music in any game. Enjoy a heavy synth track that matches each moment, map and boss. - A well thought out plot that is presented both directly and indirectly in a way that peaks your interest and makes you want to read into the subtext of indirect plot. I can't stress enough, there's a lot going on this plot, and it twists and turns all over the place. Nothing is as it is presented at face value. - A programming themed plot, hard to not love that. - Lots of weapons, no need to collect them all. This adds a lot of replay value. In fact, 3 of the weapons can only be obtaind in a secret world that only appears once. You only get one per play through, and their value is appropriate, very powerful but not overpowered. The balance of each weapon is fantastic. You will find some that feel all purpose, and others that counter specific enemies perfectly. - Lots of abilities. Not as many as there are weapons, but the uses for your abilities are numerous. You can glitch pieces of the world in and out, or you can use the same tool to corrupt enemies for anything from an easier target to a literal wrecking ball to use in your favor.  Cons: - Only one - the game is a bit long and there's not a lot of ways to move quickly through the map. A handful of teleports, maybe one per section at the farthest section would have offset having to travel through that entire section to reach the center train. Basically, expect a lot of running time where you pretty much want to avoid enemies and just get to your destination. Also expect figuring out that destination to take a bit of staring at the map and your notes.  Recommend to anyone who likes: - Metroidvania games (This game is an homage to the genre) - Deep, deep sci-fi plots with real world philosophical implications - Unique pixel animation, you'll never see another game that *looks* quite like this.

Date 2018-08-20 Playtime 10h 3m Rec Positive I want to start this review by saying that, overall, this is a good game.  That said, there are probably better Metroidvania games for you to pursue.  This game spends a lot of your time making you lost in ways that other Metroidvanias won't.  It's good that it doesn't hold your hand, but with no fast travel and little to no direction as to where you need to go next, this game gets frustrating really quickly.  It was a bit of a toss-up as to whether or not this game was a thumbs up or thumbs down, but I decided on a thumbs-up because it was, mostly, a well-designed Metroidvania, but the frustrations were REALLY frustrating.  Also, it worked really well as a piece of software, even on Linux, which is really nice.  If you've run out of Metroidvanias, maybe pick this one up.
Date 2018-08-19 Playtime 25h 53m Rec Positive Absolutely love this game, reminds me a lot of the old metroid games i used to play and it just has a nostalgic feel to it
Date 2018-08-19 Playtime 15h 47m Rec Positive La claque!! Ce jeu est indispensable pour tous les amateurs de metroidvania. Bien sur, on dirait metroid mais qu'importe, a moins d'émuler, on a pas accès aux jeux de big N. le gameplay répond au doigt et a l'oeil, game design très intéressant, graphismes pour les adorateurs du pixel art 16 bits. Mention spéciale aux boss, juste magnifiques, meme si peu difficiles dans l'ensemble. 
Date 2018-08-17 Playtime 14h 14m Rec Positive Um excelente Metroidvania. Com certeza coloco no meu top10.
Date 2018-08-16 Playtime 11h 45m Rec Positive Recentemente, esse jogo perdeu o trono de melhor Metroidvania que eu já joguei pra Hollow Knight. MAS isso não é, de forma alguma, um problema. Axiom Verge é insanamente bom em tudo que faz: a trilha sonora, os gráficos, a jogabilidade, os mistérios, o enredo... Acho que o que mais brilha nele, é ser muito Metroidvania raíz. Ou seja, você vai ficar perdido VÁRIAS vezes até encontrar o que precisa ou achar onde deve ir. E essa é a alma de um bom Metroidvania mesmo, a exploração incessante e o mistério envolvido nela seguindo a história. E mais um ponto muito maluco sobre esse jogo, que quando subiu os créditos, eu me recusei a acreditar. Aconteceu o mesmo comigo com Stardew Valley, que é: apenas UMA pessoa fez esse jogo. Essas obras são a prova viva de que os X-Men não são mera ficção.
Date 2018-08-16 Playtime 20h 9m Rec Positive Real Metroid feeling with a few modern graphical gimmicks and enough original ideas to be more than just a clone. Exploration and secrets galore, engaging story.
Date 2018-08-11 Playtime 24h 8m Rec Positive I just finished playing Axiom Verge and I have to say, this was a very good game.   The gameplay is very much in the same vein as Super Metroid. You get a gigantic map full of secrets, upgrades and an array of bad guys just asking to be blown up. It is very open ended and should really please fans looking for a Metroid kick.  The art style of the game is just fantastic. Each area has a unique enviroment, whether it's the slimey red starting area, grey and rocky, lots of lush vegetation and greens or the mechanical grey, there is always something new to look at. The enemies and creatures also look excellent with a nice array of styles. The bosses in particular look great. They're quite grotesque with a hint of Geiger creeping out every now and again. Who doesn't like taking orders from 20ft tall severed android heads?!  The biggest highlight of the game is by far the music. The sound track has a great synthesiser sound throughout which really goes well with the strange enviroments. Most of the areas have their own theme, some of which are better than others but are consistently great through out. You might get a bit fed up of hearing a couple of tracks as you start back tracking to pick up secrets. But that doesn't mean they're bad, not at all.  For the most part, Axiom Verge controls very well. The main character jumps around with great accuracy and moves around quite fast. Later on in the game you are equipped with a dash feature and a grappling hook. These features are great when they work but tend to have their moments when they want to make your game as frustrating as possible. This makes certain puzzles a bit of a pain, some of which I admittedly gave up on.  I would have liked to have seen secrets marked on the map. It would have made it a lot easier to back track. Unfortunately we're not given any indication of secret locations and items. This means that without an item map, it can become a bit frustrating and/or tedious. Talking of secrets, most of them are extra weapons. These weapons range from giant laser beams, electricty rays and what is effectively multiple grenade launchers. There are only a hand full of weapons that are actually useful (pick up that Flamethrower!), this makes the back tracking a little pointless.   Another gripe that I have is with specific enemies that bum rush your position. It gets a little annoying when they immediately fire upon you within a second of the screen loading. Between the surprise, high speed and the fact they're bullet sponges, these enemies are quite hard to avoid. The game would have been hugely improvemed without these enemies. You'll find most of them at the end game, it makes getting to the final boss extremely tedious and unenjoyable.   Despite my complaints, I still thought that Axiom Verge was a great game. It could do with a few tweaks, something we might see in a sequel (hopefully). The folks who worked on this game should be proud. If you're into Metroidvania games with a distinct sci-fi feel, this is a game for you.
Date 2018-08-07 Playtime 15h 55m Rec Positive I personally didn't quite like the "feel" of the levels (they look kinda samy). Other than that - this is a great game. Music is great, there are lots of new abilities to aquire, the movement is good - go play it now!
Date 2018-08-07 Playtime 18h 52m Rec Positive Best metroidvania ive played recently, music is awesome, really good story, great gameplay, totally addictive.
Date 2018-08-06 Playtime 5h 46m Rec Positive ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS !! everything seems to be so good in this , the music is mysterious and upbeat at times, and scary with that 8bit music style, you will go through that nostalgic feels  the textures and background are just perfectly done. the details are on point .  
Date 2018-08-05 Playtime 17h 43m Rec Positive What an amazing game. The upgrades makes you feel stronger. When all upgrades are done, you feel like you can do anything. Musics are good. Graphics are too good. Color palette is the best.
Date 2018-08-05 Playtime 14h 39m Rec Positive Compre el juego para darle una oportunidad, a ver si me gustaba, no me arrepiento, es un excelente juego de plataforma, con varias armas,  además cuando piensas que no encuentras la salida, la encuentras si te recuerdas o busca donde no recorriste anteriormente, los puntos de guarde fue por lo que casi no lo compre, porque pensé que no tenía guardado, pero si hay varios puntos de guardes en cada pedazo del mapa, una buena historia te esperara al jugarlo, una buena exploración que te anima, casi prácticamente a recorrer todo el mapa, lo Recomiendo Excelente juego.

Date 2018-08-05 Playtime 19h 22m Rec Positive A great metroid inspired game.
Date 2018-08-03 Playtime 17h 13m Rec Positive Amazing Ride from Beginning to End!  Graphics: 8/10 - Retro Graphics which not only look nice but fit the theme of the perfectly.  Atmosphere:  7/10 - Unnerving environment that barely seems to be held together matches the graphics and story perfect.  Sound 7/10 - Some really good nice tunes.  Story 9/10 - I started off hating the protagonist, The look of him and his dialog but slowly i grew to feel his blight. This lead me to feel a genuine connection with the characters/villians of the story. I was Surprised by how much the story impacted me in the end and is a sign of excellent writing.  Gameplay 8.5/10 - The gameplay is Metriodvania in Feel and form, Loved every moment of it.   Overall 8.5/10 - Recommended without a doubt. Easily a MUST BUY!!!

Date 2018-07-31 Playtime 0h 45m Rec Positive Prepara o Home Theather, fones e regule os graves e agudos. Esse jogo primeiro não é 8 bits, é super 8 bits. Com um visual lindo e jogabilidade no estilo “Old School”, e com uma das melhores e mais envolventes trilhas sonoras de todos os tempos, é claro com excelentes efeitos sonoros. Para um jogo de plataforma e tiro, este não é linear como a maioria dos games que adotam essa jogabilidade, pois seus “labirintos” embalados pela excelente trilha sonora induzem o jogador a buscar todos os seus segredos. Dentro desses labirintos encontra-se uma variedade de armas e poderes que podem ser acumulados, deixando o jogador com vontade de conquistar todos eles. Em relação a história, apesar de ser um tema bastante recorrente na cultura pop, por exemplo John Carter, um dos primeiros livros no começo do século passado (1912) que fala da saga humana em um planeta desconhecido, e nos games temos, por exemplo, o saudoso Another World (1991). A história apresenta-se de forma bastante criativa neste game e muito bem construída, chegando ao ponto de justificar a volta do personagem quando morre, ou seja, deixando de ser um simples continue ou próxima vida. Se você gosta e procura diversão neste estilo, desafio, ação, beleza e gosta de curtir uma música eletrônica... Esse é jogo. PS. Prepara uma caixa de grave. :)
Date 2018-07-30 Playtime 28h 2m Rec Positive Simply amazing ! Go for it , Great game for good price , Music and Art is solid too apart from gameplay which is awesome
Date 2018-07-28 Playtime 9h 42m Rec Positive the 20iq apes complaining about "not knowing what to do or where to go next" have never played a single video game in their life
Date 2018-07-28 Playtime 5h 54m Rec Positive Quality Metroidvania.  The game becomes nicely explorative as it goes on and has a very novel set of powerups.  Endgame traversal is great.
Date 2018-07-28 Playtime 13h 10m Rec Positive 一个人做的类银河城独立游戏，真的很不容易，何况质量又这么高。 当初2015年刚刚发售时就被像素风吸引，确定此作为必须体验的游戏之一。无奈当时仍有其他大作体验，国区尚未划分，价格20刀着实难以下手。一拖，就拖到了今年[spoiler] （其实是2017年夏促50%OFF的时候我和朋友打赌如果2018夏促史低依旧是50%我就入手……）	[/spoiler]。  画面：精美的像素风格，像素风爱好者的福利。 音乐：很有异域风格的情调，符合游戏内剧情主题。 操作：流畅爽快，无阻碍感。 剧情：讲真的你不收全笔记还真不知道啥是真相，NPC对话只能了解大概。  9.2/10.0  后记：此作是我在通关《空洞骑士》之后再玩的，同属类银河城游戏，此作难度比空洞骑士要低了很多，一周目通关死亡16次，而空洞骑士仅苦痛之路就要我200+。正常流程估计也不下60次了。但内容丰富度、画面音乐表现确实是空洞骑士要高一筹。此作难度不高，敌人BOSS规律很好找，容错率也很高。即使一时打不过，先收集血上限，切换武器打法也可以让难度降低不少。而空洞骑士你如果手残反应不够快，真就是打不过的……但无论如何，二者在我内心2D横版过关独立游戏评价中仍是佼佼者的代表。[spoiler] （接下来就剩《死亡细胞》和《盐与避难所》了）	[/spoiler]
Date 2018-07-26 Playtime 12h 48m Rec Positive In the style of metroid but with it's own personality, story, and unique items / mechanics.  Super fun!!
Date 2018-07-24 Playtime 18h 4m Rec Positive A falta de un Metroid en Steam, bueno es este homenaje.
Date 2018-07-24 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive very noice game
Date 2018-07-24 Playtime 17h 45m Rec Positive Beaten! 17 hours  Axiom Verge is a very good quality Metroidvania game with a few minor flaws (as I see them). Overall a very fun game that is certainly worth the time.  Pros: - An interesting story - Art is great - Lots of weapons and items - Secrets abound! - Combat is fun  Cons: There are 2 primary gripes I have about this game that make it more frustrating at times than it should be: 1. No fast travel system. Okay, there is KIND OF a fast travel system, but it only gets you so far. If you want to get from one area to another, largely you have to walk it.  This is helped a little by the fact the world itself isnt super huge. 2. The game often just doesnt tell you where you need to go. Dont get me wrong, I like exploring, but when I have to consistently circle the map in search of an unknown item or door or something I am missing because I cant otherwise progress, it becomes frustrating.  Some might not mind the gripes. I like the game a lot, but I just wish I didnt have to rely on youtube playthroughs to figure out where to go next.  An easy recommendation with those caviats
Date 2018-07-24 Playtime 0h 52m Rec Positive Enjoyed it.
Date 2018-07-23 Playtime 26h 57m Rec Positive Metroid fans, are your bodies ready?
Date 2018-07-22 Playtime 17h 28m Rec Positive Nice. Exactly what I thought it was gonna be. Really fun but it is easy to get lost and not know where to go. Use the map markers or whatever. Fun game
Date 2018-07-22 Playtime 12h 29m Rec Negative Meh.  Started out fun, then it got bogged down by WAYYYYYYYY too much story that only makes sense to the game developer.  Too many weapons that suck and I know there was several I missed..  You will end up using the same 3 weapons over and over.  Too much backtracking.  Probably worth it if you are a diehard Metrodvania fan.
Date 2018-07-21 Playtime 20h 4m Rec Positive One of the best Metroidvania games on Steam, must buy.
Date 2018-07-20 Playtime 13h 34m Rec Positive 記得我第1次看到這款遊戲，是在去年的冬季特賣期間，瀏覽商品佇列時看到的。^^當時的我對於這款遊戲的2D動態背景與音樂印象很深刻，直到今年的夏季特賣時，我才正式購買這款遊戲。^^ 由於我先前玩的2D橫向卷軸遊戲並不多，因此剛開始玩的時候，首先就是要熟悉鍵盤的操作方式。^^雖然一開始感覺還不是很順手，但隨著劇情往後走，也會找到更強的武器，對抗敵人也會變得容易許多。^^不過這款遊戲還是在面對Boss的時候最具挑戰性，可能要多花一點時間去分析Boss的攻擊模式與弱點，然後保持耐心慢慢解決對方。XD 除了對抗敵人之外，探索一整個遊戲地圖，去尋找遊戲中的各種道具，也是我很享受的過程之一。^^整體而言我認為遊戲的劇情設計相當有創意，武器與魔物的種類也相當多樣化。^^但如同我上面所說的，我最欣賞的部分，還是在於遊戲的2D動態背景與音樂，除了背景相當精美之外，音樂也相當融入遊戲的場景呢!^^如果再思考到整個遊戲的背景、音樂和程式設計，全都由Thomas Happ一手包辦，那又讓我覺得更不可思議了。XD 對於第1次將遊戲通關的我而言，這真的是一款相當不錯的遊戲呢!^^不過我本身並還沒有將整個遊戲的地圖全部探索完，也許在找到全部的道具之後，玩起來應該會更容易吧!^^不過如果想要達成全成就的話，可就要花加倍的時間努力才行了咧!XD
Date 2018-07-19 Playtime 23h 48m Rec Positive To just call this game a "metroid-like" or "metroidvania" doesn't do it justice. Does it function in a similar way to those games? Yes, but it feels like its own thing, something new, while also paying tribute to its predecessors.  I might not go as far as to call it flawless, but I think I could say it's "technically flawless," in that it never gave me any errors, always functioned as its supposed to, something that's particularly impressive from a 1-person dev team (especially when AAA design studios can't manage that).  Give this game a try--you'll be supporting a real person, not a soulless corporation!
Date 2018-07-19 Playtime 101h 23m Rec Positive JOGAÇO MARAVILHOSO! Desde a trilha sonora VICIANTE até o enredo de GRUDAR os olhos na tela, passando pelos graficos que é uma verdadeira OBRA PRIMA em pixelart, Axiom Verge não deixa NADA a desejar (especialmente para os fãs mais oldschool)! O game honra o genero metroidvania com "H" maiúsculo! Absolutamente nostálgico e altamente viciante, é inacreditável saber que o game INTEIRO foi desenvolvido por UMA ÚNICA pessoa! Mecânica, jogabilidade, gráficos, enredo, trilha sonora, jogabilidade.... NADA é sequer ligeiramente mediano! Simplesmente um dos MELHORES jogos que eu já tive o prazer de fechar em toda minha VIDA! Recomendadíssimo!
Date 2018-07-19 Playtime 16h 0m Rec Positive Good game
Date 2018-07-19 Playtime 9h 30m Rec Positive Looking for a great metroidvania game with great mapping system, and challenging bosses? Then this is the game for you! The world and levels are cleaverly designed, just as a Metroidvania game should be. This game also offer a good progression system and decent story.
Date 2018-07-19 Playtime 17h 55m Rec Positive This game scratched my MetroidVania itch so well. The art style is fantastic and the soundtrack is something I listen to all the time.  The themes and plot of this are also really strong, something I haven't come to expect of the genre.  Highly recommended.
Date 2018-07-18 Playtime 14h 55m Rec Positive The best metroidvania you can find on steam
Date 2018-07-18 Playtime 11h 41m Rec Positive If you have an itch for Metroid this game is for you.  Exploring bio-mechanical environments constantly moving at the rhythm of a eerie but driving soundtrack was definitely awesome.  Graphics can be a bit of hit and miss. I had trouble seeing details and finding my character in some specific environments but in general the pixel art feels good.   While having a pretty original aesthetics I think I can't say the same about the gameplay.  To put it simple, this game feels a lot like super metroid but with a bunch more weapons. This doesn't mean its a bad thing because it does it REALLY good.  
Date 2018-07-17 Playtime 44h 6m Rec Positive Jogo sensasional! Falta mais jogos únicos em sua essência como Axion Verge.
Date 2018-07-16 Playtime 11h 10m Rec Positive Axiom Verge isn't perfect. Some of the areas felt too similar, moslty early on, like palette swaps with a couple of unique enemies and features. Traversing the world was a little slow, partly because of your movement speed and partly because the game encourages careful play by having tough enemies and rare health drops - while this is fine during initial exploration, it was a bit tedious to return to areas and look for new paths and items. More shortcuts would have been welcome too. Bosses have too much health, and by the time I beat one, I had usually reached a point where I felt like I had mastered it (which was satisfying) and was just waiting for it to die (which was dull). And the game started to feel like a slog during the last couple of sections, which is the worst place for a game's quality to drop off, since it can sour the whole experience.  But I just wanted to get my complaints out of the way before I started with the praise. Axiom Verge is clearly inspired by the 2D Metroid titles, and it does an excellent job of recreating what made those games great while managing to become more than just a clone. The atmosphere is great, evoking the feeling of exploring a hostile alien world that is the core of these sorts of titles, nostalgic without feeling like an imitation. The music, while I didn't find it the most memorable, was suitable and certainly helped with that. I felt the difficulty was perfectly balanced on Normal, being challenging and pushing me to experiment and play smart without ever getting frustrating (I was surprised to find I had cleared the game with under 20 deaths - it certainly felt harder). And the exploration was excellent, which seems the rarest thing for these games to get right: I rarely felt items were just keys to unlock thinly-veiled doors. For every upgrade I saw coming, there was another that caught me off guard, and many were creative and fun to use either way.  Complaints about later stages aside, Axiom Verge just kept surprising and impressing me. If you're a fan of the 2D Metroid titles and similar games, I can't recommend this game enough. There's a lot to see in this game, and even if it isn't all gold, it's definitely worth your time to explore. If you're not... well, you probably won't enjoy it, to be honest. The game does its own thing, and does it well, but it's still very focused on what it wants to be. But if you're new to these Metroidvania sorts of games, Axiom Verge is an excellent title, and there are certainly worse places you could start.
Date 2018-07-15 Playtime 24h 56m Rec Positive Great game, so far the best Metroid-like game for Windows I know of.
Date 2018-07-14 Playtime 17h 36m Rec Positive Juego obligado para el que le gustan los metroidvanias, tiene muchas sorpresas y cosas que no te las esperas. La historia es buena y la música también. Lo único criticable es lo fáciles que son los bosses, no hay que encontrar una estrategia o manera de vencerlos, es disparar hasta que mueran y listo, sin duda el punto débil del juego pero no lo opaca. El resto es perfecto, mucho para explorar y rejugar si querés tener el 100% del mapa e items descubiertos.  9/10 para mi
Date 2018-07-14 Playtime 5h 49m Rec Positive Where have you been all my life?? Axiom Verge tops so many lists for good reason. It took everything that Metroid did to the extreme. And polishes it to the most lusterous sheen I've seen in decades. I love drilling for secret paths, hacking enemies that are difficult to deal with, swapping weapons to get the job done right... It's just an amazing experience. Graphically it's superb, the sound is also done justice. My only complaint would be that the sound of the drill takes me back to sitting in a dentist's chair. I cringe a little bit at the sound, which is unfortunate since many secrets will require a ton of drilling to find but that's just one of my personal issues. Maybe I shouldn't eat so much candy. Instead, I'll sit down with the sweet treat that is Axiom Verge.  There is always something to critique in games and although I had to dig fairly deep, I would change just a couple things in this title. Namely the shooting... While none of the enemies present too much of a problem the shooting in Axiom Verge still feels rather clunky. 8 directions simply isn't enough. This is almost remedied by the addition of being able to lock yourself in place, but I'd much rather lock my shooting position and still be able to move since in Axiom Verge you will often need to be moving in some way. Still, the solution is functional and it really is a minor complaint that is buried under a trove of retro-styled nostalgic goodness. I can't believe I've waited this long to actually sit down and give Axiom Verge a try... This should've been on my channel during its release.  We are living in a golden age of indie games and Axiom Verge is definitive proof of that fact. Metroidvanias are almost never done by larger companies anymore, so I rely on indie studios to get my fix... And boy, do they deliver! Chasm was sitting at the top of my list as the most enjoyable Metroidvania in recent years but the tight action and refined mechanics of Axiom Verge have put it up and over. Don't get me wrong, Chasm is a fantastic title... But it can't hold a candle to Axiom Verge. So much thought has gone into Axiom Verge, backtracking isn't a slog as there are tons of items to pickup with your new abilities. You literally can't go 5 rooms without tripping over some sort of powerup. That is glorious, and keeps me thirsting for more. I'm sure that Thomas Happ has been told 1000 times, but congratulations on a masterpiece.
Date 2018-07-13 Playtime 86h 7m Rec Positive Okay I'm gonna make this short and sweet. Could I review every aspect of this game in detail? Sure. But I don't wanna spoil it for ANYONE. So I'll just say this one thing for the review: AXIOM VERGE IS A LITERALLY FLAWLESS GAME. Doesn't happen often, but it happened here. The official review scores for this game are suspiciously LOW. It should have a 10/10 here, and it deserves 100% on Metacritic.   If you're not convinced yet and really want more, okay... The gameplay is natrual, fun, and perfect. The music is the best of any game for the last decade. The story is the first complex story ever in a "Metroidvania" style game, and it's deep, thought-provoking, and interestingly complex. I would call it a platform hybrid of Metroid, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and the Matrix. And it's better than all of those franchises them COMBINED. Not even exaggerating. I have beaten this game three times already and still can't get enough of it, so I'd say it has great replay value.  And please don't complain about the Passcode Tool. EVERYTHING can be found using in-game hints. EVERYTHING. Granted, one requires writing down stuff and making a cipher table, but it isn't difficult to do. This game will require you to use your brain. If you don't like that, go on back to Halo or PUBG or whatever other mindless game you play. If you like the idea of a cerebral platforming experience, there is no better game in the world than Axiom Verge.  FLAWLESS. AND I STAND BY THAT STATEMENT.
Date 2018-07-13 Playtime 12h 41m Rec Positive This is a really good game. For me, it took a while to get there though. The first hour or so was pretty rough for me, I kind of hated everything about this game. the music, the graphics, the story, and the gameplay all seemed to have something that just bothered me. I almost dropped it to never touch it again, but i'm glad i stuck with it because after a while everything kind of clicked and the things that annoyed me at first grew on me. If you're like me and hate it at first i ask that you keep with it a bit longer and who knows? It might grow on you too because this game is definitely great. Having said that, it's not perfect. For one, there's too many weapons and after picking up my 7th-8th weapon that seemed really similar to the last one i stopped getting excited when i found a new weapon. when i was exploring i almost always stuck to 2-3 weapons, the third being for really situational stuff. Honestly though, my problems with the game don't mean it's not worth playing because it is.
Date 2018-07-12 Playtime 16h 1m Rec Positive This is a fantastic metroid type game.  I won't call it a metroidvannia because there's no vannia in it.  It captures a lot of the magic of supermetroid, while still being different enough with items and game play to keep things fresh.  Exploration is fun, enviorments are atmosphereic, the music is very cool.  It has clever original gameplay mechanics that build on top of the established genre.  It's not perfect, boss battles are lame, there are too many superflious weapons, and certain story line elements fall flat.  Super Metroid is still a better game overall, but Axiom Verge is certain good enough to enjoy for 15 hours if you're a fan of the genre.  It's probably the best indie attempt out there.
Date 2018-07-12 Playtime 6h 36m Rec Positive fantastic game with excellent progression and reward. the sound is amazing, and the time spent in this world was immersive. it's a game worth replaying
Date 2018-07-12 Playtime 14h 6m Rec Positive Truly an amazing game. I always deeply respect one-man projects. Some people may complain that this is too much of a "metroid clone" and even though much of it is deeply inspired by the metroid-vania game style, it has a lot of merit on its own, especially as the game progresses.   It has just the right amount of plot and dialogue, a MASSIVE map full of secrets, and the movement controls are some of my favorite in a 2D game.

Date 2018-07-11 Playtime 18h 31m Rec Positive I bought this game on sale and paid i think like 3 dollars for it. It was honestly the best 3 dollars Ive ever spent on a game. It claims its a metroidvania experience and imo it seems to deliver. Its a bit of a slow start, but after that it really gets you hooked.  Im hoping the makers have another volume in store for us because this was really a lot of fun.  Graphically its 16 bit but does amazing things with those 16 bits. The art style is fun and alien but very cool. They really worked a lot of play ideas into one game. If theres ever a followup Id love to see each of the powers put to the test so to say. 
Date 2018-07-09 Playtime 9h 22m Rec Positive Enjoyed the game a lot. Difficult but does not feel unfair.
Date 2018-07-07 Playtime 13h 6m Rec Positive Great soundtrack and the sense of explopration kept me going through this metroidvania. There were a few novel concepts, but they seemed to peter out. Still very enjoyable for fans of the genre.
Date 2018-07-07 Playtime 26h 54m Rec Positive Probably the best metroidvania on PC right now. Wonderful pixelart graphics, interesting story and great soundtrack. The gameplay is challenging but not too difficult. For all completionists there are a lot of weapons and upgrades to discover. All speedrunners get a special speedrun mode without the story cutscenes but with an implemented timer. It's remarkable that this game was developed by just one man.  If you like metroidvanias I can totally recommend Axiom Verge!
Date 2018-07-07 Playtime 8h 12m Rec Positive The lovechild of Gordon Freeman and Samus Aran. This game is awesome.
Date 2018-07-07 Playtime 16h 5m Rec Positive Super faithful Metroid clone. Loved it!
Date 2018-07-05 Playtime 10h 34m Rec Positive Axiom Verge ist echt gutes Metroidvania das sich zumindedst grafisch sehr stark an den Super Metroid orientiert, Nicht nur der Pixel-Look sondern auch die Stimmung erinnert sehr an den Super Nintendo Klassiker. Zum glück ist es aber dennoch inovativ genung um durch eigene Item Ideen und Bosse keine zu plumpe Kopie zu sein. Ich war persönlich teils überrascht wie anders es sich im late-game gespielt hat und wie groß die möglichkeiten bei einem so alten genre noch sind, auch wenn man de, Klassiker treu bleibt.  Einziger Minus-Punkt für mich war beim spielen, dass ich an einer spezifischen Stelle nachgucken musste, wie man weiter kommt. Die Lösung dazu war mir nicht einfach/nachvollziehbar genug um selbst drauf zu kommen.  Wenn man das Genre mag kann ich Axiom Verge nur empfehlen.
Date 2018-07-05 Playtime 30h 29m Rec Positive Um dos melhores jogos indies que já joguei nos ultimos anos. Falta platinar o modo hard. Graficos e interface muito boas, o som é simplesmente demais, bem estilo metroidvania!!! Recomendadíssimo!
Date 2018-07-04 Playtime 24h 58m Rec Positive Vorneweg: Eigentlich ist dieses Spiel für mich weder zu empfehlen noch in die Tonne zu treten. о_О
Date 2018-07-03 Playtime 8h 20m Rec Positive Great metroidvania. Kinda hard too. The story is a little hard to understand, but it's still great nonetheless. Worth it at full or at discount.
Date 2018-07-03 Playtime 18h 15m Rec Positive An interesting take on the metroidvania genre, however it has some issues that I need to address. First and foremost is the weaponry; In a standard metroidvania, new weapons are either new ways to get around or provide a better means of attack, or both. Out of the 23 weapons in the game, only one is used to solve puzzles, and the rest are of varying usefulness. Some are quite useless at both fighting and puzzles, while others are only situationally useful, then there's a couple that are "The only one you need" tier. It muddies the sense of discovery integeral to this genre of game. Overall, the game plays well and the setting is interesting, but ultimately excecutes two of the core pillars of this genre poorly.  The setting is very interesting though, it's like someone spilled H.R. Geiger's artworks into a videogame.  It pains me to give this a 6/10 review, it could have been so much better. Pick it up on sale.
Date 2018-07-01 Playtime 29h 36m Rec Positive Interesting story and solid gameplay (except for a certain cheap boss).  Sometimes it takes a lot of exploration to find where you are supposed to go next.  If a metroidvania is what you are looking for then I recommend this game to you.

Date 2018-06-30 Playtime 17h 29m Rec Positive Bom, mas demais superestimado. Não vá com altas espectativas. Guarde-as para Ori ou Hollow Knight.
Date 2018-06-30 Playtime 2h 59m Rec Negative Preço muito elevado para um jogo que entrega muito pouco, mesmo na promoção.  Blz, eh um jogo legalzinho... nos primeiros 10 minutos, depois as fazes "nao lineares" começam a se tornar massantes e repetitivas... chega um momento que vc ja nem quer matar os inimigos, porque nao te dao XP, e nem gold, e nem nada... ae vc só vai seguindo e desviando, dando voltas pelo mapa, indo e voltando varias vezes pelos mesmos caminhos... Unica coisa que eh mais legalzinha são os BOSS e a arma que vira muitas coisas... Os inimigos foram feitos bem nas coxas, bem na preguiça, porque são sempre os mesmos tipos, soh mudam as cores... Eu sinceramente não sei porque esse jogo foi falado tão bem, foi tão badalado, é uma merda, e olha que eu curto muito esse estilo. Uma das coisas boas é que está disponível em todos os idiomas xD. Esse jogo valeria R$ 5 reais e olha la... comprei por R$ 22 na promoçao, e acho que joguei meu dinheiro fora...  =============================================================== Very high price for a game that delivers very little, even in promotion.  OK, it's a cool game ... in the first 10 minutes, then the "nonlinear" games begin to become massive and repetitive ... there comes a time that you do not even want to kill the enemies, because they do not give you XP, and nor gold, nor anything ... and you just go on and off, going around the map, going back and forth several times along the same paths ... Only thing that is cooler is the BOSS and the weapon that turns many things ... The enemies were made well on the thighs, well in the laziness, because they are always the same types, so they change the colors ... I honestly do not know why this game was spoken so well, it was so cool, it sucks, and I have a great style. One of the good things is that it is available in all xD languages. This game would be worth R$ 5 reais and look ... I bought it for R$ 22 in the promotion, and I think I threw my money away ...
Date 2018-06-30 Playtime 13h 49m Rec Positive        One of the best tributes to Super Metroid I have ever played. The artwork is stunning, the storyline is dark and has an extremely unexpected plot twist a little over midway through the game. It took me ~14 hours to complete (steam doesnt count offline time), and I will likely play this game multiple times over just to try to find all the secrets. It controls very well, with the shooting being much like Contra in the fact that you can shoot in any direction you want, including diagonals. Plenty of upgrades are in the game to help solve problems that prevent your progress. The boss fights are tricky at first but are not too tremedously difficult once you get the mechanics down, I only got frustrated on one of two of them.       If you're a fan of Metroid or other 2D sidescrolling platformers, this game is a must have for you!
Date 2018-06-29 Playtime 17h 28m Rec Positive do you like metroid?  then buy that game.  10/10 would metroid again
Date 2018-06-29 Playtime 57h 55m Rec Positive Fantastic metroid style game. music is A+ as well
Date 2018-06-26 Playtime 15h 50m Rec Positive [i] Axiom Verge is a nonlinear metroidvania platformer. It's hard at times, but fair. It took me about 16 hours to complete my first run of it (100% collectibles and map, normal difficulty, guide used). There are a few exclusive acheivements, so there is some replay value. In accordance to the dollar/hour rule, I'd say $20 is a fair price for this game. [/i] [b] PROS: [/b] [list] [*] Pretty good soundtrack that's mostly unrepetitive and won't melt your brain  [*] Fun combat and upgrade system that really makes you feel like you're becoming stronger [*] Decent story (it's not as bad as everyone makes it sound) [*] Interesting ablilities that make you use creative ways to advance [*] Beautiful art [*] Game will tell you if you're missing collectibles [*] Great aesthetic, concepts, and enviroment overall [/list] [b] CONS: [/b] [list] [*] That one track with the Hindi lady singing gets really annoying [*] While bosses are very balanced and challenging at the beginning of the game, you end up so powerful in the lategame that they're too easy and not fun anymore. The final boss was especially a letdown-- [spoiler] he literally just spawns enemies until you've damaged his weak point enough [/spoiler] --and I ended up beating him without dying once. [*] You'll end up with like 30 different weapons and only use about 5 consistently [*] Some upgrades feel pretty useless [spoiler] (looking at you, Bioflux Accelerator) [/spoiler] [*] No damage specs for weapons or health stats for enemies at all. This game has you learn by trial and error most of the time. [*] Some of the collectibles are incredibly difficult to find and tedious to obtain. If you want to 100% this game without looking at a guide, good luck. [/list] [h1] Axiom Verge is a fun and interesting game. If you can get it on sale, it's a steal. It has its flaws-- but keep in mind this was all developed by a single person. I enjoyed this game very much and would love to see a sequel. 7.5/10 [/h1]
Date 2018-06-24 Playtime 11h 45m Rec Positive Grandios. Wenn ihr es mit einem Controller spielt, dann spielt von Anfang an mit dem Steuerkreuz. Spätere Manöver lassen sich mit dem Analogstick sehr schlecht ausführen.

Date 2018-06-23 Playtime 19h 34m Rec Positive I wonder if other metroidvania developers are lookin at each other after playin this game like "What the have we been doin all this time". Fantastic game.
Date 2018-06-23 Playtime 14h 2m Rec Positive ☻
Date 2018-06-22 Playtime 8h 38m Rec Positive A metroidvania that's mostly inspired by the original Metroid for the NES, rather than Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night, which is an interesting change of pace.  It's got a cool electronic soundtrack, a biomechanical HR Giger aesthetic and an interesting story.
Date 2018-06-22 Playtime 20h 57m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is is a wonderful metroidvania game. It succeeds in nearly every aspect of its design, including its environments, soundtrack, and gameplay. It manages to create a truly alien atmosphere through the use of heavily bitcrushed soundeffects and eerie music, along with its enemy design. However, this praise does not only extend to its aesthetic. Axiom Verge also possesses extremely tight controls and a variety of weapons and abilities that you collect throughout play. This allows the game to remain interesting as it not only allows for additional backtracking (a given in a metroidvania) but also increased combat variety. The one thing that urked me about this game would have to be the story, which is overall rather forgetable and bland, albeit possessing remarkably well made pixel art cutscenes.  Final rating: 8.5/10  (Also, you would think that the strongest weapon in the game would be a laser or some plasma weapon, but it's actually the flamethrower. I don't know why, but that's just really funny to me.)
Date 2018-06-22 Playtime 12h 41m Rec Positive It's just FINE. I caved in to the hype and found a game that was merely competent, but no masterpiece.  +Excellent soundtrack +Fun combat/movement with no glitches +decent pixel art +decent story with some cool mind-fuck moments +tons of secrets that actually feel rewarding to find  -unreasonably large selection of pointless weapons you will find but just end up using the default weapon because it's the least gimmicky -art looks really bad in most of the game with the only impressive art being reserved for story moments. The rest is the same tiles reused a thousand times -story is very obtuse and didn't hold my attention. By the end I gave up trying to understand what was going on -very short. I take my sweet time with games and I beat it in 13 hours, meaning you can probably beat it in 7 or 8
Date 2018-06-22 Playtime 9h 15m Rec Positive >Lot's of optional content, the only area where it's closer to Symphony of the Night than Metroid.  >Cool and big robot heads, pretty backgrounds. >Surprisingly interesting story.  >Not a metroid rip off in that the character sprite is much smaller relative to the environment, running and gunning is also better (contra-influenced), mobility is higher too. >it's a good metroidvania, so if secret hunting through winding levels isn't your thing, stay away.
Date 2018-06-21 Playtime 1h 50m Rec Positive Настальгия.
Date 2018-06-19 Playtime 26h 4m Rec Positive The Metroid game we deserve.  While Nintendo can't figure out where it all went wrong (farming out the series to developers that don't even like it), we get a great indie game that feels like more of a Metroid game than most recent Metroid games.    The graphics are great, and definitely have a 8 bit feel to them, but with enough bells and whistles to be visually impressive.  The music is fantastic, easily the best part of the game.  The gameplay, for the most part, is great.  My only complaint about the controls would be after you get the ability to dash forward and through objects by double tapping a direction, it's very easy to do this accidentally, especially when trying to land yourself on a small platform, your taps may end up teleporting you further away.  luckily, as a Metroid style game, all that means is the minor inconveinance of climbing back up.  The story is...pretty bad actually, but that's not why you're playing this.  It's told through 8-bit cutscenes reminiscient of the Ninja Gaiden games on NES as well as some minor dialogue, but if the game had no story at all, it would be exactly as good.  Often marketed as and reviewed as a mix of Metroid, Contra and Castlevania but really feels like Metroid, Metroid and a bit of Metroid thrown in.  If you're at all a fan of the classic NES/SNES/GBA Metroid games, this is a must-buy.
Date 2018-06-18 Playtime 17h 20m Rec Positive Metroivania de los buenos. Me gustó mucho la variedad de armas y el diseño de los niveles, aunque el gancho no podría ser menos inuitivo ni queriedo. Los jefes son muy básicos, no tuve ni un problema con practicamente ninguno. La historia no es del otro mundo, pero cumple con lo que promete. Es algo corto, en lo particular no teng probema con eso. La música es como escuchar cantar a dios, increible. 
Date 2018-06-18 Playtime 38h 41m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvanias i have played that are not from the metroid or castlevania franchises. The sound track is amazing as well :) It was difficult, but not too difficult, very well balanced.
Date 2018-06-17 Playtime 2h 51m Rec Negative I'm giving this game a not recommended, BUT if you actually know and like very old-school metroid games, then I would recommend it to you.  I, personally, do not enjoy games that are this old school, although I do like modern metroidvanias such as Hollow Knight.  To me, this game seemed very bland. You get a brief intro, and then just wind your way through identical corridor after identical corridor. Every now and then, you see a unique sight or a cool boss and think "Now the game is getting started!", but no, it just goes back to the boring, samey corridors again.  There does not seem to be much of a story.  Secrets are hidden in the most boring and random way possible behind identical blocks. No visual or story hints.  In my view, this game needed WAY more NPCs, more dialogue, more story, and generally just more personality. I'm not motivated to trudge through these hallways for... what exactly? Yeah, who knows. Maybe there's a lore enthusiast who can tell you - or maybe there just is no reason.  I did like finding new weapons and abilities. That's always the best part of metroidvanias for me. But again, opening up new pathways just leads you into... the same corridor you were just in, but recolored.  Thanks but no thanks, 1994.  Bottom line, if you played this sort of game in the past and loved it, then this may be right up your alley.  If you never played games like this before, you may want to steer clear, or at least know what you're getting into.
Date 2018-06-17 Playtime 22h 48m Rec Positive This is a VERY long game. You definitely get your monies worth. The sound track is enjoyable, guns/items/effects are all very fun (and there are a ton of them), and bosses are challenging but manageable. Lots of puzzles that naturally fit into the game play make for a pretty engaging playthrough. Once or twice I got a little lost because I wasn't sure what item i needed to progress the story, but just like in metroid you end up backtracking any way to access new areas and items so you eventually figure it all out. Definitely a good game, and definitely fun to play. 
Date 2018-06-15 Playtime 13h 25m Rec Negative I can see how many people would love this game. It feels like Metriod. It looks like Metriod. It sounds like Metroid. There's a lot to love.  But I do not love it.   There are a few key issues that continuously plagued me: 1. Lack of guidance. You will find youself going back to areas over and over hoping to find what furthers the game. After a while, it gets old. 2. No fast travel. There's a "tram" area you later find, but it doesn't help much. With all the area revisits, being able to jump around the world would have done wonders for the frustration. 3. Difficulty. The start of the game feels like the right difficulty, but by the end of it, the ramp-up seems a little too steep.  4. Controls. They're tight... mostly. A few abilities you get feel a little too loose, or you end up erroneously triggering it constantly. 5. Music. Overall, the music was great. However.  There were a few track loops that got extremely grating, to the point I muted the music.  In the end, I gave up on the game. I wasn't having fun, and was quickly sliding into the mindset of beating it out of spite, rather than enjoyment.
Date 2018-06-15 Playtime 25h 19m Rec Positive Un excellent Metroidvania à posséder absolument dans sa bibliothèque.  https://youtu.be/Fklz7kGyJXg
Date 2018-06-14 Playtime 14h 38m Rec Positive Axiom Verge, an 8-bit adventure platformer developed by Thomas Happ, is a callback to the Metroid-style platformers of the 1980's and '90's, where the game is a maze from start to end, and the art style makes you wonder if someone slipped LSD into your drink an hour ago.  The game tells the story of Trace, a scientist who awakens on an alien-like world after a lab accident. The story goes on to explain the new world he is in and the stories of each of the characters. This worldbuilding is eons better than the actual plot of the game; in fact, the plot is pretty generic- explore, kill aliens, save the world. The sometimes cringe-worthy dialogue doesn't help either.  But whilst the game falters in its story, it makes up with not just the worldbuilding, but also the art design, tight combat, and (most importantly) the atmosphere.  The art design reminds me of the works of Swiss artist H.R. Giger (some examples: https://imgur.com/gallery/EYiSt), where organic material is mixed with the synthetic; this can be seen throughout the environment, but most prominently on the enemies and characters- enemies have guns for arms, and some characters are just giant human-looking machine heads on the wall, just to name a couple.  The combat is tight, responsive, and feels damn good. It is simple as shooting enemies until they disappear into the shadow realm, and in the case of boss battles, you have to attack its weak point for massive damage. Throughout the game, you can acquire a number of unique weapons that comprise of Metroidvania mainstays like the spreadshot, but also weapons that [spoiler] have bullets attract to enemies, ricocheting bullets, boomerang bullets, [/spoiler] and so on. Challenge-wise, most of it will come from trying to navigate through the game, as you can easily get lost even with a map. Enemies vary in difficulty, and naturally, the ones towards the latter half of the game are more robust than the ones in the former, and this applies to the boss battles as well, sometimes to a point where some bosses are rather cheap at first glance.   All elements discussed above combine to form the atmosphere of the game, which is both haunting and imposing, and also instills a sense of curiosity into players, at least for me it did. The music, composed by Happ himself, adds wonderfully to the atmosphere, as some tracks are pleasant and serene, while some are fast-paced and frantic, especially during boss battles. The worldbuilding and background details add a sense of discovery to every location, like digging up an ancient burial ground of a once-great civilization.  Overall, I recommend Axiom Verge to those who enjoy a unique art style and/or Metroidvania game design and don't mind the rather bland plot. I warn those who wish to play it in that it requires a degree of patience- you will get lost in this game and this will likely frustrate you.
Date 2018-06-12 Playtime 4h 46m Rec Positive Obvously worth whatever the dev is asking for. Pay it, play it. Keep it in your library.
Date 2018-06-11 Playtime 11h 29m Rec Positive One of the best Metroidvanias I've played in years.  The map is huge and fun to explore, with lots of secrets scattered about. And the special moves you acquire throughout the game are unique and interesting for this genre. There's also tons of weapons to find, and they're all very satisfying to shoot.   The story was also very well done. It's an interesting sci-fi plot that unveils itself a bit at a time, through dialog with ancient computers and notes hidden throughout the map.   The atmosphere overall is very reminiscent of Metroid. If you like that series then I guarantee you'll enjoy Axiom Verge. I recommend it.
Date 2018-06-10 Playtime 31h 29m Rec Positive Nice game, interesting story, nice atmosphere, nice music. Interesting game mechanics. Lots of running around, though, at least there are shortcuts.
Date 2018-06-10 Playtime 17h 44m Rec Positive Wellcrafted, massive metroid game for a oneman project. Feels sort of an avantgarde turrican for me. Interesting story set in an alien world, brilliant pixelgraphics, good sound and decent soundtrack - nothing memorable though. Some original ideas like the glitchgun?. Enemies+bosses are plenty and challenging. Game is well worth the price. it´s the type of game with that special aura and mystique you cannot explain, deep shjet. Classic.
Date 2018-06-10 Playtime 13h 27m Rec Positive + Retro feel. This game is true to Metroid spirit: No clear direction, you explore on your own, full of secrets and hidden walls. + Interesting weapons. Though I don't find the need to use them all.  + Dreadful atmosphere. This is depicted by exotic environments, trippy pixel art and chiptune. - No teleport, so you do a lot of backtracking. - After you die, you have to wait 10 seconds to respawn. This slows down the game pace. - Some special moves are hard to control (double-tap). You cannot combine move, so no drill and shoot at the same time...
Date 2018-06-08 Playtime 38h 52m Rec Positive I couldn't quite 100% this game, and occasionally had trouble trying to discern where to go next. This concludes my complaints about Axiom Verge. It's pretty much exactly what it purports itself to be: an outstanding Metroidvania with an extremely well handled retro asthetic, an engaging and nuanced plot, and fun upgrades including about a trillion weapons (if you can find them).  Factor in that this ENTIRE GAME was made by ONE GUY. What an awesome guy.
Date 2018-06-07 Playtime 26h 11m Rec Positive Axiom Verge é uma grata surpresa para amantes de títulos MetroidVania's. Com uma variedade grande de itens e upgrades, consegue ser bem desafiador. Único ponto negativo, é sua campanha curta. Vale muito a pena.
Date 2018-06-06 Playtime 55h 5m Rec Positive Играта видно е вдъхновена предимно от Metroid като атмосфера и gameplay, но създателят не се е ограничил дотук. Развит е доста комплексен плот, има няколко страхотни механики, които отсъстват от Metroid игрите, а музикалното оформление (неслучайно не казвам просто саундтрак) е прекрасно. Музиката всява чувство за негостоприемност, а отделно всички звуци и дори sprite-ове вибрират в синхрон с основния бийт на саундтрака. Ако не сте фенове на усвояване на концептуално нови механики, играта може да ви фрустрира на моменти. Вкарана е механика за "хакване" на гадините. С помощта на оръжие променяш функциите на гадини (и околната среда). То не е задължително в никоя битка, но определено улеснява много от тях. Отделно, имаш дронче и умение за размяна, което бива употребено за трикове в движението. Определено изтезава пръстите обаче. След днешните четири часа имам чувството, че ще ми трябва малко почивка от играта. Специфичните механики обаче били те и проблем за някои хора, ще са солта и пипера за други. Накратко, определено препоръчвам играта. 36 лева може да ви се виждат множко, но първото ми разиграване (78% item completion, 95% map completion) трая 12 часа. Определено ще я разиграя поне едно 2-3 пъти още, а накрая защо не и да я speedrun-на. Ако не сте от хората, които захвърлят всяка игра до средата, то Axiom Verge определено си струва инвестицията.

Date 2018-06-03 Playtime 1h 24m Rec Negative Tried this twice and both times ended up refunding it.  I love these types of games, but Axiom Verge has some really frustrating design ideas that to me just make it not fun to play.  Some enemies are basicaly just unfair, and rush you on sight before you have the change to do anything about them. To make matters worse, if you manage to escape to another screen, they then wait at the entrance to it so you can't go back without running straight into them and taking a lot of damage.  Compunding this issue is that checkpoints are pretty far apart, and because of the "open exploration" angle, easy to miss, so if you die without having found a checkpoint screen, you can be in for a long journey to get back to where you were.  Avoid and go buy Ori and the Blind Forest instead.

Date 2018-05-27 Playtime 0h 21m Rec Negative I'd like it a lot more if it would run for more than literally 30 seconds at a time before freezing up entirely til I force-close the window. I can't even get into the options to change whether it's windowed, because *it crashes 30 seconds after booting up*. I wish my review could actually be about the gameplay but I *haven't experienced any yet*. Steam says I've played it for 20 minutes or so, well I've started, force-closed and restarted, this game that many times. And the community forums are full of unanswered problems.
Date 2018-05-27 Playtime 21h 24m Rec Positive The best non-Metroid Super Metroid-clone ever. I never remember exactly the routing of the main story, but exploration is where it's at.
Date 2018-05-25 Playtime 12h 41m Rec Positive If you're into platformers like this that really take some thought and strategy to get through, I cannot recommend this game enough.  I have enjoyed playing from the first minute, and it never stopped blowing me away.    PS: if you're into music, this game is for you.  One of the best soundtracks, imo.

Date 2018-05-25 Playtime 15h 42m Rec Negative Game is trying too hard to be Metroid, visuals and everything. It becomes immensely boring near the end, and I found it hard to finish the game out of sheer boredom. Weapons are not balanced, and hard mode is garbage IMO. Still, the game had some unique ideas and generally preformed well with what it tried to be. 6/10, still a failing grade but not the worst. Buy if you are a diehard Metroid fan.
Date 2018-05-25 Playtime 22h 54m Rec Positive Весьма хороший метройд. Боссов правда маловато, и еще рядовые мобы не блещут сильной крутизной. Зато тут есть сюжет, и крутой дизайн некоторых персонажей. Ну и музычка тоже. Кароче если ОРИ уже прошли то можно пробовать.
Date 2018-05-24 Playtime 13h 4m Rec Positive An amazing take on 2D Metroid games.
Date 2018-05-24 Playtime 10h 40m Rec Positive Un Metroidvania que imita el genero, pero no lo copia, ya que ninguna habilidad es una imitacion de las habilidades de samus
Date 2018-05-24 Playtime 40h 35m Rec Positive メトロイドをオマージュした感のある作品。後半くらいまでは割と面白いとは思いますが無駄に多い武器と 後半からのテンポの悪さを感じますけど良い佳作だと思います
Date 2018-05-24 Playtime 12h 43m Rec Positive I was blown away.  Forget what you know about Metroid and the like, this game constantly rewards you with a bunch of different things that make you constantly feel stronger and faster.
Date 2018-05-23 Playtime 58h 30m Rec Positive Oh hell yeah! This game was awesome! I played for hours and hours and tried to get every single weapong. I'm not quite sure how you were supposed to get some of the passwords to get the flame thrower and other things without looking them up online, however. Not sure if that can all be done from within the game.  You should totally get this game. I liked it so much I even got the t-shirt (which you should also do! It's really sweet looking).
Date 2018-05-23 Playtime 29h 52m Rec Positive What's not to like? A well thought out story, solid gameplay, challenging without being punishing. I can't wait for this guy to make his next game!
Date 2018-05-21 Playtime 15h 37m Rec Positive A really enjoyable and solid metroidvania, the game doesn't run all that well, but it's distracting enough to detract from the game. Personally, I think it adds to it if anything.  If you are a fan of metroidvanias, definitely pick this one up.
Date 2018-05-17 Playtime 13h 32m Rec Positive A "metroidvania" game that leans more to metroid in both visual design and gameplay. Normally I'm wary of metroidvania games, but this game is easy to get into. Exploring this world was fun and it has much going for it to differentiate itself from the original metroid.
Date 2018-05-17 Playtime 36h 10m Rec Positive Rating: 8 out of 10  A good Metroidvania with an outstanding soundtrack.   The Good: - metroidvania gameplay - great soundtrack - lots of secrets and exploration - speedrun mode  The Bad: - lame story - enemies that look like fruit loops - bosses with basic attack patterns - most weapons basically useless - some boring environments - atmosphere could be darker - no quick travel, a lot of backtracking to see if some obstackles can be surpassed

Date 2018-05-15 Playtime 9h 44m Rec Positive An absolute wonder for a lover of the Metroidvania genre.
Date 2018-05-14 Playtime 8h 0m Rec Negative Title screen has a speed run option on it from the first time you boot up the game. If that's something you want in a game, then this game is probably for you. It is not something I'm looking for. Its feels pretty much like a metroid.
Date 2018-05-12 Playtime 13h 45m Rec Positive At first glance, it may seem to be a simple game with simple mechanics and uninteresting gameplay.  But, it is a type of game where if you take the time and patience to understand what to do and learn more about what the game is about, it will get you interested in exploring more. It is a must for those that like to explore while discovering the meaning of the story with awesome soundtrack and boss battles.
Date 2018-05-11 Playtime 3h 2m Rec Positive De los mejores juegos que he jugado Vamos por partes 1. Tiene una muy buena historia, te mantiene intrigado, mientras más descubres del mundo de Sudra y su pasado 2. Su banda sonora es una belleza, encajando perfectamente con cada escenario 3. Una cómoda jugabilidad, tanto en teclado como con mando 4. El píxel art es algo de admirar, una verdadera obra de arte Y podría seguir con esta lista, pero solo le diré al lector que está pensando en adquirirlo...... ¡COMPRALO YA!
Date 2018-05-10 Playtime 21h 20m Rec Positive When I started playing it I thought it was okay, then I hated it. Then I slowly grew to like it more and more. It's like Harmony of Dissonance where it's not good unless you know 80% of the game before you start. The biggest complaint I have for the game are the weapons. There's over 20 of them, and the vast majority of them flat out suck. Some of them are worse than the basic gun at the very beginning and in the end even the more useful ones get undermined from all the garbage you get. An arguably worse complaint I have is that there are a lot of special powerups that are weaker, more tedious versions of other powerups you get later. On paper, knowing what you get by the end, it actually fits in pretty well which goes with what I said earlier. But if you get a couple things near the beginning that are underwhelming/tedious and don't know that there's a much better upgrade later, it gets really annoying especially when you get lost. It's a pretty solid game in the end, your fun will go up expodentially as you find the correct progression path. If you're on the fence for it, I'd almost recommend skimming through a speedrun video to see how the character progresses through to the end.
Date 2018-05-10 Playtime 18h 2m Rec Positive Un grandioso juego, con muchos misterios y una enorme jugabilidad, me sorprende un monton que solo una persona lo hiciera.  Muy recomendado. casi 12 horas
Date 2018-05-09 Playtime 9h 36m Rec Positive 메트로이드를 생각하고 산 게임인데 메트로이드의 게임성 그대로 딱 빼다박았다고 해도 좋을만큼 재밌음 메트로이드를 플레이 해보셨거나 해당 장르를 좋아하시면 일단 사고나서 후회는 안 해요. 다만 맵에 아이템 표시가 안 되는건 아쉬운게 메트로이드도 맵에 아이템 있으면 알려는 주는데 아이템 100% 도전할 때 힘들어요
Date 2018-05-06 Playtime 7h 11m Rec Positive I love the sound design and music, which make me want to come back to this game. Sadly I don't really enjoy the gameplay though. There's a lot of exploring, shooting things, the occasional boss battle, but none of it is anything I haven't seen before.  What I'm saying is, there is nothing unique, so it ends up being boring. Recommended because of the music.
Date 2018-05-05 Playtime 12h 8m Rec Negative Summary: Metroid with more Giger Multiplayer: No Completion: 11 hrs Cards: Yes Cloud: Yes  When playing Axiom Verge, the first thing anyone will think of is Metroid, and for good reason. This is in essence a modernized NES Metroid, with standard platforming gameplay that allows for backtracking, and new paths that open up when new powers are obtained. It even goes for the classic "press rapidly for rapid fire" that gets a bit hard on your thumbs.  You play as a scientist named Trace, who, after performing an experiment of some sort, is trapped under a crumbling building. He awakes to find himself in a very creepy alien world where everything seems to breathe and pulsate. Shortly after a female voice calls out and tells you to grab a gun. After that, you're out to explore this surreal nightmarish landscape.  The game is a bit on the difficult side (with an optional hard mode to boot!), as damage taken tends to be high, health drops are low, and save points are far away. While enemies sometimes drop health like in Metroid, it's a fairly small amount, and you have to deal with being four-shotted early on. The power-ups in this game are unusual, to say the least. Rather than your standard arsenal of beams and jump boots, you get the likes of hacking beams, overcoats, and a scorpion tails because why not? I kind of hate the early weapons though. They have low fire rates or range, and with the exception of health or damage power ups, most power ups don't make me feel stronger. The bosses are hulking beasts, and while they are difficult, most have an engineered weakness of some sort, and save spots are always right next to one, so it's not too bad.  The glitch gun, while a cool concept, makes no sense realistically. As high tech as the world is, I don't understand why something would appear as a computer glitch in real life unless he has mechanical eyes or something. Trace never questions this, and if this is all really a simulation, then there's really not much point to the story. It shouldn't bother me so much, but that always stood out to me like a sore thumb.  Backtracking is an integral part of Metroid games, though in this game it's on the high side. There's at least eight(!) powers that let you get through specific terrain... and none of them are a convenient high-speed movement option. And no, forward dashing is not convenient, nor is the giant walking head. On top of that, while some blocks are clearly breakable, others are not. It gets a bit tiring having to drill/bomb/glitch every new screen.  Much story is revealed through the use of notes collected on the ground. I'm a bit against this method of storytelling, but at least these are fairly short entries, and they do reveal a lot about what's going on. Some notes are encryted, and you must find passcodes to read them.  The sprite work in this game is crazy good. Everything is fluidly animated and the game has exceptional frame rate, giving off a very authentic console game experience. Everything is also very eerie, with the whole environment being organic or a fusion of metal and organic. The music, while sometimes good, does get irritating after a short while. In fact, some music can get kind of aggravating. I had to put on some background noise to filter out the droning effect it can have.  For all its good points, I am ashamed to say I don't really like this game. That's not to say it's a bad game, it's just not my cup of tea. The game comes across to me as trying too hard to be alien in order to avoid comparisons to other games. If I were to describe this Axiom Verge in one word, it would be "unsettling". Something always feels a little off, and you are alone in this hostile environment that is out to get you. I give this game a C-, for its excessive backtracking, button mashing, and other things I did not find fun. Thanks for the copy, chicago!
Date 2018-05-05 Playtime 13h 59m Rec Positive Антураж свисающих необрезанных кусков мяса с кости или, можно сказать, с лохмотьев чьего-то платья из наноткани. [b]А какая же была моя первая ассоциация? Извилины мозга? Вероятнее всего[/b]. Наверное, из-за такого пейзажа и заказал игру - для меня этот вид был свеж, был в новинку. Да он и сейчас превосходен - когда включается картинка и когда звучит характерный бит, наступает мгновенное погружение то ли в киберпанковый, то ли в биопанковый мир, где ты то ли поднимаешься к ядру планеты, то ли сваливаешься к выходу на поверхность. Видно невооруженным взглядом, что автор душу вкладывал, уровни отличаются детальной проработкой. А если выйти из этого мира в нашу суровую и родную российскую реальность, то регулярные монстры не сильно запоминаются - это, скорее, взбесившиеся камни и фонтаны. А вот боссы и режимы "видимости" врезаются в память.  Игра, с одной стороны, хороша тем, что в ней можно обойтись без модной "звездной прокачки", которая раздражает затаенный максимализм и обычно отвлекает от процесса. Вообще, если не задумываться над розыском каждой закладки, то забег по уровням в удовольствие. Но до поры до времени…  Ведь игра, с другой стороны, чрезмерно сложна и не во всем интуитивна понятна: и она больше испытывает терпение, а не насаждает деревья удовольствия. Поэтому, во-первых, каждая новая чаша - это выдох облегчения. Во-вторых, без руководства я, к сожалению, не догадался, какими комбинациями можно выбить недостающее оружие и с каким нищим арсеналом я сумел добраться до уровня Кур.   Соответственно, если именно в Axiom Verge пойти по пути сыщика, то процесс превращается в тяжкий труд, а не лакомство. Из-за поиска всех этих закладок и потаенных пещер приходится чуть ли не каждый квадрат испытать на прочность сверла. Ведь игра отличается издевательским немногословием. Однако это и похвала автору игры - [b]не все должно просто даваться, тогда не включается азарт и вкус победы от достижения каждого нового уровня не так сладок[/b].
Date 2018-05-05 Playtime 11h 54m Rec Positive Ever wanted to play Super Metroid but can't find a good ROM due to Nintendo being idiots? Uh, do this instead...
Date 2018-05-04 Playtime 13h 45m Rec Negative This game is fine. But there are better examples of the genre on steam. That being said, it did keep me engaged the whole way through.  Unfortunately it's ruined by a lot of little things. You obtain new weapons, where nearly all of them are bad so there's no real bonus to getting them. It has a lot of inconsistent mechanics like how the glitching will sometimes work certain ways in certain zones, or the bizarre password mechanic. I'm not sure if some of the areas were just really hard or I was supposed to do them in a different way. I never understood the password mechanic so being a completionist wasn't really engaging on this game.  Also, I totally didn't understand the plot. I thought it was all a dream, but I guess it was supposed to be real? I didn't get it.
Date 2018-05-02 Playtime 3h 25m Rec Positive A pretty solid MetroidVania game.
Date 2018-05-02 Playtime 15h 48m Rec Positive Очень классный платформер, чувствуется, что создатель вложил душу в эту игру. На сколько я знаю он разрабатывал все в этой игре, и графику, и музыку, и все программирование.  ЧТО В НЕЙ КЛАССНО?  - Определенно, это псевдонаучый сюрреалистичный мир с психоделичным саундтреком. Музыка, лично мне, здесь особенно нравится. НЕДОСТАТКИ.  - Не очень удобное управление, а именно стрельба и телепорт, персонажем становится легче управлять в середине игры, когда открыаются новые оружия и способности, но все же не очень приятно. Все-таки это существенный недостаток для платформера. Персонаж не такой неуклюжий как на старых дендевских играх, но все же очень ловкий на управление. - Очень мало лора и сюжетных событий, игра все же должна больше держать в напряжении, и сюжет можно было раскрутить куда больше и интереснее. Стоило добавить больше диалогов, катсцен, может внутреннего диалога персонажа. - Механика игры. Карта и разнообразное оружие не дружелюбны к игроку, большинство оружия бесполезно, и не продуманно как его применять, в карте без бутылки не разберешься, реиграбельность от этого сильно снижается.  Советую приобрести эту игру со скидкой, играть в нее больно, но интересно.
Date 2018-05-01 Playtime 14h 5m Rec Positive Really interesting game. But I had to read game-wiki because didn't understand a lot of parts.
Date 2018-04-30 Playtime 27h 47m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is interesting metroidvania game, but now it’s time for the story.  You play as Trace a young man and theoretical physicist who with a friend are working on experiment based on Trace's revolutionary ideas in the field of physics.   But then an explosion occurs knocking Trace out, soon he wakes up in an alien world with no memory on how he got there, but soon a voice calls to him calling it Elsenov and tells him to get a gun called the Axiom Disruptor.  But who is this Elsenov? How did Trace survive the explosion? And more importantly where is he? Soon he well discover all that and more.  So now for the game itself, there is a good bit to like about the game, okay start with the Pixel Graphics/art style.  The Pixel Graphics/art style is good and gives a good H. R. Giger feeling like with the Rusalki and the bosses.  The power ups and weapon power ups where awesome and fun to use. The notes you get good helped with the story a bit. And the music was good.  Okay now for the annoying parts, sometimes the enemies can feel a bit cheap and overpowered.   Sometimes you will not know what to do next. And the story can be a little bit confusing.  Now with all that said this game is good and I hope we get a sequel someday.
Date 2018-04-29 Playtime 9h 42m Rec Negative Axiom Verge is an Action-Adventure Sidescrolling Metroidvania developed solely by Thomas Happ, a AAA developer who previously worked on titles like Grey Goo and NFL. It sells itself as a faithful recreation of the gameplay of the early Nintendo 2D Metroid games with original IP.  GAMEPLAY  Axiom Verge has hands-down, one of the best moment-to-moment gameplay in a Metroidvania that I have played (only second to Ori), during the game's exploratory sections, which is >95% of the game's playtime. The combat system is excellent, with very intuitive controls that provides for excellent 'game-feel', and a good variety of enemies and tools to take them down.  The Level Design in Axiom is very good. Players are guided through the game with a good difficulty curve, constantly pitting the player with new enemies and refreshing familiar ones with interesting and challenging positions. Gimmicks never outstay their welcome, and there is good progression in enemy variety alongside tools added to the player's sandbox.  The bosses are definitely the biggest letdown of the game. While they look really intimidating and were paced well with Metroid-style boss corridors, every single boss only had a single behaviour. Once you figure out what sequence of actions you are supposed to do (e.g. jump, squat then fire), you plainly just repeat that sequence of actions for about 30 times throughout the entire boss fight. As the boss takes damage their attacks speed up, but you do the exact same sequence to DPS them, only faster. There are no stages, or even different attack patterns. Each boss only does one thing. And you DPS them down for 1-3 minutes by doing the exact same thing over and over again. Axiom Verge's bosses are hands down the most disappointing bossfights I have ever played in any video game, EVER. Its pathetic. Whereas in every single other video game where bossfights were something to be excited about, I DREADED bossfights in this game for being so unfun. And that sucks.  Overall, Axiom Verge's great action and platforming gameplay is crippled by a lack of incentive to explore and garbage bossfights. It has all the bells and whistles of a Metroid game, but it lacks the soul of one.  Gameplay Rating: 7/10   NARRATIVE  Extremely amateur cutscene dialogue that brings to mind more questions than it answers. Characters devoid of any personality or motivation. A plot so convoluted that one has to dig into (hidden!) codex entries to even understand the crux of the main storyline (half of which were unreadable for me!). Axiom's attempts to write something novel ended up being extremely pretentious, disjointed, and confused. Sure, one might surmise that getting fans to piece the origins of the world and the meta-ness of the endings is the explicit intention, but the implementation failed spectacularly.  The character representing Axiom Verge's cover art is a perfect illustration of the woe's of this game's writing. Its a pretty face that invites intrigue, but its ultimately an empty, opaque husk too challenging for ordinary mortals to divine.  Narrative Rating: 1/10  GRAPHICS  I could not for the life of me figure out what any of the tilesets were supposed to represent, other than the main character, corpses and zombies. Tiles look either vaguely metal-ish or vaguely biomass-ish. You cannot even tell if what you're standing on is a rock.  While different areas change up the color palette slightly, its still rather drab. It might have been intentional to give the game and thereby the player a certain vibe, but alas this visual style is tiring on the eyes, and also unfortunately incredibly boring. Because despite the platforming and combat being top notch, the plain, unchanging aesthetics introduces unwarranted lethargy that does the gameplay a disservice.  Graphics Rating: 3/10  SOUND  The game has a very so-so soundtrack. Its haunting, creepy, and very appropriate to the scifi eldritch horror theme. But its all very unremarkable. There are no standout tracks, not even boss ones, which unfortunately blends in with the rest of the graphics, turning the game into a drab and dull experience.  And as mentioned above, the game has extremely poor aural feedback. Weapons lack punch, and there are no aural clues to let you know when you are hit. Enemies don't make any sounds effects. Did they even have a SFX folder?  Sound Rating: 2/10  CONCLUSION  Disclaimer: I did not even bother playing through the game to the end. I just watched the ending on Youtube after unlocking the last compulsory power-up. I got so done and bored with the game at 5 hours in, and only the combat packing a good punch got me to stay on for another 4.  And that pretty much sums up my entire thoughts on Axiom Verge. Very good platforming and combat systems, good level design, all ruined by extremely mediocre implementation in all other areas.  Final Rating: 4/10
Date 2018-04-27 Playtime 9h 59m Rec Positive This game was an amazing experience. I found it because I was searching for "Games like Cave Story" and Axiom Verge delivered and so much more. I loved the steady addons with items and weapons as you experience more and more of the game, and the atmosphere and music is amazing. I never really felt like I was stuck, and most enemies were managable once you figured them out. This was an expertly crafted video game :D
Date 2018-04-27 Playtime 12h 14m Rec Positive + Piksel piksel grafikleri ile tam bir metroidvania <3 + Konusu gayet güzel, gerçi bi noktada beklentimi öyle yükseltti ki finali zayıf geldi bana. Ama ortalamada tatmin edici. + Bölüm tasarımları ve düşman çeşitliliği yeterli seviyede. + Oyun zor, ama sinir bozucu seviyede değil. Bence güzel bir denge tutturmuşlar. 
Date 2018-04-26 Playtime 12h 21m Rec Positive Do you enjoy metroidvanias? Platformers? Exploration?  If so, get this game yesterday! Axiom Verge is an excellent game, and I recommend it even at full price!
Date 2018-04-26 Playtime 0h 42m Rec Negative This is a real peice of garbage you will want to remove from your Steam librarty as soon as you hit the play button. The audio is at full blast even after you set it to a resonable level and restart. Everything defaults to loud as fuck everytime you turn it on. You won't want to make that mistake at midnight waking up the entire house. There is no way out of the options menue. It makes you restart the game to get back to the main menue which leads right back to the loud as fuck audio again. They found the most anoying peircing 8bit noise they could find to play this prank and call it a game. Do not buy this speaker killing prank you will regret having it in your library.
Date 2018-04-23 Playtime 12h 34m Rec Positive The difficulty can be harsh at times and that's compounded by some annoying gameplay quirks (such as camera suddenly shifting perspective during boss fights). Many of the weapons feel redundant. It's pretty obvious where the story is going which is all the more annoying because it could have pulled it off so much better with the right presentation. The music can be somewhat irritating.  But for all that, it's fun. I'm not breaking down the door to play it again, but it was a fun ride while it lasted. If you're hurting for a Metroidvania, go for it.
Date 2018-04-22 Playtime 11h 48m Rec Negative the game is 'just ok'   compared to the original metroid its decent. compared to super metroid its lacking.  these games came out like 20 years ago.   there are tonns of good metroid games,  metroid fusion, mission zero. and a giant list of other non nintendo games.  something about axiom verge is lacking.  it has the elements of what could have been a good retrostyled game but i feel it falls flat on the delevery of these aspects.  the game simply feels dated at launch. the game does nothing new to the genere and simply feels like a cookie cutter copy of the original metroid hey, remember how you could jump higher with a power up! you can do that too!  hey, rememebr how you could fit into tight spaces! you can do that too!   axiom verge is not bad game, but its not a very good one.  its just decent but in a world where you can own over 8000 games on steam you simply don't have enough time to play them all; i simply feel like this one is worth skipping unless you really want to play an oldschool metroid game that brings nothing new to the table     for any one looking to play a metroidvaina, get hollow knight instead. in all aspects i think hollow knight is better at the genere.
Date 2018-04-22 Playtime 15h 25m Rec Positive Sviluppato unicamente da Thomas Happ, Axiom Verge è l’ennesima entrata in un immenso universo di Metroidvania creati nel mondo degli Indie Games, uscito nel 2015 come esclusiva Playstation e poi portato su ogni singola console possibile e immaginabile. La storia vedere come protagonista Trace, uno scienziato che si risveglia in questo strano universo alieno dopo un indicente di laboratorio. Arrivato in questo universo entra in contatto con Elsenova, un entità cibernetica dalla forma di una testa gigante. Gli racconta di essere arrivato in un mondo chiamato Sudra che è ormai stato distrutto da un entità chiamata Athetos tramite un epidemia virale. Athetos è comunque ancora vivo nei meandri più nascosti di Sudra e Trace, seppur riluttante all’idea di uccidere, sarà costretto ad affrontarlo se vuole avere una speranza di ritornare nel mondo reale. Per quanto la storia sia semplice Axiom Verge dilaga molto più in profondità con Log aggiuntivi da trovare dispersi nel mondo. Esattamente come Metroid Prime abbiamo tante informazioni di Lore che raccontano la natura di questo mondo, di Athetos e tutto questo inizia per coinvolgere anche Trace stesso. È una storia che da se solleva parecchie discussioni per coloro che sono alla ricerca di messaggi nascosti, ma senza andare a discapito di coloro che vogliono solamente godersi un Metroidvania da una decina di ore. Il gameplay è quanto di più classico si possa ottenere da questo genere, esplorazione per trovare nuovi power up che ti permettono di esplorare più in profondità e Trace è decisamente ben equipaggiato per l’avventura. La sua arma l’Axiom Disruptor può essere aggiornato per includere una moltitudine infinita di proiettili dando una vasta versatilità per le vostre opzioni di attacco, la potenza di fuoco può anche essere aumentata con la raccolta di collezionabili e una volta raggiunto il 100% certe armi sono davvero potenti. Per quanto riguarda l’esplorazione abbiamo un drone per esplorare passaggi stretti e più avanti verrà usato per teletrasporti a lunga distanza, un camice che ci permette di attraversare muri per un certo spessore e un arsenale di bombe e impulsi IEM per causare distorsioni nell’ambiente e glitchare i nemici, dando molto l’impressione di un mondo virtuale anzichè terreno. L’unico tipo di upgrade che sembra essere assente è un aumento della difesa e questo lo si sente parecchio nelle fasi finali del gioco dove i nemici sono molto aggressivi e possono fare parecchi danni se non si sta attenti, ma nonostante le mie numerose morti non mi sento di reputare questo gioco difficile , la sua difficoltà è in pari con i vari capitoli di Metroid. Parliamo infine della presentazione, Axiom Verge prende molta ispirazione dal primo capitolo di Metroid i colori sono molto vibranti e tendono più sulle scale di blu, verde e viola che danno un idea perfetta di un mondo alieno e per quanto questo possa far apparire il mondo in sè un pò monotono e piatto, lo spritework su certi personaggi e soprattutto nei boss è qualcosa di ammirabile per quanto perfettamente ben costruito e fluido, certe battaglie mi hanno fatto davvero rimanere a bocca aperta e le esplosioni dei nemici più grandi sono la ciliegina sulla torta, non posso dare lo stesso plauso per la soundtrack che per quanto il chiptune 8 bit sia godibile ed adatto all’atmosfera generale del gioco, la soundtrack a lungo andare rischia di diventare ripetitiva in quanto le tracce in se sono abbastanza limitate. In conclusione posso dire che questo gioco per essere stato creato da una sola persona è impressionante! Lo spritework è ottimo la storia molto stimolante e il gameplay ispirato ma allo stesso tempo originale. Se avete fame di Metroid anche dopo l’uscita di AM2R e Samus Returns vi consiglio di lanciarvi subito su questo gioco, non ne resterete delusi
Date 2018-04-22 Playtime 8h 49m Rec Positive Final levels a bit too harsh, but a good game overall.
Date 2018-04-20 Playtime 28h 4m Rec Negative Edit: The 2nd game is [i][b]way[/b][/i] better, but it's not on Steam. 100% in this game is incredibly boring and tedious. If you're a completionist that wants to complete as much as possible during their first playthrough, a [b]lot[/b] of time will be wasted. Having an item map is absolutely necessary unless you want to be hitting every single wall in five different ways, and finding nothing 95% of the time. There's no indication whatsoever for where hidden items are or even their general area, [i]or[/i] even if you found an item in that area. The game [i]really[/i] drags on when there's nothing much really going on, and you [i]will[/i] get lost or stuck. This game uses pixel art. I love good pixel art, but the resolution is fairly low with low detail and a lot of repetition. It comes off as somewhat lazy and bland, but it's not bad. The music is okay, but there's only a handful of tracks that repeat for hours, and these tracks are already short or repetitive. Some of the items are interesting, but over half of the weapons are useless compared to others. The AI is mediocre in my opinion, to the point where the environment is sometimes built specifically so you can exploit bad or unfair AI. Controls should've been better with the movement ability and drill that are used [b]constantly[/b] and were not customizable. For example you cannot walk and drill at a downwards angle without your character crouching so you must either repeatedly jump and aim downwards or use a later item as a workaround. The movement ability is even more painful to use and also activates unintentionally many times if you're using an analog stick to move. No form of fast travel. In a game like this with these kinds of maps, there is constant backtracking and it's quite frustrating.  The game is fairly good despite the above, but I cannot recommend it after all the hours that have been literally wasted from bashing my head against a wall due to bad design in numerous areas. I'm talking at least ⅔ of my play time was just wasted.  If you're a completionist, get an item map. It's necessary. You will not find everything yourself without wasting an insane amount of time. Besides, even with an item map you will waste some time if you don't realize some items require passcodes in your passcode tool[i](that's rarely used)[/i] to open up a random path.  But wait, there's more. There's supposed to be 5 randomly generated[i](for your save file)[/i] entrances to "Secret Worlds" to find, which contain a couple insignificant upgrades. The problem is there's around a hundred possible entrances scattered throughout the game, and you need to pull up a community-made map and go to every single location to see if that's where [b]your[/b] save file spawned an entrance. And even then, multiple people including myself have gone to every single location and are still missing a couple SW entrances. You're supposed to see a scanline filter over the game when you get near. The game never tells you this of course, but you should know. More hours thrown away to these. Edit: I have 3/5 health node fragments for an upgrade, but I have the 100% items achievement, so I may not need to do these SWs.  I've now finally gotten all the achievements at 27 hours. To put that in perspective, it's a 3-4 hour game.
Date 2018-04-19 Playtime 11h 54m Rec Positive Brought me back to when I was a kid playing Metroid: Zero Mission on my Game Boy Advance. Felt like what I wanted from a game inspired by Metroid. There were some frustrating moments, but at least it wasn't too easy. ;) Felt like it had plenty of content and kept me interested until the end with a pretty good story. Only bad thing I would point out is that it seems like there isn't enough diversity in enemies. Thought it was great! Pick it up. Happy gaming
Date 2018-04-18 Playtime 11h 6m Rec Positive This is the closest you could possibly come to recapturing what metroid is all about. If all you want is more metroid in your life than stop reading and buy this game right now. This is a pretty solid metroidvania game, however I do not think it is worthy of a 10/10 (Remember it's still a very solid game especially if you hate waypoints and map markers). The game does a very good job at not telling you where to go yet still leading you in the right direction. Some of the items are very inventive and borderline genius. The Soundtrack was stuck in my head even weeks after finishing it. But there's one thing stopping me from giving it a perfect score.   The boss battles. Quite litteraly every boss in the game only has 3 attacks. On top of this they have twice the amount of health that they should have and only two of them have multiple phases. Even worse is that they don't have health bars either, so it sometimes feels like youre shooting at a brick wall until it finally caves in. EVEN WORSE is that most of the bosses can only be hit in one spot on their body, and that one spot is in the most inconvenient location it could possibly be in. Luckily this one flaw is overshadowed by its positive for the most part and a couple bosses lead to some very memorable moments.  If I had to give it a number out of ten, I'd give it an strong 8.

Date 2018-04-11 Playtime 11h 6m Rec Positive One of the best games I have ever played. Great story, great music and many secrets to find. One of the best Metroidvania !!!
Date 2018-04-11 Playtime 41h 24m Rec Positive This game steals a boss fight from you and it's super dumb. This game inspired Hollow Knight and that's pretty magical, but that just makes this stolen boss fight that much more heart breaking.  Tom could have even made a harder version of him instead of the other guy but no, ugh.  Screw you Tom, that descision has made the world a worse place permanently.  Other than that the game is great.  The last boss depends on your stats so that's dumb but it's fine unlike what I spoke of earlier.  It's a fun game to speedrun for sure too, especially since it has the greatest skip of all time imo.  I want to thumbs down the game pretty badly but that would do the rest of the work injustice.  Plus the money goes to Tom's son which is a good place to put money.  Tom is pretty not attention seeking as well and I like that.  It's just hard when Hollow Knight is perfect.  Anyway, play the game and see what I mean and be mad, the rest almost makes up for it.
Date 2018-04-10 Playtime 37h 45m Rec Positive I don't do many reviews.  Games are just like pickles.  So people love them...some people hate them.  Mostly they are some what inbetwenst.  I made up that word.  It's a good word.  The inbetwenst do not bother to do reviews.  I was not in-be-tween.  St.  I am 36 and grew up with a Commodore Amiga 500 with about 300 pirated games my dad had scored at his nerd factory job building robots that built cars.  So when I was 5...I had access to the most advanced games around at the time.  I still demanded a Nintendo because I was ignorant and I'm sure the other 5 year olds in preschool were rambling, babbling, and spurblulating about 'Mario.'  And yes....SNES kicked the Amiga's ass.  But the Amiga was the inbetwenst of the generation.  It had the graphics and sounds of the SNES....in 1985.  And was more adult with gory games that were awesome.  Probably why I'm kind of warped as a human.  Well...anyways...I'm doing this review.  This game seems like something that came out on Amiga 500...not NES.   Like exactly.  Like making me have PTSD when I play it.  AND IT IS AWESOME.  What do I not love about this game?  Well.....it could have lasted forever.  They could have kept updating it every month like a show and you could play it eternally with brand new content forever?  I wish that of the Souls series as well.  Zelda and Mario already get that treatment to a degree.  This game is amazing.  If you were a child and owned a Commodore Amiga 500 or up.....you must have this.  If you like oldscool sidescrollin rootin tootin metroid-lite very little vanias...well...this is for you.   I swear to Cthulu that they did the music on whatever they used for the Amiga.  It doesn't sound NES....it sounds Amiga.  In audibleness and in spirit.  Bravo.  I'll pay whatever for the sequal.  Seriously...make it expensive.  Don't care.  Will buy.
Date 2018-04-09 Playtime 15h 30m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is the indie pixel version of Metroid with labcoats.  The main theme of the game itself is mystery and illusion.  It'll reel you in and take you for a ride throughout your time playing.  You'll enjoy this game.
Date 2018-04-08 Playtime 14h 38m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania style game. Leans more towards the Metroid, and you can tell that it is inspired by Nintendo's iconic series by a lot of the level design. That being said, the game does try to do its own thing and has some pretty interesting weapon mechanics to mix it up. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys 2D-platformers that encourage exploration.
Date 2018-04-08 Playtime 19h 32m Rec Positive This is one of the best metroidvania type games I have EVER played!!  It was very challenging and there were so many things to do and places to explore!  Secrets...Secrets...and more Secrets!! I NEED MORE GAMES LIKE THIS!!! MAKE AN AXIOM VERGE 2!!
Date 2018-04-08 Playtime 18h 22m Rec Positive This game made me *feel* the beauty of its dystopian ruin.  It had the right amount of challenge and was long but not too long.  (It took 5 or 6 long sessions to complete.)  It's a well-polished super metroid clone with plenty of power-ups and Giger inspired chacacters/baddies mixed in.  A few of the boses are pretty tough so be prepared to strategize.
Date 2018-04-06 Playtime 14h 53m Rec Positive Muy buen juego tipo Metroid (es un clon vamos) con graficos que emula la época de los 8/16 bits y melodias Chiptunes. Si te gusta el género es indispensable ya que hacia tiempo que no me enganchaba un juego desde primera hora hasta acabarmelo. Tengo una premisa particular, de que si un juego es capaz de mantenerme enganchado hasta cerca de las 3 de la madrugada y que me dé rabia acostarme, es que tiene esa dosis de adicción (o magia) que se echa en falta en la mayoria de los juegos actuales para un jugador (el anterior fué el Zelda BotW)  Y además tiene mérito, porque el juego lo ha hecho integramente una persona, tanto el apartado de gráficos, música y evidentemente, programación.  En definitiva, un juego recomendado para los que tuvieron algún contacto con la saga metroid en 2D o para los que anden un poco saturados de mas de lo mismo y busquen algo diferente.
Date 2018-04-04 Playtime 19h 25m Rec Positive もうだめだ・・。僕はこの手のゲームが好き過ぎるのかもしれない・・。 巷ではこの手のゲームを「メトロイドヴァニア」と呼ぶらしい。 まさしくメトロイド（特にスーパーメトロイド）やドラキュラの月下なんかは大好物。 そんな人に圧倒的にオススメできる。 むしろ何でやってないのか問いただすレベル。  良い点 ・強化していく自分と、広がる世界の探索がとにかく楽しい ・攻略に選択性がある ・音楽とシナリオがミステリアスかつ良い  悪い点 ・これは後半悩まされたんだけど、とにかく移動が面倒 　あー・・あそこもいきたい！でも遠いなー！なんて言う時にワープポイントが有れば良いんだけど、基本ないので頑張る。  どっぷりハマって遊んでから時間立ってからレビュー書いてるけど、ほんといいゲームでした。 自分もこんなゲーム作りたい。作らねば。
Date 2018-04-02 Playtime 18h 7m Rec Positive Un très bon jeu méritant d'etre jouer. Je n'ai pas été déçu. Il rapelle assez bien les jeux Metroid, un univers similaire, des monstres variés, beaucoup d'armes toutes sympathiques les unes que les autres. Dans l'ensemble il est compliqué sans l'être, par moment il fait "mal à la tête", on ne sait pas trop ou aller mais pour moi sa donne un charme qui ne ma pas déplu.
Date 2018-04-02 Playtime 22h 6m Rec Positive The term metroidvania gets thrown around a lot these days, to where pretty much every game where you can move left is considered one. I won't say those games aren't fun, but when I want to play a real metroid-like game, I get frustrated a lot when that term is used loosely and end up becoming bored with those games.  Axiom Verge did not bore me. In fact, Axiom Verge may very be the greatest Metroidvania game outside of the namesake titles themselves, though make no mistake, it's even better than some Metroid or Castlevania games. Between the two, this one definitely leans toward the Metroid side of the spectrum, and that shows in every regard. Weird creepy music, space setting, exploring caverns, a plethora of items to collect: It's all here.  My favorite part of games like these is looking around, discovering you can't progress with your current equipment, looking around until you find what you need, and then getting to move forward. Metroid does it, Castlevania does it, Zelda does it, so if you like those games for that reason, Axiom Verge will be perfect for you. It's also loaded with optional pickups, and plenty of sequence breaks to make repeated playthroughs here.   According to Steam, I've played this game for 22 hours. That isn't true, that number is closer to 50, as I love this game so much that I bought it twice more, once on the Wii U and again on the Switch, because it's just that worth it to play it again.
Date 2018-04-01 Playtime 21h 18m Rec Positive Ein sehr gutes Spiel.
Date 2018-04-01 Playtime 1h 10m Rec Negative Got bored and frustrated fast.
Date 2018-04-01 Playtime 14h 3m Rec Positive Had a ball playing this game!  A good metroid-style game without being too much like the original. The story was interesting enough (I'm not really here for the plot). Music was good, and generally speaking the gameplay was too.  Thank goodness for the lock movement buttom. Really came in handy.
Date 2018-03-31 Playtime 0h 36m Rec Positive Amazing gameplay! Beautiful art! Killer retro soundtrack! Tons alot of fun!
Date 2018-03-29 Playtime 12h 12m Rec Positive 比较优秀的类银河战士游戏了。
Date 2018-03-28 Playtime 15h 44m Rec Positive Минусы 1. Баланс. По началу игра сложновата, но к середине всё упрощается. Пока не приходит пора 2-х последних боссов. И я не про боссов, а про врагов. Дойти до боссов сложнее, чем победить. Всё бы ничего, но такое изменение сложности происходит ОЧЕНЬ резко. Игра может и очень сложная, но эти скачки огорчают. 2. Оружия хоть и навалом, но большая его часть исключительно ситуативное, например если враг застрял. 3. Пальто. Его упраление неудобно. Хотя, может так и задумывалось. Просто для халата всё понятно, а про пальто нет. Плюсы 1. Сюжет. Концовка хоть и не нова, но довольно неожиданна. Сам сюжет достаточно хорош, даже без учёта того, что игру делал один человек. 2. Графика. Игра смотрится очень красиво. Правда дизайн врагов редко радует, но по боссам всё отлично. 3. Уровни. Каждый из них уникален. Вообщем, игра на раз, как по мне, но для одного человека это хороший стимул к созданию новых игр. Очень надеюсь.
Date 2018-03-26 Playtime 16h 12m Rec Negative Great game. Good story, challenging and variated gameplay. A lot of secrets.  BUT [spoiler] the last two bosses throw up all the precition that the game trains you to get, and the way to defeat both of them is spaming buttons. All the previus bosses are available for to beat them with now damage, not like the two last ones. [/spoiler]
Date 2018-03-25 Playtime 23h 36m Rec Positive Toujours pas fini, mais l'atmosphère est ultra prenante, et si le level design est assez old school(dans le sens où comme dans les vieux Metroid on peut facilement s'y perdre) et que les déplacements sont parfois un peu gênés par le placement de certaines plateformes, la musique géniale, les décors somptueux ainsi que des armes vraiment cool(et de nouvelles idées de gameplay top) en font mon Metroidvania favori :)
Date 2018-03-24 Playtime 11h 33m Rec Positive Sweet Metroidvania game all in all. Nice infusion of some unique mechanics that will quickly remind you your not just here for a braindead scroller. Aside from the strong traditional metroidvania elements in place (combat, exploration weapon variety, secrets) the weird gadget type items have very interesting effects that while not necessary at overly frequent intervals. They definitely add a good bit to the necessary moments, and additionally the exploration portions where you use one and it reveals a secret in an interesting way.  8.9/10|  
Date 2018-03-24 Playtime 18h 45m Rec Positive Amazing game. If you're a videogame klepto, this is your jam.
Date 2018-03-22 Playtime 18h 8m Rec Positive One of of the best metroidvania out there. Something cool about this game is that the uprades are all original and that backtracking is super rewarded.
Date 2018-03-21 Playtime 2h 49m Rec Negative я честно пытался заставить через силу пройти игру, но незашла. Честно говоря я не понимаю геймеров, которые прутся от таких игр с закосом за старую 8битную графу. Я еще помнюк ак играл в контрухардкорпс и т.д и т.п. но современных игроделов не понимаю, почему нельзя забацать что то не хуже, если железо не ограничивает.  Что не понравилось лично мне:1) задники, которая и рисует всю атмосферу, они сделаны убого, серо и некрасиво и этим не цеплят, а просто вырви глаз. 2) гребаный лабиринт - кое где конечно в тему в играх, но возвращаться, бродить или пытаться найти путь в е*ной мравейнике, только после нахождения определенной пушки для этого - это слишком. Мне не в кайф бегать заного и бродить по локациям которые я пробежал, все должно быть просто или хотя бы со стрелочками или подсказками. 3)сюжет. Возможно дальше он и раскроется, но блэть, без предыстории или с такой подачей как в японской х* где сначала ничерта не понятно а потом ты фанат манги (или че там)  - это не в моем вкусе.  Итог: игра строго на любителя, я лично ожидал лучшего, пару раз пытался играть, но гребаное лазанье по серым убогим лабиринтам ссо схемой хпойми куда идти в конец отбили у меня желание тратить на нее время. Есть много аналогов в разы лучше.
Date 2018-03-21 Playtime 35h 33m Rec Positive so much fun, handles well, hidden items all over the place. simple classic fun, totally worth it
Date 2018-03-21 Playtime 11h 8m Rec Negative Ripped pieces of old popular games. Nothing new, cheap and bad art, old, stamped lore. Lame, easy bosses. Not worth its money. Overrated 100%. Waste of time.
Date 2018-03-18 Playtime 14h 31m Rec Positive I almost wanted to give up on this game.  The start feels slow and early upgrades don't give much punch.  I also realized I don't have the same patience for all the "hidden" walls in classic 'Metroid' style.    That being said, as the game progressed I enjoyed it more.  The movement abilities helped a lot (though a teleport system between save stations AKA-Rebirth Chambers).  This is personal taste, but I also started to enjoy the game more when I played with a map/guide so that all the backtracking wasn't as painful.    There clearly was a good amount of work put into this game, and the world draws interest.  Don't expect too much hand holding on the "world's lore" but it's there if you are inclined to look.  Overall I would only recommend this for people interested in the genre.  While enjoyable, I can't say it's to the same quality the more "classic" titles it draws inspiration from.    3/5
Date 2018-03-17 Playtime 28h 1m Rec Positive Il panorama videoludico contemporaneo ha bisogno di giochi ascrivibili nella categoria Metroidvania.  Ma si badi bene, non basta produrre un titolo che emuli o riproduca banalmente il concept di un Metroid o Super Metroid, è necessario un qualcosa di più, inventiva, creatività e soprattutto passione. Ed è proprio la passione di Tom Happ che trasuda da Axiom Verge, un titolo che ha un impatto visivo netto, quasi impressionante: il giocatore si trova proiettato in un mondo alieno, ostile, sinistro e disgustoso. Sacche di materia organica  pulsanti di vita, creature striscianti, umanoidi, predatori in attesa del momento adatto per attentare al giocatore sono solo una parte della fauna del gioco, ma tale da rendere consistente l'immersione del giocatore in un ambiente sconosciuto, pericoloso, inquietante.  Axiom Verge riesce a costruire una sensazione di alienazione e tensione anche mediante la presenza di boss ciclopici e disturbanti (un po' facili a dire il vero), a cui dona molto il gioco di telecamera effettuato ad inizio scontro.  L'OST del gioco è pienamente congeniale allo stile e tema del gioco, in parte composta da temi dissonanti e in parte da composizioni energetiche e molto godibili.  Il gameplay si scinde, secondo canoni classici, in esplorazione platform e combattimenti con armi da fuoco, in particolare, la varietà di armi è davvero notevole, essendo presenti più di 20 differenti fucili, ciascuno con proprietà diverse e potenzialmente utili in situazioni e con boss diversi (anche se sotto questo profilo lo sviluppo di nemici o boss più mobili avrebbe di molto incoraggiato la pratica di provare ed equipaggiare armi differenti).  L'aspetto più soddisfacente ed apprezzabile in assoluto, è tuttavia rappresentato dai contenuti puramente originali e insapettati introdotti dallo sviluppatore: lo scompositore, la trivella, il drone e relativi potenziamenti (specialmente l'ultimo , in grado di consentire un dinamismo notevole) e soprattutto il camice. Ognuno di questi power up rappresenta una volontà di allontanarsi dai "lidi sicuri" di Metroid, basta pensare al fatto che, per esperienza personale, iniziato il gioco, mi sono chiesto continuamete a quale punto dell'avventura avrei sbloccato il doppio salto, come se ciò fosse una cosa ovvia e scontata. La mia sorpresa nel proseguire e terminare Axiom Verge senza che questo potenziamento fosse stato mai implementato, mi ha  lasciato molto soddisfatto, potendo apprezzare l'originalità e il coraggio di rompere schemi classici e collaudati.  Insomma, nonostante dei difettucci, comunque presenti (assenza di un senso di profondità e di chiarezza stlistica in certi ambienti, o la necessità praticamente di controllare qualsiasi muro possibile ed immaginabile), consiglio vivamente questo titolo a tutti i Metroid aficionados e coloro che apprezzano l'originalità e la creatività su concept classici e solidi.
Date 2018-03-17 Playtime 21h 36m Rec Positive A very enjoyable metroidvania, with an above-average story, great music, and late-game powerups that make backtracking to sweep up those locked and hidden items much easier. Definitely recommended to any Metroid fan.
Date 2018-03-13 Playtime 13h 18m Rec Positive I was skeptical about this game.  I find that too often "retro" graphics are just a sign of laziness.  When I learned that this entire game was created by 1 person I was much more impressed.   The game itself is classic Metroid with a wild variety of weapons.  All of the hallmarks of the MetroidVania formula are here with locked doors, impossible jumps that simply can't be done until you obtain whatever item or tool is required to progress.  The weapon variety here is quite impressive including some that are definitely "outside the box" from what you would expect.  I don't want to spoil anything but just suffice it to say when you think the game is broken/glitched it's possible it was intended to be that way for a reason.  Overall a big thumbs up for any Metroid fans out there.  The graphics will grow on you - give it a chance!
Date 2018-03-11 Playtime 4h 47m Rec Positive Buenísimo, excelente ost, fiel a los metroidvanias de todos los tiempos, sencillo lleno de secretos, armamento por montones y muchas horas de juego si te gusta la exploración, y todo hecho por una sola persona, simplemente especatcular.
Date 2018-03-11 Playtime 20h 51m Rec Positive Absolutely fantastic! This game feels heavilly inspired by Super Metroid (and the other 2d Metroid games), which was a favorite of mine. However, it builds from that base and takes it further - adding unique gameplay elements and mechanics, a fabulous score, a unique and interesting storyline, and beautiful and lovingly detailed visuals. It's polished, plays perfectly (with a couple exceptions relating to some movement related items you get later in the game), and feels as good as any AAA 2d game I have played. Highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre.
Date 2018-03-08 Playtime 8h 25m Rec Negative Incredibally Meh. Most of the exploration is fiddling with the tools you given around walls you are told by the map arn't actually walls, and the most complex fights consist of sprawying one weapon and switching to another while crouched in a corner. At no point did I feel clever, or powerful, or anything at all really. There are a bunch of weapons, but they all function the same and only a few of them are ever more useful than your starting pea shooter.   The only thing at all interesting about the game is the tools you unlock, which are pleasantly unique and cool for the first minuete you find them.The only downside is that, because they are truley unexpected, you'll often pass by an area you need to go back and access once you find a new tool, but compleatly ignore it because it looks like just a normal wall and forget about it by the time you get what you neet to get past it, so you end up having to take another loop around the map clicking all of your buttons at all of the walls.  At no point was I excited about what I'd find in the next room, or at all invested in the story for that matter. It's just... really boring.
Date 2018-03-07 Playtime 32h 0m Rec Positive Beautiful, mysterious game. Super fun to play with the steam controller. Great style all around and the plot had many shocking moments in it that kept me interested and motivated to finish.
Date 2018-03-05 Playtime 45h 12m Rec Positive Overall, this is an amazing game. It truly captures the "Metroidvania" style in a way that many others fail to. From the gameplay mechanics to the music, graphics and atmosphere, it's an original work of art. This is a game that makes you wish there were countless sequels. After beating this on hard mode and finding 96% of the items, there isn't much else to test your powerful weaponry on.   *9/10*
Date 2018-03-05 Playtime 12h 23m Rec Positive [i]作为一个小时候没有玩过恶魔城、银河战士的“新世代玩家"，如果我在这个评测中出现了一些错误欢迎指正。[/i] 《Axiom Verge》作为一款非常古典的类恶魔城银河战士游戏，这个游戏无论哪一个方面都非常的古典。像素风格的画面、8-bit的音乐、复古的怪物设计以及游戏模式，如果不是看了游戏的发售时间我可能会觉得是10年前的游戏。哪怕是相似风格、相同类型的《momodora》，都没有这款游戏古典的那么彻底。但是在古典的背后，这游戏也不是完全复制过去游戏的模式，而是有着制作者自己的思考在其中。[b] 旧瓶装新酒但是留有旧酒香[/b] ，这是我对这个游戏的一个总体评价。 首先来说说这个游戏的战斗设计吧。由于没有玩过银河战士，在这类游戏使用枪械作为武器对我来说还是很新鲜的。个人感觉枪械的模式与冷兵器的模式还是有着很大区别。包括小怪设计、boss设计以及地形设计都有着很大的区别。个人觉得这个游戏中战斗的要素对比同一类型的《Hollow Knight》略逊一筹。游戏中通过“锁定移动”按键，使得游戏可以斜向射击而不会移动，但是个人觉得这一操作也加大了一定的难度。游戏中有一个很有意思的设定就是可以通过一个系列的特殊能力对怪物产生影响，这让游戏在一个相对没有那么有趣的战斗上多了些乐趣。游戏中设计了多达十余种的子弹，[strike]虽然大多数子弹的设计在这个游戏中没什么用[/strike]，不过好在每种子弹都有着自己的设计而不是单纯的升级威力，虽然不多但是子弹在游戏中也有着相当于特殊能力有着推进地图的作用。不过这类游戏战斗设计并不是游戏的核心乐趣。 作为一个类恶魔城银河战士游戏，最为关键的核心乐趣就在于地图的探索。而游戏中地图的设计以及特殊推进地图能力的设计就是重中之重。除了特殊子弹以外，游戏中推进地图的特殊能力有着非常多种。导致手柄玩这个游戏几乎所有的按键都有着很重要的作用。而且就设计来看可以看出作者是有花了心思的，有些能力你看了会惊呼还能这么玩。但是问题是游戏地图过小，导致了空有者总多而且有趣的能力，但是还没有完全体会到这些乐趣就结束了，如果这个游戏有着《Hollow Knight》的流程长度可能这个问题就能迎刃而解。并且能力之间有着定位略微重复的问题，虽然这个问题不大但是也略微影响了游戏。整体来看游戏这个方面设计还是非常不错的，虽然存在一些问题，但是还是可以给出9分的。其实这方面我想大书特书，但是为了不过多剧透，只好说这么多。当你自己玩了游戏，你就会理解这个游戏的优秀之处。 总体来看游戏非常好玩，略微臃肿的能力与子弹设计也可以看出制作者的野心之大。我个人觉得游戏这个问题一个原因是独立游戏制作各种资源都很紧缺，没法真正按制作者的想法完美的呈现游戏；另一原因是制作者并不想简化游戏导致最后游戏略微复杂。我相信这个制作人的下一个游戏也一样的精彩。
Date 2018-03-04 Playtime 41h 22m Rec Positive 相对于常见的类银河战士恶魔城游戏而言，这款游戏更类似于初代的银河战士。因为它不会像现在的大多数同类游戏一样去明确的告诉你下一个副本的入口在哪里，也不会告诉你下一个关键道具的大概位置或者副本的入口具体在哪个方位，更多的时候是利用各种场景和地形去限制玩家暂时能探索的范围。虽然玩家拥有一张能记录下自己走过位置的地图，但是更多时候玩家还是会在一片区域里面漫无目的的游荡，而为它们发现的每一个升级道具欣喜若狂。相对于现在的大多数类银河战士恶魔城游戏而言，这款游戏很多时候并不具有很强的目的性，但是它正是通过对直接引导做进行了一定程度的删减，而让玩家得到了另外一种截然不同的游戏体验。 Axiom Verge相对于现在流行的电子游戏而言，可能并不是一个适合于新手入门或者刚刚接触类银河战士恶魔城的玩家的作品，毕竟它需要一个玩家花上许多时间去在地图中不断绕来绕去，走回头路或者忠实的记录下每一个特殊地点的游戏。但是这对于那些已经对同类型游戏产生一定程度的厌倦的玩家可能会是一个相对更加有个性和“新意”的一款游戏。又或者说，这是一款像班尼特福迪所呼吁的那样，不想让你将其当作消耗品去游玩，而是一款想让你在重复中不断去体会游戏想要传达的那种特殊意境的游戏。
Date 2018-03-03 Playtime 8h 20m Rec Negative Pretty boring and repetative. The backtracking and "exploring" of metroidvania seems played out. Not sure why anyone would want to bother.
Date 2018-03-03 Playtime 17h 52m Rec Positive This game is great for a person who enjoys a classic side scroller with some cool innovative game mechanics.
Date 2018-03-03 Playtime 15h 6m Rec Positive Encore un jeu qui traînait depuis un moment dans ma biblio Steam après un achat pendant des soldes, je ne savais pas trop quoi en penser à première vue, alors, j'ai décidé de me le faire.  Alors qu'en est-il ? Et bien, j'ai fait pas mal de Metroidvania, certains en valent la peine, d'autre sont vite oubliable.  Axiom Verge est un excellent Metroid like, assez long (15h si on compte le 100%) et avec un mode speedrun pour les plus chaud d'entre nous. Bref, un bon Metroid like donc (sans pour autant être une bête copie), plein d'items, ENORMEMENT d'armes différentes, des secrets, des boss sympas, la BO excellente, et les environnements d'un endroit à un autre sont tous bien différents. Quant à la difficulté, elle est bien dosée, et les trophées, pour ceux qui aiment bien ça, sont assez sympas à faire.  Bref, je vous le recommande sans problème. ;)
Date 2018-03-02 Playtime 13h 19m Rec Positive This game is good except that the map isn't clear on where you have to go, so if you played the game for a while like I did, and took a 3 week hiatus and came back, there is pretty much no chance of finding where you have to go by youself. Buy it on sale.
Date 2018-03-01 Playtime 18h 43m Rec Positive A good metroidvania game, with good soundtrack.
Date 2018-03-01 Playtime 1h 0m Rec Positive I have to wipe super metroid on super nes, and voila axiom verge. thank you very much to thomas app for his colossal work to bring me back to my childhood !! I am a fan of this big game, which was made by one man, the games are world and I join him completely, bravo and thank you to him for having made me travel.  ps: I really recommend it to those who like speedruner, retro gaming, or simply fall back into childhood !!
Date 2018-03-01 Playtime 13h 8m Rec Positive A fun little Metroid-vania...well worth checking out for any fan of 8 bit gaming  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG1AO4O-NMw
Date 2018-02-28 Playtime 10h 51m Rec Positive Yeah it's pretty good.
Date 2018-02-28 Playtime 10h 32m Rec Positive Reminded me of Metroid Zero mission at its best and a badly designed NES game at it's worst.  Exploration was frighteningly rewarding, and the music was pretty pumping.  It's a comptent Metroidvania and it fullfills my fetish for boss themes that start with a siren.
Date 2018-02-27 Playtime 26h 56m Rec Positive Excellent platform video game, lots of replayability, lots of upgrades huge map. 100% Recommended.
Date 2018-02-26 Playtime 11h 48m Rec Positive Great retro metroid game. Don't let the gfx fool you, the game play is great.
Date 2018-02-26 Playtime 14h 17m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is what happens when one man wants to make a Metroid game without stepping on Nintendo’s intellectual property. There’s been a number of discussions about the game, usually calling it a Metroidvania, or a retro game of many styles. Honestly, I think they are mistaken. This is a hardcore Metroid game, not even a Metroidvania because that term tries to show the games that are offshoots of Castlevania Symphony of the night. This game is clearly trying to appeal to the original Metroid and it does a great version of it. It’s Metroid from the first moment… if it was done by a different company.   There was a popular fan game made in 2016 called A2MR, a remake of Metroid 2 and like most fan remakes I asked: “Why didn’t you take the work you put into that game and make your own game, make a ton of money and not get a Cease and Desist letter from Nintendo?” Axiom Verge actually was already out and had done all that. Well, I’m not sure it made a ton of money but it’s what a true fangame should be. Clear inspiration but not actually infringing on the original concept.   Axiom Verge doesn’t infringe on Metroid other than a concept and theme, and that’s really remarkably done. While Metroid does give the player weapons, Axiom Verge just blows that away. There’s a ton of items in this game, 20 different primary weapons, 16 “tools”, notes, upgrades, and more. This game is packed with stuff to find.   The concepts, on the other hand, are similar, but they are achieved in different ways. There are tight spaces, clearly a call for the morph ball. Except it’s not, there’s actually a drone that the player can use to get into small areas. There’s no screw attack, there’s no super speed run, in fact, only a few weapons have similarities to the original game, and that’s to be expected from 20 different weapons.   Unfortunately about half these concepts have issues. The drone is done excellently. The “lab coat” allows you to phase walls when you are standing next to them, just an odd feeling when you do that because you have to press against the wall. But for almost every annoying concept like the lab coat, there’s an upgrade like the trench coat that improves it (you can dash anytime rather than when you’re standing next to a wall, and farther too). Of course, the concept of a generic lab coat or trenchcoat doing this makes little sense. The fact that I had to play almost half the game with the inferior lab coat was quite annoying. It’s a shame because when you get the trench coat the game feels amazing. But there’s been a bad taste in your mouth for at least two to three hours because the lab coat isn’t fun.   Another problem comes in the controller itself. The game allows you to map 20 buttons, and it will use EVERY one of those buttons. It also requires 4 buttons (The directions on the R stick) for weapon selection, which means the game can’t be a twin-stick shooter, something I wanted after a couple hours. I remapped a bunch of it in-game, but then I remapped it again with the steam controller to use the grips. The fact I needed to demonstrates how crowded the controller is. Also, the lack of an auto-fire stinks as before long your finger gets tired, or you switch to weapons that have an auto fire.   When you get down to it, the real problems likely can be attributed to one thing. One guy made the entire game, and before I go on, I have to say that’s amazing. Thomas Happ deserves a lot of credit. But in the world of indie games, there have been some amazing things done by a single guy like Stardew Valley and the origins of Minecraft, and being a single person developer terrifies me. I applaud Thomas Happ for everything he does for this game, but I am forced to judge this game based on the game, not the difficulty for making the game, and the question has to be how does this stand up to other 20 dollar games, not just how does it stand up to the single person teams out there because we’re asked to spend 20 dollars on it.  There are small things that irk me. Thomas Happ was a programmer and honestly, the game is incredible from a programming aspect. The rest of the game is a mixed bag. One thing I noticed is the game lacks the true gravitas of Metroid. You can hear and feel it when you pick up an item. It’s supposed to be this great moment, especially when you pick up your first gun, and instead, a small blip plays and some weird text appears on the screen and goes away. It doesn’t have that great moment of reveal. Small things like that irk me on the game.   There’s also a heavy push towards this “glitch” mentality. Which could be cool but it is used too often and it seems to be a call back to NES graphical glitches. I get it, but it feels more like a broken game than a really cool feature. The glitched aspects of the enemies tend to be less pronounced as well, so the really cool feature doesn’t work. And it’s not even a part of the thematic story either. It just felt like I broke something, and not in a cool “You broke the game” way, but “The game is broken” way.   The game has other small design annoyances as well, the map didn’t work properly (probably because I remapped keys, I couldn’t set reminders). But it also didn’t have an objective marker, so I couldn’t see a theory of where I should be going. These markers didn’t have to be direct maybe an overarching idea of the direction I should be moving, but instead, the game hopes you’ll remember an idea of the direction and relies a lot on exploration. I did have to look up where to go a few times.  A big one is right after an exploration of Kur where you get a drone.   There are other things I really would have loved to use to go back and see everything. There’s no scope so often you have to go drill a number of blocks or try to break everything. I also would have loved to have something on my map to show me all the items I’ve seen but haven’t been able to get with the tools I had at the time. Trying to fully explore the map also could get quite annoying especially in the tallest rooms.   But on the other hand, it’s not a bad game. There’s a lot to like here. The challenge especially is fantastic. I love fighting the enemies, I think I died only a few times, and only one really annoying section. I only died once or twice on bosses, but most of them really challenged me and made me try to figure out the best solution to their patterns.   That’s the thing, there’s nothing in here that was bad to the point where I put down the game (well aside from my controller mechanically dying, but that’s not this game’s fault). And I wanted to play a Metroid game, honestly, I was hoping for a little more Super Metroid which is my favorite, but this is more of an NES style and it’s great at that.   The gameplay is solid, the action is great, and the feeling is retro without feeling outdated. I enjoyed almost every minute I played the game. But overall the game itself isn’t perfect, and I think that the flaws are a thing that should have been caught or fixed even in the three years since it’s come out.   Yet, I heavily recommend this game, especially if people want to play a Metroid game, and especially if they want to see a different take on it. I think the weapon systems here are better. I love the bosses here, and the fact they weren’t based on 20-year-old designs that I’ve found more times than I can count. It’s not better than Super Metroid, but at the same time, it doesn’t need to be. I can still enjoy a classic SNES title, and enjoy Axiom Verge at the same time and at the end of the day I do. Axiom Verge is a solid game and should be played by any Metroid fan who can accept another game in the genre. And if Super Axiom Verge ever comes out, it’ll be a great day for the genre as well.

Date 2018-02-25 Playtime 18h 19m Rec Positive One of the best side-scrolling platformers of all time.  If you loved games like Metroid, Mega Man, Castlevania, Bionic Commando, etc., you MUST play this game!  The gameplay alone is pretty solid.  Lots of places to explore, interesting weapons and items, incredible boss fights, all of it intelligently designed.  Combined with it's own unique art style, amazing music that conveys the mood and atmosphere beatifully, and a story that is as solidly entertaining as it is thought-provoking and you've got an absolute hit!  A must-have for anyone who is even remotely interested in side-scrolling platformers!
Date 2018-02-25 Playtime 18h 19m Rec Positive Ótimo metroidvania, trilha sonora ok, bastantes inimigos, boss battles bem legais, vários upgrades e diversos tipos de tiro. Só achei que alguns upgrades são bem inúteis mais pra frente do jogo .
Date 2018-02-24 Playtime 15h 50m Rec Positive Simple graphics, with superficially simple game play. As you go on you are introduced to more and more ways to interact with the world, making it very engaging and fun experience.  Oh and the music was great too!
Date 2018-02-23 Playtime 30h 21m Rec Positive First off, this is a pretty fun game to play. It's neither too challenging, nor too easy. The music is some of the best I've heard in a game, and the graphics are just gorgeous. It runs pretty well, even on low-end computers, the worst you'll experience is a little bit of lag, nothing too game-breaking. Highlights: Gorgeous H. R. Giger-esque graphics and excellent music, of which the former is synced with the latter. The planet Sudra is basically one giant dance party. When you run low on health, the beep that accompanies it syncs to the beat of the music, removing one of the more annoying aspects of being on low health. There's a wide variety of weapons that you can use, some of which can help you progress. One of the game's key mechanics is inspired by game glitches, such as the minus world in Mario, which adds an interesting bit of strategy to the game. The story's pretty good, with just enough guesswork to keep you questioning what you really know. Detractions: The controls take some getting used to, the boss fights aren't particularly notable, even becoming tedious for some, and there isn't a whole lot of early game exploration- there is even a point where you cannot backtrack until you get an item that helps you navigate the area. There isn't much in the way of replayability, once you've beaten the game, you've pretty much played it every time after.  This is a good game, definitely one to experience, and is worth the price. If you're looking for a game to play, I highly recommend this.
Date 2018-02-23 Playtime 13h 17m Rec Negative Telegraphed the BIG TWIST by giving the protagonist and the antagonist the same stupid hair.   I only beat this subpar Metroidvania because I wanted to see what the next gun I picked up would be.   Speaking of which, there's hardly any true Metroidvania backtracking or replaying until a very limited portionof the endgame.   Environments, sprites and the inhabitants of Sidra? Sudra? Sudha? are anonymous and completely forgetable. Music has two or so memorable tracks and a whole bunch of filler.
Date 2018-02-22 Playtime 13h 3m Rec Positive It feels like a Reskin of Super Metroid except with new Levels n' Stuff. I like it.
Date 2018-02-22 Playtime 12h 21m Rec Positive If I could marry this game, I probably wouldn't, but I'd at least give it some thought.
Date 2018-02-22 Playtime 17h 43m Rec Positive It's just extremely good. My feelings about this game are Overwhelmingly Positive.  
Date 2018-02-21 Playtime 17h 1m Rec Positive Um Metroid Cyberpunk com excelente jogabilidade.  É até difícil acreditar que uma única pessoa desenvolveu esse jogo. Os "ISTAS" que me perdoem, mas esse jogo tem a jogabilidade muito melhor que a dos jogos Metroid. [spoiler] ...e olha que eu amo o Metroid Fusion, ein... [/spoiler]
Date 2018-02-20 Playtime 20h 34m Rec Positive This is one of the best Metroidvania games from the last years. They got the controls right, the ambient right, the level design right, almost everything is perfect.  I am enjoying it a lot and would recomend to any fan of the genre.
Date 2018-02-20 Playtime 11h 33m Rec Positive 7/10  Interesting game with some cool concepts and interactions. Final boss fight is not super well balanced unless you have certain specific weapons that you have to go out of your way to find before the end. I didn't love the backtracking in this game, but I suppose that's what a metroid-vania is all about. Enjoyed the game overall and would say it's worth picking up to play through.
Date 2018-02-20 Playtime 15h 54m Rec Positive Recommended for people that like metroidvania, 2d platformers, sci fi etc. I enjoyed it.  The game starts out VERY metroid-ey, but it moves a way from that somewhat.  THE GOOD: The gameplay is really tight, the game has excellent pacing, and is well coded. I love the upgrades you get and the animations for weapons and explosions. I liked the plot. There is a cool thing were all the background animations sync up with the music in the levels which is a nice touch (the music itself is pretty odd but in a good way). The glitch weapon stuff is really cool.   THE NOT SO GOOD: It's really impressive that one guy did it all..... but I think it could have been a lot better with some other people helping with artwork and enemy design. Some of the areas and enemies were boring or just downright ugly.
Date 2018-02-20 Playtime 14h 37m Rec Positive Bellissimo metroidvania, con tantissimi riferimenti a giochi di un paio di decenni fa, ricchissimo di armi e segreti, che comportano una varietà notevole e un'attenzione all'esplorazione piuttosto marcata. Piacevoli le musiche e la trama anche se non particolarmente originale, ma per essere un lavoro fatto da una persona sola non si poteva chiedere di più. Consigliato!
Date 2018-02-20 Playtime 11h 49m Rec Negative  Amazing game one of the best in the more Metroid side of the MetroidVania genre. It's only let down is how abhorrently stupid the game gets at the end. Give it a pass.
Date 2018-02-20 Playtime 10h 48m Rec Positive 这款游戏很硬核，也很考验操作，但是玩过黑魂和仁王以后感觉这种游戏不就是多死几次的事吗，推荐这款游戏，音乐也很好听

Date 2018-02-18 Playtime 11h 2m Rec Positive great metroidvania
Date 2018-02-18 Playtime 13h 13m Rec Negative Ok, I have just played for 25 minutes but I have to say this. This is not complete analysis, just a rant of the graphic and sound part which grind my gears. Don't take it as a review nor too seriously.  Why the fuck they want to emulate 8 bit nes style graphics so badly but they screw it by adding effects which are from modern eras? Let me be honest, I'm not fan of 8 bit graphics, I'd rather have 16 bit snes/mega drive/neo geo or later for this type of games, take iconoclasts for example. Or if they want to do a simple pixel art just take it as an artistic insipiration, like aegis defenders. Of course I understand someone wants to embrace something fully as this game, but why do you screw it? The explosion effect from enemies for example, that's something out of a snes or psx, like the video jitter effect when you hit bosses. This effects are from a more modern era in an older graphic style game, feels so out of place I really don't understand how it got pass during developement. And we have that while we also have this horrible colour palette that makes me want to gouge my eyes because of all the red and brown, there are more colours out there. The music sounds fine but the effects sound so low quality I had to lower the volume because it was really annoying, they sound bad on purpose.  Fully embrace it or just do something more acceptable to modern standards. Or just do a nes rom. Don't mix things, it looks bad.
Date 2018-02-14 Playtime 13h 36m Rec Positive Прошел запоем и могу сказать, что игра точно запомнилась. Очень крутая стилизация графики и музыки под 8 битные игры. Для ностальгирующих самое то.  Но! При такой шикарной атмосфере чужеродного мира очень удивил дизайн врагов. Это что, блин, за летающие пончики и ромашки? Боссы офигенны, но хотелось бы больше.
Date 2018-02-12 Playtime 24h 53m Rec Positive Incroyable. Ce jeu est incroyable, dans le bon sens du terme ! J'aime bien le style rétro, mais la bande-annonce d'Axiom Verge ne m'avait pas du tout fait envie à l'époque où il est sorti. Le temps a passé, et un ami m'a vivement recommandé de l'essayer. Je me suis laissée tenter. J'ai tout de suite regretté de ne pas l'avoir pris plus tôt !  Vous aimez Castlevania : Symphony of the Night, et/ou Super Metroid ? Axiom Verge va vous régaler. Axiom Verge a le mérite d'être le bébé d'un seul homme (il a quasiment tout fait pendant les 5 ans du développement du jeu), et on sent le soin, la passion, et le talent, à travers les aventures étranges du scientifique Trace. Les graphismes évoquent ceux de la NES, mais dans ce que ça offre de mieux ! L'ambiance musicale et sonore sont très bien travaillées et on s'immerge très vite dans cette planète en péril. Y a des tonnes d'objets et power-ups cachés qui va vous donner du fil à retordre, mais si vous aimez fouiller, vous allez en avoir pour votre argent ! J'ai bien voyagé, bien trippé avec Axiom Verge. Il est possible de le faire en hard mode, ainsi qu'en mode speedrun (avec un petit regret pour la mise à jour d'il y a quelques mois qui supprime certains combos de mouvements et qui ralentissent la performance optimale du speedrun). Je vous recommande chaudement ce jeu, c'est une vraie claque, un bel hommage aux metroidvanias.
Date 2018-02-12 Playtime 13h 14m Rec Positive fun
Date 2018-02-12 Playtime 11h 46m Rec Positive Excellent Metroidvania - I'm only a few hours in, but the only drawback so far is lack of quick travel which leads to a lot of back tracking for areas previously inaccessible until you get the right items.
Date 2018-02-12 Playtime 19h 56m Rec Positive I enjoyed Axiom Verge, I really did.  But, since so many people lately are praising it, I'm going to do something different with my review and say the one thing I didn't like.  And that's the bosses.  Most of the bosses, instead of being challenging and rewarding fights, are either long and tedious, or really easy to cheese.  I either beat the bosses in a few seconds, or, in the case of the mechanical beam lance boss, had to duck in and out of the room in order to survive.  Just in general, the bosses are kinda lackluster.  The rest of the game, music, exploring sections, etc. is amazing though, and I still reccommend you check it out, especially if you are a fan of original & Super Metroid.
Date 2018-02-11 Playtime 15h 15m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania with an amazingly deep story that you have to figure out in little bits and pieces. After finishing I found myself scouring the internet for hours to look for theories and interpretations! Highly recommended. Great soundtrack, gameplay and visuals :)
Date 2018-02-10 Playtime 12h 3m Rec Positive I really enjoyed this game although I sometimes had to push myself to finish it.  The game delivers a massive amount of content, "forced" parts as well as much more hidden stuff (that takes a lot of time to collect since the travelling takes so much time >.<); nice and challenging puzzles; an interesting lore that can be deepened by additional documents throughout the game; a devastating amount of useless weapons but also some decent ones. Given that huge amount of stuff you spend a ton of time getting to points where you died, even more time backtracking and the last bit of time to finde all the secrets.  Only things that bothered me a little: [list] [*]You have to bring a good amount of patience and curiouness to find the proper way through the game since there is no real guidance or indications what you have to do (whereby I sometimes needed pauses to cope with immerse frustration) [*]There is no fast-travel, which means you have to walk everything, like EVERYTHING. This gets a little bit better towards the end of the game given that you discover some shortcuts but still remains time-consuming [*]The controls are okay but not really responsive in my opinion and made me tilt of the face of earth several times [/list]
Date 2018-02-08 Playtime 30h 47m Rec Positive There's gotta be more..
Date 2018-02-07 Playtime 26h 41m Rec Positive Esse jogo... Quando eu não tinha mais esperanças de receber um novo Metroid em 2D, lá em 2015, eis que é lançado Axiom Verge, tinha jogado a primeira hora do game, mas na época não me prendeu muito, 2 anos depois (em 2017), eu baixei e joguei o jogo denovo, dessa vez zerando e passei a amar este jogo simplesmente perfeito, tanto que pra zerar a 3 vez eu tive que comprar o game na sua versão mais cara, então, vou dar alguns motivos do porque você devia comprá-lo.  (PRIMEIRO, NÃO É UMA CÓPIA EXATA DE METROID SE É ISSO QUE O IMPEDE DE JOGAR OU COMPRAR O GAME)  Então, vamos por partes...  [h1] JOGABILIDADE [/h1] O mais puro e lindo gameplay de plataforma clássico dos anos 80/90, sem muito o que dizer, você pula, anda, atira, da um tipo de ''Lock-on'' pra atirar na diagonal, depois há algumas variações que se dá as habilidades que você obtem (Drone, Teleport do drone, Atravessar as paredes, Hack, etc) e a troca de armas.  [h1] MÚSICA [/h1] Se você gosta da OST dos jogos da franquia Metroid, você vai amar o que esse jogo tem a oferecer, são Tracks lindas e totalmente distintas umas das outras, o que já ajuda bastante a montar todo o cenário que você está, sem contar nas partes de extrema isolação onde nem a OST te faz companhia, e tenha um foco enorme na Track ''Vital Tide'' que toca na 3° Área, que me lembra muito a Track ''Brinstar Red Soil / Lower Brinstar'' de ''Super Metroid''  [h1] GRÁFICOS [/h1] Gráficos pixelados em 8 bits simplesmente lindos e bem detalhados, você não vai se desapontar  [h1] PROGRESSÃO [/h1] Cara, sabe oq é ter mais de 20 opções diferentes de matar um inimigo? Então, ou você mata com as 20 e poucas armas disponiveis, ou com os outros itens que você adquiriu, sério, no final do game você se sente o cara mais monstruosamente poderoso que já existiu, nada te para.  [h1] DIFICULDADE [/h1] Você morre ok, ainda mais no começo, e depois em alguns dos bosses, não é um jogo dificil, mas também não é daqueles que segura sua mão enquanto você corre.  [h1] BOSSES [/h1] São esquecíveis, nenhum realmente vai te marcar, exceto do último Boss que simplesmente é um dos meu antagonistas favoritos (mesmo tendo aparecido pouco no primeiro game)  [h1] HISTÓRIA [/h1] Esse jogo tem uma história perfeita, um plot twist perfeito, personagens perfeitos, sério, se você não cair da cadeira com aquele final eu não sei mais como posso fazer pra você adorar esse game tanto quanto eu.  SÉRIO, SÓ COMPRA ISSO E JOGA PFV, E SEJA MAIS UM DOS FÃS QUE ESTÃO ESPERANDO A CONTINUAÇÃO QUE TÁ PROMETENDO SER MAIS O ''VANIA'' DO GENERO ''METROIDVANIA''

Date 2018-02-06 Playtime 14h 18m Rec Positive really good
Date 2018-02-04 Playtime 12h 0m Rec Positive Incredible for a solo-dev to make such a great game, it's the feel of metroid, but more welcoming, the auto-save point revive removes a lot of frustration from the game.
Date 2018-02-04 Playtime 16h 37m Rec Positive A phenomenal Metroidvania.  Highly recommended.
Date 2018-02-03 Playtime 11h 21m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is the real deal, and quite the feat when you find out its all made by one dude.  A great-looking metroidvania with funky upgrades and an absolutely killer soundtrack.    The way the story starts out I wondered if this was going to even be worth my time. But as you go on it becomes pretty interesting.    My only gripe with the game is that the backtracking can be a little extreme. I eventually came to the realization at points that there’s no way I’d know what to do if it wasn’t for an online-guide (so thanks for those how-to-guides internet-heroes!) 
Date 2018-02-03 Playtime 10h 13m Rec Positive 1.和银河战士很像 2.剧情很有意思，逻辑很复杂又很有深意 3.武器种类很多，超多的隐藏 4.存在一个随机区域 5.暂时没中文 6.好玩，就是这样
Date 2018-02-02 Playtime 39h 58m Rec Positive A great Metroidvania! My only complaints about this game are:  #1: You need to use cheats to unlock certain areas of the game; I feel that this shouldn’t be the case at all, the player should explore and unlock everything without cheats.  #2: Too many weapons that feel the same; many weapons are extremely long range, as a result they become redundant to only 3 good long range weapons.   Other than that, this game is great

Date 2018-01-31 Playtime 20h 41m Rec Positive A must play for any Metroid fan. This game made me crave more and more games of this genre.
Date 2018-01-30 Playtime 35h 19m Rec Positive Axiom Verge, desenvolvimento de 5 anos por Thomas Happ, inspirado no Super Metroid, com referências à alguns outros clássicos.  Há inúmeros jogos bons na Steam, mas o diferencial de Axiom Verge é isto, você jogá-lo tendo em mente que tudo aquilo foi devenvolvido por apenas 1 pessoa, confesso que é difícil acreditar, é necessário muita determinação para montar tudo sozinho.  Se você é fã de jogos do gênero MetroidVania, pode comprá-lo, e se você tem curiosidades em relação ao tempo de gameplay, aqui está minha estatística:  ESTATÍSTICAS FINAIS: Dificuldade: Normal Tempo Total: 23:52:52 Itens: 86% Mapa: 97% Mortes: 34  Prós: .Enredo: A história é boa, com ficção científica. .Personagem: Carismático. .Gráfico: Lindas animações de sprites 16 Bits, cenários fantásticos com efeitos parallax! .Trilha Sonora: As músicas são o ponto forte do jogo, com certeza você irá querer adquirir a SoundTrack. .Jogabilidade: Joguei apenas nos controles Xbox360 e Steam Controller, muito responsivo. .Elementos: São mais de 20 armas, inúmeras habilidades para o personagem, inúmeros locais para explorar com estas habilidades, inúmeros ítens secretos à serem descobertos, é um verdadeiro MetroidVania.  Contras: Apenas uma observação importante... Cheguei num certo ponto, que desci num local, salvei o jogo, consegui uma habilidade que permitia alcançar novos locais no começo do jogo, mas quando tentei voltar, eu não conseguia mais subir, ou seja, era só eu continuar normalmente, adquirir uma habilidade de pulo mais alto, e voltar futuramente. Eu sou muito explorador, e depois de 40 tentativas, consegui pisar num pixel extremo, onde acabei alcançando a plataforma e voltando antes da hora certa, resultado? Consegui chegar no penúltimo cenário do jogo, revelando a história antes da hora, ou seja, perdeu um pouco a graça. Claro, ainda não foi possível alcançar o mapa do último Boss, mas o problema para mim foi isto, ver a revelação da história, e depois, quando avancei para o caminho correto, acontece uns diálogos, como se o personagem ainda não soubesse das revelações. Moral da história, não faça como eu, se você percebeu que não há como voltar agora, não volte, apenas continue naturalmente, até conseguir a habilidade para voltar, embora eu duvido muito que alguém consiga voltar como eu consegui haha.  Pra quem curte, recomendo fortemente este jogo, você não irá se arrepender.  Nota: 10/10.
Date 2018-01-30 Playtime 21h 32m Rec Negative Axiom Verge is a complete Metroid clone.  It's alright at what it does but also very flawed. Oftentimes the game feels uninspired and progressing through it can be a chore. All rooms look the same and while there are a lot of weapons most of them feel underwhelming.  If you're an absolute Metroid fan it could be a decent little pastime but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. It's not terrible but it's also not very good either.
Date 2018-01-30 Playtime 15h 30m Rec Positive This was a surprisingly good experience.  Great pixel work, not a very broad pallete, but that felt right.  Music was fun and decidedly 80's creep synth "stranger things" vibes. Most of the extra gun types were...not useless, but not useful enough to bother with.  Any fan of Samus should play this, no questions asked.
Date 2018-01-29 Playtime 4h 5m Rec Positive Description : Axiom Verge est un jeu d'action/aventure indépendant développé par Thomas Happ. Le joueur y incarne Trace, un scientifique, qui se retrouve prisonnier d'un complexe labyrinthique suite à un accident. Il devra explorer le monde qui l'entoure pour trouver des réponses sur lui-même et sur cet univers mystérieux.  Après plusieurs années de réflexion et après avoir du faire un choix entre Chasm et Axiom Verge, je pose enfin mes mains sur Axiom Verge. Je tiens a signaler que le choix entre les 2 jeux a étaient difficile a l'époque et avec le recule je me dis que je n'ai pas eu de chance car Chasm n'est toujours pas disponible, seul une démo sur Steam enfin passons a mon avis de Axiom Verge :).  Franchement très bonne surprise, si vous aimez les MetroidVania et les graphismes old school NES, n’hésitez pas ;). Le développeur a créer le projet pour ramasser des fonds pour son enfant malade, il a fait le jeu solo et franchement il a grave gérer.  Test effectuer sur PC avec la version Steam avec une manette Xbox 360  Musique  Une ost qui est très bonne, un mélange de son électronique et chiptune qui me fond pensé a des sons des années 80 dans des séries de Science Fiction.  Graphisme  Graphiquement un délire retro pour rendre hommage a Metroid de NES, la direction artistique, le level design, la similitude saute aux yeux mais Thomas Happ assume entièrement.  Gameplay  Le jeu a un très bon gameplay 2D, les déplacements et la visez de l'arme se font grâce au stick gauche ou la croix direction.  Vous pouvez vous accroupir en faisant bas avec le stick ou croix directionnel et un système de lock est disponible avec la touche LB, le système de lock vous permez de rester sur place afin de visé dans toutes les directions en inclinant le stick.  Le bouton A vous permet de sauter et X de tirer.  Plus d'informations sur le gameplay sur le site officiel via un pdf http://www.axiomverge.com/manual/.  Trace (le scientifique que vous incarnez) dispose d'un large panel de projectiles pour son arme, qu'il faudra dénicher dans des recoins (souvent très bien cachés comme dans tout bon MetroidVania).  Hors les types de projectiles pour notre arme, de nombreux équipement (une foreuse laser permettra de détruire certains murs, grappins, disrupteur bouton RB, etc..) et bonus (amélioration de vie, bonus de dégât, etc..) feront parties de l'aventures.  La sélection de ces différents modes de tirs se font via une simple pression sur le stick gauche et droit de la manette, il est possible d'attribuer une sélection rapide de projectile pour facilité le changement lors des combats ou enigmes.  La prise en main est instinctive et la possibilité de bloquer la position du personnage avec LB pour plus de précision lors des phases de tir de précision contre les boss ou lors de l'exploration rende le jeu époustouflante.  Je n'ai pas encore finis le scénario mais pour le moment au niveau du scénario c'est du solide, l'ost aide grandement pour l'immersion dans cette univers et rajoute une espèce de solitude comme l'on pouvait le ressentir dans Metroid lors de nos aventure avec Samus Aran.  Pour conclure : Thomas Happ avec son jeu Axiom Verge s'inscrit comme un tres bon Metroid-Vania et rend un très beau hommage aux titres majeurs du genre. Certes, quelques défauts sont presents mais pour un jeu de cette qualité créer par une seul personne que demande le peuple.  Pour le moment je le note 18/20  Plus d'informations sur mes tests https://phoenixprojectgaming.wordpress.com/2018/01/30/testpc-axiom-verge/   [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/3289981-Phoenix-Eraser-Sanctuary/] Mon profil Curateur Steam, abonne-toi pour soutenir mon travail :) [/url] -------------------------------------------  Let's play du jeu sur Twitch et Youtube  Prochainement :)  ------------------------------------------- Retrouve moi sur Twitch.

Date 2018-01-26 Playtime 11h 30m Rec Positive A better Metroid than Samus Returns - which is especially significant coming from a die-hard Nintendo/Metroid fanboy. They did it right.
Date 2018-01-25 Playtime 12h 52m Rec Positive I loved the look of it when i stumbled upon this one. Retro looking, i love metroidvania...so i was an easy target for this one.  Pros -The subtle and interesting story - The world itself. Great concept -The plot twists are funs and unexpected. -It's fun to have a metroidvania with a protagonist that talk (yep)  I don't have any cons after playing this one. The only thing i could add as a personal preference... i would have love a choice at the end and maybe... a different ending? Not that it's taking anything from the current ending...i love it too :D  If you want to buy this game...I strongly recommend!  *props to the devs*
Date 2018-01-25 Playtime 19h 33m Rec Positive 魔性的bgm，出色的地图关卡设计以及耐人寻味的剧情让人难以想象这是一个人开发的作品。
Date 2018-01-25 Playtime 8h 9m Rec Positive If you are a true fan of oldschool 2D Metroid, then you will love Axiom Verge, it's just a pure Metroid-like
Date 2018-01-24 Playtime 13h 28m Rec Positive Great game, a simple metroidvania, yet with lots of quirky mechanics you have to get used to, and may even forget that you need to use them when you are exploring, due to the vast amout of diversity of movement (it'll come around, the game starts slow, take it easy).  Lots of weapons, a nice array of enemies, the whole "glitch" thing is a very nice plus. Bosses range from "eh" and "challenging" to "why can't i dodge all of this", but are still fun.  Great game overall.
Date 2018-01-22 Playtime 12h 56m Rec Positive Can't wait for the sequel. This is an amazing game.
Date 2018-01-21 Playtime 13h 30m Rec Positive 密特罗德风
Date 2018-01-20 Playtime 24h 50m Rec Positive This game is amazing.  I played the Nintendo Switch verson of this game and I wanted to see how this version performs, and It's just as good. So much exploration and items to find to make you stronger and survive the upcoming dangers of later zones.   The music in this game is really good. Probably one of the best soundtracks I've heard in recent years. The developer really put a lot of effort into making the music and it's fantastic.  The bosses are quite a challenge on the first time since the process of learning the pattern and how to kill them tends to be part of some bosses (Ukhu being one of the hardest ones in my opnion), but they become easy if you do a second run of the game. To me, the bosses were a bit easy since this is my second time playing the game (first being the Switch version), but they were still fin noneteless. For some extra challenge, you can play on hard difficulty to keep yourself playing.  One negative I can say is that the final boss is kinda anticlimatic.  Overall, this game is an amazing Metroid style game. I recomend it to those who like Metroid games, platforming games and indie games like me. I give it a 9.5/10.
Date 2018-01-20 Playtime 12h 21m Rec Positive 基本上這遊戲就是魂斗羅+惡魔城的太空科幻版 整體而言前半段不算難，後半段對玩家的操作技術性及觀察力提升一定難度 後半段機車的敵人讓遊戲延續可玩性 (或摔手把的機率?!) 有很多隱藏物品可透過觀察解謎以及故事推移拿到必要道具後綜合運用取得 小缺點就是沒有快速傳送門，跑錯區域就要逛大街很久 還好死亡時你拿到的東西會自動存擋不用再跑遠遠拿一次 在遊戲中期不看攻略，卡關花的時間會很多，但喜歡解謎的人請不要錯過。
Date 2018-01-20 Playtime 11h 9m Rec Positive This game is similar to Super Metroid on the SNES in it's art direction and gameplay mechanics but, of course, doing it's own thing and it's well done.  Let's start by talking about the  [b] artstyle [/b], atmosphere and general presentation of the game. I really like good pixel art and this really looks pretty good with all the dark tones with good enemy design and the natives of the planet have a breathtaking design. [b]Atmosphere[/b] is spot-on from the Super Metroid style and has great [b]music[/b] to acompany it.  [b] Level design [/b]is very repetitive. There are some areas with diferent layouts and paths, but it's mostly the same corridors and the same paths with only diferent color palletes. Basically they have no identity. It wouldn't be such a big deal if you didn't have to backtrack to them... which is a prominent feature in Metroidvanias. It starts to become a chore to backtrack to a lot of areas and made me wish I had fast travel between areas, which you do have to some extent. I want to mention that some doorways can only be a unlocked by a password tool, by entering the correct password at the right place. While it's a neat secret, it's easily missable and I wouldn't have noticed it's existence if I didn't look it up online beforehand. All the contents from said doorways are completely optional, so it doens't ruin the experience for anyone in that regard. The [b]password tool[/b] is not only for revealing secret pathways but I won't spoil it for you.  Speaking of convoluted paths, there are what's called [i] Secret worlds [/i]. They are really well hidden and also very dependent on which save file you're on to get the reward you want.  And before I forget, Boss fights are gimmicky and extremely lacking in challenge.  Another flaw the game has is, way too many [b]weapons[/b] and very little use to them. I saw myself using only 4 weapons actively. It might be diferent from person to person, but I personally found little to no use for most of the weapons.  The [b]power-ups[/b], I thought, were okay but only 2 power-ups stood out among many "overdone" power-ups in past.  [h1]Verdict[/h1] [b]Good game[/b]
Date 2018-01-20 Playtime 42h 55m Rec Positive If you like metroid, give this game a go.
Date 2018-01-20 Playtime 22h 56m Rec Positive why is samus a boy
Date 2018-01-19 Playtime 20h 50m Rec Positive This game gets compared to Metroid an awful lot, and let me tell you... [i]Rightfully so[/i].  However, going into this game and expecting a Metroid clone will only disappoint you. It immediately deviates, which concearned me at first, but after all, it's differences make it better than a clone could ever possibly be.  Quality characters, good gameplay, well polished, decent but forgetable soundtrack, good story.
Date 2018-01-17 Playtime 58h 26m Rec Positive Having had this game on my wishlist for quite some time I finally decided to give a try. I took a chance with this one since it was rather different from what I usually play. I remember liking Super Metroid back in the nineties and reviews stated certain similarities. So I had to dig out my old generic controller that I had not used in years.  The rest is history and so was my thumb ;)  Having finished the game I immediately started searching for news about a potential sequel. That should tell you if I liked Axiom Verge or not.  Incredible game with a mind-twisting quantum physics/alien alternate dimensions theme. Madness or reality? Only Athethos knows.  Amazing soundtrack and atmosphere. Really fun gameplay with lots of secrets to discover via innovative methods. Drone is your best friend.  I tip my hat at the creator and developer of this game for bringing me on such an imaginative journey.
Date 2018-01-17 Playtime 13h 37m Rec Positive Um verdadeiro jogo de Metroidvania! É como Super Metroid (1994), só que mais louco!  A true Metroidvania game! It's feel like Super Metroid (1994), but crazier!
Date 2018-01-16 Playtime 12h 1m Rec Negative I really, really wanted to like this game. I love Metroidvania titles, but sadly by the end of this game, I actually hated it.  The first of Axiom Verge's problems is that while it has all you would expect from a Metroidvania game, it feels like it does everything it does only because that's what a Metroidvania does. By comparison, in something like Super Metroid or the more recent Hollow Knight, each location or screen justifies its existence with a unique challenge or sense of purpose. So while those maps are filled with shafts, corridors and rooms, each is unique and purposefully designed enough to confer a real sense of adventure and discovery. Axiom Verge is also full of shafts, corridors and rooms, but most fail to carve out an identity. As you backtrack in the best Metroidvania games, it's a fun journey back through places previously explored, but in Axiom Verge, it's just a trudge.  The game has numerous procedurally generated secret areas, but sadly these highlight the map design's shortcomings. I was braced for something that came with the hallmarks of procedurally generated areas - the repetition, comparative lack of identity and so on. Yet they feel no different to the game's other locations to traipse through. And not because of any particularly impressive procedural work, but simply because the bulk of the game's main locations feel so lacking in gameplay spark themselves.  This isn't uniform - locations like Kur impress more than any other area in the game, and it's a shame there isn't more like it. Another area which tries something more different is Edin, but sadly that brings me to the game's major flaw.  Up until you reach Edin, the game is a solid but unspectacular Metroid alike. However, two things happen once you reach Edin. The first is that several incredibly annoying enemy archetypes become the predominant form of adversary in the game. It turns the last few zones of the game into an agonising crawl. It completely drains any fun out of the game. You can eventually find one of three weapons which deals with these enemy types more easily. However, these weapons can only be found in "hard" secret areas, of which only one will spawn per save file. In my case, the area was located essentially a few steps from the final boss door and was of no use whatsoever to me by that point.  The second thing which happens in Edin is what I can only describe as the most awful boss fight I've ever seen in a video game. The bosses are mostly ok up until this point. Easy and bullet spongy, but at least involving and visually impressive. However the boss of Edin will haunt my gaming nightmares forever, and was so hideously frustrating I almost put the game down and never returned to it. The subsequent bosses aren't a lot better.  It's a shame and I appreciate the huge undertaking this project must be for a lone developer, but I just didn't like this game at all by the end of it. It looks stunning, and had it ended 1/3 earlier I might be writing a tentative recommendation here. Instead, I really can't.
Date 2018-01-15 Playtime 16h 5m Rec Positive Loved it.  I couldn't put it down, and though I was skeptical of the retro graphics, I found them to be really appealing.  I can't even imagine this game through modern graphics.  Awesome soundtrack too, I immediately picked up and listen to it in the background when I need to get some work done.
Date 2018-01-15 Playtime 21h 34m Rec Positive Hayatımda oynadığım en iyi bilim kurgu içerikli platform oyunu oyun adeta süprizlerle dolu ve sizi acayip sürüklüyor.İlk başta fiyatı gereksiz pahalı gelmişti ama oyunu satın alıp oynadıktan sonra az bile diyecek noktaya geldim. Müziklerinden atmosferine kısacası harika diyebilirim. Sci-fi sevenler bence hiç kaçırmadan oynamalılar. ;)
Date 2018-01-14 Playtime 12h 51m Rec Positive Excellent level design. Can make hours go by without noticing. Takes me back to when games felt like they were worth my $$$ instead of falling short of expectations and asking for more $$$.  Great work!
Date 2018-01-14 Playtime 23h 40m Rec Positive Great game with one major detraction from the quality and enjoyment of itself.  The only thing that I can't stand in this game is the Grapple System. This system is very hard to use. I have stopped playing this game a few times for about a week just because of the poor design. You'll almost always miss the grapple, fall, or do something unexpected instead. Then once you do grapple you'll randomly fall or miss the next one. 
Date 2018-01-14 Playtime 13h 52m Rec Positive This is a solid metroidvania with some great ideas (the environment and enemy glitching, the coat item progression, the drone mechanics and its progression, some of the weapon designs) and some outdated or otherwise mediocre ones (a lot of the boss designs, too many redundant weapons, the restrictive aiming, the at times annoying location based save system (the last two I get why but still)). The soundtrack is absolutely standout. The pixel art beautifully calls back to SNES era.  Everything about this game screams Super Metroid. While in a lot of ways this is great, just be warned that it is restricted in its design in some ways due to staying true to its predecessor.  Also, god bless Thomas Happ for developing this alone.
Date 2018-01-13 Playtime 14h 18m Rec Positive The only thing that would make me downvote a metroidvania is if it forces me to fight annoying baddies over and over again as a result of putting a savepoint too far away from a really hard boss that takes a couple of deaths to figure out.  Hollow Knight did that and I will never forgive that game for it.  This game did not and for that reason alone it gets my reccomendation.
Date 2018-01-12 Playtime 22h 47m Rec Positive Вау! На этом можно было бы закончить обзор! На одном весомом и многозначительном ВАУ! Глядя на скриншоты я представлял как буду уничтожать полчища мерзких инопланетных паразитов. Я с теплотой в душе вспоминал разные части Контры на NES. Но в итоге я получил нечто большее. Особую атмосферу. Классную музыку. Местами из-за неё накатывала гнетущая подавленность, и я ощущал, должно быть, те же чувства, что и главный герой, пребывая в этом пугающем мире. А где-то я откровенно любовался этой музыкой, как например в Kur. Можно мельком упомянуть пару необычных названий и имён для зарубежного производителя (но не для отечественного пользователя), или же немалый и весьма разнообрызный арсенал оружия, но гораздо больше порадовал меня поиск секретов со страницами дневника, всяческими усовершенстваниями, и, опять же, оружием. Каждый раз получая новую способность, ты думаешь лишь о том, чтобы вернуться в одну из старых локаций, и добраться наконец до недосягаемого прежде прохода. Для тех же, кому не интересны такие поиски, есть сюжет есть враги, каждый из которых имеет свои сильные и слабые стороны, делающие их устойчивыми или же восприимчивыми к тем или иным метода убийства. Попробуйте обработать того урода из дизраптора, и вместо того, чтоб убивать, он будет лечить Вас. А кто-то напротив станет ещё смертоноснее. В общем, игра видная и заметная, которая заслуживает более пристального внимания игроков.
Date 2018-01-12 Playtime 8h 49m Rec Negative If you took every ability from Castlevania and Metroid, then made them broken and exploitable, you’d have this.
Date 2018-01-12 Playtime 12h 41m Rec Positive Very good! Sometimes it's hard to know exactly what you're supposed to go next and a few parts were very challanging! It was a little frustrating in spots near the end but had a great progression. Most of the bosses seem overwhelming at first but then you learn to cheese them and it's super simple. A little pricey, but it was made by just one guy. My first play through was 12 hours and I did check a guide about four or five times. Definitely has a great sense of exploration and completionists will have lots to do here.
Date 2018-01-11 Playtime 16h 54m Rec Positive I liked this game! awesome, best Metroidvania I've played so far. Took me 17h to finish the game in hard mode. Totally reccomended.
Date 2018-01-11 Playtime 14h 9m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania with a large fun array of weapons and abilities unique to Axiom. It's a great trek with a interesting story and great artwork. A must buy if you're a fan of the genre
Date 2018-01-10 Playtime 19h 6m Rec Positive Do you like Metroid? So you will enjoy this game.  A classical metroidvania with an excelent soundtrack, a mind blowing story. The game is a gift for all old school players and a excelent tribute for metroidvania game style.  The control is fluid, and responds very well. The game is challenging, and the boss fights epic.  Note: 10/10
Date 2018-01-09 Playtime 15h 9m Rec Positive Axiom verge, while definitely not a bad metroidvania game, it also streamlined the genre in some ways but also admittedly regressed in some ways as well. One of the interesting is the array of weapons which I admit is pretty cool, but ultimately unbalanced as some of the weapons are overpowered. Also the game difficulty isn't as challenging as many claims but quite easy.   Now how the game regressed, for one there is not fast travel system like castlevania, they have this vehicle that lets you travel to shortcuts, but not as efficient as a fast travel system. Also there's no item indicators like metroid making item searching a real pain sometime as I have to retrace my steps which isn't challenging but a waste of time. The games secret isn't as rewarding as metroid as that game have well hidden secrets.  The story and lore is very interesting but the ending just gave more question rather than answers, which could lead to a sequel.   Overall it's worth playing the game, as it is a worthwhile experience, but it isn't as good as many claims, as they didn't do much to elevate or streamline the metroidvania genre, the powerups are unique though like glitch powers is very well integrated in the game play, but things such as no treasure indicator could make some people less motivated the 100% the game.  For a better metroidvania game imo, try shantae and the pirate's curse, salt and sanctuary, rabi-ribi, and especially ori and the blind forest, Outland AND guacamelee.  (NOTE) Im a huge fan of the metroidvania genre and this game is not one of the best I seen the above I mention are better
Date 2018-01-09 Playtime 15h 45m Rec Positive If you like platformers in the vein of Metroid with a good story, you're unlikely to be disappointed.   Me, I must have spent 4 hours all in all trying to find where the heck I was supposed to go next, finding secrets instead.
Date 2018-01-08 Playtime 80h 29m Rec Positive Понравилось. Очень. Не буду, в отличие от многих других отзывов на эту игру, ругаться всякими узкосубкультурными сленговыми словечками типа "Метроидвании". Попробую объяснить на пальцах и по-простому, что это за зверь такой, и почему, если вы любите атмосферные игры, его НАДО купить.  В общем, платформеры с претензией на "ретро" бывают примерно двух типов. Первый тип - это марио-сонико-подобные игры с жёстким разбиением на уровни, интенсивным (а то и с лимитом по времени) темпом игры и достаточно большим количеством врагов и/или препятствий, для прохождения которых, впрочем, надо понять предусмотренную автором последовательность нажатий на кнопки и задро^W вызубрить её до отскакивания от зубов (в качестве современного примера именно такой ретроигры - пожалуй, Life Of Pixel). Это совсем-совсем не про Axiom Verge.  Ну и второй тип, во многом обязанный своим существованием тому самому Метроиду - это игры, где чётко выделенных уровней нет, рядовых врагов вроде и не так уж и много... но есть огромная карта с кучей как очевидных, так и секретных входов и выходов - и дальность продвижения по этой карте зависит от того, какие ключевые предметы удалось по комнатам найти, каких боссов в "бутылочных горлышках" победить и какие прочие головоломки решить. Там так или иначе, придётся много раз возвращаться в ранее пройденные места, чтобы найти из них новые выходы, следить за сюжетом (да, он в таких играх более чем есть!) и читать найденные записки (так как в них могут оказаться подсказки для прохождения и просто экскурсы в историю мира) и просто достаточно немало думать (благо there is more than one way to do it). Вот это как раз Axiom Verge как она есть. В это, в отличие от платформеров первого типа, вряд ли поиграешь с друзьями на вечеринке. Эта игра требует вдумчивого погружения в нарисованный мир в течение достаточно долгого времени.  Стоит отметить, что игра - полностью, от строчек кода до пикселей графики и нот саундтрека - детище одного человека, создававшего её аж целых пять лет. И видно, что детище выстраданное и любимое, и было скорее чем-то вроде личного Opus Magnum, нежели чисто коммерческой попыткой угодить моде. Чувствуется цельность, выверенность и проработанность концепта на всех уровнях. Прекрасный электронный саундтрек, достойный отдельного прослушивания. Намеренно стилизованная под конец 80-х - начало 90-х (пиксель-арт и "кислотные" цвета!), но очень атмосферная и сюрреалистически-красивая графика. Не менее психоделично-сюрреалистичный и даже местами едва ли не шизофреничный сюжет - постапокалиптичный мир с остатками былых цивилизаций, мутировавшими тварями и гигантскими биомеханоидами разной степени зловредности (и даже те, что называют себя друзьями, порой творят такую фигню, что жалеешь об отсутствии возможности перейти на "тёмную сторону" и им как следует наподдать), а также [i]полутора[/i] (будете играть - поймёте, почему) безумными учёными. И всё это - с весьма небанальной эрудицией автора и отсылками то к научным теориям о параллельных вселенных a.k.a multiverse, то - и очень много! - к шумерской культуре и мифологии (неспроста, ой неспроста судранские письмена с виду напоминают клинопись!), то к откровенному славянскому "акценту" у части биомеханоидов. Очень ядрёно замешанный, но, опять же, на удивление цельный и органично воспринимающийся коктейль. Единственное слабое место - пожалуй, последний диалог главгероя с главгадом, мотивация обоих выглядит, скажем так, несколько неубедительной, но в остальном - любители Глубоких Смыслов недовольными точно не останутся. В этой игре будет достаточно того, что может вам впоследствии присниться в весьма странных снах!  И, как ни странно, несмотря на, гм, малочисленность команды разработчиков, откровенных багов в игре я не заметила. Единственное, что нельзя назвать багом, но можно отнести к мелким минусам - несколько неудобное управление. Автор игры зачем-то решил развесить действий на АБСОЛЮТНО ВСЕ кнопки геймпада, и даже по некоторым нажатиям производить два действия. Например, иногда в бою крайне невовремя слетает выбор оружия -  это потому, что по одному из действий на левом стике подвешен выбор некого заранее заданного в инвентаре дефолтного оружия. И этот же стик служит для перемещения, наравне с крестовиной. Более того, и на стике, и на крестовине там полная "звезда хаоса" действий с жуткой чувствительностью, и чтобы, скажем, телепортнуться влево, например, там надо нажать прицельно, чётко-чётко, влево дважды. Чуть-чуть на миллиметр ошибся - всё, вместо телепортации сработал экшен "бежим вперёд и стреляем по диагонали" или "присели вниз и ползём на карачках", что в тех же (отнюдь не тривиальных) боях с боссами может стоить немалого количества попыток и недовольных возгласов. Так что в этом смысле автор скорее перемудрил.  Но в остальном - плюсы всё же перевешивают минусы, и игре бы я по итогу дала честные 9/10 по своей личной шкале. Этот мир интересно раскапывать и исследовать, и автору - искренний респект от людей, способных понять и оценить!

Date 2018-01-07 Playtime 18h 36m Rec Positive This is an outstanding game, like a combination of Metroid and Contra. This game has excellent retro graphics, good variety of weapons, great environments, fantastic music, and good metroidvania gameplay, with plentiful boss fights. I will play through this again at some point. If you liked Super Metroid, you have to play this game.

Date 2018-01-06 Playtime 34h 36m Rec Positive Really liked the game. Has some minor flaws, which didn't bother me all that much. Overall: 4.5/5  Great: [list] [*] SciFi Setting [*] Design [*] Soundtrack [*] Gameplay (the "glitch" mechanic is very interesting and versatile) [*] Lots of weapons to choose from [*] Replay value (speedruns, secrets and achievements) [/list]  Could be improved: [list] [*] Amount of bosses ([spoiler]two are "non"-bosses and one is optional[/spoiler]) [*] Story delivery (mostly dialog, cutscenes and notes, would have liked the environment to tell me more[spoiler], like the one wheelchair room[/spoiler]) [*] Level design (there are few spots where you can get stuck and don't know what to do) [/list]  Negatives: [list] [*] I got none [/list]

Date 2018-01-05 Playtime 98h 48m Rec Positive The idea that this was all created and designed by one guy completely baffles me. This is quite easily the best metroidvania I've played, possibly ever, even going so far as to include direct references to both titles of the genre's namesake.  The first thing that strikes me is the graphics and soundtrack. Upon first starting the game you're treated to dazzling pixelated graphics and animations, and a score unique in its own way while never, ever distracting from gameplay. Throughout the game you're treated to nine named areas (I'm not counting the boss area), but within even those you get anywhere from two to four separate biomes, each unique and beautiful in its own right. The enemies are well designed and each unique as well, which brings me to mechanics.  One of the most blaringly unique mechanics is the address disruptor. Without spoiling too much, it essentially allows you to corrupt enemies, turning them into either a different enemy, a health well, or some other odd thing that invariably helps you. The other obvious unique mechanic is the lab coat, allowing you to [spoiler]essentially glitch through walls[/spoiler]. Beyond that, the weapons are all inspired and creative, and the other mechanics are equally exciting. Every time you get one it feels worth the effort.  Last of all, the story. The story, I think, is where this game has its downfall. It was confusing at times, left holes at others, and was completely nonsensical the rest of the time. Ultimately, the story was unsatisfying. But knowing the story had nothing to do with playing the rest of the game. I think, while it maybe doesn't compare to some other games, the poor story kind of falls on the sidelines.  As an ending note, I want to mention that there were three unique scripts created for this game, and once again bring up that this entire game was programmed, drawn, and composed solely by the man named Tom Happ.  tl;dr Good game, go play it, but don't expect much from the story.
Date 2018-01-05 Playtime 26h 24m Rec Positive If you're interested in this game, you probably like the Metroid series, or at least the Metroidvania subgenre. If that's true, look no further. Axiom Verge is probably the best Metroid game that doesn't have Metroid in the title. It pulled me in, compelling me to keep playing. Exploring its manifold areas feels fresh and exciting in a way that, again, few games besides Metroid manage to do.  That's not to say that its a copycat, though, at least aesthetically. The world of Axiom Verge is bizarre and alien, both a thriving ecology and a technological wasteland. Even the design of the weapons and items factors into this, many of them being wholly unlike ones from other games, both visually and in how they work. And the music... it's very good as well, and despite being electronic, doesn't immediately remind me of anything else. most of the time it's a well-crafted mix of energetic and ethereal ambience, but the boss themes take a cue from Streets of Rage and are straight up danceable.  Besides the standard weapons, movement upgrades, and health/damage, etc collectibles, you'll find interesting non-standard items that bring back the spirit of retro games in an interesting way. I'm talking, of course, about the address disruptor and passcode tool. I suppose the address disruptor is essentially just another way to get around the world, but it does it by "glitching out" enemies and certain blocks as if the game's data had been corrupted. Then there's the passcode tool, which obviously is not used to restore a saved game like on the NES, but rather alter aspects of the game with passwords you'll find in notes scattered across the game. Hint: when you first get it, enter "JUSTIN-BAILEY". You won't regret it.  All of this combines to create a highly polished, very fun game that, yes, is building off of an established formula, but doing it in a uniquely stylish way. You may not like Metroidvanias, but if you're at all interested in the genre, try out Axiom Verge. You'll probably like it.
Date 2018-01-05 Playtime 14h 16m Rec Positive Better than Super Metroid in my opinion.  Overall great pacing and difficulty.
Date 2018-01-05 Playtime 14h 3m Rec Positive Awesome.  I've spent a good chunk of my life trawling through video games looking for metroidvanias. Playing every single one I can get my hands on. And this is one of the best metroidvanias ever played. Frankly, this is #2 for me after super metroid.  A phenomenal work. My only critique that holds it back from beating out super metroid is that the later bosses (looking at you bee boss) spend a little too much time floating around being invincible.  Considering that this is an indie game, beating out every other metroidvania bar one is an incredible feat. Hats off to you Thomas Happ. I will be buying everything you make. I don't even care what your future work looks like. You've earned at least a couple hundred bucks from me. Maybe more.  tl;dr: cfuk this game is good.
Date 2018-01-05 Playtime 8h 35m Rec Positive I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe.   if I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good.   But it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems.   The art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places.   The combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.)   The music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see.   One little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool.   Writing is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great.   That is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game.   Give it a try if you feel it looks interesting.
Date 2018-01-04 Playtime 20h 5m Rec Positive Great gameplay. Good storyline to follow.  I need you to go ahead and make a sequel.
Date 2018-01-03 Playtime 8h 47m Rec Negative Overhyped piece of shit.  It´s just full of bad game design and bullshit enemies and bosses in the end. No skill, just RNG Spam ass much as possible bullets bosses.  Just watch it on youtube and hope the dev just never makes a game again.
Date 2018-01-03 Playtime 29h 37m Rec Positive It's Ratchet and Clank meets Super Metroid. What more can I say? It's well worth your time and money!
Date 2018-01-03 Playtime 17h 34m Rec Positive Do you enjoy Metroid? Do you enjoy platforming shooters? Do you enjoy exploration in general? If yes to any of these, then play Axiom Verge.  This game had much more fun for me than I figured it would!  Axiom Verge seems to follow a recent trend of pixel graphics in the past couple of years, which might throw people off if they are annoyed by it. But in my opinion, I feel like the developers did it just right for Axiom Verge. The pixel graphics style definitely fits the abnormal, futuristic world you are on, especially with some of the crazy and awkward scenes you encounter, and some of the obstacles and weapons you get to use later in the game. I cannot go into much detail without spoilers, but it was a great decision and executed well.  The premise of the game is that you awaken in an alien world and, unsurprisingly, need to navigate your way around it and find a way home. Pretty quickly you reach some NPC's and start learning more about the world and what steps you need to complete in order to return home, so you are not left in the dark for too long. The story actually develops pretty nicely, and gives some interesting quirks as you go. I was very satisfied with the progress and conclusion.  Axiom Verge's gameplay is as mentioned in the questions at the beginning of my review. You are exploring the world using platforming as well as shooting weapons (from bullet guns to lasers to bombs to many other things), with the actual mechanics of getting around being the primary puzzle for the game, as you will need to find upgrades for new abilities.  This sort of game style has again been very common for decades, and while some games can make it tedious and boring, I found that Axiom Verge yet again was well-developed and made the world interesting enough to explore, and I never felt like I was getting tired of it.  Note that the game does have a handful of hidden collectibles and upgrades in the game, as is sometimes expected in this "Metroidvania" genre, but they are not extremely common and sometimes the game will give you obvious hints if you pay attention to what happens on the screen. For instance, you might notice an enemy walking at the top edge of the screen and then suddenly disappear, meaning that there's likely a wall to break up there leading to another screen.  Further, though a slight spoiler (even though you can see it in the trailer), you obtain a Remote Drone a bit of the way into the game, which allows you to explore more safely. It is a mobile robot (that almost looks like a headcrab from Half-Life) that you can shoot into the air and then start controlling whenever it lands. While you control it, your own character is shielded and cannot be hurt by enemies, though note that the drone has its own health bar too and can temporarily die. The Remote Drone allows you to reach awkward places or simply navigate a little bit without having to leap off cliffs yourself, meaning that it will save you from having to climb all the way back up with your own character.  There is also a ridiculous amount of weapons to be found in the game, and even though I only ended up using about 5 of them for most of my gameplay, there is more than enough variety for people to find what they like to use.  My last detail is the music and sound of the game, which is underrated in my opinion. The music is phenomenal, even for the retro style, and each sub-world inside the map has their own interesting songs that definitely mesh with the vibes from their own graphics.  All in all, Axiom Verge is well worth it in my book.
Date 2018-01-03 Playtime 2h 8m Rec Positive As a Metroid fan I can say that this is one of the best indie games ive played in recent years. It combines some of the combat of megaman with the exploration and weapons of metroid. It fells familiar to the Metroid series yet new and refreshing. The style of the game is absoulutely stunning and breathtaking and the story really keeps you enganged. Overall this game keeps you entertianed and would very much recommend it to any gamer who loves retro style games.
Date 2018-01-02 Playtime 5h 5m Rec Positive Un bon Métroid Vania comme on en fait plus trop. Il y a une vraie ambiance gloque, sombre, et le gameplay est plutôt bien développé même si à mon sens il y a bcp trop d'items et qu'on s'y perd un peu parfois. Gros point positif sur la musique, vraiment immersive et diversifiée. Bémol pour le level design quand même, beaucoup de passages sont relativement vides (et inutiles du coup), on sent quand même que le développeur a manqué d'inspiration à certains moments. Autre bémol sur les boss, globalement la mécanique est simpliste. Une fois qu'on a compris le coup (30 secondes suffisent) il suffit de bourrer bêtement, ce qui est dommage. Il y a même la possibilité de prendre des dommages boost pour traverser le boss et se mettre à l'abri. Ce jeu reste une bonne découverte.
Date 2018-01-02 Playtime 22h 20m Rec Negative [h1]Overview[/h1] Overhyped, derivative and in desperate need of a tutorial on how to use a color wheel and the basics of consistent logical game design. Axiom Verge is not a Metroidvania worth your time or money compared to the competition.  [h1]Gameplay & Design[/h1] Upfront I'll say Axiom clicks with you for the first hour or two. It has a killer soundtrack and the nostalgia factor of getting into something reminiscent of Metroid is powerful at first. However after about the 2hr mark there become glaring flaws in the game design logic that start to erode its shine & enjoyment.   [u][i]Exploration:[/i][/u] One of the "axioms" - if you'll excuse the pun - of any metroidvania game is the ability to backtrack to areas you came from once you unlock new abilities. Axiom Verge throws that out the window. You find yourself stuck without the ability to get to previous areas until you have suffciently moved far enough forward in the game's narrative. This completely deflates one of the driving factors in any metroidvania game - open exploration.  The game then takes on a very linear feeling as to what exactly you can actually explore.   [u][i]Visual Cues/Language:[/i][/u] Complicating this linear exploration is an inconsistent and obnoxious design language. Is shooting everything in sight with several different types of weapons and tools (without nearly any visual hint of where a secret might be hiding) fun? Axiom Verge thinks so.  This again breaks one of the key axioms of any metroidvania. Creating a consistent visual vocabulary to indicate where an ability or weapon might be used. This creates a sense of mystery and anticipation when a new ability or weapon is uncovered to then be able to test out on previous locked areas.   There are many examples of this type of inconsistency and lack of thought when it comes to setting up the rules of the world and the visual language that follows. There is a part of the main quest that is impossible to pass without shooting an area of liquid with a "glitch gun." The problem is this is never set up as something you can do within the world. No other liquid will react to your glitch gun - not before or after.   Similarly there is a tool that allows you to open secret areas if you type in a password within the menu. At first these passwords are found on notes scattered in the world. The problem here is again the inconsistent design, there are litterally only 2 notes that do this. The others take on their own individual solutions that are found by other means and each is different from the other. There is case after case of this that I won't drone on about.   [u][i]Color Palette:[/i][/u] When you have red-ish creatures jumping from pink-ish liquid shooting red-ish orange dots at you against a dark red/maroon backdrop with a brownish figure that needs to dodge them you might want to rethink your color choices. After playing this game for 20+hrs I definitly think the strain on my eyes lowered my vision. Nostalgia is fun until someone loses an eye.  [u][i]Risk & Reward:[/i][/u] There aren't that many bosses in this game, so you would think each time you beat one you get something awesome right? Wrong. There are a few items of interest after you defeat some of the bosses yet for others there is nothing. Literally nothing. 'Hey you get to progress to the next part of the game - isn't that reward enough?'   What's worse is that for extremely important items there is no build up to receiving them. They're simply laying on the floor of some room you enter. Just for comparison [url=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2HkX2CH97G8/hqdefault.jpg]this[/url] is what a Metroid item usually sits in and [url=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yUonnTtrpmY/maxresdefault.jpg]here[/url] is where you find one of the most important abilities in Axiom.  Axiom Verge also smothers you with a seemingly endless assortment of weapons. I thought I had reached the end when I found 10. There are more than 20. Finding a weapon is less of a thrill and more an annoyance (since you didn't find a cool new ability) given you're likely to stick to one or two weapons to use 90% of the time. On top of that abilities you do end up receiving feel clumsy (grappling hook) making your power-up feel anti-climatic. Again for comparison look at Super Metroid where you unlock sprint or super jump that earnestly make you feel more powerful.  [u][i]Character Design[/i][/u] As a scientist there couldn't be a more generic and uninspired figure than looking at [url=https://static.squarespace.com/static/4f7c8818e4b000a129e38a56/52e73659e4b090f501f6fe06/52e7365ae4b090f501f6fea8/1363913002747/1000w/TraceCoats2.png]this [/url] for 10-20+hrs.  [h1]Story[/h1] The story is largely flat, uninspired and boring. I didn't buy the game expecting much, if anything in terms of story but when the dialogue and cutscenes actually detract from the game experience it becomes a drag on the overall enjoyment. If the story were short and bad it wouldn't be worth mentioning and sci-fi is tyipcally filled with jibberish words but none so terribly constructed as here.   Part of the problem is that the characters are computers without personality, and a scientist that offers little interest or character. Dialogue is tedious often without story purpose or emotional intent. You will likely find yourself tuning out fairly often & early on.   [h1]Technical [/h1] Zero problems. To the developer's credit the game is polished on a technical level in terms of its options and stability.  [h1]Bottom Line[/h1] There's no question Axiom is a flawed game. If you're looking for a metroidvania or even a decent action indie game you're better off looking elsewhere - [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/275390/Guacamelee_Super_Turbo_Championship_Edition/]Guacamelee[/url], [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/274190/Broforce/]Broforce[/url], or even [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/219150/Hotline_Miami/]Hotline Miami[/url] would offer more enjoyment for your dollar.
Date 2018-01-02 Playtime 19h 20m Rec Positive It's a wonderful side scroller with the perfect difficulty level curve, and tons of secrets to find to ensure there's plenty to do. Solid mechanics, good story, and great gameplay.
Date 2018-01-02 Playtime 58h 14m Rec Positive The throwback I've been waiting for!           When you start the game, it picks up immediately as you run down every corridor with enemies in sight. The atmosphere is sci-fi heavy and the game encourages you to find the logs hidden thoughout the game, if your someone who enjoys more depth to why you happened to appear in the mysterious world. I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers. There are more ungrades (weapons, health, and various other mods) than you can shake a stick at and the whole time your jamming out to an electronic sound track that only sounds better the more you crank the bass. Deep down, it's the Metroid game Nintendo needed to make to satisfy the nostalgia of platforming/shooter that made this labor of love possible. If your a fan of Metroid, what are you waiting for?

Date 2017-12-31 Playtime 1h 15m Rec Positive The Metroid is strong in this one.   I am a huge fan of the old Metroid side scrolling games. For years I have wanted a game like that on the pc.  I have finally found the game I am looking for in Axiom Verge.  There is a certain feel to the controls that reminds me of Super Metroid on the SNES. The soundtrack is engaging and reminds me of Metroid II on the gameboy. The level design and look remind me of the original Metroid.   The creators of Axiom Verge have paid attention to all the little details. You can see this attention to detail in ripple of the enemies exploding to the way your character stands up when first starting your game or when your character dies. There are small little flourish animaitons throughout the game. The controls are equally responsive and as well handled as the rest of the game. The sound is excellent and reminds me of the 1990's 16bit console era everytime I hear it. This game is simply an excellent game all around and the care the creators took with it shows in every little detail.   I would recommend that anyone looking for a Super Metroid type game give this game a try.   
Date 2017-12-30 Playtime 30h 26m Rec Positive Axiom Verge – ужасная игра. В лучшем смысле слова. С самого начала вы окунаетесь в ночной кошмар. Перед глазами – калейдоскоп кровавых оттенков. Звук – оглушительная пульсация басов и коробящее шипение электрических помех. Дрожащее месиво “живых” стен корчится под дикие ритмы. Когда враги выпивают вашу крохотную полоску здоровья, тревожный писк медицинского индикатора вливается в общую истеричную какофонию. Распад окружающего мира на пиксели только усугубляет паранойю.  Не зря большинство спрайтовых игр предпочитают стилизацию под позднюю эпоху. 16 бит – это красота гиперболы. 8-битные миры более утрированы и неоднозначны. Если вы хотите вызвать у человека ощущение тревоги и дискомфорта, то нет на свете ничего лучше. Когда даже протагонист - лишь крохотная кучка разноцветных блоков с головой-пикселем, игроку совсем не на кого положиться.  Клаустрофобия усиливается с каждым шагом. Вы заперты в физическом, психологическом, игровом аду. Лабиринты уродливых коридоров. Отвратительные враги. Пугающие союзники. Чудовищные боссы. Это место чуждо нашему разуму. Эта бессмысленная, безнравственная космическая реальность отторгает наше присутствие!  Главный герой, ученый-универсал Трэйс, отчалил с тихого острова человеческого невежества в черное море вселенской бесконечности, и вот что он там обнаружил. Духовного наследника серии Metroid.  Любой встречный вам скажет, что Axiom Verge – это новый Metroid. И не какой-нибудь, а самый первый, 1986-го года. Та же графика. То же мрачное настроение. Похожий дизайн уровней. Похожие переходы между комнатами. Стены сложены из знакомых строительных блоков и странных, мерзких, клейких пузырей. И по платформам ползают знакомые твари.  Но на самом деле Metroid - это только отправная точка. Одна из нескольких. В начале работы над проектом, его автор Томас Хапп и не думал создавать собственную игру. Он просто упражнялся в игровом дизайне. Пытался ради любопытства соединить воедино игровые механики и визуальные элементы любимых NES-игр. Bionic Commando, Rygar, Blaster Master, Shatterhand, Contra. Всего понемногу. Когда же этот кадавр, сшитый из частей разных тел, начал подавать признаки жизни, быстро стало понятно, что по характеру он не похож ни на кого из своих доноров. Даже на Metorid-86.  В начале прохождения наш герой приходит в себя и получает в руки простой, но надежный красный бластер. Это первое из двадцати орудий, которые вы можете добыть в игре. Дезинтеграторы, рефлекторы, пульверизаторы. Инерционный пульсатор, квантовый вариегатор, тавтологичный ретардатор и даже вульгарный огнемет. Лазеры ветвятся капиллярами или сплетаются в лучи смерти. Снаряды рассыпаются дробью, стреляют собственными снарядами, проходят сквозь стены, сами наводятся, сами разбегаются кто куда. Разная мощность, дальность, кучность, точность.  Враги тоже не сидят сложа руки. До одних сложно добраться, другие легко доберутся до вас. Вы можете положиться на рефлексы и бежать через зоны напролом. Но разумный выбор амуниции позволит заковырять любую тварь с безопасного расстояния.  И не спешите инвентаризировать ваш арсенал. Это ещё не всё. Axiom Verge размывает границу между инструментом и оружием. Крохотный радиоуправляемый дрон может пролезть через узкий проход или схватиться с десятком врагов. Лазерный бур отлично подходит как для раскопок, так и для самообороны.  Но главное – это адресный дисраптор, который буквально перекраивает мироздание. На его создание Хаппа вдохновили знаменитые чит-устройства Game Genie, которые позволяли игрокам копаться в двоичных внутренностях NES-игр и перемешивать их в своё удовольствие. “Я любил экспериментировать с этой штукой, - говорит Хапп, - Когда я был маленький, меня поражало, что я могу через заглюченную стену пройти в закрутую ото всех зону. Могу заставить врагов странно себя вести. Иногда игры зависали, иногда случалось что-то полезное - мне нравилось экспериментировать. Поэтому глюки - это основная механика в моей игре”.  Под воздействием волн дисраптора исчезают стены, пузыри становятся платформами, а повадки и способности врагов меняются кардинальным образом. Одни делаются слабее, другие – сильнее. Одни добрее, другие - злее. Многие обретают специфичные функции, которые можно и нужно использовать.  В начале игры страх и отвращение не давали нам мыслить здраво. Но теперь мы можем задать себе вопрос - что, черт возьми, происходит?! Что это за место и время? Почему всё пространство вокруг нас забагованно? Почему исходный код реальности так легко переписать? И почему мы пробираемся по древним шумерским руинам, наполненным невероятными технологиями и мутировавшей нежитью? Погрузившись с головой в сюжет Axiom Verge, мы в полной мере осознаем, как далеко эта игра ушла от Metroid, и в какие густые философские дебри она нас уводит.   В этом сюжете интересным образом сплавлены две крайности научной фантастики - вдумчивое исследование фундаментальных вопросов бытия через футуристические допущения и увлеченное мальчишеское фантазирование.  Игра затягивает атмосферой одиночества и страха. Она встречает вас, как непрошеных гостей. Бросает в мрачнейшие глубины, бьет по слуху, по глазам, по рукам. Ранит, пинает, убивает.   Игра удерживает внимание провокационной сюжетной интригой. Вы вырываетесь из затхлых, тесных катакомб на поверхность и понимаете, насколько красивы могут быть 8-битные миры. Музыка подчиняется человеческой воле и вторит темпу ваших твердых шагов.  А под конец игра превращается в классический зубодробительный боевик.   Путь от случайного прохожего до непобедимого воина – стандартное развитие событий для нелинейных платформеров. Но здесь путь особенно ярко обозначен. Ваша огневая мощь растет экспоненциально. Трейс начинает игру в футболке и джинсах. Затем находит лабораторный халат безумного ученого. Следом, пыльник космического ковбоя. И, наконец, малиновое пальто истинного чатланина.  Axiom Verge грамотно играет на ностальгии, но не упивается ею. Мы высаживаемся на этой планете, потому что соскучились по Самус Аран. Но через считанные минуты забываем о Зебесе и метроидах. Наше воображение захватывает странный, леденящий душу пост-сингулярный мир, выращенный на компосте человеческой цивилизации. Завораживающе зловещие биомеханические “русалки” заманивают нас в свои сети - прямо как духи-утопленницы в сказках утаскивали юношей в омуты. Мы выясняем, что все алгоритмы универсальны и истинны, независимо от того, выполняются они или нет. Мы подходим к краю аксиомы и делаем шаг за её пределы.

Date 2017-12-30 Playtime 26h 7m Rec Positive Good 2D platformer game. Good music. Good gameplay. Fun to explore. Well responsive control.   Only 2 things i dislike are randomness of the secret world entrances and the passcode system. -every newgame has their own randomed secret world entrances and hard to be tracked them all because of randomness. And the super weapon also random from 1 of 3 for each newgame, which means u can't collect all of them in one playthrough. -passcode system, the game requires player to get a clue from the game to retrieve the codes. Those codes can be showed to the player both explicitly and implicitly. And in order to get some weapon, the correct code is need to be figured out and use at the correct location.  I couldn't figure them all on my first playthough and had to rely on walkthough on the internet how to collect them all later on.  Some even need to manually decode the encrypted message (on the paper) by yourself in order to get the item.  by the way, I prefer this game more than the "super metroid" in SNES.  8/10, recommended

Date 2017-12-30 Playtime 14h 8m Rec Positive Like many a review states, Axiom verge is like if you took super metroid, but made it completley different. They are all indeed right and I can't add too much more of it. If Metroid-like games are your thing or you just want something while we all wait for Nintendo to give us another one (Prime 4 as of this writing), you won't go wrong here! Grab the soundtrack, it's excellent!  I do want to touch on a few things that I noticed that I didn't see mentioned in many reviews.  [list] [*] Probably the best thing Axiom Verge has over any other Metroidvania that I've seen is it's approach to movement. With some very few understandable exceptions (Labcoats), I found myself using EVERYTHING, even at the very end of the game, especially your glitch powers! They all feel great with practice and you can pull off some impressive skill based manuvers. [*]I did find the number of weapons a bit excessive, while I did get some use out of them all. I felt like they were cumbersome to select, especially at the end. This is not a problem unique to this game. [*] On one hand I do love it's hands off approach to progression, on the other hand there are times where it does expect you to go one way, but you feel more compelled to go another. (I'm looking at YOU [strike] enterance to E-Kur-Mah![/strike] After your first trek through Ukkin-Na!). If you are lost, there's no shame in using a guide. [*] The Story is VERY much a Your mileage may vary. I think its pretty good though more obtuse than it probably should be. One sequence in particular, while kind of frustrating IMHO was a highlight ("Fever" that's all I'll say) [*]  Some endgame foes that are very tough! As for common enemies, you'd be suprised at what the Address distruptor can do (or perhaps a different gun?), bosses usually have some kind of trick to them, just keep your head on your shoulders, and if all else fails, find a new gun. In fact I had more problems dying to get to my location/beat a tough boss rather than getting lost. [*] I do feel like a lot of the early game art is a bit too samey, but once you break out of Kur into the upper regions...completley different story! [/list]  Anything I didn't mention (and a few that I did) have been mentioned a million times before. I freaking love this game, though it does help that I'm a big Metroid fan. Somewhere down the line I'll do a speedrun mode of this, it sounds like fun!
Date 2017-12-29 Playtime 10h 0m Rec Positive A pretty fukken good Metroidvania game. Overall quality pretty much ties with... hell... even surpasses Super Metroid. The atmosphere of this game is even thicker than my GF~ So many secrets and so many stuff to collect, some bosses were piece of cake while some of them are created by Edmund McMillan's himself. So... thanks for the challenge...  9/10, waiting for the sequel.
Date 2017-12-29 Playtime 12h 35m Rec Positive I'll start by saying that is you like the metroid games you most likely are gonna like thins game, it took me around 10 hours to complete which means that for a game like this it is actually a good lenght, you wont miss feel a lack of unlockables or collectibles, i think that the game is very well balanced in terms of dificulty through out the game, save spots and healing are spread out well around the map. The story is rich but not too much that would overwhelm the gameplay and you are enticed to try to discover what is going on.  The bad parts about the game, even that i took 10 hours to complete and there is a speedrun mode for the game, some areas feel rushed or just there to ruin your day. i would have wanted the game to be a bit longer even going for broke i would say that if the game were twice as bid it would have given more to be able to create more depth into the story.  Conclusion I do recomend the game, its very fun to play and i will end up playing it again for a try at 100% the game. If you like the style and metroid-like games then you will enjoy this one.
Date 2017-12-29 Playtime 0h 10m Rec Positive (Don't mind my playtime. I've played this game offline during my daily commute to and from work).  It's an excellent metroidvania, not much else to say there.  The plot is confusing but in a good way. It manages to surprise you without losing you. The characters aren't exactly deep but serviceable to the story.  Although I have a few gripes with the gameplay, it's overall well done. The various upgrades you get bring variation to how you progress throughout the levels, but the variety of weapons feels forced. I swear I must have collected a dozen different weapons but in the end only really needed to use 2 or 3 of them because the rest felt like underpowered variations of those. At the very end of the game I even ended up only using one very strong weapon that rendered the rest completely useless.  Thankfully these downsides weren't enough to ruin the game for me. Far from it. I had a blast from start to finish and I definitely recommend it to anyone that likes the genre.  Oh, also the fact that it runs smoothly on a weak tablet is another plus (x5-Z8300 with 2GB of RAM in my case, at 1280*800).
Date 2017-12-29 Playtime 10h 6m Rec Positive A indie Metrovania game that can be fun at times.   The last boss fight was ridiculously unfair but its still a nice addition to the metrovania genre.   
Date 2017-12-29 Playtime 21h 5m Rec Positive Very good metroid-style game. Played through in ~15 hours w/ no annoying guides necessary. Plenty of secrets to find, but most have hints that make them just findable.
Date 2017-12-29 Playtime 15h 38m Rec Positive Without question, one of the most fun, well designed, astonishing games on Steam.  Almost limiting to call it a Metroidvania as it's more of a peer than a derivative.  Fantastic music.  Can't believe this is one guy's work.
Date 2017-12-29 Playtime 12h 50m Rec Positive Probably the best Metroidvania I even played... Buy it !!
Date 2017-12-28 Playtime 22h 30m Rec Positive If you haven't played this game you've cheated yourself out of a great experience.
Date 2017-12-28 Playtime 18h 18m Rec Positive 칙칙하고 괴기스러운 배경과 몬스터, 어디로 가야하는지 전혀 알려주지 않는 게임 시스템, 카피 원작보다 더하게 있으나마나한 맵까지... SFC의 슈퍼 메트로이드를 완전 빼다박은 게임이다. GBA로 나왔던 퓨전이나 제로미션과는 다른 슈퍼 메트로이드만의 맛이 느껴진다. 슈메를 재밌게 한 사람이라면 후속작이라 생각하고 플레이 해도 괜찮은 수준. 도전과제 깨는 게 조금 귀찮은 것은 흠이다. 슈퍼 메트로이드에도 맵에 아이템 표시는 해줬다...
Date 2017-12-28 Playtime 12h 56m Rec Positive LOVE this game! graphics are nice and slick and remind me of the good 'ol days. The soundtrack is very well done but i don't think its worth 10$ Gameplay is phenominal and the story is very well built. But however this game does not have FULL controller support as I find it should be partial controller support. If your a fan of metroidvania games I HIGHLY recommend this game!
Date 2017-12-28 Playtime 16h 31m Rec Positive This game is amazing. Would buy it again. (:
Date 2017-12-27 Playtime 19h 34m Rec Positive A few cheap enemies and cryptic segments aside, I loved this game. The music is great, the art is great, the story actually makes you wonder what is to come and the gameplay is a fine-tuned trip down nostalgia lane.  One of the best things I have played this year. 
Date 2017-12-27 Playtime 13h 53m Rec Positive :)))
Date 2017-12-27 Playtime 26h 54m Rec Positive Played this for 20 minutes so far. Definitely wins the DarrikenGaming "More fun than Skyrim" award.  Looking forward to the rest of the journey.
Date 2017-12-27 Playtime 18h 41m Rec Positive Compelling story, interesting gameplay, not metroid (but probably the best metroidvania game)   I'm still waiting for #2.... ;)
Date 2017-12-27 Playtime 15h 41m Rec Positive Got this probably in a quite cheap deal somewhere.  This game has some nice and interesting mechanics. For me the pixel Art works mostly well and the atmosphere & story is great. I remember the game has a weakness that many metroidvanias have. If you overlook an option to advance in the game, which can easily happen, you run around aimlessly for hours or you have to look up how to continue. In Dust:An Elysian Tail, this didn't happen. Only if you count optional treasures.  So yeah, great game, but I feel it could be better.
Date 2017-12-27 Playtime 11h 32m Rec Positive If you like playing Metroid-vania games then this is a must. Excellent game. Highly Recommended.
Date 2017-12-26 Playtime 13h 56m Rec Positive TL;DR: Absolutely loved every second of the first playthrough, not once did it feel boring, worth the money if you're into Metroid-like games (this is more than that though).  The gameplay is, well, Metroid-like, can't really say much about that, other than that the various upgrades and weapons you can find throughout the game are great and make the game that much more interesting. Also it's a nice touch that the earlier areas of the game aren't just some random parts that you run through and never see again, but rather you can (and should) return at later points. One thing to note here is that although the levels are well put together, in some places it's inevitable to take damage and in others you get hit by enemies or projectiles that come from off-screen (out of screen? you get the point). I played on hard difficulty - it's challenging but not ridiculous. Maybe if you're not a pleb like me, you won't die 100 times.  The graphics are top notch (if you're into pixel graphics, that is), they do feel somewhat nostalgic, but also have some tasteful elements of new (like when a Data Bomb explodes). The music likewise, although I do feel like some of the sounds are a bit too harsh, like the ghouls or when a boss appears, but that's really just a minor pet peeve - all in all, most of the sounds fit their purpose well.  Finally, the story is great. It's not shoved down your throat, if you don't care you can just skip all the dialogs and not read the notes, but I feel like it did add to the whole experience, and I would love to learn more about it (Sudran mostly).  All in all a great game, absolutely worth the money.
Date 2017-12-26 Playtime 17h 23m Rec Positive FUN.
Date 2017-12-26 Playtime 68h 8m Rec Positive The soundtrack was too good. I had to get this game.  From the first screen, it was better than I ever could have imagined.

Date 2017-12-25 Playtime 32h 47m Rec Positive nothing short of awesome. if you enjoyed super metroid.. get this
Date 2017-12-25 Playtime 9h 7m Rec Positive Dimensional scientist wakes up with no memory and decides to shoot around aimlessly looking for glitched areas along the way.  The Good:  - Straight forward menu and settings to get into the game.  - Cut scenes aren't demanding in time and gets a player right back into action.  - Controller support works well.  - A good story and progression throughout the game in discovery.  - Combat is very much Metroid inspired and in navigatoin to the bosses for combat.  - Weapon variety? Some unique concepts here that I seen.   The Bad:  - Too much weapon selections for a limited octoganal aiming direction and tasking in switching between them. The circular menu tries to alleviate this, but one can accidentally hit the left stick in accidentally triggering weapon changes on the default controller setting WHILE trying to move and lock my aiming in movement.  - Could use dual stick aiming. Many times I had to break in holding a modifier shoot-in-place shoulder button with the default controls. This limits strategy in movement and strain in dexterity in control along with strict diagonal, straight forward, or up aiming. This is a drawback even on those 2D Metroid insipired games.  - Save points. With the lore of the game, one can easily facilitate the fast travel to previous spots in the game, saving having to do past exploration tedium for completion. I would like for this to be an option - and for those speed running to be able to have this disabled for strict adherance to the spirit of the run in discipline. It would be a nice casual feature if there is fast travel between the egg capsules.  - Guess and shoot graphics. The breakable terrain isn't as straight forward as it is in say Super Metroid in discovery and built intuition. Many times I would simply find myself just holding down my fire button with a preferred weapon.  - The fire button. It is painful to continually repeatedly press fire for differing shots. It would simply be nice if some of the weapons call for a toggle switch, allowing to then focus using the awkward standing lock aiming and directional movement. Or... well have the right stick aim separately from the movement controls and allowing the triggers for jump and manual fire. This would alleviate the XABY buttons for item usages and the drone use as intended.  - Locked dedicated map button. Many times I hit the left controller menu button and it would take me to the previous menu screen I last left off at - and if I wanted to keep that button as my quick map, I have to exit the menu screen at the map section. The only other reason for quickly going into the quick menu, is for weapon selection of which the left stick already can take care of this in selection on demand - if I did not hit it accidentally while trying to duck and diagonally shoot.  - Weapon variety is also a double edge sword in detriment. Most are situational. Some will mostly be had in simply of ease in handling. That default Axiom Disrupter will quickly get disregarded and take up UI space. And because of the potential enormous selection, it is a burden to switch between the intended weapons for situations OR overshooting past a selection OR accidetnally switching weapons with the left stick in press.   The Strain:  - Unless I have to get all 100% of the items (for a good ending), there are some areas that aren't clear with the weapons and tools in determining access to those "bugged" areas in reach. There are also red herrings of terrain to also confuse the player. This would detract a player in wanting to fully complete the game compounded with lengthy backtracking in manual traveling to already discovered save points. This is in consideration of already "beating" the game the first time around.  - The music, while provides an out of world parallel for the experience, will quickly add and compound to the chore in retreading old ground. Sure one can mute it, but the music is already not considerate in repetition, and will add an additional setting chore one has to do, even on a potential first go around and then unmuting again for those boss battles.  - The aiming. This could have easily been a dual stick 2D shooter Metroidvania game. The weapons variety can certainly use this in many situations of expanded boss room fights. But far too many times I have to red-light, green-light, my hold position AND D-pad lock my diagonal in controller strain.  - Weapon selection is a chore. Even with "Secret of Mana" circle menu in serialization. Coupled with the left stick in selection PLUS the enormous weapon variety one collects over the game, one can easily overshoot one's intended selection in the heat of battle or as mentioned, accidentally select away from the current weapon in use.   Overall, a good game with very much a telling of existential deconstructions and thinking of "axioms". If there is a sequel - which the game highly hints from my playthrough, I surely await for one, but don't expect one.
Date 2017-12-25 Playtime 19h 43m Rec Positive Gorgeous, compelling, weirdly visceral and fantastically mind-bending.  A metroidvania in the old style with a hearty dose of 70's mindscrewing.  It's like Giger on acid.  So much fun.
Date 2017-12-25 Playtime 19h 22m Rec Positive Very few games have ever giving me the chills. I wasn't ready to have my mind blown to shit. Turn this into a franchise and I'll buy every one released. Seriously waited years for something like this to come around. A big mushroom tipped thumbs up to the devs of this masterpiece.

Date 2017-12-24 Playtime 13h 8m Rec Positive Axiom Verge starts out like an 8-bit-style Super Metroid clone, but develops its own identity the more you play.   The gameplay loop is immediately familiar -- reach an impasse, explore, fight a boss, get a new power, traverse the impasse -- but Happ (the creator) applies 30 years of game design innovations to the classic Metroid formula. The result is challenging, both mentally and technically, without being punishing.  There are some innovative new gameplay ideas here too. I'll try not to spoil too much, but all the glorious graphical glitches of the NES days make a return in Axiom Verge, as actual, controllable game mechanics.  The story and setting is Half Life meets The Matrix. It's boiled-down cyberpunk with a couple cool twists. Definitely a bit more than you'd expect from an 8-bit, throwback action game.  The sound and enemy design leave some room for improvement, but this is a great game if you enjoy Metroidvanias and 8-bit throwbacks, and it's a truly impressive work when you consider that it was made entirely by one person!

Date 2017-12-19 Playtime 5h 48m Rec Positive [i][b]DISCLAIMER:[/b] Recensione basata sulla versione per Nintendo Switch (che vi invito ad acquistare se possibile - vedi spiegazione in chiusura), identica a quella su Steam.[/i]  Per un retrogamer incallito come il sottoscritto buttarsi a capofitto in un gioco come Axiom Verge è un esperienza totalizzante, che riempie il cuore di gioia. Non esagero, credetemi, quando dico che questo gioco è attualmente l'esempio più brillante di retro-metroidvania in circolazione, un vero e proprio gioiello indie confezionato con una cura e attenzione ai dettagli che lascia di stucco - soprattutto se si pensa che è stato concepito e realizzato da una singola persona, il programmatore britannico Tom Happ.   In via del tutto eccezionale, questa volta vi risparmierò accenni anche solo parziali alla trama. Finirei col rivelare troppi dettagli, togliendovi il piacere di ricostruire pezzo dopo pezzo la serie di eventi che coinvolgono Trace, lo scienziato protagonista della storia. Il copione dal taglio sci-fi offre spunti interessanti, trattando in particolare il tema della realtà e della percezione, e sa regalare diversi "coup de théatre" spettacolari, culminando in un epico confronto finale.  Come metroidvania, Axiom Verge non nasconde la predilezione per il taglio futuristico delle avventure di Samus Aran; ciò nonostante si avverte per tutto l'arco del gioco un impalpabile quid di mistico estraneo all'universo di Metroid, che trova parziale spiegazione nei dialoghi e nei vari frammenti di scritture che potremo recuperare nel nostro viaggio. Come da tradizione, il mondo esplorabile è suddiviso in diversi biomi molto ben caratterizzati a livello ambientale, talvolta accessibili solo se provvisti di determinati power-up o particolari armi (ne esistono più di 20 tipi differenti).  La mappa del mondo è piuttosto ampia, benché forse leggermente più piccola di quelle viste nelle diverse incarnazioni di Metroid su console Nintendo. Non vi è alcun meccanismo di teletrasporto per accorciare i tempi di spostamento tra le varie zone: a tratti potrebbe risultare noioso passare diversi minuti ad attraversare aree già esplorate, ma in linea di massima questo aspetto non inficia sulla qualità dell'esperienza di gioco [spoiler](e più avanti troverete comunque un modo per spostarvi più agevolmente tra i vari biomi)[/spoiler].   Il gameplay è semplicemente impeccabile. I controlli sono semplici ma estremamente precisi, il gunplay arcade a la "Contra" (con la possibilità di far fuoco in 8 direzioni) è molto soddisfacente, e nelle fasi avanzate del gioco ci troveremo spesso a dover affrontare delle sezioni di platforming non banali (due parole: [spoiler]BIONIC-COMMANDO[/spoiler]) che metteranno alla prova la nostra coordinazione e reattività. Le boss battle sono ben strutturate, avvincenti e impegnative, senza mai risultare frustranti; talvolta la visuale subirà uno zoom-out per permetterci di apprezzare le dimensioni titaniche dei guardiani, rendendo lo scontro ancora più epico ed emozionante.  Parlando di grafica, Axiom Verge sfoggia la pixel-art 8bit più fedele che io abbia mai visto: semplicemente deliziosa. La modernità del gioco è tradita solo dalla complessità di alcuni fondali (difficilmente riscontrabile nei titoli vecchi), mentre per il resto il gioco potrebbe tranquillamente essere il prodotto di punta del catalogo NES negli anni '80. Sul versante audio, la soundtrack non è da meno: se quando si parla di chiptune indie l'OST di Hotline Miami rimane un modello difficilmente avvicinabile, le melodie dissonanti di Axiom Verge (senza tralasciare gli effetti sonori) vanno ad occupare di diritto il secondo gradino di un ideale podio.  Nota doverosa su una questione delicata che ho già affrontato sul mio activity feed.  Dopo l'approdo su PC, Axiom Verge è stato pubblicato qualche mese fa anche su Nintendo Switch: il 75% dei ricavi delle vendite su questa piattaforma verrà donato al fondo per le spese mediche di Alastair, il figlio dello sviluppatore Tom Happ che ha riportato danni neuro-motori permanenti a seguito di una forma di ittero neonatale non affrontata tempestivamente. Da padre prima che giocatore, consiglio a tutti i possessori di Switch di acquistarlo su console portatile, che tra l'altro per via del fattore mobilità a mio avviso rappresenta l'habitat ideale per questo tipo di giochi.   Godersi un gioco eccezionale ed accumulare karma positivo - non potremmo chiedere di meglio!

Gameplay: 5/5 (Yes, done before, but reinvented) Controls: 4.5/5  Value: 4/5  Difficulty: 3.5/5  -------------- Overall 4.7 (Difficulty is always excluded)  [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31208751/]Please follow my Pixel Art Curation for other great games...[/url]   If you have read any of my reviews, you will surely come upon negative ones about what I think about people who clone a classic and try to get a cash grab!!!  This game is for sure greatly influenced by Metroid, but they take their own creative juices and produce something that takes you deep into their imagination :)  It is a solid, expansive retro platformer that will immerse you into a gorgeous pixelated world.  I am sure, it is more likely that my review is not the first you have read, so others have said so much about this game.  I know it is not on the cheap end when it comes to pixel retro, but the quality is there!  It is like when I used to save up and wonder what game I should by when my parent took me down to Toy's R Us...So much anticipation, knowing that this would be a game I would spend much of my free time with.  I think this game would have been one of those I would have give all my savings too ;)   ACHIEVEMENTS:  Many you can accomplish no issue, but then there are they no dying and time trials, which will make this a challenging 100%.
Date 2017-12-19 Playtime 23h 55m Rec Positive A great game if you're looking for something similiar to Metroid with tons of collectibles and secrets around the map.
Date 2017-12-18 Playtime 7h 43m Rec Positive Un metroidbania completamente respetable.
Date 2017-12-18 Playtime 16h 50m Rec Positive 個人で開発したとは思えない出来栄え。 とてもおもしろい、買いです。
Date 2017-12-18 Playtime 10h 18m Rec Positive Очень залипательная игра, в хитросплетениях которой я надеюсь разобраться (столько тут всевозможных секретов и предметов для поиска). Добротный в целом проект, на который потратить требуемые четыреста рублей не зазорно, тем более если вы фанат жанра.
Date 2017-12-18 Playtime 28h 17m Rec Positive Really fun and satisfying game. It has an engaging, mysterious storyline. Graphics are nice. If you like metroidvanias, then this is a must.
Date 2017-12-17 Playtime 15h 25m Rec Positive This is the best Metroidvania game ever, including Metroid.
Date 2017-12-17 Playtime 30h 10m Rec Positive I'm not really a hardcore fan of metroidvanias, and I went into this game blind with low expectations. However, this game was a pleasant surprise.  [h1] Pros : [/h1] -The world is huge and interconnected -The map is actually useful -The soundtrack is great and the level themes are fitting. -The visuals are varied and the sprite art is pretty good, especially with large objects and bosses. -There is a variety of enemies, each mostly specific to the area they are introduced in. -The plot is quite interesting despite there being little of it. -The game rewards the player very often for exploring. -The abilities and tools are intuitive and creative.  [h1] Cons : [/h1] -My biggest gripe with this game is that the sound that plays when your weapon doesn't damage the enemy is way too loud. This isn't even a nitpick, it's louder than anything else in the game and is especially a problem with high DPS weapons. -The dash's controls can be a bit finicky, which is annoying. -The bosses seem to go down in quality after the third boss. -Sometimes the enemy placement is very annoying.  I'm glad I decided to get this game, it's very polished but has a handful of flaws.
Date 2017-12-15 Playtime 5h 43m Rec Positive This is a fantastic game. Fun, beautiful, and atmospheric with some really unique mechanics I haven't seen before. I can't think of anything I could say that will convince you more than what you already see, but seriously, just play it. If you like Metroid games, you will adore Axiom Verge.
Date 2017-12-14 Playtime 28h 50m Rec Positive I can recommend this game to everyone that like Metroidvania games that refine and challenge the standards of Metroidvania games!  Pro: - Amazingly crafted music that fits the style and atmosphere of the game perfectly. - very detailed Pixelart visuals and creative designs of the world, monsters, bosses and NPCs. - fluid and extremely well made controls, easy to grasp while also being challenging to master. - the story is very creative and absolutely different to other Metroidvania games and has HUGE plot-twists that changes  the overall theme of the game without being too difficult to grasp. - HUGE map to explore on your own and tons of hidden secrets that invite you to exploring the world multiple times. - Challenge modes like normal mode, Hard mode which cut the health drops by 25%, amount of dropped health cut by 25%, faster bosses, less damage dealt (10% cut) and more damage taken (also 10% cut) and a built in speedrun Mode that takes out dialogs, records the time ingame and even shows milestones being reached with the corresponding time so that you can clearly see how long it took you to get to that milestone and so on.  Cons: - a bit short, I for myself got 100% on my first run in about 16 hours while derping around in the environment, without the derping I would've needed about 12 hours. Now I that I played through hard mode I can complete it in about 6-7 Hours, speedrunners finish it in about 1.3 hours on 100%, any% runs stay at around 35 minutes. - no bonus bosses or challenges for completing the game to 100%, not that the game isn't amazing but something as a reward would have been nice.   TL;DR: This game is a hidden gem on steam, get it if you like Metroidvania games!
Date 2017-12-13 Playtime 20h 20m Rec Positive Very fun and challenging. This game will not hold your hand or tell you where and how to get things done but still has a way about making it fair and understandable. There are a few points in the game where the difficulty ramps up a lot, but is usually rewarding if you make it through.   8/10 in my opinion. It’s a bit tedious to get around in this game, in the beginning, but lots of shortcuts and amazing things unlock to help you get around.
Date 2017-12-10 Playtime 9h 10m Rec Positive The Super Metroid's influence is strong in this one and that's a great thing. What a thrilling adventure! The story, gameplay, soundtrack, and world just suck you in. Each session I was eager to sit down and play more. There is tons going on here and it's all great. I found almost all the weapons useful during different parts of the game.  Does this game have flaws? Of course it does, but as a big fan of the 2D Metroid games this was an amazing experience, so amazing that I didn't have time to notice any flaws.
Date 2017-12-09 Playtime 12h 2m Rec Positive [i]Axiom Verge[/i] can be thought of as sort of a Bizarro World [i]Super Metroid[/i], because while it's obviously directly inspired by [i]Super Metroid[/i], it goes out of its way to be as different as possible.  It continually subverses your expectations, in story but even more notably in upgrade design.  The array of unique upgrades distinguishes [i]Axiom Verge[/i] in a genre that struggles to move forward.  In fact, so many ways are provided to approach obstacles, that I found myself occasionally missing solutions at first.  The graphics could stand to have their resolution doubled, but I understand [i]Axiom Verge[/i] was (very impressively) created by a single person.  The game boasts a large compliment of weapons to use, and while most of them have their niche, I could rarely be bothered switching between them.  The system would have made more sense in a more tactical, slow-moving game.  The story is interesting and unobtrusive, but somewhat opaque.  The save points are generous, which is a good design decision.  I can't comment too much on the difficulty because I got stuck during the second half of the game, and ended up somewhat exhaustively finding health/power upgrade secrets while trying to figure out how to progress.
Date 2017-12-09 Playtime 15h 0m Rec Positive .
Date 2017-12-09 Playtime 31h 39m Rec Positive This game did the marvel of achieving a genuine Super Metroid feeling with almost only original mechanics. It feels refreshing to see a game from the metroidvania genre so different from the others.
Date 2017-12-09 Playtime 13h 39m Rec Positive I was on the fence about this one for a while, and couldn't be happier that I finally bought it. Expect great retro music, visuals and a very Metroid-feeling experience, but with enough unique features (and a shit ton of weapons) to stand without the comparison. It's either a completionist's worst nightmare or dream game...I myself found every secret very satisfying to find, and you don't feel as though you are playing the game 'wrong' if you don't find absolutely everything. Though, you are sufficienlty rewarded for exploring as much as possible, often with concise bits of lore detailing an engaging universe, but often with weapons, many of which feel situational, some of which feel overpowered, all of which are fun. Highly recommended if you're already a Metroidvania fan, but would also be a great intro to the genre.
Date 2017-12-08 Playtime 14h 32m Rec Positive A Metroidvania with NES-style graphics and music.  It looks great, sounds great, and has a unique but familiar atmosphere.  The story and gameplay were good, but not really memorable.
Date 2017-12-07 Playtime 9h 27m Rec Positive best metroid clone ever, I think it might even be better than super meteroid which is one of my all time favorite games.  a bit too much backtracking later in the game
Date 2017-12-07 Playtime 20h 43m Rec Positive Metroidvania love = purchasing this game. Simple as that.
Date 2017-12-07 Playtime 11h 49m Rec Positive Excelente metroidvania, muy buena historia, jugabilidad, variedad de armas, poderes, extras. La verdad que todo parece muy bueno, ecepto por la poca cantidad de jefes en el juego
Date 2017-12-06 Playtime 15h 7m Rec Positive Just beat my first playthrough on normal after a bit more than 12 hours.  Totally gorgeous looking and sounding game, yet another triumph and testament to the creative and technical genius of small indie games.  I would highly recommend it.
Date 2017-12-05 Playtime 46h 38m Rec Positive If you like classics metroivanias games, this game is for you. Like all metroidvanias this game has character status upgrades, good variety of key itens which gives abilities and weapons. This game also have notes which reveal secrets on plot. The game has great special effects like particles and visual wheezing when enemies get hit.
Date 2017-12-04 Playtime 0h 27m Rec Negative I believe I can see the enemy 'Cause I repeat the same pressing X routine I think this Metroidvania used to have a purpose Then again, that might have been a dream  I think I used to have fun exploring Now I never make a sound And I just do what I've been told I really don't want enemies to come around, oh no  Every room is exactly the same Every room is exactly the same There is no fun here and there is only pain Every room is exactly the same 
Date 2017-12-03 Playtime 10h 32m Rec Positive Really great game that I'd recommend for all fans of metroidvania games. Good atmosphere, great soundtrack, and great gameplay. I'm not a huge fan of the graphical style, but it never intereferes. 8.5/10
Date 2017-12-03 Playtime 3h 1m Rec Positive  E S T E T İ K
Date 2017-12-03 Playtime 6h 50m Rec Positive I love it, Kinda remind me of Super Metroid.
Date 2017-12-03 Playtime 8h 29m Rec Negative I am really struggling to understand why the "all reviews" classifcation is "overwhlemingly positive"? Is it "positive review bombing"? Is it that Axiom Verge is "ok" to the vast majoroity of people, and so somehow get classified as an unparalleled masterpiece through binary review aggregation? I suspect I shall never find out.  What do I think of Axiom Verge? A bit underwhelmed. Its a "ok" metroid style platformer. I love the 16bit style music, and like the retro graphics, both remind me of my childhood gaming (hey maybe, thats why so many people rated this as "recommended", it evokes nostalgia, and we all have a soft spot for that?). I guess Id rate it a 6 overall. Where did it lose me? In the "teleporting trenchcoat". Double tapping (at the end of a jump), in a pizel perfect position to warp through a wall/ceiling is incredibly fiddly and frustrating. I mean seriously bad game design. What was Tom thinking?! (Seriously Tom, Id love to know!)  And there are no "hints" as to where you are supposed to go next - which is fine if youve got time to spare on meandering about but doesnt work for me. Yes yes, one can use walkthroughs, but I feel they spoil games, and would especially destroy the lonely otherwordly feel Axoim Verge has.  As it is, I stopped playing at about 60 something percent completion, and just played through Ori Definitive edition (I had no ideas it was also a metroid style game). Wow, Ori is simply superb in comparison.  Maybe I'll pick up Axoim again someday, and struggle through, but I dont believe I will, it will enter the scores of other games Ive bought, played a bit, and simply stopped because they simply arent worth my time.
Date 2017-12-03 Playtime 13h 8m Rec Positive Simple Geometry, this Game has such a great sountrack , one of the best ones ive ever heared
Date 2017-12-02 Playtime 9h 58m Rec Positive +Great atmosphere, controls are really solid (with one exception), NEVER seen a Metroid-y game with so many weapons.  -Had to use JoyToKey for generic controller support, dash function is mapped to "double tap a direction" and doesn't filter inputs such as left-then-right leading to unintentional dashes.
Date 2017-12-02 Playtime 19h 19m Rec Positive A bit overrated but that's only if you're one of the few people like me who played Environmental Station Alpha before this game. If the most damning thing about your game is that it pales in comparison to only 1 other game in it's genre (non-metroid metroid games) then you've got a pretty fantastic game on your hands. Also some of the more unique movement mechanics are cool, but very inconsistent to use. If you don't expect too much from the story, and don't expect it to be better than Super Metroid, i'm guaranteed you'll have a great time. 8/10.
Date 2017-12-02 Playtime 16h 50m Rec Positive This game has all the elements of Super Metroid just with more weapons, bosses, more items, abilities and secrets, cool music and complex story. Its amazing just one person created this game. A must get! 9.5/10
Date 2017-12-02 Playtime 20h 28m Rec Positive Recomendado, aunque es una historia lineal un par de veces tuve que consultar la guia ya que la exploración se deriva solamente de las habilidades que vas obteniendo
Date 2017-12-01 Playtime 18h 45m Rec Positive This game displays its love of the original Metroid with no shame. It's simple, do you like Metroidvanias? Do you prefer ones that have less 'vania' in them? Then you will probably like this. Hell, I wasn't a big fan of the original Metroid games and I still love this game.  The artstyle is definitely what is most offputting in this title, and that's very intentional. Landscapes are garish and bright with clashing colors that, fittingly, are very alien. Key parts of the map are covered in corruption that looks like the kind of graphical glitching you'd see on an old NES or Master System game. Ugly, but with purpose. The soundtrack is all over the place in terms of inspiration. Tracks are definitely memorable, and they fit with the game, but I'm not sure its something that I would ever just listen to.   That said, when the game decides to make some detailed art (namely the bosses, and the only other friendly NPCs you meet), it looks great, and has a unique style. Like a weird art-deco/H.R. Geiger crossover.  The actual gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from a Metroid game. Explore an area, get the powerup in it, use that powerup to get to new areas, get more powerups, backtrack and find more areas, rinse, repeat. The game gets creative with the movement powerups though, and it think that's what sets it apart from Metroid. To go into too many details would be spoiler territory though, so I'm going to avoid that. The platforming is good, and there weren't too many bullshit enemies to annoy you.  Its not a long game, but it also doesn't overstay its welcome. And if you find yourself wanting more, there are plenty of hidden rooms and secret maps to discover for the completionist in you.   If you have any interest in these styles of game, this is a great example of the metroidvania genre, better (I think) than the genre's namesake. Just don't expect much -vania in here.
Date 2017-12-01 Playtime 13h 57m Rec Positive metroidvania fan ? BUY IT!!!!!
Date 2017-11-30 Playtime 1h 14m Rec Positive maravilhoso...saudades de jogos em 08bits
Date 2017-11-30 Playtime 24h 14m Rec Positive A very satisfying metroidvania with good pacing and weapon variety. The soundtrack is incredibly immersive, and helps set the tone for the world you are exploring.
Date 2017-11-29 Playtime 46h 26m Rec Positive 細かい所そして隅々まで遊びつくせるこの難度 メトロイド経験者ならおわかりだろう。死んだらセーブした状態まで戻されるあの辛さを Axiom Vergeは一度セーブしておけば死んでもそこから復活並びに取ったアイテムもそのまま！ 言うべきところはまだまだある ゲームにおいて鍵山雛のように厄介がられる？(R6Sではよく笑いのネタにされてるか)バグを謎解きに組み込むという斬新なアイデア！白衣を入手することにより壁を抜けることもできる他アドレス撹乱機を手に入れればバグった地形を戻したり逆に敵をバグらせて弱体化させたり友好化させたりなど そして最も言うべきところは隠しエリアの存在だ 毎度違う場所に入り口が生成される隠しエリアのい入り口も隠し方がこれまたうまい これに関してはぜひ自身の目で見てほしい このゲームに関しては文句なしの高評価をせざるを得ない 昔のゲームがお好き？なら是非プレイするべきだ
Date 2017-11-29 Playtime 22h 36m Rec Positive Do you like metroid? Do you like side scrollers? Do you like intersting sci fi plots? Do you like lovecraftian vibes?  GET THIS GAME ITS AMAZING!
Date 2017-11-28 Playtime 11h 26m Rec Positive Possibly one of the best Metroidvanias out there. Definitely to be compared with the actual metroid games. Truly nailed the combat-exploration-item hunting flow of the genre and never got stale.  Played on Normal difficulty, took about 10 hours but I only got 65 percent of the items, I hear there's something special when you get 80 percent, so I'll definitely go back and revisit it sometime.  There's a few spots that are weird difficulty spikes, like a couple of pixel perfect jumps and a few enemy areas that feel unfair. Don't be afraid to cheese them out using world geometry and the super cool hack thing you can do.  Highly recommended, especially if you're a Metroid fan.
Date 2017-11-28 Playtime 2h 48m Rec Positive This game is very fun, a very good way for us older folk to relive some of the first videogames we ever picked up. I highly recomend this fun game.
Date 2017-11-28 Playtime 16h 41m Rec Positive The epitome of the Metroidvania style.
Date 2017-11-28 Playtime 25h 29m Rec Positive Un juego para los amanets del genero "Metroidvania" que te recordara sin duda a los metroid clasicos
Date 2017-11-28 Playtime 8h 58m Rec Positive Eaily one of the best "Metroidvania" games I've ever played.
Date 2017-11-28 Playtime 1h 59m Rec Positive very great game! the adventure is fun, and the challenge makes it even better! definitely worth the price!
Date 2017-11-28 Playtime 20h 46m Rec Positive Todo un Metroidvania, juego super recomendado para los amantes de los Metroid y Castlevania tipo Simon's Quest o SOTN. Sacar el 100% será un reto interesante
Date 2017-11-28 Playtime 20h 54m Rec Positive Wow! Très bon jeu de style metroidvania, avec une soundtrack qui nous tranposte facilement dans l'univers du jeu. Pixel art bien travaillé, qui nous rappelle l'ère du SNES, avec beaucoup de détails ainsi qu'une bonne varieté d'armes.
Date 2017-11-28 Playtime 20h 52m Rec Positive Very complex with an expansive simi-openworld where you can back track to almost any where. Death never feels like the game's fault only your own which coinsides along with trying to progress through the story which when you are having trouble finding a specific Item It's usually right infront of you waiting to be seen. Great ingaging smart gameplay along with sound track you can never get bored of.
Date 2017-11-27 Playtime 12h 40m Rec Positive Kept my interest all the way through to the end, which is impressive for a game nowadays.
Date 2017-11-27 Playtime 0h 53m Rec Negative В современном гейм-деве принято считать, что если ты сделал закос под олд-скул и запилил 8-ми битную музычку, то все, успех обеспечен. Я очень люблю платформеры, но это чушь полная с убогой графикой. Лучше на эти деньги купить старенький денди и в супер-контру зарубиться. Фана в разы больше.
Date 2017-11-27 Playtime 37h 49m Rec Positive Simplemente un juego increbile, es poco decir que me encanto. Un metroidvania con su estilo unico y una historia muy atrapante. Si te gusta el genero y ademas la ciencia ficcion si o si tendrias que jugarlo, lo recomiendo demasiado.
Date 2017-11-27 Playtime 12h 51m Rec Positive An excellent Metroidvania with great art and soundtrack
Date 2017-11-27 Playtime 12h 49m Rec Positive Failed an exam because of this game.  Totally worth it.
Date 2017-11-27 Playtime 17h 50m Rec Positive This game has a very interesting storyline and great mechanics. It brings back nostalgic feelings of games like Castlevania and Metroid, but bringing in new mechanics and such a wide variety of weapons and the ever popular collective passive items.
Date 2017-11-27 Playtime 1h 8m Rec Positive This is unabashedly a Metroid clone and it couldn't be better for it.
Date 2017-11-27 Playtime 36h 29m Rec Positive First metroidvania game I played in many years, since my childhood, where I used to play hours without end of the Metroid saga. After stopping to wait for a new Metroid to be announced, I realized that there were a whole universe of games under the Metroidvania tag, which I got to know from a friend.   For the fans of the game style, Axion Verge is highly recommended, where it mixes nostalgic elements from metroid games, with new and interesting features of its own.
Date 2017-11-27 Playtime 20h 9m Rec Positive 像素的艺术，可是到现在也没有发现100%的武器和物品，有一点郁闷，游戏性很强，操作也很不错，一定要用手柄玩
Date 2017-11-27 Playtime 5h 41m Rec Positive Solid action platformer that's just modern enough to play well without straying too far from it's retro roots.
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 5h 46m Rec Positive One guy made this?
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 9h 39m Rec Negative this game makes my dick so hard it hurts q:^(
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 22h 49m Rec Positive I love this game.
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 15h 34m Rec Positive 特意为这个游戏把3DS弄成了笔记本能用的手柄，真的是一款不错的游戏，从玩法到音乐都是上乘的，最厉害的是都是出自一人之手，我是佩服的，提名了一个自定义的银河战士奖，因为我觉得他应该是类银河战士游戏中的佼佼者
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 82h 1m Rec Positive If I had a choice between Axiom Verge and Super Metroid, I'd rather tear myself apart.
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 12h 55m Rec Positive Just like everyone says, if you like the 2D Metroid games, you'll like this.  - Controls feel good - Great soundtrack - Nice environments - Difficult but not too frustrating - Interesting story  It was very enjoyable and definitely worth playing.
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 24h 4m Rec Positive Axiom Verge ist ein sehr klassisches Metroidvania, welches speziell an Spiele wie Super Metroid erinnert (was bei dem Genre nicht unüblich ist, ich weiß). Ich werde hier kurz und knapp auf einige wichtige Punkte eingehen, kann aber schon im Vorfeld sagen dass ich großer Fan des Spiels bin.  Die [h1] Grafik [/h1] ist Metroidvania typisch, und sehr hübsch umgesetzt. Großartige Pixelarts, eindrucksvolle Level, klar erkennbare Themen in einzelnen Bereichen. [b] 10/10 [/b]  Der [h1] Soundtrack [/h1] ist in meinen Augen mit das Beste am Spiel, ich empfehle sehr diesen direkt mit dazuzukaufen. Hier erwarten einen Synth Wave typische Tracks, ebenfalls zum Teil an alte Metroid Teile erinnernd. Immer passend zum aktuellen Gebiet in dem man sich befindet, ziehen sie einen immer mehr in die Welt von Axiom Verge. [b] 11/10 [/b]  Apropos Welt, das [h1] Leveldesign [/h1] ist, große Überraschung, ebenfalls typisch für ein Metroidvania. Hübsch gemacht, mit vielen Secrets. Sehr groß angelegt, für das Erkunden kann man viel Zeit einplanen, in der einem nicht langweilig wird. Einige passagen sind allerdings zugegebenermaßen schon ein wenig.. abgenutzt? Schon oft in Metroidvanias gesehen zumindest. Dies ist nicht zwingend schlimm, aber etwas neues hätte nicht geschadet. [b] 7/10 [/b]  Langweilig wird einem allgemein nicht, was auch an dem [h1] Gameplay [/h1] liegt. Viele verschiedene Waffen und Fähigkeiten erwarten einen, wenn man genug erkundet. Doch trotzdem muss ich sagen, dass ich gewisse Probleme mit der Steuerung hatte. Sie funktioniert soweit, ganz klar, aber sie fühlt sich für mich nicht besonders flüssig an. Dies kann eindeutig auch an mir liegen, aber trotzdem hielt ich es für erwähnenswert.  [b]7/10[/b]  Zu guter letzt sei noch kurz auf die [h1] Story [/h1] eingegangen (keine Sorge, ohne Spoiler!). Ich muss sagen, ich mochte die Story, und die Erzählweise. Sie ist nichts besonderes, keine Frage, aber sie war passend und stimmig, oft auch im Einklang mit Grafik und Ton sehr eindrucksvoll rübergebracht. [b] 8/10 [/b]   [h1]Fazit:[/h1] Alles in allem empfehle ich jedem, der ein Metroidvania zu schätzen weiß oder gerne mal eines ausprobieren möchte (der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist nicht niedrig, aber durchaus einsteigerfreundlich), dieses Spiel zu spielen. Besonders für den Kaufpreis lohnt es sich meiner Ansicht nach sehr. Gesamtwertung: [b] 9/10 [/b]
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 45h 55m Rec Positive A true tribute to the 90's classic. Greatest Metroidvania game, but with a much larger world, than Super Metroid. It's like that game, and Fusion combined. The music is kind of wierd, so I just played the Super Metroid sound track in the background, via youtube video, and turned down the game music. It's uncanny how it fits. Although it is similar it does have a tremendous amount of it's own refreshing content, that makes it feel new, and unkown. It gives that old fashioned Metroid style exploration, and discovery combat/problem solving mechanic. We thank you Tom Happ, for this masterpiece.
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 16h 56m Rec Positive Gran aventura para los auténticos nostálgicos de los juegos plataforma de la era Megadrive (Genesis). Básicamente si este juego hubiese salido a finales de los años 80, estoy seguro de que hoy estaría considerado como una obra maestra del juego de plataformas. Hoy en día consigue rescatar ese espiritu y hacernos volver atrás en el tiempo pero ofreciendo gran variedad de posibilidades entre armas, objetos especiales, poderes, y un mapa inmesno que es casi imposible explorar entero. Dificultad media pero para jugadores exigentes. Siempre me acordaré de este juego.
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 3h 44m Rec Positive 말이필요없는 최고의 명작게임이다!!!   메트로매니아에게 있어서 이보다 최고의 게임은 없다고 자부한다!!!
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 10h 14m Rec Positive One of the best Metroidvanias you'll ever play.

Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 8h 54m Rec Positive Fun and brings me back to my childhood. Lots of weapons and quite a big game. Totally worth it if you like any Metroid game.
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 0h 13m Rec Positive 可惜我玩了3ds的阿萨姆归来，这个游戏大概是不会碰了。还是推荐一下。
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 14h 56m Rec Positive Really good game in the style of metroid.
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 17h 52m Rec Positive Compelling story! Love the level references to Metroid. Interesting music. Fun times all around
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 30h 15m Rec Positive This is the Metroid clone I've missed and I really like the music.  I'm really only writing the review for a badge, but you should ABSOLUTELY buy this game.  You will not regret it. 
Date 2017-11-26 Playtime 5h 15m Rec Positive One of the best Metroid-vania style games I've ever played. Definitely worth your time!
Date 2017-11-25 Playtime 0h 41m Rec Negative Meh, it's just running, jumping, and shooting. It's basically an exact copy of Metroid with alternate graphics. I found nothing new or compelling in the gameplay, and am personally amazed at all the positive reviews. I bought this game specifically because I thought that the gaming public had a high bar for a Metroid clone and would only recommend a game like this if it really was spectacular. What I found was very dissapointing, so now I am also dissapointed in everyone who thinks this is a great game... For everyone who thinks this is an awesome game, go watch a video of Turrican from the early '90's and tell me how Axiom Verge is still so great.  Go ahead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70xp5mnsx1A Note Turrican, which is DECADES older has everything metroid and AV have plus: 1. MUCH larger maps so far fewer scene loading 2. Powerups and weapon changes throughout all the levels so you can make tactical choices 3. An energy economy 4. Special jetpack levels for a change of playstyle  It's 2017. If you're going to make a metroid clone, give it the qualities and complexities that have been developed in metroidvania clones through the decades since the original metroid.
Date 2017-11-25 Playtime 14h 30m Rec Positive One of the best Metroidvanias I've ever played.  One of the few that really captures the feel of the original metroid.
Date 2017-11-25 Playtime 25h 54m Rec Positive If you like the old Metrodvania games like Super Metroid, you probably love this game. A bit short, but definitely worth a try!
Date 2017-11-25 Playtime 15h 12m Rec Positive best of old school style exploder sidescroller shooter. a bit wierd and hard to follow story (atleast for me) but after few playthroughs it started to reveal and it was mind blowing, game itself is really responsive and good gameplay, lots of hidden stuff and lots to explore. now hoping for Axiom verge 2
Date 2017-11-25 Playtime 0h 7m Rec Negative 看着不错 但是玩后发现有些平庸
Date 2017-11-25 Playtime 9h 12m Rec Positive Que decir de esta maravillosa obra,es puro "hamor".Hecho por una persona,es un juegazo increible en lo visual,en lo artistico y en lo musical.Si te gustan los buenos juegos es una compra obligada.
Date 2017-11-25 Playtime 32h 26m Rec Positive Consegui gostar mais desse jogo do que o próprio metroid. A trilha sonora e a história são sensacionais.

Date 2017-11-24 Playtime 29h 52m Rec Positive This game rocks.
Date 2017-11-24 Playtime 27h 24m Rec Positive [h1] Pas PARFAIT parce qu'il n'a été produit que par une seule personne, mais on y retrouve totalement ce qui a pu faire la renommé de Super Metroïd, tout en appliquant sa propre personnalité. [/h1] [list] [*] Un environnement immersif et des musiques qui collent aux zones et situations sans lasser. [*] Un GAMEPLAY propre et varié avec ses nombreuses armes. Trop d'armes pourrait-on dire, mais quand les noobs s'essaieront à toutes les armes pour simplement prendre du plaisir à jouer comme ils en auront envie, les vétérans sauront trouver les armes indispensables pour infliger le plus de dégâts sur tel ou tel ennemi/boss et laquelle choisir pour rusher les niveaux. [spoiler] (Shotgun <3) [/spoiler]  [*] Une DIFFICULTÉ à mon goût appropriée pour celles/ceux qui veulent un challenge sans pour autant être un vétéran du genre et évidemment pour celles/ceux qui aiment transpirer. :] [*] Un SCÉNARIO efficace qui saura facilement vous toucher via l'intégration intelligente du GamePlay dans celui-ci.

Date 2017-11-24 Playtime 13h 41m Rec Positive Ich kenne seit 1994 kein anderes Spiel, dass die Atmosphäre, und Genialität besitzt, als wahres Metroidvania Meisterwerk betitelt zu werden. Dieses hier jedoch, tront dieser Kategorie an der Spitze. Ich hoffe nicht, dass das warten weitere 23 Jahre dauert,  bis ein vergleichbarer Titel erscheint!
Date 2017-11-24 Playtime 11h 38m Rec Positive Meilleur jeu néo rétro type MetroïdVania
Date 2017-11-24 Playtime 13h 9m Rec Positive Its amazing that only one person did this game . he literally just ask himselft what he would like to see in a videogame and here it is , not a perfect game but perfect for him and in the end something  perfect doesnt exist
Date 2017-11-24 Playtime 14h 42m Rec Positive This game takes me back to when I played Metroid Zero Mission and fusion on the Gameboy Advanced.
Date 2017-11-24 Playtime 76h 58m Rec Positive This is one of those indie classics that I feel went under the radar. It is obvious that a lot of time and love went into tuning each and every bit of the game. If you ever enjoyed games like Super Metroid or Cavestory, then you will love this Axiom Verge.
Date 2017-11-24 Playtime 20h 25m Rec Positive A thorough love letter to classic Metroid, pays homage without being derivative and bring its own ideas and personality to the table
Date 2017-11-24 Playtime 42h 34m Rec Positive Doesn't completely rely on the usual gating systems for these types of games. Well balanced and paced. Great speedrun mode. Has one of the best movement systems in a game.
Date 2017-11-24 Playtime 9h 46m Rec Positive 10/10. Will replay
Date 2017-11-24 Playtime 24h 8m Rec Positive One day I'll write a full review of this game. Until that day, just know this:  Play this game. Seriously.
Date 2017-11-24 Playtime 12h 46m Rec Positive Es, una maravilla de juego, he viajado en el tiempo a los juegos metroidvania de los años 90.  Qué musica, el mapeado y los boses. Una increible obra de arte
Date 2017-11-24 Playtime 1h 59m Rec Positive Metroid Like. Excellent game
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 14h 23m Rec Positive metroid clone which is super great.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 10h 51m Rec Positive Un buen juego que respeta lo de metroidvania, la historia es execelente, ya que, te al principio es simple, pero te da a enteder que es mas detallado.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 34h 27m Rec Positive This game is fun.  It is similar to Super Metroid, but has many different weapons and upgrades.  Most of the controls are eazy to use (only the teleport in the later part of the game has idiotic controls.)  The story is entertaining, but feel incomplete by leaving you hanging at the end.  The positive review is because the gameplay is so fun.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 20h 24m Rec Positive Captures the spirit of metroid/super metroid with styligh 8 bit-esque pixel art that complements its unique alien environments.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 37h 11m Rec Positive Este jogo é simplesmente demais!!! Depois de Metroid não pensei que veria coisa igual, sem falara no enedo da história que é muito legal, recomendo!
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 10h 35m Rec Positive It's Metroid plain and simple, great stuff great music
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 14h 30m Rec Positive Closest thing to Super Metroid I ever played.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 22h 44m Rec Positive Great metroidvania. There are some obscure secrets, but unless you're going for 100%, there isn't anything too well hidden.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 26h 53m Rec Positive This is a top tier metroidvania that was made by just one man. While this game is heavily influenced by the Metroid series, it maintains its own identity both story-wise and mechanically.   Aside from all the conventional things that make this game fantastic, it has another standout feature. There is a passcode system which allows you to modify different attributes of your character (aka cheat). This is a great way to add some more replay value after you've finished everything, as well as being really fun.  If your on the fence about getting this game, just do it.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 27h 2m Rec Positive is cool
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 16h 49m Rec Positive Eu tinha minhas dúvidas sobre esse jogo, mas me surpreendi muito. O jogo é muito bom e desafiado. A trilha sonora é excelente! Apenas jogue!
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 11h 47m Rec Positive First class metroidvania, Axiom Verge offers polished gameplay, a tough challenge, beautifully scary bosses and interesting tidbits of a story for those who care about it in a game like this.  I loved every minute of it.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 1h 1m Rec Positive Jogo recomendadíssimo para os amantes de Metroid
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 0h 35m Rec Negative I just couldn't seem to enjoy this one as much as other similar games. It's probably just me though since other people seem to like it.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 8h 54m Rec Positive Such a good game. I never played any of the metroid games when I was yonger to compare it like a lot of the other reviers.  But I loved the story and quirky weapons and I bought the OST on vinyl.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 14h 29m Rec Positive Really fun metroidvania game with lots of stuff to find. Awesome soundtrack.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 18h 31m Rec Positive A great Metroidvania game with a unique world to explore, deadly creatures to fight, a large and varied arsenal at your disposal, and a cryptic mystery to uncover.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 17h 21m Rec Positive Excelente Metroidvania, me recordo mi infancia con sus graficas pixeleadas, tiene buen reto pero no imposible, el uso original de armas y los enemigos originales, es una gran eleccion de juego clasico con reto y buena historia, lo recomiendo para los fans de Metroid y Contra...
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 0h 31m Rec Negative How is this game so boring?!  I played this game shortly after finishing Samus Returns, so I was hyped as hell. I cannot get into this game whatsoever. It's frustrating and monotonous.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 17h 54m Rec Positive Better than any Metroid game you'd care to mention.
Date 2017-11-23 Playtime 6h 30m Rec Positive mejor que el original
Date 2017-11-22 Playtime 33h 33m Rec Positive This is what a Metroidvania game should be.
Date 2017-11-22 Playtime 43h 28m Rec Positive This game has: - Great Soundtrack - Interesting Story - Awesome Mechanics - Sharp Controls - Creative Enemies and Bosses - A LOT of secrets - Everything I ever wanted from a video game.  is good
Date 2017-11-22 Playtime 17h 18m Rec Positive Altamente indicado para quem curti metroidvania, aliais o jogo é um homenagem a Metroid.
Date 2017-11-22 Playtime 18h 4m Rec Positive It's good. Frustrating, but good. There's far too much to it. Some of the hidden items are in such stupid places, you would never find it without some sort of guide or map. For a completionist, this game feels like a nightmare. Otherwise, I had a lot of fun spending many hours with this one. Story was really interesting and a little mind bending. Soundtrack was amazing. Loved it. It is a must play.
Date 2017-11-22 Playtime 7h 44m Rec Positive The best Metroidvania you will encounter in the market since Metroid Fusion.  And is better than most of the classic metroidvanias, in gameplay and storytelling, only paired with Hollow Knight.
Date 2017-11-22 Playtime 20h 6m Rec Positive In a world where Metroidvania's are forgotten Axiom Verge takes the torch and runs as far as it can with it.    If you are a fan of 2D Metroid games this is a great fill for the empty place Samus has left for some time.  That's not to say it's not without a few moments of "where am I going/doing?" that's a given for any game in this style but once you find that wall you could teleport through you'd been overlooking, boom, the game continues to amaze you with its level design and choice of weapons. I’d solidly place this game as one of the best Indie games I’ve played in the past few years.  It’s also great because it’s on a variety of platforms, while being on steam I feel I have to suggest it here, it also is on a variety of other systems.
Date 2017-11-22 Playtime 2h 19m Rec Positive Lovely well done and thought out indie title, If you haven't pick this one up
Date 2017-11-22 Playtime 6h 42m Rec Positive Amazing homage to Metroid.
Date 2017-11-22 Playtime 38h 30m Rec Positive If you ever wished to play another Metroid game from the 16-bit era, then this is the game to fill that void.
Date 2017-11-22 Playtime 3h 40m Rec Positive Pure classic awesomeness.  Thomas Happ is genious, thanks for this gem.
Date 2017-11-22 Playtime 10h 49m Rec Positive Что-то с чем-то! просто восхитительно, хоть местами пердак подгорал знатно так)
Date 2017-11-22 Playtime 8h 24m Rec Positive 太超级银河战士了，有点过了
Date 2017-11-22 Playtime 7h 17m Rec Negative The bee boss is fucking stupid. The rest that I played was great. The bee boss ruined it. Completely. Not challenging, just rage-quit shitty game design, with terrible patterning and telegraphing
Date 2017-11-21 Playtime 11h 26m Rec Positive What's not to like?  Lots of collectable weapons and power ups, backtracking that's not a chore, bosses that aren't souls-like and take 50 tries to beat.  This game was a ton of fun.
Date 2017-11-19 Playtime 20h 50m Rec Positive This game was awesome. Imagine metroid with a story on steroids.
Date 2017-11-19 Playtime 12h 12m Rec Positive Esse jogo me fez voltar aos tempos de criança, meu lembrou muito de Super Mario World, Sonic e Megaman. Se você curte pixel art, posso adiantar para você que está perfeito nesse quesito. A jogabilidade está muito polida, tem horas que eu comecei a me apressar pensando que eu iria perder algo importante na vida real, é estranho explicar isso, o jogo realmente te da uma impressão de intensidade em certos momentos, realmente uma obra prima.  Achei poucos bugs durante as 12 horas de jogo que tive para zerar / virar a primeira vez, contudo, vale muito a pena comprar o jogo, pois são bugs muito secundários e quase imperceptiveis.  Se você é da nova geração e não gosta de jogos com graficos "ruins", a unica coisa que tenho para falar é que a história do jogo te faz continuar como se fosse uma trama muito bem desenvolvida, um misterio a ser solucionado, ou seja, a história do jogo está muito complexa e bem polida, além de ser única.  O meu único pesar durante a jogatina foi ter virado / zerado o jogo e descoberto o fim da história. (quase chorei por causa disso :sadface: )  Enfim o jogo está magnífico, aconselho a comprar apenas as pessoas com uma personalidade mais intelectual.
Date 2017-11-19 Playtime 15h 39m Rec Positive This game is awesome. I did enjoy the 16 hours trying to find all objects and weapons. The boss are not that hard when you find the way to kill them. The retro look and the music is great. I'm just sad that its allready finished. I can't wait for the developper to release a new game.
Date 2017-11-17 Playtime 103h 43m Rec Negative 二代的PC版是EPIC独占！
Date 2017-11-15 Playtime 29h 4m Rec Positive Amazing game. If you loved Super Metroid, then this is for you
Date 2017-11-15 Playtime 21h 14m Rec Positive omgthisgameisamazingwhydidInotbuyitsooner?!?!?!?!?!??!!?!  *Ahem* This game is seriously amazing. If you liked Metroid, Super Metroid, and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, then you will love this game. The music is intense, the story is deep without trying too hard, and the bosses are all unique. Your first any-percent run will take you around 15 hours to complete, and you will get stuck at times, but as you learn the game, it gets easier.
Date 2017-11-14 Playtime 24h 57m Rec Positive Great game. Just finished on normal level. Most of the bosses are easy in my opinion. THere are a few bosses that can be tricky, one in particular is the bee like boss. He was difficult and pretty sure I died about 15 times before I realized how to kill him. So many extras for this game its insane. The Secret World sections are amazing, but you have to drill in almost every damn spot just to find it...really? I recommond this game for anyone who enjoys nostalgic games...very similiar to Metroid.
Date 2017-11-12 Playtime 98h 28m Rec Positive An excellent platformer, with a nice story, keeps giving you new weapons and abilities so that the gameplay doesn't get repetitive, and there are plenty of times that you find out something new and go "wow, look at that, that is realy clever!". Definitely recommended, I fully enjoyed it!!!
Date 2017-11-12 Playtime 12h 34m Rec Positive I am happy to be able to play Axiom Verge. And I am sad to complete it.   This is a game close to heart by Tom Happ, the sole developer of game, including everything, the code, the pixel art, the music, the story. And as the player, I appreciate and enjoy it dearly. Axiom Verge is a joy to ride.  I will not go into the cons and pros. Though, assuming the developer reads the reviews, my humble opinion is that the combat sometimes feels like "background obstacle" of the game. Along with an improved AI, a more thrilling and focused combat system would be superb.
Date 2017-11-12 Playtime 46h 17m Rec Positive "Long live the new flesh."
Date 2017-11-12 Playtime 13h 45m Rec Positive メトロイドが好きな方はとても楽しい作品です。時間をかけてススムことがとても楽しい時間になるでしょう。
Date 2017-11-11 Playtime 45h 16m Rec Positive Nunca había jugado un Metroidvania que capturara mejor la escencia del género. La jugabilidad, el soundtrack, el mundo y las mecánicas se sienten sacadas directamente del corazón del género, es como si hubieran cancelado Super Metroid y tuvieran que empezar un juego similar desde el inicio, mantiene el mismo nivel de calidad y el mapa siempre esta conectado. Los jefes son muy vistosos gracias al excelente estilo de arte y son bastante desafiantes , pero sin llegar al punto de frustración por como está estructurado el juego, ya que no hay vidas, simplemente reapareces en tu última sala de guardado y vas contra el jefe otra vez. Se lo recomiendo a cualquier fan del género o a alguien que no los haya probado antes y que le guste un buen desafío a la mente y a los dedos.
Date 2017-11-10 Playtime 13h 58m Rec Positive Great platformer, 8/10  PROS: -Very attractive 16bit-esque graphics -Engaging story / moderately thought provoking -Bosses are interesting and fun to fight-- but a little on the easy side.  -Huge variety of weapons, decent variety of other power ups  CONS: --A little unclear where to go at times, and how to get there... Plenty of: "well, just got this new movement tool, so now I should wander around and see where I can use it, and hopefully Ill find the place Im supposed to be or a cool new item.  -Somewhat short, beatable with a high completion percentage in about 12 hours.  -The movement tools you gain dont lead to cool combos and interesting platforming...hooking up somewhere and then shifting though walls isnt as interesting as a hook, then dashing or something like that. Complex platforming just isnt a focus here-- compared to a game like Environmental Station Alpha. The phase ability, then phase part 2, are kind of boring, and having it be 2 items... idk. The hook is also kind of cumbersome to use. -Some weapons make others basically obsolete. I ended up only using about 3-4 weapons on and off all game... out of... 10? I like the variety... but maybe a few less would have been okay. Maybe part of this is also that some of the weapons are hidden... and finding an early game weapon late game just gives me a sub-par new option which Ill never use, kind of dissapointing. Perhaps the early weapons should be easier to find or broadcasted a little more?
Date 2017-11-09 Playtime 19h 41m Rec Positive Not just a solid metroidvania in many respects but has a genuinely inspired sci-fi story and worldbuilding with some very unique tools. Maybe my favorite "traditional" metroidvania on PC
Date 2017-11-08 Playtime 12h 21m Rec Positive 没玩过银河战士的我就玩这个感受感受吧
Date 2017-11-07 Playtime 22h 0m Rec Positive Uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado
Date 2017-11-06 Playtime 20h 12m Rec Positive An amazing game with a great soundtrack. Lots of weapons and items to pick up and use against a large amount of enemies. Interesting story with a lot to go back and discover. Also, if you do pick this up, jump in every save room to discover the top part for the map. Just do it.
Date 2017-11-06 Playtime 0h 35m Rec Negative I love the style of this game, but it is bad Gamedesign at its finest  TL;DR: The game shows no sign of game-design, it is a sidescroll shooter with obnoxious gating, end.  I cant understand the praise, played it for 30 minutes, after aquiring the drill i had to stop due to massive recurring gamedesign-facepalms:  killing enemies is boring and tedious: - the snails are nothing more than a destructible environmental hazard - the blue flies are just a swarm that engages you from uncomfortable angles, this is bad combat-design - the hives is an annoying dmg sponges that are unable to hurt you if you dont get close - the first boss is a bad joke with uninspired dialogue  After the first boss you aquire the drill and you need to use it in order to get out of the room, here is how "drilling" is introduced: - Holding the Right-Trigger extends 4 slow rotating arms from your gun - This is the drill, but it really doesnt convey the feeling of drilling - to drill down (and you need to drill down after the boss, otherwise u are trapped) u need to: -- duck -- hold lb to lock you in position -- press diagonally down (not down, it needs to be diagonally) -- now the block below you will decay slowly by your drilling - drilling takes about 3-6s per block, maybe it is tied to dmg or smth, idk - you have to drill through 20 or so blocks, do the math  I suspect that the rest of the game as retarded so i will refund it now.  EDIT After watching a gameplay video i noticed that i never got to see the "real drill", mine was bugged or smth, i only saw the rotationg arms but not the blue laser cone.  - If this is a bug: i used xbox one elite controller on win 10 with dongle (with full range trigger) - If this is an error on my part (maybe i needed to equip something) then the game failed to convey that to me and left me with this broken drill that did the job but was slow as shit
Date 2017-11-05 Playtime 17h 32m Rec Positive Just finished playing it and it's a great Metroid style game!
Date 2017-11-05 Playtime 10h 52m Rec Positive Greatest game which I ever played
Date 2017-11-05 Playtime 13h 16m Rec Positive this game is too cool for school. that's how you know it's a true game for hackers. it's really fun. nothing short of amazing for a game made almost entirely by one person, though it has some inevitable lopsided design here and there that you might anticipate from such a thing. but really a game's amount of imperfections are secondary and often not necessarily related to just how fun the game is, and axiom verge is a lot of fun. the metroid comparisons are on-point, and aesthetically the game is far too indebted to that series for my tastes, but it does make some attempts to distinguish itself. for starters, it has this glitch theme going on throughout the entire game both mechanically and visually, but it often feels like an overlay to the overwhelming Alien/metroid esque art design. there's a focus on the joy of blasting more than range of mobility unlike metroid, and while this doesn't make for a crazily acrobatic platforming game it's incredibly satisfying to play with the game's huge amount of weapons. they're not even close to balanced, but the game is just hard enough and just forgiving enough that you'll feel inspired to experiment with your "toys" so the game finds a happy medium between situational use and enough room to allow you to stick your personal favorites. the drone mechanic was a really cute idea, and the obstacle courses designed around it are even cuter. the clever movements you can make with the combination of dashing and drone shooting make exploring for secrets always satisfying even when the methodology to find them gets repetitive. the power ups also feel substantial. while this isn't a very difficult game in my opinion, the difficulty on normal sits just right to make your power ups feel like a nice boon rather than something that just feels nice to get. that's a leg it has up on some metroids, where getting power ups feels good but their helpfulness isn't always tangible if an area's difficulty is too low. also the projectile size increasing power ups are a really cool idea. you get a constant visual representation of how much stronger you've become rather than values being changed under the hood. i'm getting tired of writing this, but really axiom verge is just pure action game fun. if you like blasting, you'll be satisfied. if you like filling out maps and getting items, you'll be satisfied. you can just get into the zone and have a good time. the story is too ambitious for this format and it failed to ever make me care about the amount of hidden lore to the world, but despite this the designer doesn't force so much story on you that it's ever a distraction. so it's no flaw. tom happ is clearly a passionate gamer and designer, and the sales of axiom verge have helped him with real life struggles like his child's severe health issues (look it up, it's too important for my stupid steam review). so if you're on the fence about this purchase know two things, you will almost certainly enjoy it enough, and you'll be helping out the kind of guy that the industry thrives on.
Date 2017-11-04 Playtime 18h 42m Rec Positive If you're an oldtimer like me and loved the Metroid for NES and SNES, this one will be right up your alley.
Date 2017-11-04 Playtime 9h 41m Rec Positive Ineludible no describir este juego mencionando a Metroid. Si hasta le hace un homenaje con el código Justin Bailey. Así, es un juego de acción-exploración con mapa en el que vas consiguiendo habilidades y otros power-ups, algunas muy originales que nunca he visto en otro juego. Las acciones básicas son saltar y disparar pero a eso hay que añadir las mencionadas habilidades y las más de 20 armas para adaptarse a cualquier estilo de juego. La ambientación de ciencia ficción es estupenda, gráficamente hecho para nostálgicos. Argumentalmente cumple bastante bien, aunque tiene un poco de narrración fragmentada por culpa de los coleccionables con texto. Pasárselo sin el 100% lleva unas 10 horas y se hace más o menos sencillo. Hacer el 100% es otro tema y hay que recurrir a guía, haciendo un total de unas 15 horas (no sé por qué Steam no me detecta mis 16 horas totales). En mi partida en normal, me resultó más dificil avanzar sabiendo qué habilidad usar que los jefes finales. Como punto negativo, en algunos puntos se hace confuso avanzar y el backtracking limpiando mapas puede resultar tedioso. Aún así, es un juego totalmente recomendado
Date 2017-11-04 Playtime 9h 50m Rec Positive メトロイド。クリア。 個人的にはmomodoraのほうが好き。 探索は楽しかったけど、どこ行けばよいかわからなくなる割に、 マップワープがないので移動に時間がかかる。 またストーリーがイマイチ。   買い
Date 2017-11-03 Playtime 7h 54m Rec Positive Where do I begin, I picked this up on a whim since it was mentioned in a video as a sponser on Chrono.gg, and this game is amazing!  Great game design, paced very well and I suprisingly only got lost once in the game which is amazing for metroidvania games like Metroid and CSotN. What in my opinion makes the game design top notch is that you feel like your backtracking and exploration makes the game easier and it also feels like it has more meaning, where all of your guns and abilities (excluding like 1 gun), has a use and makes bosses so much easier.  Speaking of bosses, I loved the bosses in the game since they were designed in a way that if you use your head you can dodge everything. They are designed perfectly except one of them which I found really annoying and tediously. The music also changes during the boss battles and is amazing along with just throught the game.   The artstyle is great as well, having a very trippy artstyle and it fits the story very well, making me want to actually get immersed in the world. Different colors and art directions everywhere which I liked, besides one area which I hated due to my inability to use one of the abilities.   Story is also amazing, having you wondering throught the game and also making you feel kind of sick at some parts (in a good way), giving you a good conclusion along with some build up for more.   I would reccomend this game at full price including the soundtrack and I would happily buy it again on the PS4 when I am craving the game, thank you Tom Happ for putting your heart and soul into this game!
Date 2017-11-03 Playtime 3h 23m Rec Positive This game is fantastic in just about every capacity
Date 2017-11-03 Playtime 18h 7m Rec Positive Awesome game and satisfyingly challenging in spots. It's more complex than most Metroid clones and it's possible to beat the game without seeing some of the best secrets it has to offer.
Date 2017-11-03 Playtime 10h 47m Rec Positive This Game is often reffered to as a Metroid on Steroids, but this doesn't do it justice.  Not only does it play on the theme of 8bit Games, by makig the old NES-Glitches a Game relevant feature, it also has one of the deepest and creepiest atmospheres I have ever Witnessed in a 2D Game.  If you haven't played metroid on SNES or it's predecessors, and you want to know what it felt like: Buy this game. It really conveys the feel of a Time where Games have graphically let you fill in all things missing with you imagination, but with a modern Gameplay and Graphics, as close to the original as you can get without sacrificing the beaty of todays effects,  If you did play and liked the old Metroid Games: This is a must!  That it is made by one Person including the phenomenal soundtrack is that much more impressive. There are a lot of secrets to explore and a great story to uncover.  I highly reccommend this game for True-Believers and New-comers alike, that want to be drawn into thick atmosphere and like to explore alien places inside and out.
Date 2017-11-01 Playtime 6h 18m Rec Positive Made with soul. Sound is like a honey for ears from retro consoles. Only for oldfags (=
Date 2017-11-01 Playtime 17h 10m Rec Positive If you have been craving something to sate the appetite Super Metroid left you with... this game is for you.  This is the best indie metroidvania game to date, complete with upgrades, secrets, boss fights, lore, a great soundtrack, and hours of fun and challenging gameplay.  It is no Super Metroid, but it gets the job done.  Simply Incredible!
Date 2017-11-01 Playtime 34h 53m Rec Positive Perfeito. Pra pessoas que curtem o estilo Metroidvania esse jogo é obrigatorio. Ótima trilha sonora, graficos retro lindissimos, e historia com altos PLOT TWIST. Virou um dos meu jogos favoritos xD
Date 2017-10-31 Playtime 12h 40m Rec Positive 勉强可以
Date 2017-10-30 Playtime 104h 48m Rec Positive One of the coolest Super Metroid successors. Good gameplay, good music, good dialogs and style, good secrets and ofc powers. Strongly recommend.  PS: works perfectly for Linux.
Date 2017-10-29 Playtime 11h 29m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is Thomas Happ's love story to metroid. Overall I was impressed with the art style and the world. The art style really reminded me alot of the biomechancal art of HR Giger. The story itself was unique and interesting enough to keep me intrigue. Gameplay wise it's your classic metroidvania style game where you collect powerups to find where to proceed to next. The soundtrack fits very well with the atmosphere the game is making and keeps to the retro feel  The things I didn't really care for was the double tap mechanics for one of the moves, It just didn't feel right and made certain jumps feel awkward and i would of prefered to have the ability on a hot key or something. The other issue I had with the game was while there was tons of weapons you could pick up and use I found myself only really caring to use 3-4 of them and the others just sit on the wayside. Honestly I think there was too many weapons, and would of probably preferred a system where the weapons upgraded and changed as you progressed or had more powerful versions.   Overall though I would highly recommend Axiom Verge to anyone who enjoys metroidvania and is looking to kill a few hours.  
Date 2017-10-29 Playtime 6h 12m Rec Positive 숨겨진 수작  꼭 할인을 확인하고 사길 바란다  메트로베니아 게임에서 RPG 요소를 뺀 액션과 퍼즐로 채워진 게임  1인 개발이라는 얘길 들었을때 제작자가 외계인인 줄 알았다  그만큼 도트퀄리티와 사운드 퀄리티가 상당하다
Date 2017-10-27 Playtime 12h 2m Rec Positive feels like metroid 10/10
Date 2017-10-25 Playtime 25h 25m Rec Positive Masterpiece 10/10
Date 2017-10-25 Playtime 19h 12m Rec Positive This is a fantastic old-school Metroidvania.  The character designs are interesting and creepy, the level designs have some pretty cool use of pixel art (although it could use a more cohesive feel for the various sections), the upgrades are interesting (although too many of the weapons are kind of boring), and the story is decent.  It certainly isn't perfect, but it was absolutely worth playing.
Date 2017-10-23 Playtime 11h 51m Rec Positive Overall it's a decent game.  Good soundtrack, gameplay is fine.  The only issue I have with it is that it gets a little repetitive at times and it's hard to navigate, especially after the map expands.  But, if you like metroidvania style games, you will not regret giving this one a try.
Date 2017-10-23 Playtime 9h 42m Rec Positive Great metroidvania game. Really interesting world and abilities.
Date 2017-10-22 Playtime 12h 18m Rec Positive Nice game, really captures that feeling of "alienness" from the old Metroids.
Date 2017-10-22 Playtime 18h 16m Rec Positive This game is amazing. Well thought out plot. Great gameplay. It also does the "teach with level design" thing. The soundtrack is one of my favorites, especially "Trace Rising" and "Cellular Skies". If I had to give a few criticisms, it would have to be some of the bosses. Some are great, don't get me wrong. It's just a good 4 or 5 suck ass. The final boss, [spoiler]Athetos, is awful. He's a spam fest with no unique theme. [/spoiler]The game is amazing despite these flaws. A must play.
Date 2017-10-21 Playtime 17h 18m Rec Positive Kaum zu glauben das EINE einzige Person dieses Monster erschaffen hat.  Sowohl im Umfang als auch in Leveldesign und Gameplay-qualität reicht Axiom Verge an Super Metroid heran.  Was die Story angeht hat das Spiel sogar die Nase vorn. Alle Elemente (besonders die Waffen) machen Spaß und sind fordernd. Wie auch im Vorbild muß man als Spieler Findigkeit und manchmal Hartnäckigkeit beweisen.   Einige Bossgegner wirken im Vergleich zum "Original" weniger gut umgesetzt (es gibt z.B. nicht mehrere Kampf-Phasen). Die Musik ist gut, müßte aber, um die Qualität des übrigen Spiels zu erreichen, "genial" sein.  Ich bin schwer beeindruckt. Für Genrefans ist Axiom Verge Pflicht.
Date 2017-10-21 Playtime 17h 13m Rec Positive Metroid homages aside the game is quite fun with an appropriate difficulty and power scale. The soundtrack is oh so tasty and the art is solid
Date 2017-10-20 Playtime 34h 31m Rec Positive If you like Metroidvania games, you should own this.
Date 2017-10-20 Playtime 16h 1m Rec Positive Pros: -Controls were tight. Movement felt really fast/fluid with all the late game items. -Overall I though the music was pretty enjoyable.   -Story was cryptic and interesting.  The world the game created made me want to know more(in a good way). -Art was pretty solid.  Didn't care for the sprite of the main character until he got some more gear.  Cons: -#1 biggest things that bothered me is that there is one puzzle that I got totally stuck on and ran around trying to figure it out for an hour or two.  Ended up looking it up, and a lot of other people got stuck there as well.   -Sound/Music all had a harsh edge to it which I found really grating over time. Every session I would start with the volume at an average level and I would slowly turn it down bit by bit over the hours. -Way too many generic trash enemies.  Was annoying to traverse with them in the way. Would have greatly preffered less enemies with more interesting/difficult patterns -Bosses were too easy(played the game on hard).  Patterns were simple, rarely felt satisfying.  Overall rating: 6/10 - Fun game but didn't have anything particularly special about it in the end. Worth picking up on sale if you like Metroidvania games.
Date 2017-10-20 Playtime 10h 3m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a decent Metroid clone and while it's not the best one one Steam (I kind of like Dust an Elysian Tale a bit better) it is a good game. With an intresting story, plenty of weapons, and a diffrent take on ways too get through obstacles Axiom Verge is defintley worth checking out. https://youtu.be/g6ZX4_ox3hk
Date 2017-10-19 Playtime 16h 38m Rec Positive Un très bon Metroid-like que j'ai découvert par l'emission speedgame, je me suis bien amusé dessus. Difficulté présente, visuel et son très bons, histoire assez sympa en cohérence avec l'univers du jeu. Je recommande fortement.
Date 2017-10-19 Playtime 19h 51m Rec Positive Great modern day metroidvania. One guy made this entire game. 10/9
Date 2017-10-19 Playtime 18h 25m Rec Positive This is a well-done metroid clone. The creator was clearly familiar with the nuances that make metroid work in terms of exploration, mechanics, and atmosphere. The music in particular is nice. Proabably the closest thing to an actual metroid game available on steam, though it does lack some polish.  Exploration is slowed down by an abundance of upgrades that can open up paths to secrets. To a certain extent this is fun. Unfortunately, the graphic design of the levels is a little too obtuse,  There are frequently, but not always, visual clues that lead to these secrets. For every visual clue that leads to something their are dozens of surfaces with color patterns that warrant scrutiny but lead to nothing.  If you aim to be thorough, you'll probably want to attempt to drill, morph, and teleport through every surface in the game, including surfaces requiring trick jumps to reach.  To what extent this mirrors the merits (or flaws) of the earlier metroid games is probably up to the preferences of each player. It is nice that you can leave markers on the map if you notice something you think you might forget about later, but only two active markers per zone.    That's the thrust of it, there are other small details that are probably more interesting to stumble across in game than read about at length in advance.   
Date 2017-10-18 Playtime 10h 51m Rec Positive I've played a couple of metroidvania games like Ori and Guacamelee but this game has made me understand why people like the genre so much.
Date 2017-10-17 Playtime 20h 7m Rec Positive p good  gotta be my favorite super metroid DLC
Date 2017-10-17 Playtime 5h 1m Rec Positive Deservers your time and you money. Amazing game, beautifully crafted. Great mechanics and respect to what made Metroid what it was.
Date 2017-10-16 Playtime 4h 20m Rec Negative A object lesson in why universal acclaim doesn't  mean universally accessable.   I bought the game because of great word of mouth and good reviews.  I found that I kept losing intrest after about an hr of play.  I found the exploration and mechanics to become tedious. I guess it's too metroid  and not enough vania for me as I love Castlevania games but never really liked Metroid games. I've enjoyed newer takes on the metroidvania formula like Guacamelee but Axiom Verge just seemed too much like Super Metroid.
Date 2017-10-15 Playtime 19h 39m Rec Positive 游戏非常好的还原了银河战士的游戏风格，不论是游戏中多样化的枪械，还是大场景跨度的的解密，都非常好的还原了银河战士的节奏和手感。同时作品中也有像银河战士中的变球和无限跳那样机制简单，但使用方法非常多样的特殊能力。也算是弥补了PC平台没有银河战士作品的遗憾
Date 2017-10-15 Playtime 18h 3m Rec Positive [h1]Review zu Axiom Verge[/h1]  Axiom Verge hat es geschafft meine Meinung über das Spiel komplett zu verändern. In den ersten zwei Spielstunden habe ich das Spiel gehasst! Ich bin dauernd gestorben und bin immer wieder zum Spawnei zurückgekehrt. Dann hat es bei mir Klick gemacht. Ich spielte das Spiel falsch. Man macht sich das Spiel deutlich leichter, wenn man alle Gegner langsam tötet und diese austrickst. Selbst manche Bosse kann man austricksen. Nachdem ich diese Einsicht hatte hat mir das Spiel plötzlich viel mehr Spaß gemacht. An sich finde ich es jedoch nicht so toll, dass ich gezwungen wurde einen gewissen Spielstil zu nehmen, da ich finde, dass der Spieler stets die Freiheit haben sollte, wie er zu spielen hat. Viele meinen, dass der Grafikstil hässlich sei. Ich persönlich habe die Schönheit in diesen Pixeln gefunden und manche technologischen Dinge, wie die großen Roboter (die haben auch einen Namen, nur fällt er mir gerade nicht ein) sehen aus als hätte H.R. Giger, also der Alienerfinder daran mitgezeichnet. Wenn sich Thomas Happ nicht daran orientiert hatte, wo sonst frage ich mich. Jedoch sollte man auch die Schwächen des Spiels nicht vergessen. Faszinierenderweise treten die eher am Ende des Spiels auf. Mit der Steuerung habe ich mich mit dem Gamepad zurecht gefunden, nur ist das teleportieren dermaßen umständlich... unglaublich so etwas. Um zu teleportieren muss man den linken Stick auf dem Xbox 360 Controller zweimal in dieselbe Richtung bewegen. Dies funktioniert auch mit dem Steuerkreuz, nur diejenigen die den 360 Controller kennen, wissen, dass das leichter gesagt als getan ist. Der 360 Controller und dessen Steuerkreuz sind nun mal nicht so präzise. Eine Tatsache, welche Thomas Happ wohl vergessen hatte. Jedenfalls am Ende des Spiels muss man Bosse und auch den Endgegner mit der Teleportationsfähigkeit besiegen. Zumindest ist es dann einfacher. Und das ist eine derartige Fingerübung gepaart mit einer unpräzisen Steuerung sind dann einfach nicht mehr schön. Ich musste für einen Boss sogar kurzzeitig mit der Tastatur spielen um ihn endlich besiegen zu können! Des Weiteren ist die Orientierungslosigkeit in Axiom Verge dermaßen übertrieben... Klar, das ist nun mal der Sinn in einem Metroidvania. Um sich dort zu verlaufen. Nur wäre es - meiner Meinung nach - besser gewesen man hätte wenigstens kurz erwähnt wo man hin müsste. Also per Textform während einer Diskussion zwischen Charakteren. Es muss ja nicht gleich der spezifische Raum sein wo ich hin muss. Mir hätte das Areal schon gereicht. Wäre dann bei weitem besser gewesen. Schließlich waren die besten Momente des Spiels bei denen ich wusste wo ich hin musste. Dieses Gefühl nach Stunden der Orientierungslosigkeit endlich den weiterführenden Weg gefunden zu haben ist so erfüllend. Ich sags euch! Nur ist das einfach echt umständlich wenn man von Areal zu Areal läuft, ohne Schnellreise, außer vielleicht dem Kopf in "Indi", welcher eher noch einer Schnellreise gleicht, und ohne Möglichkeit schneller zu sein. Klar, man hat das Teleportieren, nur ist dieses dann wieder so umständlich, dass man lieber läuft.  Kommen wir für die Schnellen unter uns einfach mal zur Pro-Contra-Liste:  [u][b]Pro:[/b][/u]  + Grafikstil ist zwar recht trist, sieht aber dennoch recht gut aus. Es ist allerdings schon einmal in einem Areal vorgekommen, dass alles aufgrund des Grafikstils unübersichtlich war. (Shopseite 4. Screenshot von rechts) + Soundtrack ist recht gut. Dieser wechselt auch von Areal zu Areal. Insofern etwas schade, da in "Indi", einem Areal, keinerlei Musik gespielt wird und diese auch oft durchquert werden muss um zwischen den Arealen hin- und herzureisen. Bei manchen Tracks innerhalb eines Areals könnte man auch glatt denken, dass Daft Punk selbst beim Soundtrack geholfen hat! + Sollte man wenig Leben haben, so piepst es dauerhaft. Man glaubt es kaum, aber dieses Piepen passt oft zum Soundtrack! Fördert schon fast mit wenig Leben durch die Welt zu schlendern nur um die Musik noch besser genießen zu können! Jedoch ist dies nur in manchen Arealen der Fall. In "Indi" (Ja, ich hasse dieses Areal, nicht weil es schwer ist, es ist nur furchtbar langweilig) piepst es einfach nur nervig bis man sich wieder geheilt hat. + Bosse sowie normale Gegner kann man austricksen durch die Umgebung + Viele verschiedene Waffen und Fähigkeiten. Es sollte eigentlich jeder seine Lieblingswaffe finden. + Die Fähigkeit Gegner zu hacken, oder umzucodieren ist genial! Manche Gegner stoßen statt giftige Gase, dann Lebenspunkte für dich aus! + Der Abspann war witzig und einfallsreich.  [u][b]Contra:[/b][/u]  - Spawnanimation ist zu lang. Ich persönlich bin jemand der nach einem Tod sofort es wieder probieren möchte. Nur ist dieses angespannte warten vor dem Bildschirm, während sich erstmal langsam das Spawnei öffnet einfach nur dermaßen ärgerlich. - Normalerweise bin ich ein Fan von Orientierungslosigkeit und Selbstfindung seitens des Spielers, nur hat dies in Axiom Verge keinerlei Spaß gemacht. Man rennt von Areal zu Areal um mit seiner neuen Fähigkeit hoffentlich eine Tür aufzubekommen. Meiner Meinung nach ist es etwas zu extrem geworden. - Zum Schießen muss man den X-Knopf auf dem Gamepad mehrmals drücken. Dies macht erstens keinerlei Spaß die ganze Zeit einen Knopf zu drücken und zweitens schmerzt irgendwann mein Daumen. Glücklicherweise ist dies nicht bei allen Waffen so. Wenn man jedoch manche dieser Waffen nicht gefunden hat, da diese nämlich nicht Pflicht sind um das Spiel zu beenden, hat man halt echt Pech und Daumenschmerzen... - Es ist mir unerklärlich wann ein Gegner Lebenspunkte droppt und wann nicht. Es scheint willkührlich zu sein. Insofern idiotisch, da manche Gegner deutlich mehr Schaden machen, während manche mich überhaupt nicht aktiv angreifen oder verfolgen, während die starken Gegner dies tun und keinerlei Lebenspunkte droppen. Manchmal kommt es auch vor, dass man die Lebenspunkte erst gar nicht erreichen kann. Bei manchen Bossarenen war dies der Fall, oder auch bei diversen fliegenden normalen Gegnern. - Gegner spawnen oft gleich nach dem Verlassen des Raumes wieder. Sehr, sehr, sehr nervig während man mit Backtracking beschäftigt ist! - Das Spielmännlein sammelt auch gedroppte Lebenszellen ein, selbst wenn die Lebensanzeige komplett gefüllt ist. Das Daliegen der Lebenspunkte und die spätere Verwendung dieser ist also nicht möglich, wenn man diese zuvor aus Versehen einsammelt. [spoiler]- Der Spieler selbst kann nicht entscheiden, ob er Athetos leben lassen möchte, oder nicht. Nein, Trace beleidigt ihn erstmal als Trottel und fängt an zu kämpfen...[/spoiler]  [u][b]Prontra:[/b][/u]  +- Die Story ist etwas, nun ja, uninteressant, aber wenigstens hat Athetos ein nachvollziehbares Motiv. +- Backtracking macht einerseits Spaß, da man dann die vorher beschrittenen Wege mit neuen Augen sieht, dank der neuen Fähigkeiten, nur gibt es komplette Passagen, welche auf dem Weg zur "Fähigkeitsnutzstelle" einfach nur langweilig sind. +- Eine deutsche Übersetzung ist zwar vorhanden, nur ist diese stellenweise bei Dialogen und bei einigen zu findenden Notizen fehlerhaft.  Axiom Verge ist eines dieser Spiele, bei denen ich empfehle sie einmal gespielt zu haben und danach nie wieder. Sehr schade eigentlich. Ich verstehe nicht wie Thomas Happ diese Mängel einfach komplett übersehen hat. Dennoch empfehle ich dieses Spiel. Selbst für den Vollpreis ist das Spiel sogar zu empfehlen. 17,99€ scheint ein fairer Preis zu sein. Zuletzt möchte ich noch erwähnen, dass ich ursprünglich etwas anderes vom Spiel erwartet hatte. Ich hab mich eher auf einen Shoot ´em up eingestellt und stattdessen Daumenschmerzen erhalten. Danke dafür!  Ich danke fürs Lesen und wünsche sehr viel Spaß beim Spielen! ;-)  http://store.steampowered.com/app/332200/Axiom_Verge/

Check out our Forum here.[/url]  [h1]Full Review[/h1] Axiom Verge gets a lot of comparison to Super Metroid. I'm not sure that's entirely fair. Yes, it's a Metroidvania, and yes, there are a ton of similarities. But I think the things that make it different are pretty vast.  I think the one thing that surprised me the most is the story presentation. It's a pretty typical sci-fi where a lot of philosophical questions are asked about ethical situations that would arise from advanced technology, but I think Axiom Verge proves that the Metroidvania format is a great way to tell that kind of story. You can explore post-disaster aftermath and learn from the environment details what might have happened. This makes it fun to theorize about anything the story doesn't tell you blatantly, but even if you're completely blind to these things the story told through dialog and cutscenes is quite interesting - at least it was to me. I don't think it's quite as masterful at the environment-based story telling as a few other games, but I think it still does it well.  The graphical presentation may be one of the weaknesses that keeps it from being on top with the likes of Dark Souls and Hollow Knight in this regard. At points the art is beautiful and I was awed by it. Other times it's only the chipset tiles the likes of which you might have seen in the original NES Metroid. Occasionally the color pallet causes the background to mesh with the foreground, but it wasn't common enough to make it a major complaint.  Where there are no flaws though is the music. It's perfect. It captures that feeling of disturbing loneliness that Metroid 2 and Super Metroid had. Sometimes it's upbeat techno, but at appropriate times it gets dark and unnerving. It really hit home on the final stretch to the end of the game, sending chills down my spine for that last confrontation the game had been building up to.  For the most part, controlling the main character Trace feels good. It's maybe not the best sidescrolling shooter I've played, but there are a ton of weapons to play with and they all have infinite ammo. This is one of the things that sets it apart from its Metroidvania forefather (er.. foremother...brain?) I played the game on Hard Mode, so I drifted back to the first and third weapons you find for most of my playthrough simply because I favor burst damage as part of my playstyle. But I did give most of the weapons token usage as I came across particularly tricky enemy types to deal with.  A lot of enemies - especially in the endgame - it seemed like the best strategy was to trick them into a corner and hit them while they couldn't reach me. The game has a signature mechanic that lets you change the nature of enemies though so there is a decent amount of strategy involved.  I think my biggest complaint about the gameplay and combat is the dashing mechanic you get later in the game. You control it by double tapping in specific directions and there doesn't seem to be a way to map this function to a button. I discovered that I apparently double tap a lot when I'm moving around, so I found myself accidentally crashing into enemies as a result. If you mastered this movement though you could theoretically dodge most of the attacks enemies can throw at you, making the combat a lot deeper than I had the skill to play it. But, I was always able to find a way around the need to dodge thanks to the arsenal I mentioned. Every boss has a "Trick" to them similar to Zelda bosses (though less dependent on found items.) I found basically all of them - and the combat in general - pretty fun as a result  (complaints about the end-game enemy strategies aside.)  What makes this game the most joy to play is how masterfully it uses the Metroidvania format. There isn't a ton of possible sequence breaking, and the game has a set path (You can't fight any of the bosses out of order - as far as I know.) But it's incredibly satisfying to explore around and find the many surprises this game has to offer. No hand-holding and interesting puzzles to solve to get to different areas made this game sweet enough that I could hardly put it down.  I definitely think this is among the best of the Metroidvanias that I've played.   4 out of 5.
Date 2017-10-14 Playtime 0h 25m Rec Positive Dare I say better than Metroid with an amazing sound track.  Totally worth it.
Date 2017-10-14 Playtime 28h 53m Rec Positive Will keep this short and sweet:  If you enjoy Metroidvania games to any degree, this is absolutely worth your time and money.
Date 2017-10-14 Playtime 8h 58m Rec Positive So I saw this game and I thought: "Huh. This looks like Super Metroid"  Then I booted it up and I clicked start and saw the map and the art and I was like: "Yeah this looks like Metroid"  Then I played the game and I said: "Wow, literally Metroid"  Yeah it's basically metroid, but I was glad to see that it was not a direct copy, since there were TONS of weapons to get as well as pleanty of interesting abilities which allow progression.  My only gripe is the grappling hook mechanic. Cant really be reworked in it's current state, so looks like it's gonna just be there as a blemish.
Date 2017-10-13 Playtime 6h 36m Rec Negative Grundsätzlich finde ich das Spiel ausgezeichnet, es vermittelt das gute alte Metroid Flare mit einen Hauch von Contra, sprich der "schmutzige" Grafikstil und genialen Bossen, nur der Endboss war für mich etwas enttäuschend.  Das ganze wird für mich persönlich aber überschattet durch das ständige Backtracking und wirklich langweilige Suchen von neuen Waffen und Upgrades. Mir ist klar, dass ist es was ein Metroidvania ausmacht. In dem Falle fühlte es sich für mich aber eher mehr nach Arbeit an, alsdass hier wirklich spass aufkam und genau diese Gefühl hatte ich bei den alten Metroid Teilen nicht.  Trotz der negativen Bewertung kann ich das Spiel jenen ans Herz legen, die über diesen Aspekt hinwegsehen können, was mir leider nicht gelang.
Date 2017-10-11 Playtime 15h 3m Rec Positive Loved the use of weapons and mechanics, giving the familiar "Metroidvania" gameplay a lot of fresh variety. The story was surprisingly interesting [spoiler]although I wonder if I got a bad ending, as the conclusion was a bit disappointing[/spoiler]. I played this because I was looking for a Metroid fix and was not disappointed.
Date 2017-10-11 Playtime 10h 43m Rec Positive It's a good game, but a difficult one. Spent a lot of time in the maze. Without a walkthrough I don't think I have the patience to finish the game... I spent more time in other platformers, but never felt that long like this...  I like the music and the graphic design. The story is sorta plain. Game mechanic is good. I can't see many differences between those weapons. The game became easier and more interesting after you got the drone.
Date 2017-10-10 Playtime 9h 50m Rec Positive Where to even start...
Date 2017-10-09 Playtime 17h 22m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvania out there 100% must have if You're fan of genre!
Date 2017-10-09 Playtime 19h 42m Rec Positive Axiom Verge - это metroidvania в ее классическом исполнении. Игровая карта достаточно большая, а количество секретов, как и вариаций устройств и оружия, зашкаливает. И это пожалуй главная положительная сторона игры.  Если не зацикливаться на секретах и стараться двигаться от одного устройства к другому, попутно убивая боссов, то темп прохождения будет достаточно быстрым и самое главное, принесет необходимое удовлетворение от преодоления препятствий, с которыми вы уже могли сталкиваться. Но я не могу сказать того же о полном прохождении, в котором вы досконально изучаете каждую выемку на стенах и поставили себе цель собрать в игре все.  И одна из причин этого - это враги. Их вариаций достаточно много и они никак не могут попасть под одно определение, но сама их функция скорее выполнена как небольшое препятствие, чем угроза для игрока. Тут преобладают многоплатформенные уровни с ползующими и летающими врагами, которые и под определение врага то не совсем подходят. Скорее они часть аномалии, сложившейся в результате перемен в этом измерении. Патрулируют, нанося урон при столкновении или находятся на месте, начиная стрелять при приближении игрока и этим самым выполняют больше защитную функцию. Кстати, стрейфового платформинга в игре почти нет. Т.е. минимум моментов, где вам нужно будет судорожно или хотя бы в пол силы прыгать, избегая вражеских снарядов и при этом остреливаться. И то, что враги не представляют серьезной угрозы для вас при первом знакомстве с ними, впоследствии, когда у вас уже будет гораздо больше здоровья и более лучшее оружие, сделает их препятствием наотмашь. Я собрал только 70% предметов, но полоса моего здоровья куда ранее этого так выросла, что я просто пробегал врагов, вяло перепрыгивая и отстреливаясь на раз-два. Помимо своей малой атакующей функции, они также не несут какой-либо пользы для игрока. Некоторые из них оставляют после себя здоровье, ну и что? Рядом с боссом всегда есть комната сохранения, полностью лечащая вас. С другой стороны нет и каких-либо приемов со своей шкалой заряда или того, что можно купить за золото, для того, чтобы убийство врагов было хоть сколько-то полезным для вас. Таким образом повторное прохождение уровней и столкновение с противниками быстро сделается рутиной, ведь быстрого перемещения по комнатам сохранений в разных игровых зонах нет и предстоит всегда ходить пешком. И много, очень много искать секреты.  Хотя во врагах все же есть кое-что хорошее, благодаря одной из фишек игры - кодированию обьектов, изменяющего их свойства, можно открывать доступ к некоторым секретам. Увы, но этот потенциал реализован лишь частично и играет больше второплановую роль т.к. препятствий с подобным видом решений попросту в игре мало. Это могло бы быть главной особенностью игры, благодаря которой был бы не отстрел слабеньких врагов, а умение обратить их в вашу пользу. Но нет, увы.   Я не могу почти ничего хорошего сказать и боссах. Они выглядят потрясающе и на скриншотах с игрой мгновенно обязывают к покупке, но с ними в целом такая же ситуация, как и со всеми живыми препятствиями. Их размер по отношению к игроку настолько велик, что их же мобильность при этом очень страдает. Несколько боссов просто неподвижны. Это делает схватку с ними гораздо менее напряженной, ведь если босс не перемещается, значит остается следить только за его выстрелами. По-моему так обстоит с 75% боссами. Один сделан так, что вообще не требует от вас какого-либо стрейфа. Еще один такой, что его невозможно пройти, не получая кучу урона, стреляя в него в малюсенькой комнате среди кучи его снарядов. Финальная схватка вообще курам насмех - она не содержит элементов платформинга, действие будет в один этап, а главным козырем игрока будет количество здоровья, при условии, что он достаточно нашел секретов. Меня напряг только один босс и это потому что способ его убийства неожиданно совершенно отличный от способа убийства остальных и догадаться до него совсем непросто. Ну что это такое, а? В Odallus, тоже достаточно свежей метроидвании, выполненной аналогично в духе старой школы, при схватке с всего одним первым боссом я получил куда больше напряжения, сложности и удовлетворения, чем во всей Axiom Verge.   Малая отдача от врагов и боссов, делает прохождение слишком спокойным по динамике и приобретает скорее медиативный характер вовсе. Что могло бы быть весомым плюсом, если бы не отсутствие быстрого перемещения, некоторые секреты с паролем и... звучащая музыка. Она отлично проработана, разнообразна в звучании и хорошо вписывается в сеттинг игры. Но эй, когда при прохождении всей игровой зоны звучит всего 1 трек, это быстро надоедает. Я уехал в гости, захватив с собой ноут с гораздо лучшим звуком, чем на моем игровом компьютере, и предвкушал, как буду наслаждаться музыкой в игре. Но на деле большую часть прохождения я либо убавлял на минимум, либо вообще выключал звук. Игровая зона состоит из множества комнат, в которых куча секретов. Когда тратишь час, или больше, обыскивая каждый метр в поиске заветного предмета, одна и та же игровая композиция звучит уже дотошно и приторно. И да, некоторые звуки слишком громкие и с перебором высоких частот, режут слух только так.  И все же со скидкой на то, что игру сделал всего один человек, это очень даже крепкая metroidvania. Ведь он даже нарисовал все и музыку сам сочинил! И выглядит и звучит это потрясающе. При этом, количество решений преодоления препятствий достаточно разнообразно, но не слишком велико и ауентетично происходящему. Вместо того, чтобы сваливать на вас 10 инструментов, вам дают вдвое меньше и улучшают их по мере прохождения, а также комбинируют. Внесет свою лепту при вашем прохождении и отлично обыгранный нетривиальный сюжет. Лично мне хотелось бы, чтобы ему уделили куда больше внимания, но есть, что есть. Какой вывод из всего этого можно сделать? Очень простой - нужно обьединяться с другими разработчиками. Чтобы вышла не просто хорошая игра, а шедевр, в котором по отдельности разные аспекты игры уже менее бы провисали. Аналогичная ситуация с Dust: an Elysium Tail. Но впрочем как и она, Axiom Verge все равно запомнится вам надолго и при отсутствии большой конкуренции в той же нише, наверняка западет вам в самое сердце.

Date 2017-10-09 Playtime 0h 45m Rec Positive I haven't really played much of the game, and it feels weird playing on keyboard (since I don't have a controller to use), but it shows promise. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as AM2R though, which sucked out my will to continue playing. Ultimately, I do recommend it though.
Date 2017-10-07 Playtime 33h 45m Rec Positive Лушая 2-D игра с крутым сюжетом.
Date 2017-10-06 Playtime 11h 25m Rec Negative I never really liked Super Metroid, never really got to play it when it came out, subsequently I never really gave a “chance” to other Metroid games for the same reason.  Guess that’s why I don’t like Axiom Verge.  I decided to give the game a second chance and actually try to finish it after the hour or so that I played in the past (a couple of months, maybe a couple of years ago) at the start, everything started “clicking” so to say, everything became comfortable, and enjoyable for me to play, the movement, the combat, the upgrades, even the complex, yet comprehensive traversal through a massive “maze-like” map.  I even enjoyed the fact that the game instead of having checkpoints, had a series of save points formed by “capsules” in which the protagonist could rest and refill it’s health.  This however didn’t last for more than a couple of hours until, maybe, halfway through the game things started becoming gradually more, and more tedious, and started being a bit more like what the early Super Metroid was like, and just like some of the “archaic” aspects of that game drew me far away from it, with Axiom Verge, they did the same.  For starters, the game becomes incredibly difficult as you keep playing along, at the start it’s difficult, but fair, balanced so to say, playing at the easiest difficulty available (that being “normal”) the game keeps changing simple core mechanics of some enemies, whilst from time to time, introducing new, and unique type of enemies as well.  Problem is eventually the game creates new and more difficult enemies that attack the player in the form of swarms that rush him (or her).  In other cases the game simply doesn’t offer nearly as frequent save points, making the constant “act” of dying a chore, a tedious activity that will keep making you repeat a certain given sequence plenty of times.  Then after a while the game simply becomes too “cryptic”, I had to look at plenty of guides while other times I just had to explore as much as possible, finding myself getting collectibles and upgrades, that really didn’t satisfy me in the least, given that I just wanted to keep progressing and discovering new areas.  At times some of them are hidden in sections that are incredibly further away from where you are, it goes beyond just finding the right path, at times it’s simply tedious to get to a particular area only to have to backtrack to the next.  With that being said, I think the main reason as to why people enjoy the game so much it’s specifically for the same reasons I dislike it, the game in itself it’s not bad, considering it was made by such a small team, it’s an incredible achievement.  But for me it was simply just such a jarring, frustrating, and tedious experience to play through, the more and more I progressed the more, and more it seemed to me as if the game was trying it’s hardest to become more difficult, and complex, up to a point where I simply didn’t have the will to continue playing it anymore, if I wasn’t such an obsessive, neurotic, I probably wouldn’t have finish it.  Some of the elements of it are fine, some of them are excellent, the music is great, nothing to special, to me at the very least, either way, it’s all relative.  The aesthetic it’s incredibly unique, dare I say, even beautiful at time, although quite a bit bizarre. It retains a massive amount of individuality nonetheless.  It’s a game that wanted to clearly pay an homage, or even be a direct sequel to the way not only Super Metroid was at the time, but also to the way videogames were at the time.  There’s secrets, upgrades, and heart put in here, I love it because of that, but sadly it also brings back a lot of the worse things, that I’ve come to dislike over the years about gaming as a medium from that time.  I guess if people have gotten this far into the “review” or the “critique” or whatever the hell this is…  Some of them might be asking, “Well what did you expect?”  And honestly, I think I expected a game that understood what was “good” from gaming before, brought it back, and mixed it up with some of the elements that current games have, and if not, at the very least a game that brought back what was good, even if it was through the idealization of whatever it was, while at the same time, it detracted a lot of the more frustrating, and tedious elements from the games it was trying to emulate, and if not, be inspired by.  Its a nice game, just not for everyone, a very niche type of game, I don’t regret it’s creation, I love the fact that other people enjoy it.  It’s just certainly not the game for me. 
Date 2017-10-06 Playtime 16h 50m Rec Positive Amazing, like bring back the old metroid/castlevania but with an original story. I have only just begun and can tell its going good places. Really nice to be transported to an imaganitive place like that, I keep thinking of how the movie/anime of this story would be like and imagining the main character in it. Hope you guys make a movie of this, also Risk of Rain.
Date 2017-10-05 Playtime 8h 11m Rec Positive If there's a lesson to be learned from Axiom Verge, it's that some days it just doesn't pay off to get involved with experiments in theoretical dimensional physics.  In all seriousness, Axiom Verge is a maze exploration game visually similar to Blaster Master and Metroid for the NES/Famicom, but with a higher focus on grotesque creatures, creepy atmosphere, and suspense, like Out of This World and Half-Life. Similarly, Axiom Verge casts us in the role of an otherwise regular dude scientist guy, Trace, who is flung abruptly to a strange and unfamilliar world after an experiment goes awry.  I personally liked the way that the overarching plot was revealed through a combination of exploratory discovery and linear narrative, in a rare triumph of  complex storytelling. Without spoiling any details, Trace is party to different components of the complete story than the player is at certain points during the game's run time. This makes the game feel like a journey that the player takes along with Trace, instead of just a story that happens as the player pilots him around, blasting weird monsters.  The run and gun game play is pretty good overall, with only a slight drawback in that getting used to some of the more unusual weapons can be a little confusing at first. Boss fights and normal enemies alike run by set, non-randomized behavior patterns, which means that with enough attempts it's possible to learn how to defeat any given room without being damaged.  Axiom Verge really shines in its exploration elements. New sections of the map are unlocked organically with the acquisition of movement enhancing power ups. Few, if any, new abilities are functionally just a "key" which removes a specific obstacle to progress, rather granting some kind of new jumping or teleporting power which the player is then encouraged to scour the environment for places inaccessible before. It's an extremely satisfying and, incidentally, exciting format.  There are only two real shortcomings to Axiom Verge. Firstly, there are a few weapon powerups which are only available via semi-randomized sections of the map, which themselves are only accessed through randomized sections of glitched graphics. Searching for even one of them is exhausting and even a little tedious, so it's fortunate that it's exlusive to these very optional upgrades. The other thing that deserves some mention is the game's ending. I'll spoiler this section, though it won't contain any really specific details. [spoiler] The game's ending very clearly sets up a much larger story than the narrative of the game actually tells. There are still a lot of questions which are unanswered by the end, even going to far as to suggest that Trace might even be an unreliable narrator, and the final cutscene is practically a "to be continued!" screen. Whether or not a sequel was planned, it left me feeling that the author was holding out details on a mystery that I could have otherwise solved, and it made the finale less satisfying as a result. [/spoiler]  Axiom Verge was a lot of fun for me, in both gameplay and story, and I'd recommend it to anyone who isn't bothered by the retro-era graphics or bizarre visual design. Or even to people who are bothered by retro game graphics, with a supplimental statement of "Deal with it, the game's good!"
Date 2017-10-05 Playtime 2h 49m Rec Positive If you like Castlevania SOTN, this is definitely the game for you. Every bit as glorious as SOTN. Possibly even better, depending on your prefference of scifi or Fantacy/monsters. Elegant game.
Date 2017-10-04 Playtime 17h 16m Rec Positive I was thinking this was going to be Super Metroid with some cyberpunk elements to it, but after playing through it, Axiom Verge is much more than I expected. I may have enjoyed it more than metroid actually.  Great soundtrack Lots of cool Weapons and Gadgets to play with Interesting characters Solid, interpretable story  All in all, I highly recommend this game.
Date 2017-10-04 Playtime 20h 17m Rec Positive As a massive fan of Metroid I was excited when I first saw the trailer of Axiom verge, everything from the atmosphere to the music to the mechanics made it feel like a perfect spiritual succesor to Metroid and a great addition to the Metroidvania Genre.  I greatly enjoyed playing this game and found that the only two things that bothered me was the fact that the enviorments of the different regions all feel kinda the same (a possible side effect of its more NES inspired visuals), in stark contrast to games like super metroid or castlevania, that and the fact that the bosses, while each having an awsome and unique design, also all feel too similar in their actual combat.  Other then that I found the exploration factor to be perfect for its genre and the vast variety of weapons you can find for your gun to be very rewarding.  As with other metroidvanias along with weapons the abilities your character accumilates throughout the game that make exploring new areas possible can also be used to aid in combat resulting in more varied gameplay and involved strategy when exploring the map.   One thing that came as a welcome suprise to me was its story, which is more present in this game then other metroidvanias. I remeber watching the first trailer to the game wanting to uncover the mysteries that it was advertiesd to having, and while said mysteries are answered during the game, several more questions arose for each one,  and the game leaves unsolved these unsolved, hopefully to be answered in a sequal that fixes some of the problems in the game mentioned earlier.   In conclusion, Axiom Verge leaves me wanting a continuation of the story and a more varied visual design but nails the exploration and rewards system in metroidvanias
Date 2017-10-04 Playtime 9h 19m Rec Positive La verdad es que no se qué decir de este Axiom Verge. A pesar de tener muchísimas cosas positivas, como una dificultad desafiante, progresión de personaje.... Todo lo bueno que hace a un metroidvania, no sé, me ha parecido descafeinado. Creo que he salido un poco desquiciado con su dificultad. Puedo decir que me he pasado el 75% del juego y tras reintentar un boss durante 2 horas me he rendido ya que me ha parecido imposible seguir avanzando. pero no lo he dejado por eso, era simplemente que se me estaba haciendo pesado, y no divertido. Aún así es un juego notable, que seguramente guste a todo fan del género, pero que a mi, tristemente, no me ha acabado de convencer.  Una pena.  Probaremos con el Ori, a ver si hay más suerte.
Date 2017-10-04 Playtime 19h 17m Rec Positive If you did play Super Metroid back in the time and liked it, then it's most likely you will like this one too and I would recommand very highly you try it out.  Beeing overlycritical the soundtrack for this game is very average but the most important element of the game, room design, is really well done. I had fun exploring every area and searching every wall for secrets.
Date 2017-10-03 Playtime 12h 53m Rec Positive I have not seen too much of the game yet, but what I've seen I liked quite a lot, it brought back memories of the "good old times". You will have to learn patterns to vanquish bosses. You might have to backtrack, if you do not pay attention, because you are lost in the scenery. The usual ;)  Controls are tight, music is great, visuals are fitting.   If you enjoy Metroidvanias, you have to have a shot at Axiom Verge.
Date 2017-10-02 Playtime 24h 35m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is weird, kind of gross sometimes, kind of distressing sometimes, and worth every last ounce of playtime.  It’s a one-man ode to the Metroid of yore, with some Bionic Commando and Contra in there as well. Glitching the game out is a valid gameplay mechanic, one that is probably especially unsettling for folks who played a lot of NES and Game Boy games. With clever puzzles, intriguing lore, a phenomenal soundtrack, and lots and lots of bizarre monsters in surreal environments, Axiom Verge is a delight.  I’m eager to see more in this world - the ending screams “sequel hook”. If not, though, Thomas Happ is a developer to keep an eye on.
Date 2017-10-02 Playtime 14h 28m Rec Positive This is an impressive game as a solo project. Has the same quality you would expect from a team of developers. Just all around a terrific experiance. Borrows many ideas from simular games before it and applies its own twist. Graphics, Sound, Design are all well executed. Highly reccomended to those who want to get lost in another world.
Date 2017-10-01 Playtime 15h 7m Rec Positive Must have for fans of Metroid/Castlevania. Fantastic music and fun gameplay!
Date 2017-10-01 Playtime 18h 4m Rec Positive What a great metroidvania.  It's not crazy long like some of the Castlevania games tend to be but this game has a lot of heart. I was drawn in and couldn't put it down until I beat it. The artwork is gorgeous and a lot of creativity went into the weapons. The story was interesting as well, a bit more thought out than you normally find in these types of games.  I did have some discrepancies, however.  Many of the guns, even some later into the game, feel very weak and they never really gives you a reason to use half of them. For a good portion of my play through I stuck to using the Kilver. Which I would describe as a shotgun but instead of buckshot it's a short electrical blast. You get it early on and even towards the end I still found myself using it more than anything else. The Voranj was pretty awesome too, like a fracturing lightening strike, making different paths every time you fire it. Of course along with the interesting weapons you had your boring standard arsenal as well. They don't get much playtime.  The environments tend to get a little drab after a while. They don't tend to switch it up all too much, and there is some unnecessary back traveling as well, which always plagues this genre.  The sounds/music are great. I'd compare the soundtrack to the quality of older Castlevania games. Ear worms that would get stuck in my head, repeating over and over as I laid down to go to sleep.  If you're a fan of simple, no bullshit sidescrollers, I'd give this one a try. It's pretty cheap on steam, but I've also bought a physical aluminum case copy from Gamestop for $5. One CD is the game disk, the 2nd is the soundtrack. You really can't beat that price.
Date 2017-09-30 Playtime 24h 51m Rec Positive This title is extraordinary in that the developer was able to bring a fully realized idea to fruition on his own merits. The gameplay is very smooth and most certainly more crisp than the games that it draws inspiration from. The addition of new mechanics rejuvenates the genre while maintaining a comfortable and nostalgic feeling. This has become one of my favorite Metroidvania games.
Date 2017-09-29 Playtime 0h 47m Rec Positive a must play i double dipped and got the pc version this is what metroid should have been for newer titles its a hard game and a welcoming challenge i think this is a overlooked powerhouse of indie goodness and should be looked into for people that havent played it also for a one person army making the whole game it shows what they can do. reminder i had this on ps4 and was in the ending areas of the game is why im reviewing it now cause i switched to pc and wont look back to console
Date 2017-09-29 Playtime 14h 5m Rec Negative Отвратительная метроидвания как по мне и вот почему:  1) Ужасная карта по которой ориентироваться вообще нельзя. Отметки можно поставить всего 2-е и те в виде циферок 1 и 2, все! Уровни хоть и имеют свою стилистику, но в целом вообще не запоминаются, за исключением каких-то отдельных редких комнат, что в метроидваниях очень важно, ведь ты запоминаешь сначала комнату, а потом уже место, до которого ты в этой комнате не можешь добраться. Некоторые проходы закрыты с помощью таких "дверей" ключ к которым ты находишь уже в конце игры и естественно забываешь, что и в какой комнате было. Помимо этого ты после первой половины игры просто не знаешь куда идти, а пути порой ну ооочень нетривиальны как по мне. В итоге мне пришлось после середины игры постоянно лазить на ютуб что бы понять куда же мне надо идти.  2) Оружие. Да, его много... ОЧЕНЬ много, но полезных при этом всего 4-6 пушек половину из которых вы, скорее всего, не найдете при первом прохождении, если не будете пользоваться гайдами или не будете очень уж дотошными и не потратите овердофига времени на поиск всех секретов в игре. При этом пара полезных пушек, которыми можно пользоваться получаются уже под конец игры и насладиться ими вы как следует не сможете.  3) Враги. Врагов в игре 2 типа:  -враги которые в 90% случаев вообще ни чего не могут вам сделать -враги которые в 90% случаев вас закоцают так или иначе  и это жутко бесит т.к. толкового челенджа у игры нет. Ты либо позевывая и почесывая левую пятку убиваешь наинуднейших врагов которые только и делают, что замедляют твое прохождение просто своим присутствием, либо по любому отхватываешь плюхи как бы не потел.  4) Боссы. Во первых их мало. Во вторых они в большенстве скучные и убиваются тупо танча урон и вливая в босса как можно быстрее и убиваются в худшем случае с 3-й попытки. Дизайн боссов... ну в лучшем случае он нормальный, хотя как по мне, кроме парочки они все довольно посредственны. А один из боссов вообще убивается пока вы на кухне наливаете себе чай и это не шутка. Нет, вы можете с ним постреляться, то конец заскриптован и вы на него повлиять не способны, я считаю это полный идиотизм.  5) Музыка. Композиций мало и они жутко надоедают под конец. Кроме того сами по себе они не очень качественны, а ориентал композиция вообще меня ужасно бесила треть игры.  Из плюсов могу отметить клёвый пиксель-арт, некоторые комнаты очень качественно и атмосферно сделано, но их, к сожалению, очень мало. И управление. Да, тут задействованы все кнопки геймпада и блинк очень не удобно сделан, но в целом персонаж чувствуется, стреляет куда надо и делает то, что ты ему приказал (кроме сраных блинков).  По итогу могу сказать, что игра оверхайпнута и есть куда более качественные недооцененные метроидвании, например Valdis story(ее кстати тоже делали 1,5 землекопа). Автор думал, что он и чтец и жнец и на дуде игрец, но так не бывает. Я лучше сыграю в игру которую делали 100 человек, каждый из которых умеет делать только одно, но очень качественно, чем в игру от автора, который пытается приуспеть везде и везде лажает.
Date 2017-09-28 Playtime 16h 2m Rec Positive This is an awesome metroidvania game done very well. Storywise, it could be a bit better but the gameplay is solid (it even has speedrun mode!).
Date 2017-09-27 Playtime 16h 29m Rec Positive Мне, как любителю Контры (не КС, а той, что Contra), зашло на отлично. + Тёплая ламповая графика(я не фанат пиксельной графики, но здесь она сделана к месту) + Годный сюжет (и в целом годная атмосфера) + Отличный сайндтрек 
Date 2017-09-27 Playtime 39h 36m Rec Positive "Axiom Verge" fait partie des jolies [i]success stories[/i] du jeu rétro indépendant des années 2010, réussissant à faire avec Metroid ce que "Shovel Knight" avait fait avec Mega Man: un jeu qui reprend la formule d'une série classique, mais qui parvient à l'enrichir, la moderniser et s'en affranchir tout en conservant ses sensations "rétro" et tous ses fondamentaux.  Pourtant, à première vue, "Axiom Verge" ne paye pas de mine: ludiquement et visuellement, il semble trop copier "[b]Metroid[/b]" sur NES, et narrativement, il semble reproduire telle quelle toute la scène d'introduction de "[b]Another World[/b]" de Éric Chahi (1991), montrant l'expérience d'un scientifique qui tourne horriblement mal et paraît le téléporter soudainement dans un monde extraterrestre étrange.  Plus on avance, cependant, plus "Axiom Verge" affirme son identité. Déjà, sur le plan immersif, on est ici assez loin de l'univers "pulp" de Metroid avec des monstres colorés et kitsch et une histoire superficielle, ou de l'univers "Star Wars" tout autant stéréotypé de "Another World": le jeu est beaucoup plus sombre voire glauque, lorgnant souvent du côté de [b]H.R. Giger[/b] sur sa forme (en particulier avec les Rusalki, des créatures biomécaniques géantes à tête de femme), et s'inspirant plutôt de la science-fiction "sérieuse" (Isaac Asimov, Frank Herbert) sur son fond, avec une histoire complexe et dramatique.  Sur le plan ludique, le jeu s'affirme vite sur deux axes: l'action y est bien plus fluide que dans Metroid, et il présente le gimmick novateur de pouvoir "buguer" l'environnement. Beaucoup de capacités de notre héros, Trace, ont en effet un équivalent dans Metroid, mais à chaque fois cet équivalent est légèrement différent et plus amusant et intuitif: les bombes de Metroid (qui réclament que l'on se change en boule, puis que l'on pose la bombe, puis que l'on attende qu'elle explose) sont ici remplacées par une foreuse bien plus directe à manipuler, la boule morphing est remplacée par un drone que l'on peut lancer puis aussitôt diriger (et qui peut sauter et tirer), le grappin est beaucoup plus simple à contrôler, etc. De même, changer d'arme est bien plus rapide, les armes sont beaucoup plus nombreuses et faciles à utiliser, on se croirait parfois dans un clone de "Contra". Quant au gimmick principal du jeu, l'utilisation des "bugs", il est génial: sur les consoles et les ordinateurs 8-bit, il était courant que les jeux réagissent bizarrement, mais à l'époque le joueur n'était pas capable de vraiment faire la différence entre un bug et le comportement normal du jeu. "Axiom Verge" exploite cela dans son univers et ses mécaniques ludiques: le monde que l'on explore, Sudra, est une passerelle instable entre plusieurs mondes différents, et des outils variés permettent ainsi d'y altérer la réalité ou les comportements ennemis - c'est original et utilisé ici très intelligemment.  Tout cela combiné résulte en une expérience qui semble familière au départ, mais propose réellement quelque chose de neuf et même d'inoubliable - "Axiom Verge" est ainsi un des meilleurs jeux à la Metroid jamais sortis, que je classerais pour ma part à côté d'autres grands jeux du genre comme "[b]Environmental Station Alpha[/b]" ou "[b]Hollow Knight[/b]".

Date 2017-09-27 Playtime 14h 51m Rec Positive No-holds barred, old school gaming at its finest.  Great soundtrack, great story, great gameplay, and great controls all paying homage to one of the best side-scrolling shooters of all time.
Date 2017-09-27 Playtime 14h 28m Rec Positive Nice metroidvania.
Date 2017-09-26 Playtime 20h 16m Rec Positive This game is an absolute gem. Despite being a huge fan of Metroid, I never really got into other Metroidvania games. Most don't hold my attention for very long. Not this one though, this one was awesome to the end.   Axiom Verge, from the art, to the music, to the gameplay, is a beautiful homage to Metroid while never once feeling like a clone. It has no shortage of its own unique mechanics that it utlizes well. The artwork and music are absolutely excellent in their own right as well. I don't listen to a lot of video game soundtracks, but I find myself coming back to this one. It's on Spotify btw, and I recommend checking it out even if you don't buy the game.
Date 2017-09-26 Playtime 14h 10m Rec Positive Love letter to the Metroid series. Get it if you love Metroid. Simple as.
Date 2017-09-25 Playtime 15h 34m Rec Positive Un buen Metroidvania, cortito (Literalmente me lo he pasado 2 veces en 15 horas, ustedes diran; y tengo un perfil de juego al 100%), una trama interesante de Ciencia Ficcion. 8.9/10
Date 2017-09-25 Playtime 10h 37m Rec Positive An amazing metroidvania game. Great story. Great mechanics. Scratches that old-time metroid nostalgia itch just right. 9.5/10 will play again.
Date 2017-09-24 Playtime 13h 43m Rec Positive Great, fun 'metroidvania' type game (for those unknown to the genre: the world branches off in different directions, you get to open up formerly closed branches as you discover new items.)  Game is rarely frustrating (as many games in the genre are unfortunately). Save-points are frequent enough for you to have breathing points.  Very little handholding is needed in the game, it has a fun learning curve, going from easy to harder mobs and jumps.  Length: took me around 12 hours on normal, more than worth it. You could go for 100% pickups / map exploration, or speedruns after that, but I did not feel the need.
Date 2017-09-24 Playtime 13h 25m Rec Positive I haven't written a review in a long time, but feel like what I have to say about this game will be useful to people.  I will say that this is a good game and very impressive coming from a one-man development team, but I think the general community consensus that this game is better than Super Metroid is a bit of a hyperbole.  I'm going to try out a simpler pro/con format as opposed to my previous reviews to help it be more readable.  Pros: - Fantastic retro art and music - Very unique and weird theme with a decent story - Large maps with lots of content and varied enemies - Will run at 120 fps unlike many 2D games - Several unique mechanics that mix up the experience compared to other Metroidvania games - Save points that actually save your progress when you die rather than losing all progress since you visited the save point.  Mixed: - A huge number of weapons.  There are no damage types of special effects, so they only differ by projectile behavior and whether you can hold down the attack button (not very many.)  Too many end up being very similar and the weapon wheel is clumsy to use with so many options. - Many secrets are 100% hidden with no way to find them unless you attempt to do exactly what you need to do to get to them.  Some people may like this, but I think lacking a block type indicator like Super Metroid has it doesn't serve the game well.  Cons: - The controls for the two movement abilities are just plain atrocious.  It's probably less of an issue playing with keyboard but I used a gamepad. - Weak boss fights.  Most of the bosses end up being mind-numbingly simple to beat and don't have any interesting mechanics.  One ends up being rather frustrating instead. - Combat design could use some work.  Enemies generally either are easy to kill, cause essentially unavoidable damage to you, or are best cheesed (try to get them stuck so they can't hit you.)  The limited firing speed on weapons doesn't feel very good, and combined with the excessive HP of many enemies, it makes combat tedious. - Zero indicators for where to go to progress in the story.  I think this is an especially large problem due to how large the maps are.  The game doesn't need to tell you exactly where to go but even Super Metroid shows you where to find the next boss so you have a general idea of which direction to head.  So to sum up: It's a good game, but not without significant flaws.  I look forward to the developer's next project.
Date 2017-09-23 Playtime 4h 33m Rec Positive This game suffers from a massive case of "where the hell do I go next" syndrome. It's infuriating because you get into a flow, you're having hun...but then the fun stops completely. Thre's no shame in using walkthroughs for this game. Also the boss fights are very easily and the reptition is a bit mindess. I didn't care about the story at all.  But other than that, this is a fantastic metrovania game. It's worth your time if you liked the original Metroid.
Date 2017-09-22 Playtime 14h 46m Rec Positive [h1]Axiom Verge[/h1]  [i]Axiom Verge[/i] throws you headfirst into nostalgia from the moment the game begins, and isn’t shy at all about its inspiration from classics [i]Metroid[/i] and [i]Super Metroid[/i]. [i]Axiom Verge[/i] has a killer soundtrack, unique biomes and enemies, secrets galore, a plethora of upgrades and weapons, and boss fights that will test your reflexes and skill.   Play as Trace, a scientist who wakes up in the strange land of Sudra after an explosion in the lab knocks him unconscious. Help the Rusalki (Sudran war machines) recover their strength after being critically wounded by Athetos and his biological weapons. But who is really friend and who is foe? Or perhaps an even better question is, what is real and what is not? These are the types of questions you will be constantly asking yourself during and after your playthrough of [i]Axiom Verge[/i]. The game’s ending is fantastic and leaves plenty of room for theorizing and forming your own opinion. That being said, the entire experience will take you between ten and fifteen hours. Here’s to hoping this isn’t the last we’ll see of Trace!  For the hardcore, [i]Axiom Verge[/i] can be played in hard mode, speedrun mode, or both.   [h1]Summary and Target Price Point[/h1]  [i]Axiom Verge[/i] is a solid [b]8.0 out of 10 with the biggest complaint being its brevity[/b].

Date 2017-09-21 Playtime 48h 22m Rec Positive Posibly the best Metroidvania. So awesome.
Date 2017-09-20 Playtime 43h 35m Rec Positive Excelente juego !!!
Date 2017-09-19 Playtime 31h 58m Rec Positive Very atmospheric indie metroidvania with an excellent 16-bit artstyle that let's you explore and discover at your own discretion.
Date 2017-09-19 Playtime 7h 50m Rec Positive This is a Metroidvania style game. In fact, it has a lot in common with the original Metroid... but it likes to subvert your expectations. There are small gaps just like in Metroid. Veteran gamers will see these and immediately start looking for the Morph Ball upgrade, but the tool you get to deal with those is significantly different. Worth playing for the creativity and solid combat!
Date 2017-09-17 Playtime 7h 26m Rec Positive It's fun, but old school hard.
Date 2017-09-17 Playtime 0h 52m Rec Positive Beautiful art, sound, and music. The first level just screams Metroid. I will definitely revisit and beat this game.  My experience so far is really tight controls, intuitive environments, and interesting enemies.
Date 2017-09-16 Playtime 4h 19m Rec Positive Amazing tribute to Metroid.  This game i could tell was a labor of love for the single man developer. There is so much soul it is nearly overflowing.  Gameplay: It is a true to form callback to the metroid series of days past lending each new area with new weapons to collect and puzzles with said weapons.   Graphics: Amazing. it uses an old school asthetic that is very reminiscent of the games of the NES era of platformers, while still keeping everything new and exciting. I admit that i have only logged about an hour in so far, and honestly it was only that way because I was compelled to close out to write this review.  Sound: great soundtrack that takes a lot of it's queues from super metroid using a minimalistic amount of music to build that "out of this world" atmosphere.  Controls: not groundbreaking but honestly do you really want that? it plays exactly as i would expect and was never cumbersome. Easy to just pick up and go.  I cannot express how impressed i am with this game so far and i would recommend it to anyone who is jonesing for that old school metroid game in there life. 100%  (Also note) I picked this game up from my local GS as a Steelbook special edition with soundtrack included. it came with a beautiful art/game manual as well as the full soundtrack. I was super impressed by the presentation and was the best 5 dollars i have spent on a game in a very long while.
Date 2017-09-15 Playtime 13h 42m Rec Positive Лучшая метроидвания со времён Metroid на Gameboy. Классный платформер с олдскульной графикой и музыкой 8-bit, любителям жанра - к ознакомлению)  з.ы: играть только на контроллере, на клавиатуре - сущий ад, атвичаю :D
Date 2017-09-15 Playtime 19h 14m Rec Positive Awesome game! Brilliant gameplay
Date 2017-09-14 Playtime 18h 6m Rec Positive fun trippy experience.
Date 2017-09-14 Playtime 17h 29m Rec Positive This takes the best parts of the metroid games, and runs with them. Expounding new powers and mechanics that Nintendon't. Unbelievably fun.
Date 2017-09-13 Playtime 20h 34m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is retro gaming bliss - metroidvania at its best.  Absolutely creativity tool and weapon design that creates an engaging experience throughout.  The story was tricky for me to grasp, but it was not what motivated me through my first playthrough (I was just having so much fun).  On my second playthrouh, I focused on grasping the story.  And I turned to the internet to immerse myself in the community's ideas on just what the heck was going on in this insane world.  I do not think we'll ever grasp the completely picture, but, as a result, I'm left a subtle and satisfying longing which makes Axiom Verge more real and more special than an experience which neatly ties all loose ends.  This is game is an epic accomplishment by an extremely talented and creative human.  I would support any future project Tom Happ would bless us with.
Date 2017-09-13 Playtime 12h 48m Rec Positive Awesome game!
Date 2017-09-13 Playtime 14h 19m Rec Positive Из всех современных игр Axiom Verge наиболее близок к оригинальному Metroid по концепции и стилистике.
Date 2017-09-13 Playtime 5h 12m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a wonderful throwback to the old school 2D Metroid titles found on the Super Nintendo and Gameboy Advance. With a variety of different weapons and fun power ups it makes exploring this alien world a blast. This game boasts wonderful music and a pixel art style straight out the 16-bit era, providing for a fun time with a great atmosphere and soundtrack to back it up.  If you grew up a fan of the old school Metroid games or are just looking for a fun Sci-fi exploration game, please give this game your time. You won't regret it. 
Date 2017-09-12 Playtime 19h 38m Rec Positive This game is a breath of fresh air for anyone familiar with old-school Metroid. This game is exactly like how I remember the old Metroid to be, but majorly upgraded. This is the game that I have been looking forward to playing, and I was astounded as to how well the game is put together. It offers abilities, upgrades, puzzles that are not easy, hidden rooms with hidden upgrades, and the game can reach dark souls level intensity often. The game punishes you as you die by sending you back to your last touched save point, which can be challenging because some areas are tough to get though. The game forces you to learn your environment to get through areas that cause pain. If you like Metroid, boy will you love Axiom Verge.
Date 2017-09-12 Playtime 8h 3m Rec Positive A loving and worthy homage to Super Metroid. It is challenging and refreshing and introduces new "meta" gameplay concepts that I won't spoil here.
Date 2017-09-12 Playtime 18h 52m Rec Positive This is easily the best game I have played in years. The atmosphere is fantastic and the gameplay is simply fabulous, and the story is on another level of amazing that very few games ever achieve.

Date 2017-09-09 Playtime 21h 16m Rec Positive Seriously, I [i]love[/i] Metroidvania games. Been a fan since Super Metroid and since, but what [i]is[/i] a "Metroidvania"? Simple: it's a game that you go and explore an open world with a limited set of items that overtime you find more items that open up more of the world, it's a bit hard to explain, but the genre was created from the original Metroid...  "Wait, this is Axiom Verge! How does that relate?" You may ask, ah but it's the [i]gameplay[/i] that is similar (although not entirely!). Let's get on with this review!  [h1]REVIEW START![/h1]  [b]Gameplay[/b] Litterally, it's amazing, the controls are responsive, you only need a keyboard, not a pesky mouse to aim. Although it can get a pain to do some menauvers (Like having to press like 4 buttons at once with a keyboard that only registers 3 inputs), but after a bit you can get through. It's like many other metroidvanias, but it has some extra "bonus" gear that's entirely optional for you to collect. With the idea of a 'NES-Like' game in mind, you see glitches, like [i]actual intentional[/i] glitches in the game! They appear as corrupted blocks, but after a while, you get an upgrade that allows you to [i]corrupt the enemies![/i] Each enemy in the game has a unique "corrupted" form, with even a special appearance to MissingNo. (Also, use your 6th weapon when he's on Screen too, you wont regret it!) Some corrupted enemies will actually heal you, or become a different enemy al together, or for some of those "Late Game" ones, allow them to move with your movements. It's pretty impressive  EDIT: I forgot to mention, but the game, especially when trying to 100% it or anything, will take you a while to complete on your first try, the first time took me [i]11[/i] hours! And that's with a guide after the last half of the game!  Even the 'Speedrun' trohpy will take a while, you have to complete the game under 4 hours! Compared to other metroidvanias, that doesn't sound too bad, but trust me. [i]That's a long time with this game[/i]  8.75/10  [b]Story[/b] I was quite enjoying the story, it was one of those kind of stories that wont be all "in your face" impeding the gameplay, it's quite well done to be honest. (Super Duper Short Summation) The story is that you take the role of a Scientist, whom was doing research in his when an explosion has occured and sent to this mysterious world. You have to go and help some mechanical robot from dying from a man named 'Athesos' (Might have spelled that wrong...) Whom is the antagonist of the game. You go through trying to figure out who he is, why you're there and what other fishy things have been going on.  (The secret ending was alright tho but I wont say anything 'bout it)  9/10  [b]Appearance[/b]  DO I have to say it? [i]They're so good[/i], the graphics, the sound design, the [i]music[/i], it's all amazing. The tunes really throw back to the classic era, with little to no "modern" intruments in sounds, most of the sounds are chiptune based sounds, and with the "Secret Worlds" mechanic, throwing back to Metroids "Secret" worlds, the glitchy stuff of blocks and enemies really do there job at being glitchy. Like the palletes of enemies will corrupt, or the graphics of one enemy is jumbled while the behavior switches to that of another, it's really convincing glitch behavior! The Spritework is amazing, the amount of detail in the sprites on the bosses are just awe inspiring beatiful.  9.75/10  [h1]Let's Review...the Review?[/h1]  Okay, let's hope I did this table thing correctly....  [table] [tr] [th]Category[/th] [th]Rank[/th] [/tr] [tr] [td]Gameplay[/td] [td]8.75[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]Story[/td] [td]9[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]Appearance[/td] [td]9.75[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]TOTAL[/td] [td]9.16/10[/td] [/tr] [/table]  Great Game I Recommend it with a L9M2 rating of 9.1/10! A 91%!
Date 2017-09-07 Playtime 6h 16m Rec Positive Amazing, if you like 2d metroid you should 100% buy this.
Date 2017-09-05 Playtime 51h 32m Rec Positive Very good game. Have it ruckzuck durchgesuchtet.
Date 2017-09-04 Playtime 11h 44m Rec Positive Game 47 of my backlog.  A fun Metroidvania game with a good soundtrack and (mostly) skill-required gameplay mechanics.   + Stylish NES style pixel-ish graphics that come together pretty darn well. Looks great + Music and Sound design is fantastic + Lots of fun and cool abilities + Unique boss fight design  - Beeping sound when health gets low is incredibly annoying. Constantly goes off. - Bad story - Some useless weapons - The "dash through walls" mechanic (double tapping desired direction) is frustrating as hell. You will accidentally be using it constantly throughout the entire second half of the game, running into enemies that will hurt you and kill you due to only being quick with your fingers. You cannot remap it at the time of this review (10/7/2017).    That aside, it's still a fun metroidvania game that requires anyone who likes the older metroids (or games like Rogue Legacy) to give it a try.
Date 2017-09-04 Playtime 19h 19m Rec Positive Straight up Metroid-like with sick beats. Very fun platformer-Metroid(vania) with lots of challenging enemies. 8/10
Date 2017-09-03 Playtime 13h 56m Rec Positive Un GRANDISIMO estilo Metroivania que hace denotar su inspiración en el primer Metroid y que a la misma vez logra tener su propia personalidad y originalidad, una gran jugabilidad, extraordinaria banda sonora, una durabilidad satisfactoria y rejugabilidad. En cuanto a los puntos negativos son: Una historia que pretende ser brillante y que falla por su mala narrativa y el segundo aspecto son las batallas con los jefes ya que no conllevan un gran reto, cuestion que pudieron explotar con la cantidad de armas que podemos conseguir. Aun asi no deja de ser un titulo muy solido y uno de los mejores Metroidvanias de la actualidad. Muy Recomendable. :D
Date 2017-09-01 Playtime 15h 42m Rec Positive 非常对胃！BGM+地图元素那种病态异域的实际感受令我喜悦！ 少有的“BGM强化了游戏整体感受”的类型 整个游戏气氛非常微妙的压在惊悚的边缘上··微微的崩坏和病质有如恶梦一样的迷幻感 PS：看有人评论里说听不来BGM····EMMMMMMM PS2：期待续作！
Date 2017-08-31 Playtime 22h 35m Rec Positive Отличный метроид, для любителей жанра это просто подарок.
Date 2017-08-29 Playtime 24h 20m Rec Positive Perfect for diehard metroid fans.
Date 2017-08-29 Playtime 17h 50m Rec Positive 8/10: My enjoyment peaked in the middle of Axiom Verge. The best part is its story. It hints at one of the most chilling, interesting stories I've ever seen. But just hints -- it's so noncommital that it's not very satisfying. Vagueness or contradiction would be fine, but the sparse details read like the creator is unsure of the story he is telling. They don't read like interesting tidbits from unreliable narrators.  Early on it differentiates itself from Super Metroid, the biggest inspiration for this game. The start is promising but by the end, gameplay-wise especially, it's more like a(n extremely well made) Metroid ROM hack than a unique game. The gameplay differences matter less as the game continues.  And it makes errors that Super Metroid never did. Travelling the world is slow, even with the best upgrades. It doesn't make me want to explore because going from place to place is too time-consuming. In Super Metroid, towards the end you can speed through old areas and shred any enemy in your way. Axiom Verge never gives that catharsis. Making exploring even slower, too many of the items are hidden behind arbitrary walls. I greatly enjoyed an optional puzzle (finding the gun with initials QV) and wish more of the game was like that. I think Fez will be closer to what I was looking for here.
Date 2017-08-28 Playtime 80h 45m Rec Positive Лучший Metroid, чем Super Metroid. Графика, геймплей, музыка, дизайн, сюжет - 11 из 10. 
Date 2017-08-27 Playtime 55h 33m Rec Positive 十分好玩的类银河战士恶魔城的游戏，如果你是这类游戏的粉丝，请千万不要错过这个由Tom Happ自主独立制作的2d横版射击游戏。  Axiom Verge（公理边缘）借用与银河战士解密、探索等同样的方式来作为游戏整体的游玩结构，比如前期不能去的某些地方，等到了后期拿到新能力后才能再次探索等等。  种类繁多的武器，不过实用性高的只有那么几种，剩下的不是解密必须用到的，就是只用来看的花架子（不过真的挺好看的）。  创新方面值得一提的就是断层空间，随机的出现在地图的各个角落，不过据说每个存档只会有5个，而地图还比较丰富，这对探索家门来说，究竟是好还是坏呢？  故事的因果几乎得依靠日记来发现，这让我想到了魂like，莫非作者是魂粉？[spoiler]最终的结局是怎样的呢？我只想到某句台词：是谁杀了我？而我又杀了谁？[/spoiler]  总之，如果你是一个类银河战士恶魔城游戏的爱好者，请千万不要错过这部作品，它不会让你失望的。^_^  个人评价：9/10
Date 2017-08-27 Playtime 24h 27m Rec Positive Axiom Verge has a fantastic story discovered as the game progresses.  The lore gives depth and a profound moral greyness to this delicious game.  The game's mechanics are wonderful, with solid movement options and beautiful graphics to complement them.  A variety of weapons, upgrades, and locales await you in this brilliant Metroid tribute.
Date 2017-08-25 Playtime 11h 30m Rec Positive I'm not one for metroidvanias, in fact, I bought the game and it sat in my library for a month, then I played it for 5 minutes and attempted to refund it.  I could not refund the game.  Boy, was I lucky. I decided, since I spent $10 on it, I might as well try it, some of the bosses looked cool. From that moment on, I rarely had a dull moment playing this game.  Every discovery came with a satisfying reward, although I used guides twice, most of the progression was very doable. I cannot stress how great this game is, even if you've never played a metroidvania before.  Also, people can 100% this game in 90 minutes, even though it took me 11.5 hours to 50% complete it. Great game.  Might replay again.    Pros: Satisfying Gameplay + Good Soundtrack + Replayable + A Seperate Mode For Speedrunning+ Cool Enviornments + Great Visuals + TONS OF GUNS +++  Neutral: Somewhat expensive if not on sale ($20) BUT goes on sale somewhat often +/- Can Kill the sixth boss in one hit, but you won't know how without looking it up +/- Endgame enemies are a little op, but that makes for a more challenging game +/- Story is a little barebones, but still feels fulfilling upon completing and the small amount included is intriguing +/-   Cons: I only used 5 of the many weapons throughout the game - Some weapons are just underwhelming - Two "bosses" that you don't fight - Final boss really made my wrists hurt-   Lastly: Mad props to Thomas Happ.  He made this game by himself, and it's better than like 95% of my steam library I'd rate it 10/10.  Honestly.
Date 2017-08-24 Playtime 12h 6m Rec Positive Un petit jeu indé très cool, vibrant hommage aux jeux nes, qui se paye le luxe de quelques innovations sympathiques.  On aurait aimé cependant une écriture un tout petit peu plus poussée par moment.   15/20 :)
Date 2017-08-24 Playtime 66h 11m Rec Positive The kind of game that makes me glad I'm a fan of exploration, weapon variety, and interconnected level design!
Date 2017-08-23 Playtime 4h 14m Rec Positive Fini sur PS4 et racheté sur steam pour la "collection", Axiom Verge est un clone de Metroid, visuellement comme au niveau de sa construction, la musique est de qualité, le gameplay est nickel et la durée de vie est correcte, reste juste à supporter le rendu graphique façon "NES" et vous passerez un bon moment.
Date 2017-08-23 Playtime 43h 4m Rec Positive If this had been called Super Metroid 2, I would not be disappointed.
Date 2017-08-23 Playtime 0h 8m Rec Positive 说实话操作性还有些欠缺，希望中文快点出
Date 2017-08-22 Playtime 76h 8m Rec Positive Fun little metroid clone. Definitely worth a few playthroughs. Awesome music and pixel art.
Date 2017-08-21 Playtime 11h 35m Rec Positive Wenn ihr 2D-Metroid-Spiele liebt, dann werdet ihr dieses Spiel auch lieben!  Mein erster Eindruck war die Ähnlichkeit einer Mischung aus Metroid 1 und Metroid Fusion. Axiom Verge ist nicht irgendein billiger Metroid-Klon. Auch wenn einem vieles bekannt vorkommen wird, macht dieses Spiel von der 1. Minute an süchtig.  Das Typische an den ersten Metroid-Spielen war (und ist auch bei Axiom Verge so), dass man so gut wie auf sich allein gestellt ist und die Umgebung selbstständig erkunden muss, was aber genau das Reizvolle an der Sache ist.  Als Oldschool-Metroid-Fan ist man mit diesem Spiel sehr gut bedient!
Date 2017-08-21 Playtime 22h 17m Rec Positive Echt ein tolles Spiel!   Klar man muss schon ein gewissen Hang zur Nostalgie haben um die Pixelgrafik zu mögen, aber diese schaft es problemlos die Atmosphäre des Spiels zu transportieren. Das Spiel hatte mich von Anfang an genau wegen dieser Atmosphäre, aber auch wegen des tollen Soundtracks, der Story bei der man sich nach jedem Bröckchen Information sehnt und nicht zuletzt wegen des sehr gut umgesetzten Gameplays. Die Waffen und Items wirken gleichtzweit neu aber haben dennoch eine liebevollen Metroidvania-Charme, was eigentlich auch auf das ganze Spiel zu trifft. Das Artwork der Charaktere und Bosse weiß ebenfalls vollends zu überzeugen.   Ich persönlich bin begeistert und würde das Spiel sogar jemandem empfehlen der sich bisher noch nicht ausgiebig im Metroidvania-Genre bewegt hat...
Date 2017-08-20 Playtime 3h 1m Rec Negative I tried it a couple of times, but my gripe is really with the platforming. Placing platforms above each other so you keep bumping your head is just frustrating. The guns also don't feel like they add much, only a few are actually necessary.  (Disclaimer: I had a longer review, deleted it after a negative comment, decided that was stupid and just wrote out my main points again)
Date 2017-08-17 Playtime 18h 25m Rec Positive [h1]So ... Axiom Verge[/h1]  Made by Thomas Happ Games, which is just one guy called … Thomas Happ. It’s sort of a love letter to old school NES platformers like Contra, Blaster Master and such. But beyond any doubt, it has the biggest boner for Metroid. Explore the world to find upgrades, then use those to find more upgrades. All that good metroidvania stuff. You’re Trace, a scientist dude who blows up his lab in an experiment and ends up in Sudra, a barren world devastated by some unknown calamity. I’ll leave it there, cuz spoilers suck. But first, let's list off the good and the bad.  [h1]Pros[/h1] [list] [*]Progression is pretty satisfying with some novel upgrades, like a remote controlled drone and one that let’s you ‘glitch’ through stuff. Weakens a little in the late game. More in the negatives. [*]Controls are precise and responsive. The standard control layout is pretty smartly mapped. Weapon switching is easy through a radial/line menu. Drops off a bit in the late game. More in the negatives. [*]Good bosses, mostly. Not too damage spongy and decently challenging,testing pattern recognition skills and found abilities. Some subvert expectations. You’ll remember these. Sudden leap in difficulty about 2/3rds through. Bosses beyond this are just decent in design. [*]Great soundtrack! A mix of dark ambient chiptune and melancholy instruments over deep, thumpy basses. Sure, not all tracks are winners, but still, do yourself a favor. Turn it up. [*]Nice 8-bit pixel art inspired by Metroid. Sometimes verges on 16-bit & some effects wouldn’t be possible on NES. So, 12-bit? Dark biomechanical aesthetic that reminds of H.R. Giger, more so than Metroid did actually. Also, it can run on a potato. [*]Remember those weird graphical glitches in old 8-bit games? Those are a mechanic. An upgrade lets you ‘glitch’ enemies or bits of level into something less dangerous, harmless or helpful. Shame it doesn't use it more.[/list]  [h1]Cons[/h1] [list] [*]Controls and progression get weaker later on. Late-game abilities and their controls are hard to use in combination with others and this becomes a requirement for progress, making reaching some areas potentially frustrating. No dealbreaker, but worth mentioning. [*]It can be a “Where do I go?” and “Guide Dang It” game. It might be too old school in this respect. You get an objective, but no real idea of where to go. Some items are hidden really, really well. Even Super Metroid told which general direction to go and had the X-Ray Visor to help find stuff. Axiom Verge doesn’t do anything (that actually helps).  [*]Protagonist Trace is a bore. At first he’s promising. Curious, yet skeptical. Like a scientist should be. That goes away. Later on he turns into a rather generic hero who quietly does what he’s told to. Shame, missed opportunity. [*]The story is pretty meh. At first, it’s mysterious and atmospheric. Some plot points hint at something greater going on, but it doesn’t do anything with those, instead playing it pretty straight. Another lost chance.[/list]  Axiom Verge leaves me a little conflicted. It has a lot of strong beginnings and does many things right throughout, but in a few respects, it sort of tapers off. Maybe the developer ran out of ideas or rushed things, but the last third or so doesn’t feel as tightly put together anymore. It’s still plenty good, just no longer great. If you’re looking for a solid metroidvania, Axiom Verge is well worth your time, even if you're not big on the genre and despite some nitpicks. I’d give it a 5 banana rating, but I know it falls just a smidgen short of that. More a 4,5, but I don’t round up nor give half-bananas, so ...  [b]I rate Axiom Verge 4 out of 5 bananas.[/b]  What my ratings mean: 1 bananas - Crap. Turn around & don’t look back. 2 bananas - Bad. Not really worth it. 3 bananas - Average. For fans of the genre or a sale. 4 bananas - Good. Won't waste your time. 5 bananas - Superb. A definite must-play.
Date 2017-08-17 Playtime 18h 32m Rec Positive Bon jeu, durée de vie ok et surtout très bonne ambiance. Je regrette que certains power ups soient un peu trop posés là de manière un peu artificielle pour prolonger la durée de vie du jeu. Mais très cool.
Date 2017-08-16 Playtime 8h 22m Rec Positive blah blah Super Metroid blah blah... blah blah Metroidvania blah blah...  Yeah, it's "Just Another Metroid(tm)" but it's a damn good one.  8/10
Date 2017-08-16 Playtime 5h 23m Rec Positive Metroid
Date 2017-08-15 Playtime 35h 31m Rec Positive WOW. Nailed the bio-cyber-punk aethetic. Music, art and story are all great.   Without spoiling the plot, let me just say this reminds me why I never want to try LSD or DMT. I would be afraid I would go through the experience and come out believing something like this actually happened to me.  10/10 Helped me face my existential dread.
Date 2017-08-14 Playtime 4h 16m Rec Positive My first completed Metroidvania game. It's a genre I'm really afraid of because I hate backtracking, but I have to say that Axiom Verge exceeded my expectations. I experienced nearly no downtime and the backtracking never felt pointless. The music is awesome and get you pumped up, enhancing the experience. The abilities feel great to use and unlocking new paths is very satisfying (maybe too many weapons mod so you're a bit overwhelemed but still). The story is a bit hard to follow sometimes and the only way to get a grasp of the full situation requires you to be a completionist, but it really is a great story if you like having to figure it out yourself using the clues that you can find. The old school art didn't resonate with me and I had a hard time visualizing this world being a planet, but it's a matter of taste and I would say it shouldn't be your main decision point.  Overall, it was a great and worth it experience that convinced me to try more Metroidvania games.
Date 2017-08-13 Playtime 41h 19m Rec Positive One of the best metroidlike since ages !  Only down side is the final boss. For all the previous bosses, there is a way to dodge, hide, or a pattern to figure in order to beat them. But for the final one, it is just pure luck. Random pattern and no way to hide, no way do dodge, nothing at all. A real shame.  Other than that, the music is good, graphics are gorgeous and the gameplay is awesome with all its weapons / items / secrets.  The story line is also interresting !
Date 2017-08-13 Playtime 23h 52m Rec Positive Un gioco fantastico, quasi perfetto nel suo genere.  Atmosfera fantastica, una miriade di armi e potenziamenti molto originali, una storia che seppur di contorno a questo tipo di giochi è anche interessante. I controlli sono ottimi con un pad e discreti con la tastiera, per l'uso di vari tasti diversi. La colonna sonora è molto d'atmosfera e memorabile, anche se personalmente non mi rimane in testa come per esempio quella dei vecchi Castlevania.  Purtroppo essendo un gioco così buono i piccoli difetti che ha si fanno sentire: da buon metroidvania (più Metroid che "vania") c'è una buona dose di backtracking per tornare nelle zone prima inaccessibili. Il problema è essenzialmente la mancanza di teletrasporto da una zona all'altra, il gioco ti costringe e rifare completamente tutta la strada (e affrontare di nuovo i nemici) per tornare indietro, quasi senza scorciatoie. E se arrivi al punto dove ti sfugge dove usare il nuovo potere raccolto, è molto facile perdere ore a vagare in aree già visitate solo per arrivare ad un altro punto.  A parte questo problema, è un gioco che consiglio a tutti gli appasionati del genere, davvero ottimo.
Date 2017-08-13 Playtime 11h 40m Rec Positive So like, i was this guy who had a bad haircut and a nice coat, and i was running around to a pimpin' soundtrack, and at one point i got rid of my old coat because it couldn't warp reality around me.  and really, what more would you ever want in a coat? lumberjacks only care about warmth in the frigid northern canadian cold. I don't need to worry about that thanks to global warming. All i ever wanted was to be able to atomize people by walking through them.  Oh, and the gun is so cool. i'd cosplay as this dude, except i feel a realistic rendition of the twenty-something pixels- tops- wouldn't be recognized at conventions.  aliens are douchebags.

Date 2017-08-13 Playtime 12h 1m Rec Positive [u]What I liked: [/u] [list]     [*]Metroidvania progression is good     [*]Intriguing story to push you along too     [*]Strong art style and some cool weapon designs(Voranj, Tethered Charge, and Lightning Gun) [/list] [u]What You Need to Know: [/u] [list]          [*]I first want to say I have never actually played the original Metroid series or any of the OG games it’s inspired by. My first games were the Metroid Prime games. So I guess I’m not as nostalgic for this genre?      [*]So the story and setting are very unique here, kind of feeling like you’re in a computer world with the glitch gun, but also very surreal with weird aliens and a cryptic story that has to do with a virus, clones, and hallucinogens. It’s a great mystery and I was pleased with where it went.       [*]The exploration in a game like this is key to the success, are their good enough upgrades that up you’re power level and mobility. There are a lot of secrets in this game, some are story notes that add more insight into explaining what is going on. There are health and weapon power upgrades. A lot of these are optional with the weapons coming up next.      [*]So the weapons are a mixed bag, you have so much variety in terms of different effects, I think there are about 20 weapons in total with almost all of them being optional weapons. This rewards you when you find them; it’s cool to try them out. But a lot of them are worthless. They are all pretty much do the same damage except the close ranged weapons. This brings the total number to less than 5 that I found useful.  ) Axiom Disruptor replaced by Inertial Pulse, Voranj, Kilver then replaced by Flamethrower, and Lightning Gun        [*]A lot of the weapons are just reskinned and better versions of others. I would have rather seen 6 good weapons with the newer weapons just adding their abilities to arsenal or flatout replacing them. I do want to say the design of the weapons and variety is good and want to thank the dev for making them even if it turned out not as I know he hoped them to be.      [*]The combat is also not as good as it could have been, All but the flying enemies were a joke with some bosses even offering no challenge. I don’t know why this is, maybe I’m better at games than I think or demand more complexity, but the difficulty of AI attack patterns with bosses and minions alike was overall weak here. (The final boss, I just tanked and killed him without moving. How is that possible?!?!?)      [*]Overall the game won’t be a classic overtime as the game’s difficulty is too low and lack of a strong core of weapons. Regardless the game will still be fun for anyone that likes Metroidvania style games with a strong mystical story, eerie soundtrack, and exploration rewards a plenty.  [/list]  [h1]My Score: [/h1] [b]B[/b]  [b]Paid: $10[/b] [b]Completed in: 12 hours [/b]  Games similar I recommend:  [list]     [*]Apotheon     [*]Guacamelee     [*]Cave Story+     [*]Outland     [*]Alwa's Awakening [/list]	  Here are the weapons list I would have done to limit the choices and make the weapons more meaningful: (Reduced from 20 to 6) [list]      [*] Axiom Disruptor with upgrades of Inertial Pulse, Hypo-Atomizer, or Multi-Disruptor or all     [*]Nova with upgrades of Data Bomb, Orbital Discharge, or Reflector     [*]Voranj      [*]Tethered Charge     [*]Ion Beam with upgrades of Lightning Gun     [*]Flamethrower [/list]
Date 2017-08-12 Playtime 14h 3m Rec Positive Axiom Verge überrascht mit einfallsreichen unterschiedlichen Waffen und Upgrades, einer tollen direkten Steuerung, einer fantastischen futuristischen Storyline und dabei völliger Bewegungsfreiheit von Raum zu Raum. Besonders interessant ist die Tatsache sich nach gewisser Zeit im Spiel und durch sammeln eines PowerUps durch Wände glitch'en zu dürfen, dies eröffnet immer wieder neue Wege und macht die Welt interessant. In einem speziell angebotenen SpeedRun Modus können Sie sich mit Ihren Freunden messen. Rundrum Top Produkt.
Date 2017-08-12 Playtime 13h 38m Rec Positive A fantastic nod to the 2D Metroid games but retro gaming in general without feeling like just lame fanservice. The worldbuilding and atmosphere in this game is top notch--even better than some of the 2D Metroid games. The controls are great and have the perfect combination of simplicity and complexity to keep things interesting. The story is complex without becoming nonsensical/esoteric and gets you thinking about violence/pacifism, fate/choice, reality/falsehood.  There's a reason the user reviews for this game are overwhelmingly positive.
Date 2017-08-11 Playtime 12h 58m Rec Positive It has enough similarities to Metroid to definitely feel and play like Metroid, while still doing enough different to be its own entity. But for those differences (which I thoroughly liked), I’d say this is the best classic-style Metroid game since Super Metroid. Instead, I just say play it. You won’t regret it.
Date 2017-08-11 Playtime 1h 48m Rec Negative Whoever thought that basing a game on the ORIGINAL Metroid, and thought that having bland and bleak environments would be great game design needs to have their balls strapped to the back of a Ford F-150, screaming as it goes down the highway at 70 miles per hour. Great concept, absolutely STUPID and RETARDED excecution. 6 years down the toilet, sir, and what a damn shame. By the way, I beat this game on PS4... AFTER 20 hours of just wandering aimlessly in the map.
Date 2017-08-10 Playtime 13h 0m Rec Positive An absolute masterpiece.  This is everything you want from a game:  -an amazing story -fun combat -interesting bosses -challenging but not frustrating -a level of exploration -a variety of weapons to fit all play styles  I honestly cannot think of a single issue with this game, other than maybe it can sometimes be confusing where to go to progress.  Definately worth picking up whenever you can, but give yourself time because once you start you won't wanna stop till ur done!
Date 2017-08-09 Playtime 10h 55m Rec Positive The game has a few flaws, the controls can be a bit stiff, and some of the end-game abilities are a bit awkward to use. Double tapping a direction to dash on a controller was a really stupid idea, especially when it's needed everywhere. You will also swim in weapons by the end game but only use 2 or 3 of them, why did they create so many useless ones?  But all in all I still recommend the game, it very much feels like a Metroid game.
Date 2017-08-09 Playtime 15h 0m Rec Positive 如果能加入中文，改善下美术设计和音乐，是一款能比肩铲子骑士的游戏
Date 2017-08-06 Playtime 18h 59m Rec Positive One great Metroidvania game, the gameplay and music is stellar. Game is a challenge for sure, though you progress with some patience, practice, and skill. Reminded me of likely it's inspiration. Figuring out some of the progression was challenging.  Certainly highly recommend to any of those interested in the genre.
Date 2017-08-05 Playtime 13h 52m Rec Positive There are some legitimate gripes to be had with Axiom Verge, like: [*] that controls can be a tad finicky once you have certain abilities later in the game [*] that having so many weapons makes progress feel a tad stale [*] that the nuances of the story may not be abundantly clear even at game end  Personally, I would have liked a few more bosses, too, but I won't nit and pick to a huge degree, because Axiom Verge is really a great game. Very much feels like something that could have been a huge SNES hit. It deserves the "Metroidvania" descriptor more than many games I've seen get it. It's a lot of fun and makes backtracking rewarding - if you try to figure out all the secrets in the game by yourself you'll be at it for a while.  It's hard, but if you like hard games it might be for you.
Date 2017-08-05 Playtime 16h 13m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a fantastic prime example of a Metroidvania game. It has cool enemies, amazing music, an interesting story, mysterious characters, good level designs, lots of secrets and puzzles, replay value and nifty mechanics such as hacking enemies to weaken them or to use them as platforms.  These attributes all come together to form an awesome video game with a great atmosphere which is lots of fun to play.  Everyone who likes Metroid(vania) games will love this, and everyone who never played a game of these sorts should give this piece of art at least a try. But I must say that everything is kinda confusing at first, so that might scare some people off, but they will surely get the hang of it as the game gets more consistent after the first hour of playing.  And even if you bought this and it's not your cup of tea, at least you can be assured that you didn't throw your money out the window, as the single (!!!!) person who made this entire game needs it to buy medicaments etc. for his son with Kernicterus. Hats off to Tom Happ, as he still took his time to make such a well thought-out gaming experience in such trying times.    
Date 2017-08-05 Playtime 11h 51m Rec Positive Si te gusta Metroid te va a gustar Axiom Verge.
Date 2017-08-05 Playtime 2h 44m Rec Positive Underrated game towards nearly all mainstream gamers and most wont give it a chance. I think its a dope title to play and own. This beats out all the other metroidvania style games so far for sure. Put this game on your wishlist and dont underestimate its potential or you will be greatly disappointed.
Date 2017-08-04 Playtime 10h 22m Rec Positive I'm not very familiar with the genre, but I can say that it is worth playing. Good gameplay and ambiance overall.
Date 2017-08-04 Playtime 25h 5m Rec Positive Es un juego muy bueno, ami me encantan estos juegos tipo "Metroid", la historia tambien es buena aunque un poco confusa pero tampoco llega a ser mala, solo tengo un problema con este juego y es que no sabes a donde ir y yo se que la mayoria de este tipo de juegos son asi pero no vendria mal tener un indicador de adonde ir en el mapa, pero dejando eso de lado, es un juego que lo tiene todo: sountrack excelente, historia buena y mas que nada graficos de antaño, asi que te lo recomiendo altamente y si esta en oferta no dudes en comprarlo.
Date 2017-08-04 Playtime 32h 3m Rec Positive Not a big fan of Metroid but Axiom Verge got me hooked from the pixel designs and soundtracks.   Gameplay is pretty fine but can be a bit frustrating on my side (since my timing is bad).  I like the big heads. They are really cool  ?? I'm not sure why am I attracted to them.  I would call this game a game that I should have played in my childhood.
Date 2017-08-04 Playtime 11h 40m Rec Positive Very Solid Game! Enjoyed the boss fights, the music and the story really made this a great experience for me!
Date 2017-08-04 Playtime 13h 54m Rec Positive The finest metroidvania I have ever played. The art style is fantastic, the music is incredible, and the story is pretty interesting.
Date 2017-08-03 Playtime 14h 21m Rec Positive This is not a mere Metroidvania. This game is a love letter to all things Metroid. It has all the pieces: power-ups, new abilities, and even includes a deep and rich lore within the game that you have to explore to unlock, ala Dark Souls. The only negative I could level against it is the game rarely goes on sale. So is it worth your hard-earned dollars? Check out my video review to find out!  https://youtu.be/tqq7mTxw7fo
Date 2017-08-02 Playtime 10h 35m Rec Positive It was good
Date 2017-08-01 Playtime 31h 39m Rec Positive At first I thought this was just a weak Super Metroid clone, but after an hour or two of gameplay it really starts to come into its own. Excellent gameplay, great music, and a surprisingly complex and well thought out story. Totally worth the full price. Axiom verge KICKS ASS!  10/10
Date 2017-08-01 Playtime 20h 46m Rec Positive 10/10  AMAZING, this game is on point and is as good if not better, than actual Metroid games.
Date 2017-07-31 Playtime 21h 47m Rec Positive Axiom Verge est un titre étrange, vaguement inquiétant, dont les pixels et le coté pour le moins "organique" rebuteraient presque... Sauf qu'il y a les musiques envoutantes (l'intro, le chant indien...), des armes variées à foison, dont une géniale qui fait buguer les ennemis, des décors à l'esthétique singulière, Elsenova...  Moi qui ne suis pas très flingues ni explosions d'aliens, j'ai franchement adoré ce jeu. Bien sur il vaut mieux aimer un minimum l'esprit rétro, certes l'histoire est un peu cryptique et on se sent souvent très seul... mais ce jeu a un truc, il sait devenir hyper prenant, nous baladant sans jamais vraiment nous perdre. On a toujours quelque chose à aller chercher, une zone pas vraiment passée au crible, et puis on veut connaitre le mot de la fin, le secret de ce monde hypnotique et oppressant.  Si je devais pointer quelques défauts (vite pardonnés), ce serait la difficulté des boss assez inégale (certains vraiment faciles, d'autres qui nous en font pas mal baver, bien qu'il y ait toujours un point faible), le fait de devoir parcourir de longs couloirs en sens inverse pour retourner chercher des items (meme si évidemment ça augmente la durée de vie) et peut-etre l'histoire que certains auraient aimée un peu plus racontée, plutot qu'à décrypter à travers des notes éparpillées dans les diverses zones, meme si pour le coup c'est une affaire de gout.  Le gameplay est simple mais riche : outre les tonnes d'armes, on gagne pas mal d'aptitudes assez cools, déblocables moyennant un peu de sueur, avec une progression très bien dosée, un peu à la manière de Castlevania - Symphony of the night.  Il y a peu d'ennemis vraiment tactiques hormis 1 ou 2 boss, donc le jeu est relativement facile pour les habitués mais juste bien pour les joueurs plus amateurs qui pourront profiter de l'ambiance sans se faire descendre toutes les 2 secondes.  Si vous aimez alien, Metroid et les "metroidvania", la sf en général, les ambiances entre reve et réalité, et à moins d'etre vraiment allergique aux jeux 2D old school, faites le saut jusqu'à Sudra, Athetos et les Rusalki...
Date 2017-07-30 Playtime 10h 30m Rec Positive Awesome!
Date 2017-07-30 Playtime 11h 38m Rec Positive While its visual style is pure Metroid-homage, its weapons and mechanics and movement-abilities are fresh and distinct. It's a worthy addition to the genre.  It doesn't completely rise to the level of the classics. Its bosses are somewhat sub-par and its endgame content feels more muddled with less of a clear vision. At this price-point, though, you can't have everything.
Date 2017-07-30 Playtime 14h 1m Rec Positive It took me 13 hours and 133 deaths to finish it on my first playthrough. Is it difficult or am I noob? Grab it and play it.. it's EPIC. IMPORTANT NOTE: You must take breaks otherwise your thumb will be swollen if you play it on an Xbox One controller.
Date 2017-07-28 Playtime 6h 52m Rec Positive If you loved Super Metroid, you'll love this game, if you haven't played Super Metroid, go play Super Metroid.
Date 2017-07-27 Playtime 21h 33m Rec Positive As other reviewers have stated, this game is quite a bit like Metroid.  The story is pretty engaging as well as the gameplay.  Fairly challenging at certain points in the game.  The artwork and soundtrack are a nice addition as well.  I would definitely recommend picking this one up if you enjoy the Metroid series at all.
Date 2017-07-26 Playtime 30h 47m Rec Positive A great game whit a surreal ambience and music that perfectly supports the exploration of this cybernetic alien world made of stone, ancient temples, metal, circuits and flesh pulsating whit life.
Date 2017-07-26 Playtime 21h 54m Rec Positive I liked this game a lot. It has a lot of the feel of your typical Metroidvania kind of game, and a nice goopy aesthetic, but it incorporates the glitchy, wonky feeling of old games from that era, that it leans into.  I got to the penultimate boss, and that's where I had to tap out. Still, there's a lot of exploration and fun to be had on the way, and it rarely left me feeling totally lost.
Date 2017-07-26 Playtime 25h 16m Rec Positive A very balanced and polished game with no obvious weak points. Nice graphics with a lot of variety, plethora of weapons, upgrades and tools to find, a great variety of enemies and bosses and lots of secrets to look for. What's there more to want? Cool music? Check. Engaging story with plot twists and moral ambiguity? Check. If you're looking for a fun metroidvania-style game, you'll definitely enjoy Axiom Verge.
Date 2017-07-25 Playtime 20h 17m Rec Positive Jogão Da P***a
Date 2017-07-23 Playtime 30h 5m Rec Positive Эта игра изменит ваше сознание.
Date 2017-07-23 Playtime 30h 3m Rec Positive Very well-crafted metroid inspired game. Nice retro feeling, amazing art, solid and innovative gameplay. EDIT: Turns out the developer can't be hold responsible if you bite keys off your keyboard or break your game controller against the wall, so yeah... take a deep breath instead or something...
Date 2017-07-23 Playtime 10h 46m Rec Positive They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Thomas must really like Metroid. A few issues keep it from getting the perfect score though.  + The exploration part is just perfect. Every corner hides something, from simple powerups to world-scale enigmas + Huge variety of abilities and weapons, with the classic Metroid movement progression + Pixel art is gorgeous and perfectly Metroid-ish + Same goes for the music, with a few exceptions + Despite the above the game manages to maintain its own identity in both gameplay and story  - The combat part, however, could be better. Bosses often have a single attack and are easily cheesed - Low overall difficulty, even if i chose the "hard mode" - Controls quickly become really cluttered... like in Metroid. Too many unintentional teleports - No 21:9 support is sad  4/5
Date 2017-07-22 Playtime 12h 51m Rec Positive I can recommend to people who liked Super Metroid. Made by one guy, the combat is decent and retro, and there's a big map to explore with lots of areas to come back to. It falls short in level design - spent hours searching for where to go next. Lots of backtracking, and the boss design is pretty bad. Still worth it though!
Date 2017-07-21 Playtime 15h 28m Rec Positive Great game. Really addicting. I love exploring the world looking for what to do next. And the game is hard, but not so hard that I wind up hating it and quit playing, like some recent platformers in this genre.
Date 2017-07-21 Playtime 9h 22m Rec Positive Axiom Verge was a pretty good game. The pixel graphics were only decent in my opinion but they fit in very well into the whole theme/atmosphere of the game. The same can be said about the music, which was nice, but not very catchy. The game has a good length for a Metroidvania and a good mapsize. Because the game doesn't give you any hints where to go next, if you don't perfectly memorise the obstacles you passed so far, you will probably spend a while with backtracking.  The definitely best part of the game were the abilities. The game features very unique weapons and exploration tools, although most of the weapons are optional and didn't seem especially useful to me either... At best, they made a boss or a few enemies easier, at worst they were just a more complicated way to fight enemies, since the main weapon is still decently powerful. Still, they brought an interesting spin to the standard ranged weapons seen in Metroidvanias. And the exploration tools really made up most of the charm of the game for me. The story was ok. It didn't really captivate me, but it made for a few interesting moments. Overall, it's a game I would really recommend to every Metroidvania-fan for it's unique ideas on the tools. And it's definitely also worth a look for others. 8/10
Date 2017-07-20 Playtime 19h 4m Rec Positive Очень крутая игра в стиле metroidvania, долго подобную искал
Date 2017-07-20 Playtime 25h 10m Rec Positive One of the best games i've played in years.  Strong Metroid vibe, but while still feelint like a new thing.
Date 2017-07-20 Playtime 14h 40m Rec Positive PI K
Date 2017-07-20 Playtime 14h 37m Rec Positive I loved this game. Its got a great story (albiet a bit confusing/lacking), amazing controls, and amazing music. This game has replay value just for sound track alone. If you love metroid you'll love this.
Date 2017-07-19 Playtime 45h 5m Rec Positive for the 30-somethings out there, it's like a mix between the gamplay of metroid 2 on gameboy, the color and aesthetics of the original on nes, and the feel of both. it's got a pretty good engaging and retro soundtrack, updated mechanics and items, a few expanded movement and weapon options (upgrades), and a handy dandy mini-map. worth the asking price (i mean i guess, at least having played it through already. the developers deserve it, anyway), but i bought it on sale and definitely relished the extra value i got because of that.
Date 2017-07-18 Playtime 24h 31m Rec Positive Great plot, but the graphics are eye gougingly flourescent awful.
Date 2017-07-18 Playtime 1h 26m Rec Negative The combat is tedious, which makes the exploration aspect of the game annoying. Boss fights are okay but the rest of the game is pretty meh.
Date 2017-07-18 Playtime 11h 4m Rec Positive Really great game, I highly recommand for any metroidVania fan out there ! Worth every penny.
Date 2017-07-17 Playtime 29h 2m Rec Positive THE STORY!!! THE STORY!!!! THIS GAME KNOWS HOW TO LEAVE QUESTIONS AND MAKE YOU WONDER!   i mostly bought this game for being a metroidvania, but its so much better.  the art style goes back to the classic and the music is amazing, but the power ups are unique and amzing to use and its just so fun to explore the woeird and messed up world your in as you try to just figure out why?  i would recomend this only to certain people, but those people? IT WILL TAKE THEM OVER!!!
Date 2017-07-17 Playtime 3h 53m Rec Negative I have tried twice now to play this game and bot times I have stopped early on.  Its not that its a bad game, its just that I dont enjoy what I am doing.  The weapons have very little variety and are almost completely useless.  They all do variations of the same thing and the enemies are all effected the same. I know I know, how do you make guns do different things in a game like this.  Just look at Final Doom, the original series.  There were 6 guns and a melee attack, every weapon shot bullets you couldnt even see most of the time, but in the end the enemies were all killed by certain weapons better.  The game design was perfect.  That is not the case here, the combat is boring, and the exploration is not fun or interesting like it is in better games.  The music is seriously sweet though.
Date 2017-07-16 Playtime 0h 48m Rec Positive Чистокровный Metroid - неплохой и денег своих стоит.  Что не понравилось:  - оружия много, но большая часть бесполезна. Базовая винтовка + оружие бьющие зеленой молнией по площади - это все что реально нужно; остальное побаловаться. - боссы - симпатичные, но слабые и скучные, за исключением последнего - уже  первой трети игры вы станете слишком сильным, умирать будете по невнимательности или усталости (игра очень длинная) - очень субъектнивно, но мне не нравиться "анимация" смерти врагов  Что понравилось:  + Стиль выдержан безупречно. Если бы Контру делали сейчас, примерно так ей стоило бы выглядеть. + Глитч пушка: применяя на врагов - меняете их свойства: одни перестают стрелять и превращаются в платформы, другие становятся живыми снарядами. Конечно проще расстрелять, но все равно любопытно. + Музыка, хотя приедается быстро. + сюжет - в рамках жанра очень даже достойный
Date 2017-07-16 Playtime 25h 28m Rec Positive Axiom Verge è un Metroidvania indie creato nell'arco di 5 anni da una singola persona, Tom Happ. Da grande fan del genere, Happ ha voluto riempire il gioco con rimandi all'ovvio Metroid per NES e con altri tocchi presi dagli arcade dell'epoca: grafica in pixel-art, certe armi, qualche nemico e musiche perfettamente in stile con quelle 8 bit che i fanatici (come il sottoscritto) hanno imparato a conoscere ed amare.  Il gioco è sicuramente un buon prodotto, sia per quanto riguarda la trama (stranamente articolata) che per il gameplay, anche se purtroppo AV ha lo "svantaggio" (se di svantaggio si può parlare) di essere fin troppo hardcore nell'idea alla base. A differenza dei moderni Metroidvania, nessuno vi tiene la mano, non c'è nessun nav-point per le location utili alla missione, niente indicazioni che facilitino la vita a chi punta al 100% dei segreti (nemmeno un indicatore percentuale), se non qualche misteriosa "lucina" in un angolo della mappa (non voglio dire troppo)... e sicuramente non vi verrà detto come usare certi ammennicoli che troverete strada facendo. L'azione si riassume in un continuo avanti e indietro per zone già visitate non appena si trova un nuovo potere, esattamente come accadeva negli anni '90. La cosa potrebbe divertire i fan più sfegatati o coloro che sono abituati al genere, ma snervare chi invece cerca qualcosa di più "leggero" e arcade, o più in generale al passo coi tempi. Continuando coi diifetti, non posso non citare il controllo: per certe mosse avrei evitato l'uso di vecchi sistemi, soprattutto il doppio tap per il teletrasporto. Oggigiorno gli stick analogici non permettono una rapida reazione per questo genere di movimento e la loro eccessiva precisione non gioca a nostro favore. Usando il pad del 360 mi sono dovuto appoggiare alla croce direzionale per andare esattamente nella direzione che volevo e non 10 gradi più in su o più in giù, come capitava invece con l'analogico. Oltretutto la limitata possibilità di riconfigurare i controlli non migliora certamente le cose... Ma si tratta di farci l'abitudine, alla fine. Personalmente ho trovato AV un'apprezzabile sfida e un bel tuffo nel passato, ma vi do un consiglio: non sottovalutate l'importanza dell'[b]Address Disruptor[/b] per cambiare la "natura" dei nemici, e il [b]Passcode Tool[/b] con i relativi codici da trovare! Avrete alcuni indizi nei diari sparsi in giro e la loro scoperta è una sorta di sottogioco che aprirà passaggi e stanze segrete contenenti nuove armi (ce ne sono una ventina in totale!), bonus vita, ecc. Tutte cose che vi faranno comodo contro i numerosi Boss.  [i]PS:[/i] Per i super nerd, provate a inserire il codice JUSTIN-BAILEY, l'originale cheat di Metroid per NES che permetteva di giocare con Samus Aran in costume da bagno... ;-D
Date 2017-07-15 Playtime 12h 32m Rec Positive Great gameplay, many different weapons, original items and lots of secrets! This is good metroidvania! Too bad the artistic direction isn't more inspired though: the hero is generic and lack charisma, and the game globally lacks a truely unique identity.
Date 2017-07-15 Playtime 17h 38m Rec Positive Truly a great metroidvania games, one of the best ones I had played in a while. I don't think it has much replayability, or at the very least I don't think I'll ever go back to the game, but it's definitely one of those games that will keep you hooked til the very end. It had a good story and such. Plus I mean hey, not many games out there where you get to play as Doc Oc.
Date 2017-07-14 Playtime 12h 8m Rec Positive Un metroidvania de lujo, con un buen diseño, habilidades, una atmósfera oscura, una trama que es algo extraña. En resumen, despiertas en un mundo extraño y te vas enterando de a poco de que va todo, tiene buenos elementos de diseño, muchas opciones para tu arma principal aunque muchas la verdad se ven algo inútiles, salvo en momentos muy específicos, pero generalmente usarás los mismos recursos para enfrentar a los enemigos, también el juego tiene muchos lugares medio secretos, o poderes escondidos lo cual extiende el tiempo de juego para descubrirlo todo. Buen juego plataformero, pero mucho más importante , un gran metroidvania, si te gusta este tipo de juegos, DEBES tener Axiom Verge en tu biblioteca. Impresionante que solo lo haya hecho una persona, como punto débil, los enemigos son poco carismáticos, en especial los jefes y los escenarios suelen ser muy similares entre sí, como que no te puedes ubicar muy bien solo por ver en que escenario te ecuentras como sí ocurre con otros juegos similares, eso se traduce en consultar el mapa con frecuencia.  8.5/10
Date 2017-07-14 Playtime 34h 16m Rec Positive *hella* dope
Date 2017-07-13 Playtime 39h 51m Rec Positive All I can say is, wow. This game, while very controversial, is probably one of my favorite metroidvanias. It captures the feel of metroid perfectly, and even improves on some of the things I didn't like about other games in this genre. I'd say definitely pick this game up if you're a fan of this genre. Even if you're not a fan of metroidvanias, it's still a joy to play. Now, there are a couple issues I had with the game, so I'll go ahead and list a couple of pros and cons now: Pros: Tight and responsive controls(especially with a controller) A soundtrack that I found even better than Super Metroid's(edit, my opinion has changed on this recently) A whole lot of weapons and upgrades Plenty of replayability A diverse group of enemies and bosses It doesn't wear itself out with about a 10-15 hour experience A beautiful art style The story's pretty good  Cons: The ending had a lot of missed potential Ukhu variant(oh my god that boss was horribly unfun) The game randomly left full screen every now and then, although that's probably my computer's fault The trench coat and red coat are a pain to use while in midair Some of the weapons are pretty useless
Date 2017-07-13 Playtime 16h 32m Rec Positive Un super jeu dans la lignée des premiers Metroid en 2D. Ambiance soignée, bande son aux petits oignons et écriture riche en rebondissements. Les items et armes sont très diversifiés et bien cachés dans l'ensemble du jeu pour donner du challenge aux 100% lovers. La difficulté est plutôt élevée même en normal (ou alors je suis vraiment trop nul...) ce qui rend le jeu encore plus attirant pour ma part. A acheter les yeux fermer pour les fans de Samus !
Date 2017-07-13 Playtime 26h 1m Rec Positive Well, it's a good game, i found it really detailed and well polished in all directions: gameplay, sound, plot (only a bit vague but open for speculations), design (metroidvania style with lots of new elements) and even difficulty. You will probably die and get lost a lot only to find new mindfu... mindblowing ways to proceed, guides will be helpfull some times. Trust me. It was really fun to play, all in all an 8/10 is well earned. Just play it and git gud,
Date 2017-07-11 Playtime 47h 7m Rec Positive As a former classic NES Metroid fan, this game totally hit the spot.
Date 2017-07-11 Playtime 12h 57m Rec Positive finally a game that earns and deserves the label "metroidvania" but despite that there are flaws such as  - the drone is a fairly weak (in terms of design) morph ball replacement  - there are too many weapons and items (the majority of which are optional and/or not useful), which dilutes the excitement from getting new gear. additionally they all just do damage; which one you use is a matter of preference or the enemies you are fighting, meaning the majority of them go unused   - when new abilities give you access to new areas, it isn't always clear where those areas are. i do not mean in a typical Metroid way, where maybe you think back or examine the map and have to explore. consider that in traditional metroidvanias a new weapon or item instantly instructs you in how to use it and what it can open/allow you to access; in Axiom Verge, this is rarely the case. the level design doesnt lend itself to that kind of analysis very often (except in cases like the drone ability)   - AV marks the map screen when you have fully explored an area, and when you have found all items in an area, but unlike most 2D Metroids, it will not tell you about items in rooms--either that one exists, or that you've found it. this makes collecting everything extremely tedious  - similar to above, there is a dire lack of late-game shortcuts that makes exploring the game very slow and frustrating. late game abilities in metroidvanias usually open shortcuts, but here they largely do not open anything of importance. teleporters might just be ideal for this game  - certain enemies (fireflies? bats? birds?) are tiny, have high HP, dive bomb you relentlessly, and do obscene amounts of damage to you. in many areas of the game i was dying a lot not because i was where i shouldn't have been, or because i was using the wrong weapon, or because i was bad, but because the number and difficulty of enemies attacking me was a little absurd for the amount of damage i was taking.  - the main character looks exactly like any random Generic Male from any random Generic Video Game Comic  despite these, the story is interesting enough, the music is fantastic, and the ending is satisfying while leaving room for a sequel--where i hope many of this issues will be improved upon. at no time during play is it clear that one person made this game by himself.  it's alright
Date 2017-07-11 Playtime 16h 17m Rec Positive This game made me remember how good Super Metroid was.  The only thing i didn't like too much was the music. But i put it at minimum and it didn't bothered me too much. It's a really well made game. Couldn't stop playing untill the end. Can't imagine how a single person could do this. Just incredible.
Date 2017-07-11 Playtime 26h 18m Rec Positive 5/5 Clearly one of the best metroidvania titles I have played in years.
Date 2017-07-10 Playtime 17h 45m Rec Positive For everyone that followed my adventure on Twitch / youtube you know how much I love/hate this game. While it had some excellent things going for it there were equal amount of issues. A great soundtrack that became boring after time, many areas, but none very memorable, a ton of weapons, only 1 or 2 worth using, very little story, but they tried to force a lot of plot into it. There's pros and cons, I got it on summer sale for $10, cant say it's worth regular price though. Still a memorable game nonetheless.
Date 2017-07-10 Playtime 17h 15m Rec Positive Fantastic Metroid style game: fun gameplay, plenty of hours of content, and the best damn videogame soundtrack i've ever heard. Definitely worth picking up. 
Date 2017-07-09 Playtime 18h 40m Rec Positive Crank up the volume and enjoy THE best Super Metroid successor.  Awesome soundtrack. Awesome pixel graphics. Awesome control. Awesome map.  Thank you Tom Happ.
Date 2017-07-09 Playtime 10h 11m Rec Positive Breathtaking. To make a game that captures the feel of Super Metroid better than the original, without borrowing any of the abilities and design of that game barring essential ones, and to do it all by himself.   I feel like this game belongs on a record of somekind.  9.7/10
Date 2017-07-09 Playtime 37h 20m Rec Positive Really good Metroid-like game with sci-fi deep story and heavenly soundtrack.
Date 2017-07-09 Playtime 25h 8m Rec Positive One of the best Metriodvanias I've ever played! Do get this title if you like any of the 2-D Metroid games.
Date 2017-07-08 Playtime 22h 30m Rec Positive Absolutely amazing metroidvania - it has so much of the feel from the old metroid games. Highly recommended.
Date 2017-07-08 Playtime 11h 0m Rec Positive [h1][Introduction][/h1] I haven’t touched a 2D metroid game in ages and so I was pleasantly surprised by how similar this game is. “Nintendo seems to have forgotten about Metroid” is what I would’ve written just a few weeks ago, but the recent announcements of Metroid Prime 4 and Samus Returns have made me very happy. While having completely different characters, storyline and mechanics than my beloved franchise, this game managed to seduce me almost immediately and reminded me pleasantly about good old days long gone.  As with all of my reviews, these are my own opinions and experiences; please check out other reviews too!  [h1][Negatives][/h1] The eight-directional shooting system lets you shoot down and diagonally downwards only after you jumped, are in the state of falling down, or hold a button to lock your movement and shoot in any desired direction. While this might be alright for most of the game, there are some bosses and situations made harder because of this limitation.  There is only one boss battle theme, played across all of the game’s bosses, making them much less epic than they could’ve been. I’m not asking for one for each boss but a couple of them would’ve been nice to spice things up.  [h1][Gameplay][/h1] Discover 23 different obtainable weapons, each with their own firing arc, range, and damage values. You can also find permanent passive power ups (increased weapon damage, bullet range, health, etc) and there are 16 different upgrades where each one will change the gameplay in some way or another which keeps things fresh pretty much through the whole game. Access previously unreachable places or use them to advance in the story. Two things I want to highlight are the ability to hack enemies to render them harmless or make them vulnerable to your attacks, and an interesting way of glitching through certain walls which opens a lot of opportunities for secrets and hidden paths.  Several save points spread across the the map let you save your progress, regenerate health and ammo, while setting a point to revive in the case of death. Dying in this game will not reset your progress but instead respawn all enemies and breakable objects.  Axiom throws over 60 different enemy types at you and new ones will often surprise you with fresh attack patterns and steadily increasing damage. It also kindly invites you to 10 different boss battles that will keep you on your toes, a good mix stationary and mobile designs, and a few of them are quite harsh but still doable.  Finally I’ll mention how well the game utilizes the controller, with each and every button having it’s own purpose for a good variety of gameplay mechanics.  [h1][Graphics/Art][/h1] A 2D art style that could be ripped right out of Super Metroid just with a higher resolution. While beautiful to look at, a creepy and mysterious atmosphere is stretched throughout thanks to the eerie backgrounds.  [h1][Music][/h1] Just like the graphics, the chiptune soundtrack offers mysterious but energetic vibes that approach frightening at times. Some tracks even feel like they’d fit in a new Metroid game, and the whole thing just fits the game so well, it's unbelieveable.  [url=https://axiomverge.bandcamp.com/releases]Checkout the composer's website for a preview![/url]   [h1][Story][/h1] Definitely the weak point. Not by being lame or cheesy, but just because of how it’s presented. It starts out with a very mysterious premise but loses it’s focus near the middle and tries to grab it back at the end. It barely works but it’s sufficient enough to give the game a passable ending.  [h1][Conclusion][/h1] Clearly inspired by the Metroid franchise, Axiom Verge is a metroidvania through and through, where one slowly explores a large and mysterious world while finding abilities, weapons and tools that let you access previously unreachable places with each new item.  I recommend this game to fans of the 2D metroid and metroidvania genres. I also highly recommend checking it out if you are drawn in by what you see on the store page.  [code] Enjoyed this review?

Date 2017-07-08 Playtime 12h 33m Rec Positive Jogo muito bom, um otimo "super metroid" atual, pra quem curte toda a saga de Metroid, vai gostar do jogo. O que me deixou a desejar, são as armas e equipamentos, poderia melhorar, fazer mais parecido com Metroid, mas em si, o jogo é otimo.
Date 2017-07-08 Playtime 37h 13m Rec Positive Uma experiência Metroidesca em tudo, exceto mome e estória!   Se Isto já seria o bastante para recomendar o jogo, não espere para viajar em um mundo alienígena sem igual que vai te prender também pela música e muitos efeitos sonoros das antigas. Ainda tem a maestria da fórmula, tudo envolto de uma estória sci-fi das mais alucinadas!  Parabéns Tom Happ! E parabéns para quem aprecia esta maravilha do mundo dos games!
Date 2017-07-07 Playtime 69h 16m Rec Positive increible para ser desarrollado por una sola persona, dificil, canciones increibles, jafes originales, una buena historia y un pixel art increible. El final te deja con ganas de una secuela lo recomiendo al 100%

Date 2017-07-06 Playtime 74h 1m Rec Positive Fantástico, ideal para los amantes de la era 90era de los videojuegos, con todos los vicios que trae, graficos de 16 fantásticos mezclados con efectos visuales más modernos de forma muy acertiva, plataformero inspirado en Metroid, donde se huele la influencia por todas partes, aunque sabe tomar una historia que se ha contado varias veces, y recontarla con gracia.  Pros: • Gráficos de 16 bits espectaculares • Musica atmosférica ad-hoc para cada momento del juego • Mapa estilo "Metroidvania" al que ya estamos familiarizados  Cons: • Sin sistema de autosave, por lo que morir puede significar volver a hacer un tramo nuy largo (contra que puede jugar a favor de hacer sentir este juego más noventero)  Nota Final:  9,5/10
Date 2017-07-06 Playtime 11h 57m Rec Positive Eines der besten Metroidvania. Geile Musik, spaßiges backtracking wenn man eine neue Fähigkeit/Waffe gefunden hat und tolle Bosskämpfe. Kann ich jeden empfehlen der 2D Metroids liebt.
Date 2017-07-06 Playtime 15h 3m Rec Positive Gorgeous Horror-based game.
Date 2017-07-06 Playtime 8h 29m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvanias ever made.   I'm not someone who has played the old Metroid games; metroidvanias in general I don't play very often. But this game is just so perfectly well-crafted that if you even have the slightest interest in games like this I'd reccomend you give it a try.  (nothisisntadetailedreviewjustwanttoaddtothepositivereviewpileforthemostpart)
Date 2017-07-06 Playtime 10h 58m Rec Positive I have this strong urge to bind "double tap directional button" to "reload last save" and make the developer play through it. Other than that pretty solid metroidvania.
Date 2017-07-06 Playtime 598h 10m Rec Positive A long time ago, I discovered the joys of a game named Ironblood, a 2D MS-DOS side-scroller in which you pilot one of two different mechs through tough waves of enemy robots and cyborgs, gaining new weapons and power-ups.  It was always good to unwind after a tough day at work, blasting pixels into oblivion.  But it always seemed like it needed something more--maybe more exploration and a bit less button-mashing trigger-happy bullet-hell.  Ironblood was the closest I ever came to any metroidvania style games.  In comes Axiom Verge, nearly a decade after the last time I seriously played Ironblood, and it was just what the doctor ordered!  There's enough blasting and shooting to satisfy my trigger-happy side, with enough exploration and puzzle-solving as a bonus.  I remember wanting this game two years ago when it first came to Steam, watching the reviews and thinking just how cool it looked.  Retro graphics give it a nice "console-era" feel, along with synthetic beats that feel like classic chip-tunes.  I must say that Axiom Verge impresses me on so many levels.  If only Steam had star-ratings, I'd give Axiom Verge the full 7 out of 5 stars it deserves!
Date 2017-07-05 Playtime 14h 35m Rec Positive Axiom Verge... because I don't know a Metroid so good I'll say: "Axiom Verge is like Commander Keer who met Giger, Metal Mutant and Biomaniac + added a lot of quite a good stuff." Simply = 2D action game ...with interesting story, weapons, abilities, level design and boss battles. I've really enjoyed this game... except one boss battle where I died for 12 times : )  I am seeing only one bad thing about this game... sometimes you don't get immediately where should You go. But everything else is good in this game.
Date 2017-07-05 Playtime 14h 39m Rec Positive Quem curte Supermetroid, recomendo esse jogo.
Date 2017-07-05 Playtime 23h 42m Rec Positive Ah, reminds me the good old days, looking to find secret passages in every block. A very good and unique metroidvania.
Date 2017-07-05 Playtime 11h 34m Rec Positive A very good not-Metroid
Date 2017-07-05 Playtime 14h 43m Rec Negative Enemies are difficult and repetitive, and so are bosses. Boss attack patterns are extremely predictable, long, and repetitive. Each boss only has one single attack, which just gets faster and faster. The fights are a battle of patience. Some even have areas where you are completely invulnerable, but you can still hit the boss. Then it's just a matter of shooting the boss, while it gets redder and redder until it explodes. Zero variety, it's just annoying after a while.  Total completion is near impossible because the map is worthless, and secret areas are randomized for each run.
Date 2017-07-05 Playtime 12h 17m Rec Positive Bueno, Bonito, Barato, no ocupas saber mas para comprarlo
Date 2017-07-05 Playtime 13h 1m Rec Positive Axiom verge is a fun and challenging metroidvania that i would recommend
Date 2017-07-05 Playtime 13h 20m Rec Positive So, it's a very fun game gameplay wise. I [i]kinda[/i] like that most bosses have a simple cycle that you perform to beat them and some even have a way to be cheesed heavily. There's lot of little techniques I discovered along the game. Some were helpful like a certain glitch with the swinging rope and some not so helpful such as stepping forward and shooting at the same time makes your bullet travel faster. One thing I did not like was how I had to run around so much to find the next place to go. Perhaps I've had my hand held too much by recent games, but it seemed I never knew where to go after a certain point. This does, however, force you to discover a lot of secrets and hidden powerups/weapons. Fun game, good game.
Date 2017-07-04 Playtime 10h 9m Rec Positive Really enjoed this game. Solid level design had me rarely feeling loss even with its heavy backtracking. As an example, there's an object in the world you can't bypass that's really visuallly distinct and looks like broken pixels on a monitor. Later in the game you'll gain a power that lets you destroy these barriers. Rather than feeling lost on where to go next, I remembered these glitched out pixels and knew I could now return there and advance to a new zone. I never once  felt  like I needed a strategy guide to figure out what to do next.   One complaint: a lot of the secret bonus weapons you can find are kind of useless.
Date 2017-07-04 Playtime 8h 26m Rec Positive Junte todos os elementos que um Metroidvania deve ter, adicione ficção científica, uma história excelente, uma boa variedade de upgrades, bastantes segredos e áreas secretas, puzzles excelentes e personagens fodas, bata tudo e o resultado será Axiom Verge.
Date 2017-07-04 Playtime 19h 44m Rec Positive This game is an incredible blast of nostalgia. It's got the look and feel of Super Metroid with an equally great soundtrack, playstyle and the same kind of piece by piece storyline that makes you run through the labyrinth because you want to know more!!!

Date 2017-07-04 Playtime 24h 9m Rec Positive [h1]Qualidade de jogo de primeira linha por preço de indie. Eu compraria no preço cheio se soubesse que era tão bom.[/h1]  Fazia tempo que eu não engolia tão rápido um jogo como engoli esse. Tanto que devo jogar novamente no hard pra mastigar melhor.  Sou suspeito pra falar por ser um fã de longa data de Metroid e Castlevania e apaixonado por Metroidvanias, mas esse jogo foi claramente feito com paixão aos detalhes, uma avalanche de referências a inúmeras séries sci-fi, uma caralhada de inspiração principalmente para as armas e uma dose cavalar de playtest pro tanto de possibilidades que os equipamentos do jogo possibilitam. Fiquei surpreso de não ter sido atacado por uma chuva de bugs.  Todas essas qualidades são amalgamadas em um produto final:  [list]     [*]Extremamente bem polido e cujas possibilidades mostram que foi bem testado     [*]Com ótima dificuldade mesmo no normal, que recompensam movimentação e uso adequado de armas     [*]Com ótimos controles, que raramente irão te fustrar e respondem bem a sua intenção.     [*]De Trilha sonora excelente. Te consome dentro do universo que o jogo propõe e casa perfeitamente com a ambientação alienígena     [*]Com Ambientação rica: os cenários parecem fracos e copiados de Metroid no começo e vão ficando mais e mais inspirados, originais e são peça-chave pra contar a história do jogo [/list]  Fora isso, tenho que dizer que o jogo surpreende [b]MUITO[/b] com uma história profunda envolvendo ciência, filosofia, cyberpunk e religião que no começo parece fraquíssima e vai te soltando pistas do que de fato está acontecendo e te cativando de uma forma impressionante. O desenrolar e o desfecho são tão abertos a interpretação que precisei ler alguns artigos e wikis na net depois pra entender melhor o que se passou. Não leia nada antes de jogar, o processo de descobrimento das verdades do jogo é excelente e tem ótimos plot twists.  Sugestões: Compre tranquilo e curta o jogo sem usar guias, boa parte da diversão é quebrar a cabeça quando você tá travado e perdendo algum detalhe bobo pra progredir. Você [b]NUNCA[/b] estará preso e o jogo não vai ficar te dando dicas do que fazer! Geralmente passará um tempo se matando pra achar o caminho e depois pensará [b]"como fui burro, era só fazer isso"[/b], e seguirá em frente. Quando terminar, fique tranquilo que você poderá jogar à vontade pra completar 100% se quiser, usando o último save point antes do chefe final. Porém, esteja avisado, o jogo tem desfecho diferente dependendo do seu progresso de mapa e de aquisição de itens e também muda se tiver terminado no hard. Se quiser começar tempo, comece no hard, você toma um pouco mais de dano dos inimigos e os inimigos droppam menos vida, mas dá pra seguir de boa!  Tenha uma ótima jornada!
Date 2017-07-03 Playtime 6h 27m Rec Negative Axiom Verge in a nutshell:  -Derivative gameplay -Derivative music -Unappealing environments  -Myriad weapons that are mostly useless  Metroidvania-esque games are becoming redundant, and Axiom Verge does nothing to help the genre.

Date 2017-07-03 Playtime 18h 3m Rec Positive Seit langem das teuerste Spiel das ich mir auf Steam geleistet habe, aber ich bins recht zufrieden und freue mich auf ein paar Stunden Retro-Genuss. Leider fehlt mir der Controller, aber die Tastatursteuerung ist erträglich umgesetzt.
Date 2017-07-03 Playtime 0h 12m Rec Positive Best kind, for what it is. 5/5
Date 2017-07-02 Playtime 15h 27m Rec Positive so i just completed axiom verge, took me 13 hours and wow, this game is amazing! its a really good, should i say 'spiritual successor to metroid' and im amazing of how well 1 person managed to do all this, thank you so much for this experience  theres A HUGE supply of weapons (if you manage to find them, which you probably wont find all during your first playthrough), a huge amount of powerups and the map is MASSIVE, theres a lot of areas and the game never stops feeling like a metroid game, its all very well designed i would say  theres a fair bit of backtracking, but its rarely too 'required', its more of 'if you want extra power ups, enjoy your backtracking journey' type of thing, and the backtracking is quite fun, especially if your the kind of person who loved the old 2d metroids  the story is above average quality, its interesting and good, though admittedly the main character doesent have much reasons to 'go further' in the early game, as he isnt given a real reason to do anything, but thats fairly minor and the story picks up within a few hours  the controls, especially movements feel a bit 'stiff' but i believe this is intentional and you get used to it fairly quickly within 20 minutes or so  regarding the difficulty level, normal difficulty isnt too difficult, it only took me a few attempts for each boss before i passed it and so i believe most players should definitely go for it, unless your just really bad with a keyboard/controlled (or whatever input device your using)  overall i can say: if you liked the older 2d metroid games, the progression, bosses, backtracking and exploring then you'll love this game! expect to put in 10 to 15 hours for a first playthrough depending on how good you are
Date 2017-07-02 Playtime 25h 54m Rec Positive If you are a fan of the original metroid games this is a good game. It gives you a vague description of what needs to happen but then lets you explore the world on your own. It gives you no sense of direction except for the environmental clues  that you need ohter items to pass through. This game does a good job of emulating the old style metroid games.
Date 2017-07-02 Playtime 15h 0m Rec Positive Great Game, inspirational design, impeccable controls, fantastic music. Play It!
Date 2017-07-02 Playtime 12h 47m Rec Positive As someone who had a NES and played the original Metroid on it, I was never one who was a huge fan of it. I thought Super Metroid on the other hand was a masterpiece.  So I'll just start by saying that if you liked those games, you should pick this game up if it caught your attention. This whole game is heavily influenced by Metroid, from art to gameplay, but that's not to say it's a direct copy.  Gameplay: Tight, responsive controls with the exception of the hookshot -- the hookshot/grappling hook was pretty awkward in Super Metroid, but here it's significantly worse (a good 2D grapple hook example for me would be the Worms rope)... you'll make due though, it's not a major part of the game. There are a ton of guns to find (none of them really required to beat any particular part of the game like the ice-mod was in metroid), ton of secret areas, etc... you'll have a lot to explore, and the map is quite large with your typical backtracking to pick up upgrades. I like to think I'm pretty thorough, and often find all the collectibles, but this game had a lot of well-hidden things, I ended with 77% items. The enemies are quick and vicious, and you can find yourself killed quickly if you're not careful (so the challenge is pretty adequate... I played it on "Normal") -- as compared to Super Metroid where I'm never close to dying. You never get to turn into "God mode" by the end of the game, like many of these kinds of games are (Super Metroid, Castlevania SotN), but you will definitely notice yourself getting stronger as you find more upgrades.  Boss fights: There are plenty of bosses, and I guess they're all "OK". None were super memorable, and many could be "cheesed" if you found the strategy which I could figure out usually before losing more than half my HP.  Art: It's a mix of Metriod/H Giger (designer of Alien, etc)/"I have no mouth, and I must scream" (an old pc title). The art does a lot to tell the story, making you use your imagination (seeing various areas that could have been an ancient civilization infected by a strange fungus, etc). The bosses also are vile mutations of things resembling human body parts (kind of like Binding of Isaac). And the "Rusalka", those creepy porcelaine doll masks/Starcraft adjutants that talk to you throughout the game... I don't want to spoil anything, but I'll say I appreciated their design.  Music/Sound: Mostly good, with some great tracks. One piece was interesting in particular: influenced from eastern themes (Indian). Most other pieces were heavy bass and did well to set the atmosphere. The monsters/gun sounds were also done well (not just a simple "blip" like metroid did).  Story: Surprisingly more going on than I expected. Like Metroid, a lot of it is up to your imagination, but if you care to explore, you'll find notes, and ways to translate the 2 alien languages. Without spoiling anything, you start off as a scientist who gets knocked out by an explosion in his lab. You then wake up in some strange planet... do you have amnesia? are you cloned? where are you? why? (that kind of thing) There is a lot that won't be told to you directly, and the ending ends somewhat cliffhanger-y. You'll need to beat it on HARD for the true ending, but even then there's a nice twist (if you like that kind of stuff).   Overall: A good game. Smooth gameplay, good music, good length. Plenty to explore if you like that. For an indy game, this is definitely above-par. If I had to rate it, it is better than Metroid (NES), but not quite as great as Super Metriod (a tough game to beat). I'd definitely be interested in a sequel, perhaps one that explored the world of Sutra and the giant Rusalka there that remain.
Date 2017-07-02 Playtime 43h 15m Rec Positive Absolutely amazing game, and very faithful to the style of Metroid down to the smallest details. Extremely well done.
Date 2017-07-02 Playtime 10h 0m Rec Positive Simply put, this game is wonderful. The pixel graphics harken back to games like Metroid and Castlevania, and are really well done. The score is enjoyable. The gameplay is great, and the puzzles aren't too easy, neither are they too hard. The world of this game is unique, and the story is engaging. I really enjoyed my time with Axiom Verge, and I would recommend it to anyone.
Date 2017-07-01 Playtime 12h 3m Rec Positive Fantastic Metroid game, one of the best Metroid games we've had since Super. The plot is whatever with some mildly interesting story developments, but it's really the gameplay and atmosphere that make this game shine. Beautifully frustrating level designs that inspres you to do a lot of back tracking, finding new upgrades and weapons and just all around exploring every facet of this interesting, diverse world. The back tracking, like any game that apes old school gameplay like this, can be annoying and tedious at times, but overall it takes nothing away from the gameplay. Beautiful world, with some obvious Giger/Alien homages scattered around on top of the Metroid type design.   Now I know I've mentioned Metroid 4 times now, but it's really impossible not to. This game is a Metroid game, despite some very mild gameplay differences and story, it's more than a homage, but I don't think it's a rip off, since this style Metroid is dead to Nintendo and really people are still asking for this time of gameplay, obviously. I think this is a great game, very fun with a great difficulty curve, the final boss was incredibly disapointing to me, but that's a mild issue.  If you like old school games, if you like Metroid/Metroidvania games, if you like a good level of difficulty and enjoy supporting indepdent supporters, then buy and play this game. As a side note: this is also the kind of game I really would reccomend playing with a controller, as the keyboard controls are not great.
Date 2017-07-01 Playtime 12h 16m Rec Positive Rating: 9/10  Pros: +Great Art Style +Great Sound Track +Plenty of Secrets to find +Metroid Style Gameplay  Cons: -The story could be a little more tighter. (I tend to lose track of the story due to looking through every nook and cranny for secrets)  Overall: If your are looking for a good platformer game that promotes metroid like gameplay, then this game is for you.  
Date 2017-07-01 Playtime 13h 37m Rec Positive Yup, basically Metroid with all of suable elements removed. Being able to "glitch" yourself to access certain areas was a great experience. And the music really sells the creepy tone I got while playing the Metroid Prime games. Now I personally don't like getting lost in games since I have a bad sense of direction in real life, but in this game I didn't mind as much. Maybe that is just good game design, no idea. Did have to use a YouTube vid for some parts. But overall it was enjoyable. 
Date 2017-07-01 Playtime 2h 31m Rec Positive Simply one of the best MetroidVanias to come out in the last decade. Combines amazing Super Metroid-esque gameplay, with a Metroid Prime style of story telling, amazing Megaman-like 8-Bit graphics, a difficulty level that very few MetroidVanias have obtained, and an absolutely steller soundtrack that I'd buy for $25 alone! If you like Super Metroid, do yourself a favor and pick this up, as it's worth its $20 price tag.

Date 2017-06-30 Playtime 1h 45m Rec Positive Best. Game. Ever.   Can't imagine how much I missed a game like this!
Date 2017-06-30 Playtime 13h 9m Rec Negative Axiom Verge - неплохая по всем стандартам игра, а если учесть, что всё делал один-единственный человек, то результат впечатляет ещё сильнее. Внешний вид хорош, но на мой взгляд мог бы быть и лучше (даже с учётом сознательной старо-приставочной стилистики). Саундтрек местами очень даже приятный, но не весь, и со временем утомляет. Неожиданно крепкий сюжет, с подмигиваниями жанровым клише и даже лёгким почёсыванием четвёртой стены а-ля [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/alpasy/recommended/233980]Unepic[/url]. Необычные, колоритные герои. Про другие плюсы вы можете почитать в многочисленных положительных обзорах, а я здесь сконцентрируюсь на минусах.   Прежде всего стоит отметить, что автор намеренно и последовательно создавал современный аналог классического "Метроида", и преуспел в плане классики, а вот по части современности вышел полный провал.   Игра представляет собой гигантский связанный мир, в котором остро не хватает системы навигации. Поначалу это не так заметно, но ближе к концу вы не сможете продвинуться даже по основному квесту, не заглянув в руководство. И я уже не говорю о прорве сборных бонусов и видов оружия - на карте ничего не обозначено, всё нужно искать наобум, либо муторно сверяться с гайдами (в т.ч. видео, потому что и в гайдах иной раз сложно сориентироваться).   Да, в игре так много разного вида оружия, что в какой-то момент хоткеи перестают умещаться на цифровых клавишах. Проблема в том, что в 95% игровых ситуаций самым удобным и эффективным из них остаётся базовая винтовка, а крутые пушки, которые реально выручают на поздних боссах, запрятаны вдвойне глубоко, и без гайдов (либо долгого и нудного оббегания всего обширного игрового мира по 20 раз) вы их скорее всего не найдёте.   Стрельба старательно убивает палец по дебильному олдскульному принципу "одно нажатие кнопки - один выстрел" (в какой-то момент появляется автоматический пулемёт, но с удручающе малым радиусом действия). И если в детстве на "Денди" очень выручали турбо-кнопки (а в Cave Story+ меня спас ноу-нейм джойстик с активируемым турбо-режимом), то здесь готовьте суставные мази и капу для скрежета зубов.   Управление не до такой степени перегружено, как в [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/alpasy/recommended/261570]Ori and the Blind Forest[/url], но доставляет определённые сложности, а функция телепорта ощутимо косячит на стике (пришлось перевести левую руку на крестик). [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=953438393]Вот здесь[/url], в совершенно обычной комнате я провёл, наверное, 10 минут, пытаясь запрыгнуть в верхний выход.   Вплоть до самого последнего уровня я не понимал, почему эту игру называют сложной, но в конце, что называется, автора накрыло. Сразу несколько последних боссов представляют собой аттракцион "сломай себе все пальцы в попытках забить громилу, пока он поливает тебя лазерами, от которых невозможно уклониться" (вот есть [url=https://www.giantbomb.com/forums/axiom-verge-234268/worst-final-boss-i-ve-seen-in-a-while-potential-sp-1769627/]целый тред[/url] лучащихся счастьем игроков). Более того, появляется ощутимый путь от точки сохранения до босса, полный крайне назойливыми врагами, выедающими тебе весь мозг.   Видел в другом отзыве остроумное наблюдение, что все монстры здесь двух типов: первые служат тупыми мишенями, а вторые резко напрыгивают тебе на голову и начинают жевать твоё лицо, пока ты судорожно пытаешься хоть как-то минимизировать неизбежные повреждения. Дело усугубляют совершенно бесполезные апгрейды оружия, сделанные по принципу "Теперь вместо 20 пуль враг убьётся с 19-ти". [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/alpasy/recommended/250900]Binding of Isaac[/url] плачет горючими слезами.   В целом же мне, любителю жанра, показалось, что здесь не хватает инноваций и наработок современного геймдизайна. Если откровенно, Axiom Verge наскучила мне уже в первый же вечер, но я, на что-то надеясь, сделал над собой усилие, и бросил её лишь в самом конце, "доиграв" на ютубе. Впрочем, если вы любитель чистого олдскула и искусственных сложностей - попробуйте; вполне возможно, ваши впечатления будут совсем иными.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=943201462
Date 2017-06-30 Playtime 27h 36m Rec Positive So. Damn. Good.  If you liked Super Metroid you'll definitely like this game. It has great atmosphere, fun weapons and tools, and just an overall great game.  When you finally get all of the tools and movement techniques it feels like there's so much more that you can do and starts to feel very fluid. I wouldn't be doing my dilligence if I didn't address the negatives.  The plot is kind of wonky. I don't want to spoil it, but there is a really cool twist in the plot followed by a really cliched one. It askes a lot of metaphysical questions that I frankly don't care for.  There are extra notes you can find throughout your play-through but I found the notes did very little to add to the world and instead made feel that "What is life?" smugness that I hate in pretty much every game, even the good ones.  The other problem I had was that normal was a bit too easy after you get the first couple of health extensions. The bosses didn't really test my reflexes and seemed to be designed around finding a place to exploit cover and just firing from there. I'll try the Hard mode and see if the enemies just hit harder or if the patterns are different.  Regardless, of those two nit-picks the game is just fantastic. I want people to understand that this is only a slightly negative aspect and doesn't distract from the overall enjoyment of it. I marathoned the game to completion, which took about 7 hours and all I could think of was wanting to play more.  Just an excellent, excellent game and a MUST play for fans of Metroidvania.
Date 2017-06-29 Playtime 0h 36m Rec Positive The New Metroid for me. Big Maps, strong Bosses, cool power-up's and an awesome pounding synth-track.
Date 2017-06-29 Playtime 20h 57m Rec Positive A really slick homage to 2D Metroid games. One small gripe: some secrets are hidden in walls that have no subtle marking to indicate that you might want to check that spot, meaning you just have to constantly check every single wall once you get the abilities that let you do so. Apart from that though, the game is great: good combat, plenty of exploring to do, and great pixel art.
Date 2017-06-28 Playtime 16h 14m Rec Positive 최근 메트로이드 신작이 발표되고서 게임이 급 땡겨서 전에 사두고 안하고 있었던 악시옴 버지를  플레이했다. 메트로이드 게임의 향수를 불러 일으키며 간만에 게임 불감증을 해소해 주는 즐거움을 선사해 주었다.  전반적으로 난이도가 좀 있으며 특정구간에서는 공략을 볼정도로 어려운 구간도 있었다. 메트로이드에서는 주어진 무기를 가지고 보스를 클리어하는게  되지만 악시옴버지는 특정 무기가 없으면 몇몇 보스는 너무 어렵다.   다른 게임들을 한글패치가 있는데 악시옴버지가 없다는게 좀 아쉽다.   하지만 메트로이드나 악마성이 하고 싶다면 주저없이 추천해 주고 싶다. 그만큼 잘 만들었기 때문이다.

Date 2017-06-27 Playtime 14h 28m Rec Positive + impressive art direction + stellar soundtrack + classic Metroid style gameplay - weak story  Worth the money, especially if you enjoy metroidvania games.
Date 2017-06-27 Playtime 35h 39m Rec Positive One of my favorite games of the year it came out, if you like metroid style games, it should be high on your list to pick up.
Date 2017-06-27 Playtime 16h 41m Rec Positive Básicamente, toma todos los elementos de un Metroid 2D y los conjunta en un juego capaz de ir más allá de ser sólo una copia barata. Buen argumento Sci-Fi, jugabilidad excelente, y la variedad de objetos y armas por usar es grande, aunque en el caso de las armas no varías entre 2 0 3. Siempre recomendable
Date 2017-06-27 Playtime 14h 12m Rec Negative I finally played this game and I gotta say, I am really disappointed. It's full of ungrokable and unmemorable things. The zones, the weapons, the names, the plot, the map layout, it's all functional but uninteresting. Incremental upgrades are replaced by power ups that do nothing unless you get  6 or 8 of them, so many weapons that are useless and forgettable. I don't know who I would recommend this game to.  Edit: Previously my review was about how this game did not work on Mac with a Steam controller. I am playing now on a PC with a Switch Pro controller.
Date 2017-06-27 Playtime 17h 49m Rec Positive Solid Metriod style game with great gameplay. It has an interesting world, characters and monsters, though the story is a little convoluted.  The encounters are sufficiently difficult to keep things fun, but not so punishing that you consider giving up.  Definitely a lot of content for completionists.  That being said it features a great deal of backtracking, even for a Metroid type.  All in all it is worth a play through if you are a fan of the classic Metroid style platformer
Date 2017-06-27 Playtime 15h 54m Rec Positive This game stands not on the shoulders of the giants that have come before it, but amongst them as equals.

Date 2017-06-25 Playtime 1h 10m Rec Negative Contra в сотню раз лучше этой ахинеи. В Axiom Verge - это небольшая часть украденного у Contra визуального стиля в открытом, лабиринтообразном мире с крайне посредственным, до ужаса типичным геймплеем. Серьёзно, Axiom Verge неспособна предоставить игроку абсолютно ничего нового и интересного. Я недоумеваю, как у настолько типичного платформера смогло появиться 95% положительных отзывов? Неужели современным геймерам достаточно напоминающей олдсукльный шедевр картинки чтобы писать кипятком и ставить оценки “10 из 10. Ведьмак из мира платформеров”?

Date 2017-06-25 Playtime 17h 44m Rec Positive Jeder der ein Fan des guten alten Super Metroid gewesen ist, wird auch dieses Spiel lieben.   Spoiler: Das einzige Manko für Completionists ist das Passwort-Item, dessen Codes geheime Areale öffnen kann, nur das wie und wo ist sehr nebulös gehalten.  
Date 2017-06-25 Playtime 46h 36m Rec Positive Gut umgesetztes Metroidvania. Gamepad Steuerung klappt super, Spielfigur lässt sich präzise steuern. Schwierigkeit ist im fairen Bereich, teilweise gibt es kniffelige Abschnitte und Bosse. Die meisten Rätsel lassen sich leicht lösen, anhand der Karte kann man schnell sehen, welche Abschnitte noch nicht vollständig erkundet wurden. Einige Geheimnisse (z.B. Flammenwerfer) sind meiner Meinung nach jedoch ohne eine Komplettlösung zu absurd. Insgesamt hatte ich ein wunderbares Spielerlebnis und war überrascht, wie umfangreich das Spiel ist.
Date 2017-06-25 Playtime 49h 38m Rec Positive Innovative and fun gameplay. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a metroid successor or just a fun game in general.
Date 2017-06-25 Playtime 20h 45m Rec Positive I will dare and say it, this game has SURPASSED Metroid in style. Fantastic music, great alien atmosphere, fun weapons, engaging boss fights and last but not least, an intriguing story!  It's a bit on the hard side if you come from the gba Metroid titles as enemies, especially in the later part of the game, hit pretty hard. Bosses are tricky enough that you might die a few times to figure out their paterns, but easy enough that if you are good at dodging, you might beat them on the first go.  The game focuses less overpowering your enemy and instead adds artful dodging using various tools you find along your adventure. If you choose to fight though, you will have an entire arsenal to choose from (10+ ways to damage enemies).  Exploration is still key to find most things, sometimes by breaking walls down and other times... well let's just say reality finds a way to let you through. Never got stuck on my first playthrough; the game has a specific path to take you to the end, but every now and then you can get a few items out of order if you explore carefully.  The game does feel like it has a few too many collectibles to my taste (half the weapons in this game I didn't use more than once) and some of them need passwords (all found in-game in lore stuff) to unlock.  The controls felt a bit weird at first, having a lot of tools over time to choose from and each having their own button in general. At least you can remap anything you want!  Looking forward to the next installement!
Date 2017-06-25 Playtime 35h 26m Rec Positive If you like the classic 2D Metroid games, please do yourself a favor and BUY THIS GAME!  That is really all that needs to be said.  It's free exploration, lots of weapons and upgrades, lots of secrets... just so much fun!  I knew I've been wanting a new Metroid for a long time... but I didn't realize how badly I wanted one until I played this.  This will scratch that Metroid itch.  If they release a sequel, it will be a day 1 buy for me!

Date 2017-06-24 Playtime 18h 0m Rec Negative To me, this game is a worse version of Metroid Fusion, an old GBA game. I liked playing iy for awhile, but at one point the game became quite tedious so I set it down and am not planning to pick it up again.
Date 2017-06-24 Playtime 2h 1m Rec Positive Extremely fun game, especially if you are going away and just have a laptop, play on hard for best experience.

Date 2017-06-24 Playtime 17h 18m Rec Positive Do you like Super Metroid? if you do, just play this game.  This game has a lot of exploration, a lot of colectables and weapons, a big world filled with secrets, a very interesting story, a lot of cool abilities and a very cool artstyle. This days the tag "metroidvania" is on almost half of all the indie games I see on steam. But I  can honestly say, that this one is one of the few (if not the only one) that truly deserves that tag. It gives you the feel of those 2d metroid and castlevania games, but with a lot of little tweaks that brings that play style to the new era of gamming. To make this whole thing even more amazing, this game was made by just one man. And the love this guy put on this game is amazing, you can really feel it and it's speacially clear when you look at all the atention every little detail of this game had. Also the dev is very active on the forum, and will help you out with any technical issue you're having.  Amazing art, amazing gameplay and a lot of replayability. You can't go wrong with this game.
Date 2017-06-23 Playtime 18h 58m Rec Positive This game is absolutley fantastic, and I should have wrote this review earlier.. If you loved the old school 2d Metroid games, then I would highly reccomend picking this game up. It really captures the "MetroidVania" feel very well. However, rather than being a carbon copy of the game it is obviously inspired by, it brings many new and interesting mechnics to the table, such as the modular weapons system and the gun you can use to "glitch" enemies, reduccing them to what look like corrupted SNES sprites. The bosses are fun and the game itself is reasonably challanging. There is a huge focus on exploration, with many power-ups and lore notes to collect. The game has a lonley, desolate and surreal atmosphere that is very well protrayed by the art, music, and story. It feels like you are having some weird, halluconigenic fueled fever dream and it's actually really awesome. The art style is extremley reminicent of the origonal Metroid for the NES, with it's reds, purples, blues, and blacks in the environment detail and it's strange alien life. However, it adds a certain trippy, surreal touch to it that make it very interesting. The music is very strange yet extremley fitting, and spritework is gorgeous. The story, although a little hard to follow at times, is very unique and well done, and the characters, although few, are very memorable.   PROS: -fun, interesting gameplay -absoultley beautiful spritework, especially in the backgrounds and the Russalka -unique soundtrack that really captures the feel of the game world -challanging -lots of secret areas -cool and unique gameplay mechanics -haunting, lonley, and surreal atmosphere. It's like a bad trip. -unique and interesting sci-fi story -LORE NOTES :O   CONS: -The "glitch" themed secret areas (forget exactly what they are called) are very unnoticable and difficult to find. Maybe there was a mechanic I was missing for locating them or something? -same music for every boss barring the final one (very minor nitpick) -a few of the enimies in particular (yes I'm talking about the guys that spew gas out of their backs) are very annoying -story is hard to follow at times -sometimes I felt like I was lost and could not figure out where to go, especially later in the game.  I, personally would give this game an 8.75/10. It was tremendous fun to play, and really gave me that old school metroid nostalgia. My only nitpicks are what I listed in the cons and that it at times feels too much like Super Metroid. While these flaws are pretty minor, they are just enough to keep me from giving it a 9/10, despite my love for the game and it's fantastic artwork and music. I was actually tempted to tack another point on the rating I gave it just because it was made by one person alone, which really shows his skill and dedication as a game developer. If a sequel is ever made (not sure how likley that is) I would for sure buy it.
Date 2017-06-23 Playtime 50h 38m Rec Positive Excelente juego, de lo mejor que he jugado desde hace mucho, no soy muy dado a terminar los juegos, normalmente los dejo a la mitad, a menos que me llenen, este fue uno de los casos, el sonido y efectos retro me llevo a cuando jugaba super nintendo en los 90, 10/10
Date 2017-06-23 Playtime 15h 50m Rec Positive   Só pela referencia: metroidvania, são motivos suficientes para parar e observar um pouco mais esse tal de Axiom Verge. E que jogo fantástico, não apenas pela semelhança em um estilo tão agradável mas pelas particularidades que ele proporciona.

Date 2017-06-21 Playtime 24h 59m Rec Positive This may be the single most perfect example of the tag "metroidvania" out there, and in the best way possible. Being someone who grew up even-paced with the videogame industry, I'm a sucker for old-school style games that fix old-school problems (if only we'd had diagonal shooting back then!!), and Axiom Verge channels that time when 2D platformers were utterly perfected. Highly recommended!
Date 2017-06-21 Playtime 61h 3m Rec Positive Beautiful game, great soundtrack and nostalgic playing style. It's the perfect addition to a retro gamer's collection. Mr. Happ, please make more adventures for us to take!  I highly recommend this game for people who enjoyed the side-scrolling metroid games. Sure, it plays very similarly, but it's a whole new experience. The atmosphere is gripping. 5 stars!
Date 2017-06-20 Playtime 21h 27m Rec Positive [h1][b] I highly recommend this game. [/b] [/h1]  If you enjoy [olist] [1] upgrades [2] epic music [3]metroid/castlevania platformers [4] good games [/olist] Then this [i] IS [/i]  the game. There isn't really any handholding on where [u] most [/u] upgrades are for things, but exploring every nook and crany of this world is vastly satisfying. It also pays to pay attention to things so when you go back to areas you can possibly do something you previously couldn't. The story is pretty cool, its a game that you probably wont forget about. I do strongly recomend this. What are you waiting for, buy this game.
Date 2017-06-20 Playtime 17h 46m Rec Positive Sometimes I wonder why they call them Metroidvanias. I mean, instead of Legend of Metroids. Or Zeldroids. It wasn't until the second Castlevania that the gated RPG in a more or less open world showed up, and it wasn't always there. The most recent ones are more Devil May Cry than Metroidvania--and it's a Vania!   I'm just saying, Zegend of Zelda and Metroid have consistently had the pieces in place in every game.   Axiom Verge is a Legend of Metroid. It even feels right to call this game that. That is what it is: Legend of Metroid.  You're welcome.  One caveat though... but it has to be said: the sound design is not good.  The music is solid 16-bit stuff. Fits and sets the atmosphere. The sounds are 8-bit bruises. They're super noise heavy, and I think he had the brilliance dialed all the way up because... Damn. Some of those sounds are painful at moderate volume.   One of the worst is the alarm for when you're at low health. I find it really jarring. It's a perfect tone and it's so loud you can't miss it. I imagine that was the intent, and I acknowledge it's really really effective. You're never surprised you ran out of health, though sometimes you might feel relieved.  I play it for about an hour at a time because of the sound issue.  But I keep playing it. It's the best Legend of Metroid with bad sound effects I've ever wanted to play.
Date 2017-06-20 Playtime 24h 42m Rec Positive Отличная метроидвания. Тут вам и масштабные карты, большое разнообразие предметов и оружия, изобретательная игровая механика, четкое управление, и конечно же огромное количество бэктрекинга. Есть и секреточки, и коллектиблс. Чтобы собрать все придется изрядно попотеть. Для того, чтобы достать некоторые предметы, нужна не только изобретательность, но и умения, а так же недюжий запас нервов.   Кислотная цветовая гамма на любителя, но в целом пиксельная графика очень качественная. Все эти мясисто кровянные дизайны вызывают воспоминания о старых сайфай платформерах с 16битных консолей, что наверное и было целью. Русалки и некоторые боссы прям шикарно отрисованы. Саундтрек приятный, хотя в некоторых зонах может немного утомлять.  Сюжет вроде как неплох, но меня особо не впечатлил. Как то невнятно вышло, если как по мне. Так и не поняла, каким боком славянская мифология и письменность затесалась на эту богом забытую планету. Боссы средненькие, да и вообще в целом враги, наверное, самая слабая часть игры, особенно под конец. В игре просто огромное количество оружия, но при этом две трети, если не три четверти, абсолютно бесполезны, и собирать их стоит лишь ради ачивки. Что мне в боевке понравилось, так это использование глитч гана на врагах. Никогда не знаешь, как они на это отреагируют. Некоторые заглитченные враги открывают новую игровую механику, позволяют добраться до мест, в которые обычным способом никак не попасть.   В целом, если закрыть глаза на посредственную боевку, то игра вышла исключительно замечательная. Рекомендую. 
Date 2017-06-20 Playtime 37h 25m Rec Positive This is one of the best Metroidvania games I've played in years.  It invokes that Super Metroid feel without borrowing too much from it.  Many many original ideas here, from gameplay to weapons to story.  The unique story keeps you hungry for more, and even at the end, you can still uncover the hidden ulterior motives of the other characters.  This game comes with a ton of secrets, some of them really hard to find.  And the soundtrack is phenomenal.  I can't believe one guy did everything here.  Super Bunnyhop reviewed this game, but I thought he was way too harsh.  It kept me from picking it up when I did.  I'm at least glad I played it when I did.  Still hungry for more.

Date 2017-06-19 Playtime 9h 11m Rec Positive This game is outstanding. It plays just like Super Metroid, but with completely unique and original mechanics. I knew it was going to be good the moment I heard the music of the first stage, and with each passing room I wanted more. Definatly a worthwile experience. Axiom Verge hits all marks of a good Metroidvania game, and has some seriously groundbreaking mechanics that I would compare with the likes of Portal.   Satisfying controls, mechanics, gameplay, music, exploration, secrets, humor, and challenge.  Also, Mutton Chops FTW!

Date 2017-06-16 Playtime 10h 43m Rec Negative Terrible, horrible excuse for a game. It is really good until you get to the hallucination "boss fight." After that the game dives off a ciff.  Nothing but fiddely jumps involving a flawed teleport mechanic, unbelieveably cheap tiny bug enemies that do massive damage and are almost impossible to shoot. You get several weapons, but with the exception of stupid switches to open pathways only two, maybe three are even slightly useful. Hours and several weapon power upgrades later the very first enemies in the game still take multiple shots to kill. Cheap BS does not equal challange, it is a lazy attempt at best. This game sucks.
Date 2017-06-16 Playtime 30h 49m Rec Positive Muito legal!  Ótimo jogo pra quem curte um metroidvania, tem power ups, puzzles e uma história legal apesar de não se equiparar com nenhum dos jogos Medroid, quiça Castlevania Symphony of the Night. Mas mesmo assim vale a pena.  Existem alguns bugs no jogo mas são muito imperceptíveis, mas bem imperceptíveis mesmo.   Concluindo compre e você vai se divertir bastante.
Date 2017-06-15 Playtime 24h 25m Rec Positive Биопанк. Мрачняк. Наркомания. Атмосфера, музыка - выше всяких похвал.  10 из 10. Автору(1 человек!) - респект!
Date 2017-06-15 Playtime 30h 48m Rec Positive Extremely fun and creative game. The visuals are wonderful and at times stunning. I really wish there were more like this.
Date 2017-06-15 Playtime 89h 38m Rec Positive I don't even know if I should review this game since I'm basically in love with the genre in general. Maybe it's the opposite. Anyway. Let's up some downs.  UPs: + The Atmosphere is just as hopeless and isolated (at first) as known from other Metroidvania titles. +++ It brings a lot of innovative gameplay ideas to the table (like the Remote Drone Teleport or corrupting/glitching enemies and walls) + The soundtrack doesn't always fit to the atmosphere, but it kinda fits to the native Sudran culture in my book, at least in my imagination and judgdment of the Sudrans using the text logs found in game + It has a fine story to go after, which actually suprised me, as the 2D Metroid games (except for maybe Metroid Fusion) did not offer that much of a background story to support the characters motives) + I just can't help giving the Drone Teleport and the Scissor Beam their own up.  DOWNS: -- The Bosses can be hard, but they are way too easy if you know the trick to them. Even the hardest boss in the game (a giant wasp) can be killed in a mere ten seconds. The final boss is an absolute joke if you go for 100% (or at least get the Flamethrower and a bit of extra health). - There are a lot of Health and Power Node fragments. I just prefer well hidden full nodes over having to collect 5 or 6 well hidden fragments. It makes them absolutely useless when not collecting a full set. - There is absolutely no reward for 100%ing the game (items and map) except for a short bonus sequence after the credits. That's one thing I hated since I got into the genre. Just don't do it, it's not worth it, and turns the final boss into a joke.   OTHER COMMENTS: There are three weapons in the game that can only be obtained in hard difficulty secret worlds. However, there is only one of them in each playthrough (as they are generated randomly as you start a new game). I would've liked some sort of New Game+ feature in which you keep that one weapon you got on your last playthrough. That way players could've obtained all three of those secret weapons after three playthroughs and give this game even more replayability. Just a thought.  Final Score: + 7:4 - Final comment: Axiom Verge is absolutely worth the money, even for people that don't have any experience with the Metroidvania genre. I once heard someone saying it's a prime example of a good Metroidvania game. And I absolutely agree.
Date 2017-06-15 Playtime 18h 31m Rec Positive A solid metroidvania game. My biggest complaint is with the bosss. One of them is simply a matter of a little initial setup and then standing in place and shooting. Another has too much going on and I don't believe the character is physically capable of being maneuverable enough to avoid everything, I ultimately beat it by just getting a bit more life and a new weapon and then just standing in place, face-tanking the projectiles, and shooting.
Date 2017-06-15 Playtime 10h 20m Rec Positive I think my game is corrupted. Some textures of the wall are flickering, some enemies have broken textures and behave differently, certain parts of the world are blocked off by large errors, and sometimes I can phase through walls. Hopefully this is fixed soon ;)
Date 2017-06-14 Playtime 29h 9m Rec Positive 游戏必须给个大大的好评 喜爱银河战士的玩家们不要错过了~！  另外希望能有中文 We need chinese! 我还在想会不会有隐藏结局呢……
Date 2017-06-14 Playtime 40h 39m Rec Positive Узнал, что такое жанр Метроидвания. В начале думал, что так никогда ее и не пройду. С непривычки игру легко забросить, но ей стоит дать шанс, после чего сложно будет оторваться.  Иногда напрягало после очередного просмотра всех секций карты бежать туда, где остался черный не исследованный квадрат. Напрягало так же, как и радовало найти за этим черным квадратом большой новый кусок карты или интересную плюшку. Часто приходили мысли "Ничего себе куда забрался", "О, я и так умею?" и закончилось "Фигасе как я высоко могу запрыгнуть" =)  Порадовало большое кол-во способностей, обе руки заняты на клавиатуре. Есть приемы, которые нужно отработать, но дальше исполняешь на автоматизме. На высокой сложности с одним босом даже переназначил клавиши, чтобы быстро менять 2 вида оружия. Оказалось, можно пройти одним. После прохождения на ютубе увидел, что есть еще более легкий способ. Интересно к каждому босу и иногда противнику, который наносит уж больно много урона, подбирать свой ключ.  Был неприятный момент с управлением. На клавиатуре со стрелками отказывались работать все сочетания клавиш, порой их надо было приличное количество прожимать. Например, есть место, где надо прыгнуть в бок и закинуть дрона в проем. Я, в начале, думал, что это баг, начал гуглить, на ютубе увидел, что момент проходим, может человек с контроллера играл. Пришлось изменить перемещение со стрелок на цифры в правой части, играть стало намного удобней после адаптации.  Классная музыка, классная графика, свои враги и стили секций карты, босы, русалки, которые, оказывается, так и назывались в оригинальной версии.
Date 2017-06-14 Playtime 12h 14m Rec Positive [h1]Merciiiii, daaass eees diiich giiiibt![/h1]  Axiom Verge ist ein unterhaltsames Metroidvania-Spiel mit insgesamt guter Musik (, aber meiner Meinung nach nicht herausragend wie manche Magazine das Spiel zum Soundtrack des Jahres küren - dann lieber Hotline Miami 1 + 2, wobei das natürlich stark Geschmackssache ist), sehr interessanten Fähigkeiten und einer Menge Waffen.  Einzige Mankos: Story ist ziemlich doof, die Steuerung auf dem Gamepad wirkt überladen (was habe ich die Superbomb sowie das Dashen mehrmals versehentlich ausgelöst - und einen Waffenwechselbutton musste ich deaktivieren, weil ich den immer im falschen Moment betätigt hab) und dieses Passwort-Tool (intern) ist ein Gadget, was man sich hätte absolut sparen können. Als ich in einem YouTube-World-Cleanup-Video sah, dass einige Wege nur (!) erreichbar werden, wenn man da einen Code eintippt, ist mir die Lust nach 100% vergangen. Zum Glück scheint das Ausnahmecharakter zu haben.  Abgesehen davon hatte ich ca. 12 wunderbar unterhaltsame Stunden, in denen immer wieder was Neues dazu kam und viele Inhalte richtig GUTE Ideen sind. Empfehlenswert!  🔫 Pew Pew Pew! 💥 Bock auf mehr Reviews? 🔎 🏃💨 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42792002/]Folge mir[/url] und verpass' keine weiteren Neuigkeiten! ⚡
Date 2017-06-13 Playtime 5h 41m Rec Positive It's a very good 8 bit metroidvania-like. However it got so much hype and good reviews I don't really see what is better in this one than is many other titles that didn't get that kind of attention.
Date 2017-06-13 Playtime 4h 11m Rec Negative Has a similar feel to Super Metroid, but falls flat in every area. The gameplay is repetative, and the music is really mundane and difficult to listen to. I can't recommend it. Environmental Station Alpha was a much better stab at the genre.
Date 2017-06-13 Playtime 12h 24m Rec Positive Well done game.  I would easily recommend it to anyone who enjoys Metroidvania (more Metroid than Castlevania).
Date 2017-06-13 Playtime 15h 11m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvania ever made
Date 2017-06-12 Playtime 28h 18m Rec Positive In the end I have to give the game a thumbs up. However, having said that, I found the game ludicrously difficult on Hard in the final level. Most of the game before I felt delivered a fair challenge. I found the final level, and in particular the final boss, frustratingly difficult. The difficulty ramps up from challenging to "You've got to be kidding me" rapidly, and I literally found the game impossible to finish with the items I had, and would have needed to consult a wiki to get the items I would have needed to succeed. So maybe just enjoy the otherwise fantastic gameplay and music on Normal. But then, I'm not a terribly skilled player so your mileage may vary.
Date 2017-06-10 Playtime 10h 49m Rec Positive Very solid metroid style game. You could talk about the fact that one single person made it, but honestly it's good by any standard. Solid mechanically, stylistically beautiful, interesting storyline, challenging without being cheap or frustrating. Worth playing for any fan of retro gaming or side scrollers.
Date 2017-06-10 Playtime 14h 6m Rec Positive Loved it, a game that wears it's inspiration on it's sleeve - Metroid. If you liked any of the NES/SNES era metriod-vania games then this won't disappoint.
Date 2017-06-09 Playtime 24h 32m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a fantastic platformer heavily inspired by Metroid and games of its kind. If you love Metroid, you *need* to play this game.  Pro: + Wonderful art style. You really feel like you are on an alien world + Unique soundtrack; very atmospheric tracks + Tons of weapons, power-ups and tools to collect + Many secret areas to find + Good story (with a few plottwists) + A lot of replay value, especially for those who want 100% achievements  Con: - I wish the game was longer... (about 15 hours for the first playthrough)
Date 2017-06-08 Playtime 36h 4m Rec Positive Koop het.
Date 2017-06-07 Playtime 15h 46m Rec Negative Axiom Verge is so good for so long that you will continue to give it the benefit of the doubt long after it turns monotonous.  At some point it switches from a constant series of finding cool items, revealing new areas, and learning more backstory, to a exercise in tedium as you backtrack and backbacktrack and backbackbacktrack through previously explored rooms, desperately trying to figure out what the hell to do next. I'm half convinced that the good reviews for this game came from people who either only played the first half, or who plowed through the whole thing with walkthough in hand. Save yourself the heartache of watching a great game go dull by not getting invested in the first place.  UPDATE:  A Robot Named Fight! is the game you want.  http://store.steampowered.com/app/603530/A_Robot_Named_Fight/
Date 2017-06-06 Playtime 20h 0m Rec Positive For those who loved playing Castlevania, Metroid, Megaman will love this game.   Pros: *Amazing Soundtrack/graphics. *Fast paced gameplay, like for example 'Super Metroid'. *A big world to explore. Lots of room you passed by that you couldn't get in or get that item are avaiable later when you have that specific power-up to do so.   Cons: *The enemies are sometimes way too easy, and sometimes unfair, mostly melee ones, like, you can't kill it without him hitting you 2-3 times. And no that's not noob thing, it's simply impossible. *Lots of weapons for you to choose from, but most of them are rather useless.  For example: the 2nd weapon that you pick up, I only used that to open the first doors in the game, later I never used it again. Same for lots of weapons, out of more than 12 options I only used 3... *You can't aim upper-right for example without being completely still, it should be more versatile...   Well, even after all those Cons I really enjoyed the game, completed it and plan on doing Speedruns/Hard Mode runs, hope you enjoy.
Date 2017-06-06 Playtime 20h 9m Rec Positive Rating: 9/10  If you want a new platformer to burn some time in, this is the perfect contender. It is worth every penny.   Axiom Verge has you playing the role of Trace, a scientist that ended up in this odd world of mystery. You're met with the voice of Elsenova immediately upon waking up into the world, where she guides you to your weapon for your protection. Are you on earth or elsewhere? From then on, it gets a hell of a lot more interesting.   With an arsenal of weapons, skills, and hidden items throughout the game, this will quench your thirst for exploration.  The gameplay is solid and plays well with a xbox/dualshock controller. If you're worried about any advanced techniques in this game, not to worry. You don't need to mash fast to shoot at a comfortable speed and there aren't any tight tricks.  There are bosses and there are puzzles. Lots of puzzles. This was a plus for me.   This could have been a solid 10/10, but I found the bosses quite lackluster. The thing is, you don't play this game for the bosses. There's so much more to this game that makes it great.  
Date 2017-06-06 Playtime 19h 50m Rec Positive 值得一玩的类银河战士游戏。  ++相当独特的画风，充满了异域风情，从小怪到BOSS，从地形到背景，很好的表现了这TMD不是地球这点。 +不错的操作和手感，至少用手柄🎮操作相当舒服。 +++++非常丰富的收集要素。武器，血/攻的等级，剧情补充的文本，隐藏空间。而且藏东西的花样还挺多的，还有一些隐藏的谜题。 ++微妙的剧情、开放的结局。可惜英文水平不好的人理解有限。 +++有趣的 干涉/HACK 玩法 +++丰富的敌人种类，结合HACK的玩法基本上可以一直保持新鲜感。 ++武器多样丰富，但平衡性不足，有几个武器非常无用。  ~过于异域风情的音乐，略微有点怪怪的。 ~个别操作还需要进一步的优化，比如爪勾和2级衣服的短距离瞬移。个别剧情点需要比较极限的操作才能到达，感觉是不必要的门槛。 ~即时存档！游戏里面说是存档点，其实是重生点，所有记录即时存档。可以随时退游戏返回重生点。  -----重生点是两格高！前期地图上每个存档点上面都缺一块，后期能上来了，上面TMD也没有东西… -[strike]没有传送[/strike]每一块区域都比较复杂，很多东西远离列车通道。后期补充收集的时候跑图会比较累。 --BOSS战的设计比较简陋，攻击手法相当单调和机械，难以留下印象。 -切后台或者在游戏中不能直接调整音量。 -后期剧情主线引导不足，导致乱跑图。 -环境要素有些单调，各个场景基本上只是贴图不同而已，缺乏场景特色要素。
Date 2017-06-06 Playtime 15h 41m Rec Negative Ambitious game, but too big for its own good.  There's a certain balance that comes with making a good Metroidvania game, and while Axiom Verge manages to do some correctly, its critical faults prevent it from being something truly magical.  First off, the retro aesthetic is spectacular. This is some of the best spritework I've seen in a long time. The music is reminiscent of the Metroid franchise, and while a few tracks stand out, the rest just blend together in their mediocrity, with a few being downright annoying. Sound design is fun and adequate enough and helps to set the otherworldly mood well.  The first half of this game is absolutely wonderful. As you start to explore the map and find more items, you will slowly learn to maneuver your character around obstacles and make use of your new tools to get around. It's exactly what you want a Metroidvania to be.  But then about 3/5 of the way into the game, you start to hit the wall, and this is where the game fails to live up to the legacy it's desperately trying to capture. There is NO way to know which of the dozens of passageways you've visited in the past is the correct one, and many times you will find a new path, hoping to progress the story, only to discover that it simply carries some useless collectable. There are no on-screen indicators to let the player know where an item is, and whether they've collected it, making even online walkthroughs fairly worthless unless you follow them from the beginning.  You will constantly find new weapons to provide a variety of ways to dispatch your enemies, but there are so many and only a few of them are actually necessary to complete the game and unlock new paths. The rest are simply for show, providing a method of killing baddies that is pretty to look at, but fairly useless in the long run. It feels like the developers had too many ideas and couldn't decide which ones to keep in, so they just used them all in hopes of letting the player find one they like. I think once your weapon loadout starts to go past the 1-0 keys on the keyboard, it's time to scale back, guys.  Certain weapons like the ice shard sprayer look impressive, and when you first acquire it, you think it would be useful for freezing water and solving puzzles, but it's really nothing more than a glorified machinegun with a wide spray angle and short range. Many of the weapons are like this, and it really makes the game feel unfocused.  Axiom Verge is also HARD. And for no good reason, either. Enemies have obscene amounts of health, and deal massive amounts of damage, even on normal difficulty, and while they do occasionally drop health restoration pellets, it happens so infrequently you can never count on it when you are desperately low. The only reliable way to restore your health is to corrupt certain enemies and cause them to shoot out health pellets instead of bullets, or find a save point, which will also cause all the enemies to respawn.  Enemies will swarm you constantly, forcing you to stop and fight them at every opportunity. Running through them and tanking the damage is NOT a reliable strategy until much later in the game. And weapon upgrade powerups are almost completely worthless. You would think there would be a noticeable difference in weapon strength after upgrading, but it will simply cause an enemy that once took 20 shots to now take 19.  Yeah, it's that kind of game. And for as hardy as the enemies are, the bosses are almost insultingly easy. While they do have unfair amounts of health (sensing a theme?) their attack patterns are predictable, turning the fight into a battle of patience. Some even have areas where you are completely invulnerable, but your attacks can still reach the boss. Once the game realizes that you understand the enemy's attack pattern, it shouldn't still take several minutes of whittling down the boss's health just to move on.  Then of course, it comes time to go for 100% completion, and that is where you really realize this game's failing. I managed to complete the game without any guides, simply through systematic searching and trial-and-error, but trying to get 100% made me give up, because it is F$%&ING IMPOSSIBLE. Each section of the map is separated into a different area, and the game only tells you whether you have uncovered all of the map, or all of the items. This is told to you through two dots that appear in the corner of the map, and no documentation what these dots mean. The only way to get 100% is to check an online walkthrough. There are plenty of these available online, so have at it, but here is a message to the developers:  It is twenty-god-damn-fifteen. (Going by the game's release date) Stop fetishizing the days of wandering around making no progress. Video games were made like that during the 80s because nobody knew how to make good games yet and they were experimenting. Online walkthroughs exist when a game fails to meet the expectations for what a player is supposed to know. Objective arrows, item markers, visual and sensory clues exist for a reason, and it's about time you learned how to integrate them properly into the games you design. If you want to put puzzles and exploration into the game, go ahead, but you are competing against a fanbase that has an entire encyclopedia of knowledge at their disposal and is not afraid to use it. If your puzzles are unintuitive and asinine, we will NOT care. If you refuse to give us tools to know what items we've picked up and from where, we will find our own. If that's what you want, then by all means, but don't expect us to praise you for giving us a complete gaming experience when we had to do half of the work ourselves.  If Axiom Verge were more focused, perhaps giving the player only a small selection of weapons and making them all useful, and provided more in-game resources to assist while going for 100%, it could have ranked up there with the great fan Metroidvanias like Xeodrifter or AM2R. But as it stands, it's a game with a lot of dead ends, both in terms of game design and overall concept.
Date 2017-06-04 Playtime 18h 45m Rec Positive An excelent game, excelent gameplay, excelent environment music, the graphic style is amazing. The only bad thing is that the game could be boring after 70% of the game, because the items found them will be less interesting and the journey of the map could be complicated and boring, but that is easy to solve if we use the marks on the map correctly :).  I love this game.
Date 2017-06-04 Playtime 16h 2m Rec Positive I'm not totally sure what I was expecting out of Axiom Verge but I was pleasantly surprised.   For the most part the game doesn't deviate from the exploration-platformer formula perfected by Super Metroid, but I don't think that's a negative -- it works in many of the same ways Super Metroid works. Wholly alien pixel art landscapes, weird monsters, a sense of isolation and loneliness, zillions of different weapons and slowly expanding exploration options, and a solid soundtrack. Lots of stuff to find -- I thought I got most of the items, but I was only at 77% collection when I finished the game, much to my surprise.   The glitchy, reality-hacking aesthetic is the main way the game parts ways with just being another Super Metroid, and honestly it works. It's a lot more than a simple gimmick -- it defines the game's atmosphere, offers some really neat ways to navigate the map, and more than once messes with your head a bit, which is always fun in an otherwise fairly straightfoward platformer.  The storyline was pretty much exactly the kind of story I'd expect a guy making a complex retro-styled sci-fi metroidvania largely by himself would write. I'll leave it up to you to decide whether or not this is a good thing.
Date 2017-06-03 Playtime 11h 51m Rec Negative Estéticamente me parece brutal, pero a la hora de jugarlo se me hizo un poco infumable. La música empeoraba a medida que avanzabas y al no tener teleports para recorrerte el mapa tardabas la vida. Se me hizo muy pesado y al final terminé pasándomelo por orgullo.
Date 2017-06-02 Playtime 9h 43m Rec Positive 9.5小时通关，看了看国外大神竟然有40分钟通关的，惊了。  +优秀的游戏能力设计 +美术风格恶趣味，但是我喜欢233 +各种隐藏地点设计得非常巧妙，让探索的乐趣倍增 +BOSS画的很精致 -羸弱的武器设计，大多数枪支略显鸡肋 -剧情单薄 -没有传送，后期跑图有点恶心  8.0/10 推荐给喜欢正统银河战士的玩家（或者打枪版的恶魔城？）  作为一款独立游戏，整个游戏的设计都是由作者一个人完成的，以这个标准来看，游戏的完成度相当的高。游戏基本遵循恶魔城/银河战士like游戏的流程，节奏上基本是探索地图——获得能力——运用新能力到达新的地图，但是与往常的恶魔城like游戏不同的是，探索过程中主角获得的特殊能力设计得相当独特，不落窠臼。比如到了某个地方太高了，往往我就会想“啊，这里需要获得二段跳才能过去吧，等拿到能力的时候再过来吧”然而，直到通关主角也没有二段跳的能力，取而代之的是一条类似百战天虫里的忍者绳索的道具，通过抓在地形上牵引主角到达新的地点。  除此以外还有许多令人惊讶的能力，得到的时候完全跟预想的不一样。其中有一个能力可以用惊艳来说，就是骇客。游戏中期主角获得了一把能将敌人骇掉的枪，敌人被黑了之后会变成乱码的形式，与此同时会出现一些新的特性，比如某只怪物在被骇了之后会沿着行动路径创造出大量的石头，之后用前面提到的绳索一路勾石头飞过去就可以到达隐藏地点。顺便一提，游戏中很多隐藏的地点，灵活运用各种能力找到它们也是游戏的一大乐趣。  最后来说说游戏的战斗系统吧，玩过银河战士的同学应该会很熟悉，基本上来说就是拿枪biubiubiu。游戏中提供了大量的可收集枪支，LZ我通关的时候大致收集了15种左右的枪，不得不说每种枪都设计得很有特色，不过可惜的是在强度上各种枪的水平参差不齐，最终通关的时候常用的枪大概也就3把。不过游戏中获得的特别能力大多都有一定的战斗性能，活用它们能让你更好的生存，为了不过多剧透，还是用前面提到的骇客能力举个例子。基本上大多数的敌人在被骇客之后都会呈现弱化的趋势，有些乍一看非常棘手的敌人在骇客之后都会变得相当弱鸡，当然骇客也并非无敌的存在，毕竟要用骇客枪照射敌人相当一段时间才能将敌人骇掉。  至于游戏剧情是什么？其实不太吸引人，有点黑客帝国的味道，又有点blame的感觉，听上去很不错，但是恐怕是作者个人精力有限，很多我期待的地方都没有进行展开，整个讲故事的地方给人感觉不是过剧情，而是强行解释设定，有点无趣，不过毕竟这种类型的游戏剧情并不是核心，所以也就无所谓了吧。  
Date 2017-06-01 Playtime 15h 17m Rec Positive Excellent game. Possibly the best Metroidvania I've ever played (besides the Metroid games of course).
Date 2017-05-31 Playtime 14h 54m Rec Positive Tredici ore di puro divertimento. Adrenalico, sfidante fino all'ultimo boss e con una crescita dei talenti acquisiti che dovrebbe fare scuola nei titoli tripla A. In sostanza, riducendo la veste grafica al minimo indispensabile per apprezzare il contesto, Axiom Verge mostra la via per acquisire la grammatica del gameplay: conoscerlo dovrebbe essere un prerequisito per entrare nel mondo dello sviluppo ludico. Trama e sottofondo musicale sono altrettanto incisivi, per quanto ossessivi più di un incubo iniziato nel 1980 e mai finito. Da avere.
Date 2017-05-31 Playtime 22h 57m Rec Positive Excellent indie game.... If you're into metroidvania games then this is for you.

Date 2017-05-30 Playtime 10h 39m Rec Positive Mejor metroidvania de todos los tiempos
Date 2017-05-30 Playtime 10h 58m Rec Positive 一个非常不错的游戏，整体的情节也很出色，讲了一个[spoiler]屌丝科学家命运循环[/spoiler]的故事。 优点： 1）故事迷离，渐入佳境； 2）脑洞清奇，各种不可思议的场景； 3）武器的打击感不错，物品收集要素很下心思。  缺点： 1）像素风的画面看上去有些脏，可能作者本身就喜欢这类的设计； 2）有的地方音乐优点惊悚，大半夜瘆得慌。  总体打分的话，4/5吧。
Date 2017-05-27 Playtime 15h 32m Rec Positive Fantastic Game. The love for the classic metroid series is clear.  A great example of proper nostalgia; Hitting the theme and feeling while also adapting modern game making lessons.  (Metroid need maps)(Metroid 3 was fairly locked into what weapons you'd use.)  Many options with playstyle except the at the end....No spoilers;  the story suggests a choice at the end, but doesnt give it.  I did not agree with the character and would have liked to see a final scene based on what I thought was going on.  This feeling is made worse with the extras after the credits suggesting that I was right.    Still....the amount of work and thought behind the curtain of this game is simply amazing.
Date 2017-05-27 Playtime 93h 20m Rec Positive Very fun Metroid-esque game. Well done!
Date 2017-05-27 Playtime 21h 25m Rec Positive 游戏好游戏，找密码太恶心，虽然不收集一样能通关
Date 2017-05-26 Playtime 12h 52m Rec Positive I really loved axiom verge, it had a few rough edges, but overall was very entertaining and had a decent story.
Date 2017-05-26 Playtime 19h 6m Rec Positive Another great metroidvania game.  + awesome soundtrack + many different weapons (even though only few of them are actually useful sadly) + a challenging difficulty (yes that's a good thing for anyone that likes a challenge like me) + really good movement later on in the game (as a speedrunner of various other games I highly enjoyed going fast casually) + if you are done with the game then there's still 100%, or just do a speedrun in speedrun mode + interesting story line, as you only get one view from the playing through itself, but there's a lot more background information you can find in the notes + good art direction with use of colours, effects and pixelart  - some control flaws with dashing and not being able to go to one direction, but shooting towards the other one - maybe too difficult for some people - some item locations are pretty bs and you won't be able to find everything on your own  all in all I highly enjoyed playing this game and it's well worth the money.
Date 2017-05-25 Playtime 17h 24m Rec Positive Just don't get stuck.
Date 2017-05-25 Playtime 17h 15m Rec Positive Absolute pleasure playing this game. Having played Metroid back in the days of the SNES and various games from back then i was pleased to go back to that time but with an interesting story to boot and an addicting soundtrack. I also recognised some sounds that i could swere were from games like Super R-Type and the like wich made the gameplay experiance just that much more fun.  To be compleately honest, I don't normally buy games like this but when i saw the screenshots and what not, something in me just told me to go for it and i must say i was not dissapointed. 15 out of 10 stars. i will likely play through this game again when the urge hits me. Just wonderfull.

Date 2017-05-25 Playtime 5h 23m Rec Negative Successfully weirded me out.  The hallucination boss was too much.  Gameplay was solid, for what it's worth.  My only minor complaint being that walls have two ways to be secretly circumventable (drill and address).
Date 2017-05-24 Playtime 10h 50m Rec Positive It's a homage to Metroid.  Made by one guy.  That plays fantastically. If you even remotely love the Metroidvania style, like exploring and like the great variation and challenge in finding everything. Get it. It's worth it, even at full price.  And the music. Wow.
Date 2017-05-23 Playtime 16h 17m Rec Positive This game left me hungry for more.
Date 2017-05-23 Playtime 16h 21m Rec Positive Very good game.  Great level design, good story, decent gameplay and is very reminiscent of older Metroid/Castlevania style games, and the soundtrack made me cum buckets. Only issue I had with the game is having to constantly backtrack through the entire map multiple times as you unlock new items to progress and to access secrets that you couldn't previously reach. A fast travel system would've been nice, but I guess it wouldn't have really worked as some areas require you to get trapped until you get to the item that allows you to escape. Still very fun though.
Date 2017-05-22 Playtime 13h 41m Rec Positive Just completed it. Great game. Lots of weapons, unlockables and things to figure out.  Unfortunately it had some crashes along the way. And could have less text.
Date 2017-05-22 Playtime 33h 12m Rec Positive I rate this game as highly as Super Metroid and AM2R. It's atmosphere is different, more upbeat than the Metroids. But it works well.  It's a massive game, with plenty of challenge. A lot of weapons to collect, hidden areas to find and huge bosses to take down.  On top of the story is pretty decent too.  It'll be many hours before you find everything and see the ending. For the price this game is well worth getting.
Date 2017-05-22 Playtime 5h 25m Rec Negative fun for a while but gets really tedious with too much backtracking and an outdated map system very soon afterwards
Date 2017-05-22 Playtime 10h 42m Rec Positive I had just invested about 4-6 hours at this point, and I just fought the 4th boss at Kur (Grib Tab / scorpion thingy). And I started off playing Hard mode. I decided to dive straight into hard mode without even knowing the game before hand. If this is what people call a "metroidvania game" its got me really hooked into the genre. I have to say this is one of the few true metroidvania games that I really felt invested in. I also played DMC3, Spyro Attack of the Rhynocos and Ninja Gaiden Black which are fairly close to the genre where you gotta backtrack to progress and upgrade.   Usually I play linear platformers but this game does have "different" type of platforming. Its just not instant kill mobile buzzsaws, pendulums, moving platforms, unpredictable spikes or etc. Most common enemies act as the hazards themselves rather than trying to kill you (although some types will follow you and jump over platforms if necessary.).   You definately change as the protagonist is changing. He is getting stronger but so are you. i used to fear those humanoid zombie thingies that jumped and charged at you because my guns tickled them and the enemies were much faster. This game doesn't spoon feed you but spoonfeeding is something I see too much in modern games. Instead you gotta try to stay away from the objective until you grab those upgrades. Now that I explored and found a few extra things, I don't fear those zombies anymore.  The boss fights don't feel cheap but that doesn't mean that they aren't challenging. They make you platform and jump while managing to aim at the same time. Its easier said than done but their patterns can throw you off and it gets frustrating. They are fair because they show you their weakspots and you can see the whole entire necessary field between you and the opponent. However its up to your instincts and pattern recognition to defeat the boss. I hate it when bosses in other games aren't visible within the screen borders. Its a pet peeve I have with Freedom Planet because if I could see the entire field, then I can assess my positioning. Instead Brevon's mech keeps mowing me down because I didn't see him past the borders.   If I didn't mention about the creepy atmosphere and the grand scale of the world, well...now I did and its awesome. Its one of the main reasons why I am still hooked into the game. Interesting world but very spooky.
Date 2017-05-22 Playtime 14h 9m Rec Positive Solid Metroidvania game. (More on the Metroid side.)   Nothing will ever really compare well to Super Metroid, so with that in mind, it's somewhat comparable to Zero Mission in terms of enjoyment. I'd recommend it if you're a fan of the genre. You won't be disappointed.
Date 2017-05-22 Playtime 11h 23m Rec Negative Being a fan of retro-style, metroidvania games, I really wanted to be able to recommend this game. It's not horrendous as it is, but it does have a few glaring issues that keep me from recommending it with any real earnesty.   The weakest part of the game, I think, is its combat. The weapons are varied and interesting, but the enemies you'll be gunning down are decidedly not. I think the developer didn't really grasp the implications of ranged weapons going against melee enemies very well. Enemies come in two varieties: easy or frustrating.   Most enemies fall into the first category, and can easily be blasted from afar, or by using the second obtained weapon to shoot them without entering into their line of attack. It got to the point where most enemies felt like a bother, as opposed to a challenge. The level design/monster placement did them no favors, either. The game is just begging you to cheese most enemies without ever putting yourself in harm's way. one poor enemy type, that sat on the ground and shot a burst of semi-random projectiles up and out from itself, was bafflingly placed so that you approached them from below, so that you never really entered their area of affect until after you had shot them to death from the platform under them.  The second type of enemy is much less sympathetic and shows up more and more as the game progresses. These enemies attack in a very similar manner: awkwardly fly into the player, repeatedly bump into/shoot the player until somebody dies. These enemies are frustrating to fight, which led to me just cheesing them whenever possible or just standing my ground and blasting back at them in an attrition tactic that was surprisingly effective most of the time. Trying to actually fight them was generally fruitless, as your aim is determined by the same input that controls your movement, so if you were moving around to dodge them you couldn't simultaneously shoot at them and vice versa.  Another obnoxious detail about enemies is that some of them have the bad habit of blending into the background. Now, this might have been to have some "natural camoflauge" effect, but most of the time it didn't feel intentional. The few cases were it was, the enemies were literally indistinguishable from the background until they pounced on you.  The bosses are more of a challenge than the mooks, but still feel rather bland, by and large. The only one I even care to comment on is the giant wasp that just felt so awkward to fight that it made me irrationally angry.  The sound design in the game is also rather poor, with the background music ranging from unoffensively bland to obtrusive. I ended up turning off the bgm and playing my own music in the background after about a third of the way in. Also, two of the more common sound effects (picking up health and hitting an invulnerable enemy) are for some reason much louder than the rest and obnoxious.  Even given its detriments, it's not an awful game. If you're just looking for something to scratch a 16-bit itch, or give you the satisfaction that comes with discovering an interesting new weapon tucked away in some nook, then it's a perfectly servicable game. All in all, I wouldn't recommend it at full price and I wouldn't recommend it unless you love metroidvanias, but if those requrements are met, then there are worse ways to kill a few hours.

Date 2017-05-21 Playtime 5h 34m Rec Positive Outro Metroidvania excelente, o jogo te prende por horas, quem busca um Metroidvania estilo 8-bits com roupagem atualizada vai encontrar um prato cheio. RECOMENDADÍSSIMO.
Date 2017-05-21 Playtime 4h 43m Rec Positive The graphic might be occasionally hard on your eyes, but finally there is something like the classic metroid in the post-2105 with interesting story, alien atomsphere and environment that reminds me of H.R. Giger's work.

Date 2017-05-20 Playtime 19h 55m Rec Positive excellent~!
Date 2017-05-20 Playtime 12h 38m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is at its heart a love letter to Super Metroid, and you've probably read that sentence a dozen times already. However, like the best "retro" games, it takes some creative liberties with its source material and does things that devs in the 90s probably would not have thought of, and If they had, the tech level wouldn't have been able to keep up. It also has a level of mystery and worldbuilding unrivaled in the genre.  First, I have to address some personal issues I had with the controls. Axiom Verge handles well enough to be quite playable, but it also rather noticably doesn't handle as well as Super Metroid or other games of the era, or even some of its own contemporaries: the Shantae games have much more fluid movement, for example. I found myself switching between the keyboard and an Xbox 360 controller on the fly depending on what I was doing, not wholly comfortable using either. In particular, aiming and firing felt much more natural on the controller, but grappling was far easier using the keyboard, thanks to what might be the shortest and most awkward grapple in gaming. It's like nobody but me played the 2009 Bionic Commando remake. It also has curiously easy boss fights for the genre, especially considering how dangerous some of the regular enemies are.  That probably isn't a fair assesment of it, considering it was developed by one guy, unlike any of the other titles I just mentioned. With that in mind, Axiom Verge is an impressive work. It has a staggering variety of weapons that reads like a greatest hits list of shmup weaponry, everything from a basic linear projectile to a three-way spread, enemy-tracking lightning, R-Type-style curving lasers, Castlevania's fire vials, Ninja Gaiden's windmill stars, projectiles that bounce or travel along the ground, continous-fire lasers, an ice-shard spreadfire weapon and more.   Where Verge really shines is in its setting. You are Trace, a nerdy laser scientist who, following an accident at his lab, awakens in a bizarre, otherworldy place filled with fantastic things that want him dead. Like the many dead worlds Samus Aran has set foot upon, what happened to the world of Axiom Verge happened long ago. But this is different. You are not a power-armored, alien dna-infused super-warrior. You are a dazed and confused everyman lost in a nightmare. You are treading among the bones of giants and the game's foreboding, H.R. Giger-esque artwork and eerie soundtrack heavily reinforces this. It reminds me vaguely of Xargon, an old Epic Games platformer from 1993.  A central theme of the game, without going into too much detail, is the idea that things are not always as they appear. As one reviewer put it, you think you know how Verge will end, but you don't. It may not even make very much sense to you when it does, so I suggest you hunt down those notes and pay very close attention to their wording.  The game makes clever use of "glitchy" textures to represent areas of the world where reality has gone a bit fuzzy, when it is being re-written. What would indicate an error in any other game is a feature here, a potential gateway to elsewhere. With enough items, the world opens up in ways you probably woudn't have anticipated going in- where the journey of many other platformer protagonists would end, Trace's is only beginning. The esotericism of its backstory is even reflected in gameplay- some items are so well hidden that there is no possible way to discern their location without literally shooting and probing every wall with every ability, a questionable design choice, I'd say, but easily remedied by a guide and quite in keeping with the games' overall feel. There are even "secret" worlds whose placement and contents are randomized in each playthrough, that are implied to exist outside of the reality of most of the game- to the point where items found within do not count towards your completion percentage!  If you are as big a fan of Metroidvania as I am, then you owe it to yourself to play Axiom Verge, but even more so if you appreciate quality aesthetic design in games and the ability of them to put you in a unfamilar and uncomfortable reality. Verge will remain in my conciousness for a very long time.
Date 2017-05-20 Playtime 4h 0m Rec Positive Super good time :). Nice game, nice story, great graphics and music.
Date 2017-05-20 Playtime 24h 5m Rec Positive It's like if Metroid, Super Metroid, and Contra had a three-way love child.  Great gameplay (use a controller), great retro graphics, excellent soundtrack. Story is kinda meh but is secondary for this type of game.  If you like Metroidvanias at all, try this game!

Date 2017-05-19 Playtime 20h 33m Rec Positive When I first played Axiom Verg, I fell in love with it. I love the art stye, gameplay, story, music, everything. It may look alot like metroid but oh baby is it different in some ways. Also the way secrets are panned out is really interesting and can be a little easy to find or just pass you by unnoticed.
Date 2017-05-19 Playtime 9h 47m Rec Negative All these good reviews about this game are on crack. It was fun and interesting at first, but half way through I realized it was a terrible game.  If you're looking for challenging combat, do NOT play this game. Combat is repetitive and cheesy. Most of the time you can't avoid getting hit by monsters late in the game without cheesing because theres no form of iframes or dodging in this game until you get one particular upgrade and it's not enough.  The latter boss fights in the game are just "How much hp do you have and how many dmg upgrades did you find so you can  face tank everything and beat the game?" I've never played such a bad game. You know a game is bad when you just spam the attack button, get hit by everything, and still win. There's also no penalty for dying and you keep all upgrades on the run you  I played on hard mode and the only boss I ever took more than 3 tries awas the last boss nd it was a matter of RNG of how much hp monsters dropped. Most bosses took 1 or 2 tries.  The reward for exploration is meh. Most of the time it's just another useless weapon. I remember I solved some cryptic puzzle and got a useless weapon for it that I never used. Since there is no fast travel trying to backtrack and find secrets got really repetitive although I did explore and find most of the upgrades with no walkthrough, some of them felt impossible to get. I guess the puzzles there were too difficult for me.  Then again, if I wanted to play cryptic puzzle game I would play La mulana.

Date 2017-05-18 Playtime 12h 33m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a Metroidvania style game where you play as a scientist named Trace, that finds himself in a strange and dangerous world after an accident takes place in the lab he works in.  I played the game using the Playstation Dualshock 4 controller and it worked like a charm.  Character movement is responsive, weapon selection and inventory menus are intuitive and non-convoluted.  The graphics are a throwback to the classic 2D pseudo-pixelated style like Super Metorid and other SNES era games.  Overall the aesthetic is nice and varied environments never let you get bored of what you see.  The music is what you would expect, a sci fi synth vibe which adds to the overall mood and immersion.  On normal difficulty, you get an enjoyable experience.  Boss fights offer the right amount of challenge and regular enemies put up enough of a fight for the most of the game.  Later on when you get more powerups things got a bit on the easier end, especially for the final boss.  Overall I spent just over 12 hours to beat the game on my first run, however collectibles completion was just about 85%.  Axiom Verge is a fun throwback to the classic Metroidvania style games and I would recommend it to anyone that's a fan of the genre.
Date 2017-05-17 Playtime 10h 51m Rec Positive Slow at first but once you start to play it a bit it's a really fantastic game. It's like cavestory where it takes an old school 16 bit look and feel and manages to have amazing graphics and very compelling gameplay.
Date 2017-05-17 Playtime 10h 11m Rec Positive This game captures very well the essence of what makes Metroid such a great game, then puts in own spin on that. Environments are amazing; sound design is great; story is very interesting and mysterious and still leaves room for theories after finishing.... If you have been trying to find something to scratch the Metroid itch since Nintendo seems to be forgetting it is a thing... PICK THIS UP!! It is worth the full price!
Date 2017-05-17 Playtime 7h 32m Rec Positive A few frustrating points, but an ultimately solid game. I think my biggest annoyance was very frequently accidentally triggering the 'double-tap to teleport' power using the analog stick. Ironically, the same power would sometimes be unresponsive while attempting to deliberately trigger it.   I do enjoy the aesthetic, music, and general playstyle of the game, however. It very obviously borrows from Metroid in its  style without coming off as a ripoff. Some of the weapons feel very rewarding to use,  and the 'glitch' powers are interesting to play around with. Other weapons, however, I simply never used - I think there were far too many.
Date 2017-05-17 Playtime 0h 32m Rec Positive It's basically Metroid.
Date 2017-05-17 Playtime 15h 20m Rec Positive If you like side scrollers, platformers, shooters, and especially if you liked Super Metroid, this game is for you.
Date 2017-05-16 Playtime 25h 8m Rec Positive Este juego es increible, echo como en la vieja escuela donde tu tenias que investigar que camino tomar, regresar para obtener objetos, aprender como funcionan tus habilidades, etc. Ampliamente recomendado si te gusta la vieja escuela, los desafio, pensar estrategias y morir para saber como son las mecanicas :p lml [b] Watain is the best black [/b]
Date 2017-05-16 Playtime 22h 27m Rec Positive Excellent game for fans of Metroid. Not only does great with the gameplay but also replicates that Alien inspired style and feel that Metroid had.
Date 2017-05-16 Playtime 4h 0m Rec Negative I'm playing through this game now wondering if it's ever going to get good.. so far just seems like a poorly planned Metroid copy, but then again I am comparing it to Super Metroid.. and we all know how awesome that game is, hard to craft at that level.. especially one person, impressive they got pretty close - the differences in this game are pretty cool on their own, but they aren't gelling into anything that's really fun.  Does this game get better as you go through? Or does it always seem like a repetitive, kinda boring, poorly planned Metroid game?
Date 2017-05-15 Playtime 20h 8m Rec Positive Buy it now!
Date 2017-05-15 Playtime 11h 36m Rec Negative This game just rubbed me up the wrong way. It's playable, and I'm enough of a completionist that I had to finish it, but the controls, the music, and the overall aesthetic annoyed me.
Date 2017-05-15 Playtime 9h 11m Rec Positive Most certainly one of the best metroidvania games out there. The plot is not revolutionary, but is engaging and detailed enough to keep you interested. The music is amazing, from chiptune to indian vocal samples. Gameplay is quite complex, with many different weapons and items, sometimes it can even get a bit overwhelming. But difficulty never feels cheap. The biggest flaw in the game is navigation, sometimes there's not much to tell you what to do next, and you have to wander around for quite a while until you figure out what you gotta do. All in all, highly recommended for anyone, especially those looking for a new metroidvania fix.
Date 2017-05-14 Playtime 21h 53m Rec Positive This game is amazing. I would be still be immensely pleased if I had gotten it for $30 or $40. Definitely a must buy for anyone who likes metroid, or any similar games.
Date 2017-05-14 Playtime 9h 53m Rec Positive J'attendais impatiemment quelque chose depuis 1994... Le voilà, le fils de Samus est là !
Date 2017-05-14 Playtime 14h 35m Rec Positive 超 级 好 玩 ！ 唯一的缺点就是没中文和不知道接下来该做什么
Date 2017-05-14 Playtime 23h 12m Rec Positive I have been addicted to video games since the crash.  I have owned nearly every console and PC configuration released in North America since the Atari and MS DOS.  Taking this into account, I can comfortably claim that Axiom Verge is perhaps the best platformer I have ever played.  That truely says a lot.  What is Axiom Verge?  At first glance, it looks like a clone of the original Metroid for the NES.  But no.  It's much more of a cleverly crafted love letter to the era.  Back in the day, NES titles often suffered from bugs known as address corruption.  These would usually take the form of glitched or discolored blocks or enemies.  The original Metroid was notorious for this.  What was a bug in Metroid, Axiom Verge utilises as a fully intentional (and functional) feature.  For the sake of spoiler protection, I won't go much further than this.  Every area is beautifully crafted, perfectly matching the style of the time - but with oh so much love and polish.  Indeed, polish is perhaps this game's strongest asset.  The music?  Pulse-pounding.  I know of no other way to describe it.  The developer has turned chiptune into a veritable art form.  The story is "meta" - confusing, alluring, and possibly brilliant.  I would truly love to see it expanded upon in a sequel.  Game-length is perfect.  Slightly longer than any 2D Metroid title, including Fusion and Zero Mission.  In the "metroidvania" genre, it checks off ALL the right boxes.  If you're a fan of said genre, take the advice of this old gamer:  Buy it.  You won't regret it, and it's worth the full asking price.
Date 2017-05-14 Playtime 4h 28m Rec Positive Brings back wonderful memories of Metriod.......much more so than games like Guacamelee and other Metroidvania like games of the recent past!
Date 2017-05-14 Playtime 8h 22m Rec Positive GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: [u][b]70% YES[/b][/u] / 30% NO  [h1]GOOD[/h1] [list] [*]Gameplay feels solid and you get a lot of options to approach combat. Most of your options are tied to weapon mods you find for your gun, which could turn off some, but if you have an exploration itch this shouldn't be a problem. [*]Graphics are fairly relaxed with a definite push in the Metroid direction, which is great. Some of the great robot beings look beautiful and intimidating despite being allies. [*]The game does a good job balancing new tools and giving you ample zones to return to once you obtain them. [*]Enemy design is crazy cool and they often convey what attacks they'll do with just their design. It always felt great to see a new monster and had an idea what it was about to do. [*]While most of the mechanics are good like the teleports, I'd like to specifically point out the drone mechanic. It's rather satisfying to shoot out your drone as a means of platforming and teleporting around. I wish they played more with the idea of robot allies, like options, but it's fine as is. [/list]  [h1]NEUTRAL[/h1] [list] [*]Bosses aren't that great. Most are just horribly easy with maybe one of them that can give you a run for your money. Can't say I felt excited fighting any of them nor could I recall any. [/list]  [h1]BAD[/h1] [list] [*]I don't like the look of the main character. His hair, sideburns, and overall attitude just made me sigh a bit every time he appeared in portrait conversations. [*]I felt like enemies were, for the most part, fair and you could approach them with a decent strategy and most of the time come out unscathed. This isn't the case with the enemies in the last area, which spam bullets and lasers out of every point of their body and sometimes you deal with quite a few of these before hitting a boss room. These enemies felt cheap and maddening compared with a game that ramped up tactics with new tools quite well. [*]The story is uninteresting and generic. It never really does anything surprising nor does enough to pull you in. Quite frankly I only even have a basic idea of what even happened despite beating the game.  [/list]  [h1]SUMMARY[/h1] Axiom Verge is a pretty good Metroid-esque game with cool enemies, great robot ally designs, unfortunate looking main character, and forgettable bosses. Hardcore fans of the genre would probably feel satisfied buying it at the full price, but I'd recommend picking this up at a sale price of at least 50% off for everyone else.

Date 2017-05-13 Playtime 1h 31m Rec Negative [h1]Monotonous[/h1]  This game has no soul. I like the setting but it isn't atmospheric. The level design is the same copy paste of blocky layout and is mediocre, the only difference are the textures. Items are placed in locations that are easy to reach and doesn't give you a sense of accomplishment, like laying in the centre of a standard corridor unguarded. The game doesn't give you any urge to explore and becomes monotonous quite fast. I've encountered two bosses in which I haven't died once, are too easy  and have uninspired attack patterns. The retro-like graphics are awesome though, and the controls and gunplay are super smooth but those are the only goods things this game has to offer really. I would suggest picking up Environmental Station Alpha over this one, that game surpasses Axiom Verge in almost every way.
Date 2017-05-12 Playtime 11h 26m Rec Positive Terrific metroidvania.  If you like that genre you should pick this up.
Date 2017-05-12 Playtime 24h 18m Rec Positive Best Game EVER
Date 2017-05-12 Playtime 1h 52m Rec Positive Personally, I'm a big fan of Super Metroid and "Metroidvania" games in general, like Symphony of the Night and the GBA Castlevanias or even Shantae, Teslagrad and Steam World Dig. So I was tempted to buy this game on the Wii U but I saw it here with a good discount (50% off). All I can say is that I was not dissapointed, the graphics are very Super Metroid-like and the music is awesome, the map system is very similar to the Castlevania games and the feel of the game is just top-notch, definitely, give this game a try!
Date 2017-05-12 Playtime 36h 49m Rec Positive Axiom Verge > Metroid  the soundtrack is godlike.  gameplay is amazing.   10/10 
Date 2017-05-12 Playtime 9h 17m Rec Positive Amazing game if you enjoy Metroid games.  Perfect art style, music, and gameplay to bring up nostalgic feelings toward classics like Super Metroid.  Could not put it down.
Date 2017-05-12 Playtime 12h 15m Rec Positive What if Super Metroid had been drawn by H.R. Giger? You'd probably end up with something like Axiom Verge. Axiom Verge initially seems like a straight clone of Super Metroid. That's hardly a bad thing. Super Metroid is fantastic and lots of games could learn from it. That said, Axiom Verge quickly establishes an identity of its own. It could have taken the easy way out and copied the abilities found in other Metroidvania games, but Axiom Verge has plenty of unique ideas to throw at you.
Date 2017-05-12 Playtime 80h 20m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is one of those games you play and get an immediate sense that you'll be going back and replaying it a lot. Thomas Happ is a fantastic developer and this game is a shining example of how to make a game. The controls are tight and there is no uncertainty about where you're going to be moving while you're in control. The story is deep, but you don't need to know the story to beat the game, with the journals/logs providing a deep sense of worldbuilding. The soundtrack is top-notch electronica, and you need to listen to it with headphones to fully enjoy it. And of course, the spritework is just. So perfectly done.  The added speedrun mode is the icing on the cake. After my first playthrough, 100% completion over 30 hours, i played on hard mode, beat it in 10 hours, and now i speedrun the game whenever I'm feeling down or want a quick game fix (1:38:45, baybee). This game is fantastic, and I heartily encourage you to get it if you want a great, well-crafted indie game.
Date 2017-05-11 Playtime 39h 29m Rec Positive Do gatunku Metroidvanii przekonałem się stosunkowo niedawno. po Cukierkowym Ori and the Blind Forest i prześmiesznym Guacamelee stwierdziłem ze czas na coś bardziej mrocznego. Wybór padł na Axiom Verge i był to wybór jak najbardziej trafny. Świetna muzyka (choć niektórych może denerwować w niektórych lokacjach), Mocno archaiczna grafika (co zamierzone), ogromna mapa świata który to rzadzi sie swoimi prawami, tony znajdziek i powerupów które z nerdowatego studenta z karabinem laserowym przeobrażą Trace'a w półboga który może zmieniać otoczenie niemal na własne życzenie. dla mnie osobiście jedynym mankamentem jest niekiedy koniecznosć wracania się przec cały poznany świat po jakiś przedmiot by pchnąć fabułę naprzód.  Od dawna żadna pozycja nie przykuła mnie tak mocno do monitora. Szczerze polecam
Date 2017-05-11 Playtime 38h 55m Rec Positive Excellent Metroidvania game.  Lots of exploration, but the map helps guide you as to where you should go.  Story is compelling and along with the messages you may find, tells a lot about the world. Unique game mechanics and great replay value.  Music is atmospheric and driving.  9.25/10
Date 2017-05-11 Playtime 19h 53m Rec Positive Begins as casual fun game with retro graphics from last century, continues to be fun as the difficulty, rewards and exploration keep me hitting the one more try button.
Date 2017-05-11 Playtime 21h 38m Rec Positive It's so fun that you will want to finish it in one sit then feel regret for finishing it too quickly. Even though this game is not for everyone due to rely heavily on players' memory, making newcomers of this genre to get lost quite easily and hating the game because of this; you can't go wrong with this one. I loved the art, soundtrack and gameplay of the game. The story made me want more, but it's not an actual problem. It made me discuss with a friend about the lore and story of the game.  The only time I had an issue with this game was at the puzzle where you get [spoiler]the drone[/spoiler]. Had to watch a youtube video just to feel stupid and ashame with myself due to the simplicity of the situation. [spoiler] I won't count the amount of weapons as an issue because you can choose how to play, cheesy, normal or challenging. (There are some useless, though). [/spoiler]  It has a SpeedRun mode to those who want to play without re-reading the story and have a timer to measure well how they are doing. Ideal for those who love speedrunning.  I hope Thomas Happ keeps doing more amazing games like this one.

Date 2017-05-10 Playtime 20h 8m Rec Positive Love the look and feel of this game, and the soundtrack is great. Strongly recommended to any Metroid fans.
Date 2017-05-10 Playtime 43h 25m Rec Positive This game captured the same joy and eagerness to explore as Metroid when I was a kid. To top it off, the atmosphere, music, and lore are outstanding. Highly recommend.
Date 2017-05-10 Playtime 0h 31m Rec Negative Way overhyped. The first 10 minutes I was amazed. The music, the setting, I dig it. But than grinding begun. The story line stopped completely, just shooting and jumping. After another 10 minutes I noticed that with new enemies the only difference is they are in different color and they are harder. Also animations are not really great. Just ok but simple and not amazing. So I then I decided to quickly jump thru the large portion of the map and see what's later. I found it's not really much different. In a 18euro title I expect more. Especially towards animations and game variety. This game is worth maybe 3euro, not more.
Date 2017-05-10 Playtime 9h 23m Rec Negative This game IS a fantastical example of what an impressive feat [u]ONE[/u] man can achieve when building a good game from start to finish. And immdeately we come to a reason [u]why[/u] one person shouldn't do it to a scale that Axiom Verge tried to pull everything off: it is lacking in all the component fields as a result... Artwork is nice, but not varied enough; music is ok but doesn't have thought continuation throughout; story is interesting to start with and then goes into an incoherent vector and I'm still not sure if I understood what Tom was trying to convey. After playing it through it seems much more could've been done in the universe and storyline. gameplay mechanics are good but some parts are really fiddly to work with and the variety of weapons was there just for the sake of it. It didn't add anything different and I played 96% of it using combination of two weapons again with a ratio of 80% to 20% where long range was a necessity. The amount of unnecessary gadgetry was baffling almost to a level of a point-and-click adventure game where you would get a shiny new item with a dedicated button only to use it in 3 locations throughout the map. The area that I could not get any complains at is the technical side. No crashes, runs impossibly smoothly, loads fast, and didn't end up in any unforseen scenario throughout the whole run (never stuck in a wall or anything of the sorts). Most of luck in the future Tom, I really really hope your next game will be with a full(er) team, at least one guy in each sector to get all the distractions out of the way!  Bottom line: It was a nice journey, but I wouldn't play it again. Could be regarded as a decent pickup on a sale.
Date 2017-05-10 Playtime 12h 30m Rec Positive This game is amazing. The story is one of those well pieced together journal entry driven things, and your jaw will drop multiple times. The gameplay is smooth. The graphics are very well done, the level design is brilliant, and you don't ever feel lost. That being said, there are a few really frustrating rooms and enemies. The music fits well and is ambient for the most part. The sound design is pretty darn spot on, but a nitpick would be when you hit an invincible enemy with a multihit weapon it makes a loud irritating noise. The bosses weren't the strong point of this game for me, there were a few good ones, but the rest are either too easy or super frustrating.  All in all despite its flaws, it's still a damn good game. 8/10
Date 2017-05-09 Playtime 25h 35m Rec Positive This is one of the best super metroid clone games ever, the only way to beat nostalgia is to be better than it!

Date 2017-05-09 Playtime 17h 49m Rec Positive Axiom Verge ist ein Metroidvania-Titel, der sich stark von Metroid hat inspirieren lassen, aber trotzdem eigene Ideen präsentiert. Auch wenn ich das Spiel an dieser Stelle ausdrücklich für alle 2D-Metroid Fans (und eigentlich auch Nicht-Fans) empfehle, hat das Spiel kleinere Mängel.   So ist die Steuerung allgemein in Ordnung, jedoch gibt es "Fähigkeiten" und Items, deren Benutzung etwas Geschick erfordern, weil die vorgesehene Steurung nicht immer ganz so funktionieren will.  Auch das Balancing des Gameplays ist teilweise nicht immer ganz optimal gelöst. Vor allem die Endgegner sind teilweise echt lahm, erst recht, wenn man sie so besiegt wie es der Game Designer nicht vorgesehen hat. Wiederum erscheinen andere Endgegner dezent unfair. Auch die normalen Gegner sind - gerade am Anfang eines neuen Gebiets - etwas stark. Jedoch gerade die Gegner aus den ersten Gebieten verlieren ziemlich schnell an ihrer Bedrohung. Trotzdem ist es z.B. ärgerlich, wenn man direkt an einer Schleuse von einem Gegner überrascht wird, wenn man zwischen Räumen wechselt... ja, das kommt oft genug vor.   Ich persönlich hatte immer eine Ahnung, was ich als nächstes tun muss, aber wer Backtracking nicht mag, der sollte sich darauf einstellen oder ein Walkthrough benutzen. Backtracking ist vor allem ein Sprichwort, wenn man Secrets finden will und das ist - meiner Meinung nach - auch gut so. Denn man kommt immer wieder in ein Gebiet zurück, um neue versteckte Sachen zu finden, an die man vorher nicht drangekommen wäre, wenn man eine neue Fähigkeit erhalten hat. Das macht Metroid so nicht anders und das ist einer der Aspekte, die mir an dieser Art von Games so gefällt. Das erfüllt das Spiel mit einem gewissen Wiederspielwert.  Doch velleicht hätten es ein paar Secrets weniger auch getan. Denn ich habe das Gefühl, dass vieles auch nur die Spielzeit künstlich hochpusht, also eigentlich die Waffen. Es gibt insgesamt 20 verschiedene Waffen, die man finden kann, exklusive der supergeheimen Secret-World-Waffen, auf die ich allerdings nicht eingehen werde. Die meisten davon sind jedoch leider relativ unnötig und auch nutzlos. Ich finde es gut, dass Axiom Verge sich in der Hinsicht deutlich von Metroid distanziert und feiere die Kreativität und die Originalität, die in diesem Spiel präsentiert wird, aber wie gesagt verbleiben einige Waffen unbenutzt im Inventar und hätten aus dem Spiel auch raus gelassen werden können. In Metroid hat man nur eine Waffe, die durch den Spielefortschritt immer mehr Upgrades erhält, durch die gewisse Passagen im Spiel erst erreichbar werden. Bei Axiom Verge ist es allerdings so, dass es vielleicht eine Hand voll von den Waffen auch wirklich effektiv nutzbar sind, um Gegner gut zu erledigen und im Spiel gewisse Passagen zu überwinden.   Genug gemeckert - all dies mindert nicht den Spielspaß. Axiom Verge macht in meinen Augen fast alles richtig und erweist seinem Vorbild - Metroid - alle Ehre. Es hat eine eigene Story und völlig eigene Features, wie Items/Fähigkeiten, mit denen sich Rätsel lösen bzw. Passagen überwinden lassen. In der Hinsicht hat Axiom Verge kaum etwas von Metroid abgekupfert. Einzig und allein die Formel, die ja eben einen Metroid-Klon ausmacht, ist geblieben. Das Gegnerdesign ist auch sehr originell und es gibt einige lustige Dinge, die man Gegner "machen lassen" kann, selbstverständlich nicht durch "echte Glitches!" ;) Ebenfalls das Sound-Design und vor allem der Soundtrack gefallen und untermalen die Atmosphäre optimal. Das Level-Design, auch wenn es viel Backtracking beinhaltet, ist genauso rund und abwechslungsreich wie in einem Metroid. Grafisch macht das Spiel ebenfalls einen guten Eindruck, es hat saubere Animationen, eine gute Farbpalette in einer ordentlichen Pixelgrafik. Es vermischt diese angemessen mit modernen grafischen Effekten, wie z.B. Verzerrungen bei Explosionen, die den Waffen gleich stärker aussehen lassen... und ja, auch, wenn das Waffenarsenal eine dezent verwirrende Größe hat, dennoch hat jede Waffe ein komplett eigenes Verhalten mit visuell ansprechenden Effekten. Zur Story möchte ich nichts sagen, doch diese wird weitestgehend durch klein und wenig gehaltene Dialoge, sowie auffindbare Notizen erzählt.  Im Großen und Ganzen ist Axiom Verge ein runder und gut gelungener, empfehlenswerter Titel, der seinem Vorbild alle Ehre macht, auch wenn er es knapp verfehlt.
Date 2017-05-09 Playtime 2h 56m Rec Positive [h1] You played Metroid II when you were a kid...	[/h1]   ...and you loved every part of it?  Then buy this game.  Seriously the art is awesome, the music too. Game progression is very well thought [spoiler] (the glitch gun is a great idea and is op af when you understand how to use it)[/spoiler]  Many things in this game will remind you of Metroid, except the story maybe, which is very open to interpretation. The nostalgia was strong during my playthrough.  Props to the man behind this!  Also, if you intend to buy this, don't read any guides/wikis. That would spoil the puzzle and backtracking aspect of the game, which is core to enjoying that kind of game in my opinion.

Date 2017-05-07 Playtime 6h 52m Rec Positive The best things about this game are the visuals and the soundtrack. I personally think the story, as its interesting, doesn't do the game justice. The gameplay is pretty nice too, but controls can be iffy at first. Health drops aren't available during any bosses. You're likely going to have to die several times in boss fights just to figure out the best strategy, and whether that's a big deal or not is really up to the player. You'll see yourself collecting several types of guns that are pretty outright wicked in design. Personally, as this game looks and sounds really cool, it just didn't resonate too much with me because you can not really surpass how great Metroid or Contra was (Two games Axiom Verge is heavily inspired by) without coming off like a clone, especially with so many similarities.  I will be listening to the soundtrack though! Way worth the buy!  Overall, my rating of this game is a solid 6/10. But don't let my rating discourage you- it's a pretty well made indie game that deserves its praise and my rating is just an opinion.

Date 2017-05-03 Playtime 18h 22m Rec Positive I didn't play Metroid as a kid, never liked it. So I can't be the one to attest to this games' similarity to Metroid. I can, however, tell you that this game is very addicting and after completing every map, you feel satisfied and rewarded. The story is brilliant and the gameplay is smooth.  If you're looking for an 8-Bit type side-scroller, I suggest this. It's honestly non-stop fun and keeps you looking for more. Within about 17 hours, I only managed to discover 91% of the entire map and found 70% of all the items. And that was my run on Normal, while being distracted much of the time.  Must buy, especially if on sale!

Date 2017-04-28 Playtime 23h 12m Rec Positive Буквально позавчера я [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/manuelle/recommended/283640/] писал	[/url] обзор на игру Salt&Sanctuary, которая, если вкратце, являясь игрой очень маленькой студии  (если не ошибаюсь то 3-5 человек) получила скорее всего из-за этого несколько весьма спорных гейм-идей - вероятно делай эту игру крупная студия (хотя врядли крупная студия вообще бы стала такое делать, разве что какая японская, и то сомневаюсь) тому кто придумал там например платформинг - просто дали бы по рукам, чтобы не баловался. Так вот, Axiom Verge целиком вообще сделал один человек, и сделать её чтобы до самого конца чувство меры не изменило, у него не вышло.  Сотрудник студии Petroglyph Games Томас Хапп судя по всему устал ждать когда Нинтендо разродится новым метроедом, и решил сделать его сам (Нинтенда кстати так и не разродилась, но это уже другая история). Metroid - это довольно древняя серия игр, расцвет которой пришёлся на то время, когда приставки ещё меряли битами. Так например на приставке SNES в 1995 году вышел Super Metroid, вероятно лучшая 16-битная игра вообще, несколько позже был ещё клёвый портативный Metroid Fusion, в начале века серию вроде как удачно удалось перевести в жанр FPS-a (я играл в первый прайм, он был ок, не более, возможно я играл в него поздно), но потихоньку серия загнулась, а двухмерной части не было уже почти 15 лет. Вообщем по состоянию на 2017 год, кто метроид не помнит, тому и не надо, кто помнит - тот старпёр, ну а кому интересно, тот может загуглить.  Так вот, Axiom Verge результат более чем пятилетнего труда Хаппа. Получилось ли у него сделать метроид - а то! Хороший ли это метроид - ну с оговорками.  Для начала - игра большая. БОЛЬШАЯ. Не oche bol'shaya как Knytt Underground, но приличная. Ну и никто особо не говорит куда надо идти, поэтому приходится блуждать. Блуждать можно долго, так как иногда  совершенно неочевидно куда автор хочет чтобы мы попали (и как мы бы этого добились). Потом - блуждать откровенно неудобно, уровни сделаны как будто назло игроку. Потом оружие - его тут много, даже oche - больше тридцати штук (к слову всё собирать необязательно). чуть ли не к каждому врагу нужен свой подход, поэтому быстро задалбывает это оружие переключать (а под конец игры можно разжиться разными вундервафлями типа огнемёта, и все эти кучи оружия становятся ненужными. Далее по исследованиям - это использование способностей - у героя помимо оружия ещё есть способности, это бур, которым можно ломать некоторые блоки, пушка глючащая врагов (о ней можно и отдельно), радиоуправляемый дрон (замена метроидовскому шарику), крюк-захват, лабораторный халат (причина чуть ли не 80% моего хейта) и штука похожая на взломщик кодов. У некоторых из этих полезных вещей есть и апгрейды, что тоже несколько запутывает.  Из этого всего особенно бесят крюк (особенно потому что сорваться с него проще простого, а если сорвался, то обычно очень свысока. И лабораторный халат - в его первоначальном виде он позволяет ходить сквозь нетолстые стены - надо подойти к этой стене и несколько раз нажать в её сторону. Таких мест приличное количество и они обязательны по сюжету. Так вот, у меня тупо не получалось его использовать. Ни на аналоговом стике, ни на d-pad'e. Сидел и пад долбил как дятел, пока не получалось. Не знаю почему, возможно руки, возможно и нет. Но когда ты заблудился и ищешь дорогу самое то сначала просочиться через пару таких стен туда, а потом назад. К слову потом дадут более лучший халат, который позволяет делать рывки с места, с ходу и в любую сторону пару раз нажав на стик.  Ещё одна радость подобных игр - поиск секретов. Тут их много. Проблема в том что они практически никак не отображаются (только если собрать их все на общей карте нарисуют точку). Не отображаются те из них что ты взял (казалось бы оставь метку, типа "Сдезь был Уася", но неет), не отображаются те что не найдены - поиск секретов тут натуральная боль в попе. Помимо прочего чуть ли каждую стену надо проверять различными способами, эта ломается лишь буром, через эту можно телепортироваться, эту бомбой взорвать, тут вообще невидимый проход для дрона и т.д. Потом опять будет секрета не хватать и придётся с гайдом по всей зоне лазать, ища что же ты пропустил. Помимо прочего ещё есть глитч-миры расположенные случайным образом и суперсекреты открывающие доступ к супероружию - их сначала надо найти, а потом понять что ты именно нашёл то что надо, а потом ещё понять что от тебя нужно. Как обычно некоторые из таких головоломок решаемы самостоятельно, а например на одну из них даже в гайде объяснения не было, думаю его и впринципе нету.  Ну и пара слов о глитчгане - интересная и уникальная вещь, которой можно искажать врагов, при этом изменяя условия игры. Некоторые враги становятся уязвимы, некоторые наоборот звереют, некоторые например каменеют, позволяя забираться в разные интересные места, некоторые начинают бросать бонусы. Вообщем интересная и свежая штука, несколько усложняя впрочем и без того насыщенный геймплей  Что же до игры - игра то хорошая :) Она большая и разнообразная, основные придирки - сложный поиск серетов и общая неясность не столь критичны в наши дни когда каждый второй - стример, проблемы с халатом вероятно только у меня, да и их можно перетерпеть. Топас Хапп проделал колоссальную работу, да и человек видно небесталанный, например саундтрек написанный им же, тоже вполне хорош. Да возможно стоило игру сделать не столь комплексной и несколько более "юзерфрендли", но что сделано, то сделано. Я в принципе получил скорее удовольствие от прохождения, поэтому палец вверх. Не обоже 10 из 10 конечно, но твёрдые 7-8.
Date 2017-04-28 Playtime 31h 11m Rec Positive What a throw back! I loved the environments, the asthetics, the ambiance, and the mechanics. It felt like I was back in the 90's playing the old 2D metroid games.   My only complaint is it felt a bit short to me. For such a story driven game it wasn't very long, and maybe a little cliche. That being said the story was well told, and well rounded. It's definetly a game I will play through again. The game controls very nicely. The graphics are very astheticly pleasing. The guns are all super varied, and none of them feel similar at all. It's not an extremelly challenging game difficulty wise. I only found myself dying to bosses, but only because I hadn't figured out their patterns or how to defeat them. All round good game.  I would recommend though that they put an epilepsy warning on the game though. In some areas there can be lots of flickering textures.   I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys metroidvania games.
Date 2017-04-25 Playtime 18h 26m Rec Positive TLDR: Excellent Metroidvania platform/exploration game.   This game will leave you frustrated, puzzled, slapping-your-forehead, cheering, frowning, determined, exasperated and--in the end--smiling. In other words, it is damn near perfect.  I won't get into the plot or substance of the game, but the story is clever and weaves a wonderful mystery that you unravel as you explore new areas. This mystery is something that the original Metroid gave you, but Super Metroid (as a rehash) did not. With a new world, and a new story, this takes the best gameplay elements of the Metroidvania genre, adds a few of its own and takes off.   The humor and design of the game are very self-aware. For instance, an item lets you "glitch" through walls as was famously possible on older SNES titles. The main character constantly challenges the plausibility of his situation and injects just the right amount of humor into a bizarre mystery.  Play this! If you have investigated enough to see this review, you will LOVE it!
Date 2017-04-24 Playtime 4h 53m Rec Positive This game seriously is my Super Metroid fix! 10/10
Date 2017-04-23 Playtime 0h 34m Rec Positive Какой сейчас год!? Почему я играю в метроид!?
Date 2017-04-22 Playtime 18h 34m Rec Positive This game is a triumph of style and design. It wears its inspiration on its sleeve, but, in my opinion, largely improves on the originator. The weapon variety and movement upgrades in this game are some of the most satisfying I've ever seen in a Metroidvania, and the atmosphere, look of the game and graphics are pitch-perfect and genuinely stick with you. The combat, especially in boss encounters, can become frenetic and quite challenging, but make no mistake, this game's strength is exploration. And the story, as basic as it is, is genuinely engaging.   Simply put, this game accomplishes everything it sets out to do, and more. Some may criticize it for feeling too close to what it's inspired by, but in my view its quality easily transcends the source, placing it as its own respectable addition to the genre. The fact that a single person made this entire game makes it all the more impressive.  If you like Metroid, Contra, exploration, and strange sci-fi settings, you will love this game. One of the best I've played in a long time.
Date 2017-04-22 Playtime 10h 32m Rec Positive Everything about this game was everything that I would have expected out of a 2D Metroid type game. Everything was great: the environments, the upgrades, the bosses were challenging, exploring was fun though there are a few things I disliked personally, such as not being able to really see which blocks were drillable unless they were put in a place that was blatantly obvious that the blocks were drillable but that's fine. There is a very major flaw in the game and that is the very final area of the game leading up to the final boss. Up to that point in the game it depending on your skill on getting through areas. This is not the case for the final area where it suddenly shifts to a test of endurance and patience, each death sending you straight to the bottom of a long vertical climb filled with persistantly annoying enemies placed there to ensure maximum aggravation. Other than that, it's a fine game. Pick it up during a sale if this game interests you.
Date 2017-04-22 Playtime 14h 47m Rec Positive I don't normally write reviews, but this game is fantastic. It really is a modern Metroid with fun, challenging (but not absurdly difficult) gameplay. The only real negative here is that there were times where it was possible to get "lost" and not know where you were supposed to go next (with no real way of figuring it out except to blindly explore).  This is good and bad on some level, I suppose, but some semblance of a hinting system might have been nice. (I know, I could've looked up a walkthrough, but having something in game to help direct the gameplay is preferable to looking up spoilers on the internet.)  All in all, though, absolutely terrific game.
Date 2017-04-20 Playtime 35h 34m Rec Positive I crave games like this. I eat them up in a couple of days, and yet, I keep coming back to Axiom Verge. The story is so open ended and fascinating, and it feels so much like metroid in some places it's unreal. This is a true spiritual successor to Metroid.  I recommend this game A++
Date 2017-04-17 Playtime 3h 59m Rec Positive I'm not too deep into the game yet, but as someone who hasn't played Metroid or Super Metroid in probably 20 years and just barely played it then, I feel I have a pretty unique perspective on the game.   In short, anyone can enjoy this game whether you describe yourself as a Metroidvania fan or not. It's got a cool setting, varied enemy types, great weapons, and the good gravy the map is big. The music is awesome too, and I'm not a huge chiptunes guy. The graphics work for me and I'm typically put off by the pixelated indie game style.  All I'm trying to get at is that this is an awesome game, and that awesomeness transcends a person's usual genre proclivities. FPS fans should dig it, 4x fans should dig (I don't know why, just because), and RPG fans will surely dig it. Go play it and see for yourself.
Date 2017-04-17 Playtime 16h 14m Rec Positive Absolutely amazing, one of the best retro style games i have ever played, this took me back to metroid and even ninja gaiden, the feel of the control is perfect, movment and combat come togther smooth and seamless. This is a perfect exapmle of less is more, this game does not need all the 3D HD 4K blah blah, this game sends you on a trip through a multitued of beautiful and intricate levels. The only problem i have is that a sequel has not been released yet
Date 2017-04-16 Playtime 33h 43m Rec Positive Awesome metroidmania game!!!

Date 2017-04-13 Playtime 18h 30m Rec Positive -20mins of play time game review- What i've seen so far i like. this feels very much like metroid 1 for the NES years ago with much tigher play controls and some of the features that made the SNES version so much fun (saves over passwords).  i am very very much looking forward to diving in deeper once i get the time to play. So far so good.  -Finished Game review-  i liked this one length and depth were great. as for the running back to uncover new items with newly aquired abalities didn't really feel much a chor. Boss battles were mostly enjoyable even if the earlier ones were a bit on the easy side. What else can i say, if you dig the metroid-vania games you should enjoy this one too. At a later date I could see myself going for a 100% completeion, as there were more then a few weapons that i missed.
Date 2017-04-11 Playtime 14h 7m Rec Positive This is an awesome Metroidvania game. If you like the 2D Metroid games, this is definitly something for you.
Date 2017-04-10 Playtime 15h 15m Rec Positive A superb Metroidvania title, with a huge, well constructed map chock full of items, weaponry, and upgrades. Samus would be proud.  You start off not knowing where you are, or how you got here, with minimal plot revealed, you must start fighting your way through an alien world. As you gain new abilities, the map opens itself up to new possibilities, letting you swing from ceilings, drill through solid walls, and navigate tight crawlspaces, unravelling the mysteries of a bizarre new world as you do so. Along the way you'll find yourself facing a variety of enemies which can be killed or corrupted into alternative modes that can help you, hinder you, or just turn them into a new challenge to face. Occasionally when faced with new enemies, you'll corrupt them in an attempt to depower them, only to find out that their corrupted alternative is even more difficult.  No Metroid-style game would be complete without exploration, which this game delivers in spades. There is a lot of backtracking - though this is a defining characteristic of the genre, as new movement abilities let you pass earlier inaccessible parts of the map - but even if you're not going the "right" way, exploring new areas will often reward you with a new weapon, upgrade, or note that helps build upon the story. It's important to note that unlike the Nintendo title from which this game draws its inspiration, colour-coded doors do not make an appearance here - all doors are generally open, and instead being locked behind physical barriers that require a new movement ability to bypass. This is a change I certainly support, as I could never understand why in Samus' world anyone would ever install a door that required *firing explosives* to enter - someone should really have a word with their contractors.  This exploration is helped with a character that controls exceptionally well, being both highly responsive and with movement that feels extremely well-weighted. Some of the later abilities are a little trickier to use, but in a manner that requires practice, rather than resulting in any cheap deaths. The majority of abilities are sensibly mapped to make them easily accessible when you need them in a hurry, with only changing weapons requiring more than a single keypress on a controller - which I'd personally recommend for the best experience.  Speaking of changing weapons, there are a ton of unique weapons to be found. You'll generally only find yourself using a handful, often in specific situations, and while they're not all required in order to advance, this makes a nice change to the usual limited range that Metroid players might be used to.  The graphics have a pleasing 16-bit console aesthetic, with some fantastic spritework in places and a pleasantly varied, bright colour scheme throughout. The bosses are massive, detailed monstrosities; enough so that the game often zooms out in boss rooms, as they're larger than a single screen. This can make some a little tricky, though often they can be a little easy to defeat once you figure out their patterns and the safe areas of the room. My only complaint would rprobably be the lack of single-use setpieces to give the layout of the world a feeling of logical structure - but given the alien setting, it's hard to hold this against the game as a whole.  Audio-wise, the sound effects suit the game well, but where it really shines is the soundtrack, consisting of some superb electronica, all being original mixes composed by the lone developer, really adding to the technological atmosphere. One complaint is the limited number tracks played in the main game, with only a handful played depending on whether you're in the upper or lower areas of the map - This might grate on you in time, and it certainly could have benefitted from a few more tracks for each area of the map - but this doesn't detract from what is otherwise a fantastic game.  Onto performance: As a 2D game released in 2015; I'd be disappointed if it didn't run well, but I'm happy to report that it does, with masses of sprites often filling the screen without so much as a hitch, which in a game where failing to dodge enemy fire can result in a fairly quick death and a trip back to the last save room, is incredibly important.  In a world where Nintendo seem to be resistant to taking Metroid back to anyting near its roots, this game is more than worthy in filling the gap. Some may find the backtracking offputting, and even find themselves lost at times after picking up a new ability, unsure where to use it; but for fans of Metroidvania style games this is a must-own.  9.5/10
Date 2017-04-09 Playtime 11h 47m Rec Positive It's worth every dime to any Metroid fan of the 1980's on NES.  It made me feel like I was 8 yrs old again.
Date 2017-04-08 Playtime 30h 25m Rec Positive I'd have sex with this game if it was a person
Date 2017-04-06 Playtime 12h 7m Rec Positive You played Super Metroid?   Then what are you waiting for?
Date 2017-04-06 Playtime 18h 50m Rec Positive В своё время Metroid внёс как бы новое измерение в платформеры - нахождение секретов стало совершенно необходимым для прохождения игры. Позже спидранеры внесли ещё одно измерение - использование игровых глюков, что позволяло, например, проходить Super Metroid за 15 минут. Axiom Verge как бы "легализовало" это новое измерение с помощью встроенных юзабельных "глюков". Получилось довольно интересно.
Date 2017-04-06 Playtime 20h 40m Rec Positive You've played this before just in in different froms.  Axiom Verge takes all of the best elements from the 16 bit era action platformer.  Adds in a story that will first alienate you, misdirect you, reveal itself, pull the carpet out from under your feet, and then from the ground looking up you make sense of it all.  All the while you're comfortable in this familiar skin.
Date 2017-04-05 Playtime 11h 1m Rec Positive Probably the most faithful super metroid-like out there. (Well, maybe kind of like a mix of super metroid and the original metroid)  If you've played super metroid and thought, "Hey, I want more of this", then you'll probably like this game.
Date 2017-04-04 Playtime 12h 31m Rec Positive Solid game with some interesting mechanics, but the combat leaves a lot to be desired and the game's ending is its weakest point. Overall a solid experience, but probably not worth the full $20 unless you really scrape these sorts of games to unlock all the secrets or think you'll get into trying to speedrun it (which the game goes out of its way to encourage).   Overall a very competent metroid clone that manages to put its own unique spin on the genre.
Date 2017-04-03 Playtime 11h 59m Rec Positive The best Metroid game Nintendo never made.
Date 2017-04-03 Playtime 19h 18m Rec Positive One of my all time favorite games!  The music is so good it's in my Spotify library.  The creepy organic world, the weird mystery of why you're here and what happened to this place, the amazing abilities you gain throughout, all add up to a great homage to classic Metroid games.  I highly recomend this game to any fans of Metroidvanias, sci-fi, horror, platformers, exploration, monsters, or mysterious stories.
Date 2017-04-02 Playtime 9h 16m Rec Positive It took me 9 hours to beat this game and all I got was this shitty video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48R0wHssNVE
Date 2017-04-01 Playtime 30h 35m Rec Positive Um real metroidvania, e um dos melhores que joguei até hoje.  Os gráficos ao estilo 8/16-bits são bem charmosos, a quantidade de armas é absurdamente grande, o que dá ao jogo mais variedade, e a OST é uma das melhores que já ouvi num indie até hoje, possuindo um tom muito alien e melódico, que acaba contribuindo e muito pra atmosfera do jogo num geral.  Um dos pontos negativos que notei é que grande parte das regiões do jogo não tem muita diferença uma das outras, tendo mudanças apenas em tons de cores. Outro são os bosses, onde são mais desafiadores que o próprio final boss, e a maioria deles são demorados e bem arrastados, mas que ainda possuem um fator bem interessante de escala e de apresentação.  O jogo também pode ser um pouco arrastado em relação ao backtracking, e isso ainda é piorado por conta do sistema bem ruim de fast travel que o jogo tem. Mas de resto, foi uma das experiências mais incríveis que tive num metroidvania até hoje.
Date 2017-04-01 Playtime 4h 8m Rec Positive 这游戏真心牛逼。
Date 2017-04-01 Playtime 40h 51m Rec Positive Easily one of the greatest games I've ever played. Whenever I tell anyone to get Steam, I tell them about Broforce and now this game.
Date 2017-03-31 Playtime 10h 12m Rec Positive Metroid like game with some real kick ass music. If you like metroid and you don't want to wait for nintendo, you can't go wrong with this game. Fun boss fights for the most part and a variety of guns to keep the player from getting bored.
Date 2017-03-30 Playtime 11h 29m Rec Positive it's a pretty good game that doesn't really diverge too hard from the formula of metroidvanias too much so it works.  this game straddled the line between "inspired by" and "outright stole from" nes metroid/super metroid sometimes tho, which occasionally made me question why i wasn't just playing either of those games  but it's still worth playing
Date 2017-03-28 Playtime 14h 34m Rec Positive Wow, great game. Not got a bad word to say about it really. If you don't like retro style games then it might not be for you, the music can a bit of an ear sore with its 8 bit-iness, but the graphics work perfectly and the controls are nice and crisp. There's just something so satisfying about pixel perfect platforming that HD games seem to lose out on.  If you aren't up for exploring and travelling back and forth in the rather large game world then it could be a bit tedious but I personally am fine with that side of it. In a way it's a bit of a memory test, a mental exercise to try and remember what's going on throughout the gameworld.  It is definitely one of my favourite games on Steam.
Date 2017-03-27 Playtime 7h 40m Rec Positive The best Metroid game in years. The gradual scaling of player ability is the most satisfying its been in ANY Metroidlike, in my opinion.   Tom Happ deserves your support, and this game deserves your time and money!
Date 2017-03-27 Playtime 47h 3m Rec Positive Почитал неготивных отзывов НО купил)...  + Управление настраивается!!!  + Джойстик видит!!! + Музыка великолепна  + графика думал кислотная)... Нет идеально разнообразно.  + Карта можно делать пометки в общем игра выглядит очень серьёзно.... посмотрим).   PS/ Я не верю! Такое нереально сделать одному.
Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 28h 24m Rec Positive 公理边缘由Tom Happ历时四年开发，程序、美工、音乐全部独立完成。   相较于其他的Metroidvania Game，Axiom Verge没有什么特别的创意，它只是完成度更高，为所有这类游戏的粉丝们提供足量的内容。比如更加精美的画面表现、流畅自然的探索升级系统、合理上升的难度曲线等等。你只需要沉浸在那个充满科幻气息和外星风情的游戏氛围里，一边收集道具武器一边与奇特的外星生物作战，探索自己和这片世界的秘密。      虽然是非线性的地图设计，不过初期引导十分友好，设计好的关卡会帮助你自行领悟各种武器道具的妙用(需要提醒的是，不是所有的新区域都需要新武器道具才能打开，有时候找不到路请充分发挥想象力)；随着你的收集愈发完善，就会有更多的区域和密道向你敞开，当然更加强力的敌人也随之而来。不考虑100%收集的话，你大概会享受20-30小时的美好游戏时光。   游戏中有许多的秘密通道和房间，不少需要你充分发挥自己的想象力，有时候还需要你尝试组合已经获得的各种能力。在三十多种武器和装备中，最为有趣的是武器Address Disruptor和装备Remote Drone，前者是一个能够破坏一些方块和敌人程序的黑客枪，被击中的敌人将会发生种种奇特的改变(比如将小怪变为钻头，帮你打开无法通过的岩石)；后者则是一个拥有独立血条，可以扔出去操作的无人机，帮你探索无法到达的区域，或者在低血量时帮你杀死敌人。熟练运用这两者能够使你更加容易通关和收集，并获得解密成功的快感。   优点： +恶魔城银河战士类游戏的大成之作，提供充足的2D横版动作解密游戏乐趣。  +独立游戏标志性的美术特色和音乐表现，共同构成完美的外星科幻氛围，或许这不是最好的游戏背景，但绝对是最适合此类游戏的艺术品位。  +良好的动作手感和枪械手感，各具特色的武器和道具组合。  +黑客枪和无人机的设定大大增加了游戏的趣味性和可玩性。   缺点： -Boss略缺乏个性；你不会遇到什么特别出彩特别有挑战性的boss，尤其是当你收集到几乎所有的武器和道具以后难度会显著降低，正如你儿时玩过的那些横版游戏一样。  -个别收集和解密过难。有些是因为藏起的位置太过奇葩或者获得的手段有点难以想象，有些是因为地图太大玩着玩着就忘记了(你需要利用好游戏里的标记功能)QAQ  -创意有限。相较于Fez、braid、Undertale这类我们常常惊叹的独立游戏，Axiom Verge显得过于传统和怀旧了。它更像是星露谷物语，一个由作者个人对某类游戏的狂热爱好打造的集大成之作，不太可能吸引许多新的玩家，但对于这类游戏的老玩家来说，绝对值得一试。
Date 2017-03-25 Playtime 13h 26m Rec Positive I do not write reviews often, but when I do it is for a game that I find quite exceptional.  Axiom Verge is a modern classic. The soundtrack is superb, the controls are responsive, and the world is beautiful and haunting. The gameplay is fast, fluid, and challenging. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a tough platformer that takes a classic genre and expands upon it without getting dense.
Date 2017-03-23 Playtime 1h 2m Rec Positive 有没有中文啊？
Date 2017-03-21 Playtime 15h 25m Rec Positive Amazing game on it's own and absolutely must-play for any metroidvania genere fan out there
Date 2017-03-20 Playtime 42h 12m Rec Positive The first metroidvania I ever beat, and you can really tell why. Gameplay's tough but fair, the absurd items and gadgets you get are refreshingly original, and enemies and bosses are fun to fight. Yeah, the story's weak, but it's honestly safe to ignore. Axiom Verge's gameplay, world, and utter atmosphere more than define it as one of the best of its generation.
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 15h 20m Rec Positive Grande jogo, captura perfeitamente o espírito Metroid.
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 1h 55m Rec Positive Very glad I picked this up on a whim at GameStop as part of their "GameTrust" initiative. Both the game and the collector's edition packing are lovingly crafted.
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 36h 17m Rec Positive Great game. Surprised me how well made it was, especially considering one person did it all. Superficially, it's a bit like Super Metroid, but I think it's unfair to both games to compare them too much. It has the 2D exploration, backtracking, hidden items and ability-gates which Metroid is well known for. The graphics and enemies are obviously inspired by Metroid as well. But it also does its own thing with its abilities and weapons, and feels like its own game, not just something derivative.   Saying that, something derivative would have been completely fine as well. It's not like there are a lot of good Metroid clones out there, and if you're hungry for one then you should enjoy this. (Track down AM2R, too!) But calling it just a clone isn't fair either. It reminds me of a lot of SNES/NES/Amiga/C64-era games rolled into one, with Metroid just being the strongest influence, and with some modern touches as well. Plot and cutscene wise, there is a bit of an Another World / Flashback vibe going on. It could even be an unofficial prequel to Another World, in a weird way.  Most of my time was spent hunting down secrets, which I enjoy. If you don't enjoy that, you don't really have to. The game makes sure you have plenty of things to succeed with even if you don't track down every last item. It has a somewhat ridiculous number of weapons, if you collect them all, and you won't use all of them much, but each one is interesting and several are useful in certain situations even if they may not become your main tool of choice.  Powerups/abilities suprrised me, and definitely deviate from what you would expect from Metroid or similar, while still unlocking new and sometimes surprising ways to reach places you could not before.  Combat is for the most part straightforward, but you have the option of using a device that modifies what certain enemies do, which is sometimes very useful (and sometimes not; and sometimes does some secret stuff...). Controls are responsive and fair. Boss battles are never ridiculously hard, sometimes quite easy (at least if you use the right weapon), sometimes requiring a few goes and a bit of luck. Save points are plentiful and you rarely have to traverse a huge amount of space again if you die, unless you failed to explore and find them. The save system is also nice in that death essentially teleports you to the last save point with your items/pickups and revealed areas on the map left as-is. So, unless you have a power cut, you never have to worry "will I remember to get this secret again if I die before I find th enext save point?" because you won't have to rememeber at all. I like that.  Backtracking is not tedious as by the time you're likely to want to go back to old areas to find secrets you missed or could not access originally, you will probably be so powerful (both weapons and movements) that you can cut through both the enemies and the level geometry itself like butter.  One piece of advice, and a slight spoiler: There are some hidden areas in places. Make a note of the ones you find. The game tracks whether you have 100% map and 100% items in each area of the game, but does not include the hidden areas, and they are in different places each game (from a large number of possible places). There are guides to help you find any you have missed, but if you haven't made a note of which and how many you have found then you may not know whether you are missing any or not. Save time and make a note.
Date 2017-03-19 Playtime 59h 51m Rec Positive Simply amazing love letter to Metroid. If you like side scrolling Metroidvania style games, then "Axiom Verge" is a must play!
Date 2017-03-18 Playtime 14h 47m Rec Positive A realy enjoyable and good metroidvania type game with a great soundtrack. The weapons and upgrades in this game are a lot of fun, although collecting 100% of the items will take 50+ hours. If you just play the game you will finish it in about 6-10 hours. The only thing that bothered me were the levels, which sometimes can get a bit repetitive.
Date 2017-03-17 Playtime 42h 41m Rec Positive Meiner Meinung nach einer der besten Platformer seit Super Metroid. Metroidvania in Bestform! Es stehen viele Items und Skills zur Verfügung, die Samus auch hatte, und jeden Menge neuer, abgefahrener Kram, der das Spiel weit über den Status eines Metroid-Klons heraus hebt. Auch gibt es eine gute Portion Rätsel, wer nicht gleich nach Walkthroughs sucht, wird einige Stunden mehr zu tun haben, was nicht zuletzt der großen Spielwelt und der Verschiedenheit aller Skills zu verdanken ist, Die Story kommt nach und nach, auch der Schwierigkeitsgrad gefällt mir. Bosse sind eher leicht, aber auch zwischen den Bossen beisst man schnell mal ins Gras.  Einziges Manko: Vielleicht ist dem einen oder anderen der Soundtrack zu abgefahren, ich find ihn dennoch sehr gelungen und passend.  Erworben im letzten Sale, bin vollends zufrieden. Bin noch nicht durch, freu mich auf den Rest.
Date 2017-03-16 Playtime 24h 13m Rec Positive One of the most polished, well planned, and intricate indie games I've had the pleasure to sink time into. A definite DO NOT MISS for those who enjoy Metroidvania titles, which I define as "Side scrolling platformer slasher/shooter where the main goal is to complete the map by exploring and obtaining equipment and powers that improve your ability to get around". The story is also well written, being filled in by AI beings you come across as you explore. There's even story reasoning for re-spawning at the save point after death. Intricate!  XBOX Controllers have full support and input is spot on. I have no issues with the controls in this game and really can't think of much else to say. Stellar all around and easily the best Metroidvania titles to release in years.
Date 2017-03-16 Playtime 11h 45m Rec Positive must play !
Date 2017-03-16 Playtime 9h 6m Rec Negative A decent Metroidvania. Not bad, but not quite satisfying overall. There are better games that fill the same niche. Try Cave Story or Guacamelee instead.  PROS: [list] [*]Glitch mechanics are unique [*]The Geiger-esque Rusalki are visually impressive [*]The right length; no needless padding [/list]  CONS: [list] [*]Glitch mechanics never addressed in the storyline whatsoever [*]Most weapons not worth using [*]Subpar soundtrack [*]Boss fights not particularly noteworthy [*]The ending feels wrong, like you messed up and got the bad ending, only there is no second ending. [/list]
Date 2017-03-14 Playtime 10h 35m Rec Positive the "get a powerup and unlock new zone" feature is a little aribitrary, in that you dont get power number 8 and have an epiphany like "OH NOW I CAN OPEN THAT ONE DOOR". It's more like get a power, then retreat through the entire map to see if you can figure out how that power helps get you somewhere, and hope it doesn't dead end.   overall good game, good music, would probably attempt a 100% completion at some point
Date 2017-03-14 Playtime 26h 16m Rec Positive Já tinha terminado o jogo em uma versão de console (Wii U), e depois peguei o jogo de pc/steam em um bundle.  O jogo é metroid em sua essência e veia. Gráficos pixelados a lá 8 bits muito graciosos. Armas, mapas e estrutura de exploração muito amplos. Chefe de fases de encher a tela. Truques, macetes e tudo mais que pode esperar de um metrovania. As armas são originais. O save room é bem único. E o protagonista é um cientista perdido após um acidente de laboratório. Mais clássico, impossível.  Antes de pensar em comprar o jogo, TIRE O MALDITO ESCORPIÃO DO TEU BOLSO! E pegue a versão com soundtrack! Vale MUITO a pena!  Contras? Odio, raivinha, furia contra a nintendo por não ter feito um novo metroid nestes moldes. Axiom Verge é o que precisa jogar se ama metroid e castlevania. Vai lá! Compensa!
Date 2017-03-14 Playtime 22h 5m Rec Positive J'ai tout simplement adoré ce jeu, accros jusqu'èa la fin. Par certains moment je dois avoué que de courir en rond en espérant trouver le bon passage peut devenir lassant, mais quand on y parvient c'est tellement satisfaisant qu'on est reparti pour 1 heure de jeu. Mon regret, le boss final un peu trop facile, les autres boss représentant parfois de grand défis. La musique est super.  Je recomande a tout fan de jeu retro.
Date 2017-03-13 Playtime 22h 48m Rec Positive An amazing game in terms of atmosphere, with one of the best game soundtracks I've heard. I'd recommend it for that alone.  Unfortunately, while I would LOVE to go back for a second, third, fourth playthrough, I can't bring myself to do so because the dash function that much of the game relies upon is tied only to double tapping a direction. This leads to accidentally dashing off edges when you don't mean to and dropped dashes when you REALLY NEED THEM.  It couldn't be all that hard for the devs to add an option to change it to a button that makes you dash/teleport in the direction you are holding.
Date 2017-03-08 Playtime 24h 7m Rec Positive This is one of the best Metroidvania games out there, including titles published by major companies. This game was made by just one man, and major props to him, because this is one heck of a game. Anyone who likes Metroidvanias has got to get this game.
Date 2017-03-08 Playtime 23h 1m Rec Positive Very nice metroid-clone, doesn't hold a candle to Environmental Station Alpha tho in my opinion. But that's more of an endorsement of ESA then condemnation of Axiom Verge.
Date 2017-03-08 Playtime 17h 22m Rec Positive Beat (not 100%) Axiom Verge. Very nice story. I'm disappointed though because I saw the twist coming pretty early and the gameplay didn't live up to the hype. Bosses were either incredibly easy or incredibily frustating and traversing levels felt like a chore more than an adventure often making me have to go through zones I've already been in to see if I had missed something important and not just secrets.  There was one particular point that left me pretty annoyed, which was a puzzle that was never hinted at and never used again elsewhere but was required to beat the game (unless there was a skip, Idk)  I also didn't like the True ending to the game (I looked it up), but I guess that's because I started to prefer the villain of the game over the protagonist.  6/10, Play it, don't use a guide if you don't have to, possibly beat it. Don't bother with 100% unless the game really sticks with you.
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 22h 23m Rec Positive By far one of the best games I've played in a loooong time. If you grew up in the 90s and have a love for games like Metroid and Super Metroid then this is the game for you. This game has nostalgia in spades but still is fresh and has its own take on the metroidvania genre. The weapons are fun, the controls are tight and the secrets are everywhere. A great game that I cannot recommend enough! You can easily pull 10 - 20 hours out of this game if you just throw it on hard and play it blind. Speed Run mode is available and theres an achievement for getting it knocked out in under 4 hours.  Do yourself a favor and buy this game. Its a steal at only $15.
Date 2017-03-05 Playtime 17h 50m Rec Positive Of the handfull of retro love letter indie titles I've had the pleasure of playing the past few years Axiom Verge is easily a member the top echelons. The game harkins back to the 8-bit giants, namely Metroid and Gunstar Heroes in the way you move and fight respectively. While bringing new ideas to the table such as the ability to "reprogram" many obsticles to interesting and beneficial effect.  Axiom Verge's aestetic is the kind of weird and grosteque surrealism that often is compared to the works of H.R. Giger, in an 8-bit form. I personally enjoy the intentional use of non sequitor terms to reinforce that the world does not translate easily into a language the player can understand.  The music is one of the best digital soundtracks I have heard in a long time, and even the low health alert gets in on the action beeping in time to the beat, which left me awestruck that I had not played a game before Axiom Verge that had the sense to do that.  I admire that the game does not hold your hand. Though that brings me to the only complaint that has stuck with me after playing; there is a single room on the east side of the world that requires the player to change the attributes of an object to progress. The issue being the object goes from pink to a different configuration of pink within the same pink field, which didn't cleary convey that a change had happened.  I can not recommend this game enough to fans of Metroid, surrealism, and weird sciences. The gameplay, setting, score, and philosophical concepts presented are wonderfully executed and leave enough to the imagination to excite discussion.   Bonus marks for the name being a clever use of word play.

Date 2017-03-04 Playtime 25h 20m Rec Positive Things got a little hairy when I found myself confused as to where I had to go but other than that its a pretty good game. Lots of cool weapons, a few abilities and a pretty big map.
Date 2017-03-04 Playtime 32h 27m Rec Positive Buyed it when it came out and played it again the Days ago, this game is incredible! 10/10 People who liked 2D-Games like Metriod will love this too. Enjoy
Date 2017-03-04 Playtime 8h 48m Rec Positive I wish I had the time to write this game the review it deserves but  long story short :      9~9.5/10 ( i wouldsay 10/10 but i feel perfect tens are for 'masterpieces' and classics and the like)     great story          great ending     good character development     plentiful upgrades keep exploration rewarding     nice diversity of offensive functions makes interesting gameplay     awesome visual (huge fan of pixel style)          ^^rusalki concepts particularly intriuiging      necessary gameplay/exploration items double as Useful mobility optons (keyword USEFUL)          ^^and sometiimes offensive-ish (address disruptor)     good diversity of enemies and environments     satisfying boss battles when formidable         Always a save close to a boss room      honestly when I first played this game I played around for the forst 15 20 minutes until I got to the first egg  and saved and stopped playing because it kinda felt like a generic " oh youre a scientist with a laser in a weird dimension now kill stuff" game. but when I picked it back up and met Elsanova and beyond, and saw the game for what it truly was, I was pleasantly enticed and compelled to see what this game, and I, were made of.  lol  well its 1:22am im gonna make some toast and go to bed now         IF YOU ARE A FAN OF METROIDVANIA PLATFORMERS AND PIXEL GRAPHICS THIS GAME I FOR YOU
Date 2017-03-02 Playtime 12h 17m Rec Positive TL;DR Axiom Verge is a great modern take on the retro metroidvania.  INITIAL THOUGHTS: Maybe it's the nostalgia for the retro aesthetic, maybe it's the simplicity of exploring the world of a metroidvania, or maybe it's finally having a game that feels natural on my steam controller that isn't about car-powered soccer. Whatever the cause may be, the ten hours I logged on my first playthrough were all incredibly enjoyable and even though I do have a few issues with it you can't get a better modern metroidvania experience than with Axiom Verge.  PROS: Starting from the very basics, the game looks amazing and goes to show that incredible worlds can be build without a million-dollar art budget. The retro-aesthetic perfectly matches the retro-style gameplay, creating the perfect casual atmosphere to enjoy. The world is incredibly interesting which means backtracking (you will do a lot of backtracking) rarely feels like a chore, and by the time you do have to return to an area you usually have some new ability that opens up a little bit more of a room you thought you'd cleaned out an hour ago. The game is also full of items, weapons, lore, and bonuses that are incredibly satisfying to find, so if you're a completionist you have your work cut out for you, but nothing quite beats the feeling of gaining a new ability and using it to explore more of the world. The sound design of the game is excellent as well, the background music is fantastic and the sounds your abilities make when you use them are incredibly satisfying. Sound design often gets overlooked but doing it well can make any game better, and Axiom Verge does it perfectly.  CONS: These are all minor flaws I noticed while playing. If you play with a joystick controller you have to double-tap the stick in the same direction to perform some abilities, an action that always felt a bit awkward to me especially during more delicate platforming sessions. The boss fights are fun and enjoyable but most of them can be beaten with relatively little work if you use the right strategy, which can make an awesome fight less exciting, but you by no means have to play them that way. Lastly (and this is about the more fundamental design of the game), Axiom Verge rarely leaves you lost with almost no idea where to go. That may seem like a pro, but to me the metroidvania category is all about exploring a world and discovering new things on your own. While Axiom Verge never explicitly tells you where to go your options are often extremely limited, forcing you down a singular path. At about the halfway point the game starts to open up a bit, leaving more room to explore, but the initial few hours seem incredibly scripted for an otherwise well-done metroidvania. In talking with other players not many even seemed to notice this railroading so maybe this is a moot point, but from a design perspective it's definitely there.  YOU SHOULD BUY AXIOM VERGE IF: -you enjoy older metroidvanias and are looking for one with modern polish -you're looking for a casual game to play at your own pace -you're a game designer and want an example of how games can silently guide the player -you like games with lots of collectables -you're looking for a new game to speedrun (there's a built in timer should you choose to use it)
Date 2017-03-01 Playtime 22h 48m Rec Negative Bleak world, oddly geeky background and design for the main character. I tried to like this, but I pretty much played it mindlessly over a holiday week. I should have gone out and played in the snow instead.
Date 2017-03-01 Playtime 22h 58m Rec Positive 游戏不错如果场景再丰富些，有中文版就好了，剧情还需要加深。
Date 2017-02-27 Playtime 14h 17m Rec Positive Pros: Similar to Metroid, isn't Metroid  Cons: Makes you wish Nintendo knew what they were doing with Metroid
Date 2017-02-27 Playtime 0h 11m Rec Positive Aweome game - I can't wait for part 2! MedtroidVania done right and done at a time when this format has been almost abandoned! Its crazy that 1 man did this on his own - and its a must buy! This is the closest you will get to a Super Metroid or Castlevania Symphony of the Night game until IGA releases Bloodstained!
Date 2017-02-26 Playtime 12h 39m Rec Positive Se você gosta de um bom metroidvania, com muito backtracking, e tem saudades do estilo gráfico da era de ouro dos 8 bits, esse é o jogo para você.  Uma grande aventura, com uma estória bacana, que não segura na sua mão. Você vai se sentir perdido e, para cada segredo descoberto, a sensação é sem igual ou, no máximo, parecido com o que achei de Shovel Knight.  Sci-fi na veia, trilha sonora 10, gameplay perfeito (recomendo joystick).  Resumindo, não sei por que você está perdendo tempo lendo esse review. Vai lá comprar logo :D
Date 2017-02-26 Playtime 14h 16m Rec Positive Amazing game, really hope for a sequel. The gameplay was interesting and had to offer decent amount of stuff. At first, I felt helpless and weak, but the more I proceeded, collected upgrades and explored this big world, I felt stronger and it was a fucking amazing feeling, the music and ambience really gave this game a bonus. The concept of using glitchy barriers was also dope, especially the secret glitch rooms.  What more to say? If you like Metroid-Like games, exploring and upgrading your character... this is for you then.  Can't honestly find any other game that does it better.
Date 2017-02-26 Playtime 15h 32m Rec Positive Breath taking. There is so much i want to say but... I'm sure you just came for an opinion, not a spoiler. What i will say is the mystery of what is in this game will blow you away. This will leave questions burning in your head forever.
Date 2017-02-26 Playtime 0h 25m Rec Positive Thomas Happ does what Nintendon't. While it ably substitutes for the new 2D Metroid that Nintendo inexplicably refuses to make, Axiom Verge simultaneously establishes a compelling identity of its own.
Date 2017-02-25 Playtime 21h 37m Rec Positive 9/10 :) el control lo veo raro y la historia es muy rara pero aun asi me encanta tanto su jugabilidad como su arte de pixeles :)
Date 2017-02-25 Playtime 10h 47m Rec Positive Muy buen juego, entretenido hasta decir basta. Se echa en falta alguna opción de viaje rápido entre zonas de guardado, pero aún sin eso, es un muy buen plataformas de estilo clásico y merece la pena
Date 2017-02-24 Playtime 15h 10m Rec Positive Easily one of the best metroidvania games ever made. It takes the formula of Super Metroid, expands upon it with new mechanics, a unique world, interesting story, and great gameplay. This game has tons of weapons, powerups, sprawling zones littered with secrets, interesting navigation tools and more. If you're at all a fan of metroid games or the metroidvania genre in general, this is a must play.
Date 2017-02-23 Playtime 24h 3m Rec Positive Excelente juego y de los metroidvanias mas interesantes que he jugado ultimamente. Buena musica aunque una trama un tanto confusa. Recomendable :)
Date 2017-02-23 Playtime 10h 36m Rec Positive I've played a lot of metroid-likes, but this feels like the first one to really stick to what makes 2D metroid games great, while also including enough flair and variety of power-ups to feel remarkably distinct. It's everything you love about Super Metroid with a bunch of unique abilities and a very different story. Anybody looking for the next big thing since Zero Mission was released however many years ago, this will likely scratch that itch for you.
Date 2017-02-23 Playtime 17h 28m Rec Positive História bem elaborada! Um modo bem arcaico de gráficos, mas totamente visíveis em HD. Curti bastante o jogo, produto para se pensar e teorizar enquanto joga. Recomendo aos amantes de modo história, principalmente por ser um jogo Indie.
Date 2017-02-22 Playtime 12h 27m Rec Positive Is there any way to beat the final boss without just cheezing it?  Also if you're going to copy Metroid this brazenly then have multiple ending rewards plz  I like that you play as Dr. Octopus
Date 2017-02-21 Playtime 18h 33m Rec Positive Metroid clones were created to one day evolve into Axiom Verge.  The pounding bass was enough to win me over.  The silky gameplay, throwback graphics, and apocalyptic story were just icing on the cake.  Just get it already.
Date 2017-02-20 Playtime 14h 4m Rec Positive Muito bom! 10/10
Date 2017-02-19 Playtime 16h 27m Rec Positive I, like many others, have been yearning for a new Metroid title for years. And since it seems that Nintendo is reluctant to fill that void, Axiom Verge manages to fill it for them.  This game is a great entry into the Metroidvania genre and one that is more on the Metroid side than the Castlevania side. It has a lot of elements borrowed from the Metroid formula, such as the map system, hidden upgrades, backtracking and world exploration. But, it also has a lot that lets it stand on its own. Having an item that just lets you teleport past walls, or having a beam that lets you glitch up enemies that are in your way are really novel ideas.   If you've missed that feeling of completing a Metroid game, then definitely give this game a shot.  Update as of 4/22/17:  I've now gone and finished this game 100%, so I have some additional comments on the completionist aspects of the game. Many of the item locations are super cryptic, and many times while finding items, I'd find one by pure chance of messing around and think, "How was I supposed to find this without just messing around?" There were some items that were behind walls you can just walk through, with no indication that you can walk through them. The ones that require passcodes that you decipher from the other scripts written on the wall were annoying as well. Overall, only go for 100% if you really want the challenge of running around everywhere. It took me a total of 15 hrs to find everything, and most of that was just wandering around aimlessly hoping I'd find something. I eventually had to resort to using a guide to find the last few items after 2 hrs of wandering around. Still a good game overall, just be wary of the completionist goal.  Also, as a musician, I really appreciate that the low health beep is in time with the music
Date 2017-02-19 Playtime 80h 42m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is the best Metroid game to come out in the last 10 years. The different areas are amazingly constructed and easily distinguishable. The soundtracks used for each area are memorable and extremely fitting for said areas. Gameplay and story are gripping and addicting, even challenging the player to imprive upon themselves along the way. And last but not least, there is a very wide multitude of weapons you can use, each having their own use in every situation you find yourself in.  Tl;dr: Great game. I recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the Metroidvania sub-genre.
Date 2017-02-19 Playtime 26h 26m Rec Positive Fun, but has a lot of flaws.  It's a MetroidVania game with a decent story that is more than it seems.  Combat is mostly fun, with a LOT of different weapon types and movement abilities.  The more advanced abilities are clunky to control, and can be frustrating at times.  The map is big and maze-like, with a lot of connecting passages.  This can lead to confusion while you try to find the one place you need to go.  Thankfully all the wandering around lets you find more powerups that you had missed or were unable to get to before.  Overall, a decent game.  Try and get it on sale, because while fun, not worth 20 bucks in my opinion.
Date 2017-02-19 Playtime 14h 29m Rec Positive A very good Metroid-style game with tons of fun weapons and crazy storyline. I also love the music and I recommend buying the soundtrack as well.
Date 2017-02-19 Playtime 23h 20m Rec Positive This is the Metroid game we wanted, not Other M.
Date 2017-02-18 Playtime 23h 37m Rec Positive this game is perfect. I can't understand how one man made it but its a pure masterpiece.  people who afraid that its Metroid copy. I can assure you its not. it is clearly inspired by. but its original enough with great story line, perfect gameplay and gunius level design.  people who loved Metroid will love Axiom Verge.
Date 2017-02-17 Playtime 15h 30m Rec Positive Although not the best story ever, this game got me hooked. At start, you simply can't understand what's going on, but you can't stop playing anyway. The game grew on me, It's completely worth it.
Date 2017-02-15 Playtime 20h 24m Rec Positive I find that the best definition of a niche game is a game that has features that would normally be considered faults, but to the intended audience they are perks that make the game or games special. For this game those faults are constant backtracking, secrets that no normal person would be expected to find, and parts of the game which require little more than patience and determination to get through.  And I love this game for this. The game rewards exploration, has a host of amazing abilities, catchy music, weird and interesting art, albeit a bit Freudian at times. I only really started playing metroidvania's about september last year, and I wasn't born during the "golden" age or the SNES or Playstation, and that shows how good this game is. I have no nostalgia towards that time, and this game is still very strong in my eye's.  It has some non-niche faults however, I was constantly dying, but I have sub-par reflexes especially with a keyboard so that is probably more my fault than the game's, and the difficulty is rather inconsistent, going from brutal to easy from zone to zone. There was also a part of the game that gave me motion sickness and where it was near impossible to see the enemies I was fighting, one of the few moments where putting my head down and pushing through didn't feel satifying. As well while there are a lot of fun weapons you will usually find yourself only using 2-3 that are really practical, as most are awesome to watch but pale in comparaision to the high-DPS vanilla shot, the wall ignoring electric shotgun, and the delayed detonation explosive ball to deal with powerfull enemies without getting close to them. All three of which you get in the first two hours of the game.
Date 2017-02-15 Playtime 13h 26m Rec Positive Fantastic platformer in the metroidvania style of progression and reveals.  Art style and music are enjoyable and bring a nice retro + electronic atmosphere to the experience. More than a dozen weapons, all of which feel unique and have a decent balance of pros and cons. One of the best games in the genre I have played in a while.
Date 2017-02-13 Playtime 28h 34m Rec Positive smh all these fake games will never be as good as metroid is in his game
Date 2017-02-13 Playtime 33h 3m Rec Positive 重新玩了一次，这次看着攻略地图地图道具都100%了，心满意足。 全成就就不追求了，自己几斤几两还是知道的。 玩过gba时代银河战士的朋友绝对会喜欢这个游戏，味道非常正。 配乐吊的一批，非常魔性。 说点不算缺点的缺点：武器非常多不过好用的就那几个；游戏剧情很引人入胜，但是通关后又觉得不太完整，可能需要借助axiom verge wiki帮助理解。 喜欢，太喜欢了。
Date 2017-02-13 Playtime 24h 18m Rec Positive This game is not only a well built platformer but also an interesting philosophical agruement about the nature of reality. Having playing the old school metroid platformers as well as all of the megaman zero titles I am no stranger to what makes of breaks a good platformer. This game is just that, a good platformer. What it lacks in quantity of levels and environments it makes up for in well made classic platformer gameplay with new twists. I'd love to go more into detail, but you will have no spoilers from me. It's worth the journey, even for the cheesy twist ending.
Date 2017-02-12 Playtime 11h 36m Rec Positive A REALLY good metroidvania name. What's a metroidvania? An exploration-action hybrid with large expansive 2d map, items, sense of progression and empowering your character. This game is good example of the genre, even if it is a bit linear/easy.
Date 2017-02-12 Playtime 16h 49m Rec Positive This is a good Metroidvania game, much more 'Metroid' than 'vania', although it draws from several influences. The world is pretty well designed, with some interesting secrets, although not all are well-clued enough to be worth attempting 100% without a guide. In particular there's one health node fragment which you will likely only find through sheer luck. The address disruptor is an inventive mechanic, although it's not always used to its full potential; there are few real puzzles using it, and the rewards for completing them are optional items. The game has over 20 weapons but few of them are useful or fun to use, which also makes combat a chore most of the time. Rather than trying to have as many items as possible, the game should have more closely emulated 2D Metroid, where you have fewer powerups but each has a unique purpose. The soundtrack is good and the art is impressive. The designs of the mechanised alien thingies in particular stand out.
Date 2017-02-12 Playtime 16h 41m Rec Positive A one man masterpiece of a metroidvania game.
Date 2017-02-11 Playtime 7h 7m Rec Positive Pretty fun! Metroidvania with decent exploration, secrets and bearable backtracking. Nice and gritty feel for enemy damage, complete with 2D particle gibs. Platforming is simple but there's a few challenges for upgrades here and there. Easy to moderate difficulty, mostly on bosses. Music and visuals work well but don't go out of their way to grab your attention. The style is pretty reminiscent of the first Metroid on NES if anything. Story can be a little vague but it's also nothing too distracting. I cleared the world map using all the upgrades but that barely reached 50% items, so that's pretty neat.  Overall, nice lowkey feel and a good time.
Date 2017-02-09 Playtime 20h 17m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a surprisingly good game. However, the personal taste ultimate decides whether it's good or not.  I grew up with 2D games, this game appealed to me.  The story is confusing at first, but once you uncover more of the game's lore through ingame notes and dialogue, you will understand it when you manage to wrap your head around it.  The standard controls take a little to get used to, it's not horrible. You can change them the way you'd like.  The graphics are as expected, no complaints. I absolutely love the HR Giger influence though. The distortion effects give a unique tone to it. Color schemes are OK, it's not too bright or oversaturated. My only complaint is the screwed up scaling ratio, making pixels look uneven on a 5:4 monitor.  Sound effects are more or less what you'd hear from an NES and a Gameboy Advance, which I don't mind at all.  The music is one the most important aspect of the game to me. It's one of the best I've heard, it adds to the surreal theme and general atmosphere. If it's something that makes a game good, then it has to be the game's music, at best composed directly from the person who envisioned the game.  There is no ammo (except for bombs which you find late in the game), other than that the HUD is minimal. The game borrows the map elements of Super Metroid, the map doesn't show item locations however.  Most weapons that you find in the game are just 'meh' because of their lousy damage. The only really useful weapons are the Inertial Pulse (Super Metroid's pure plasma beam) and Kilver (highest damage of all weapons, shotgun-esque hugging-range gun). The coolest weapon though is the Voranj, which shoots bolts that split in two, looking like a fractal tree. You will also find tools which are necessary to progress in the game.  The enemies can get annoying sometimes, but they are dispatched quickly by just spamming your gun - and even quicker when you picked up Power Nodes.  Unfortunately, the bosses are getting lackluster later in the game. It's really a shame, because there is always an easy way to defeat them - even the endboss.  Verdict: I'd say this game is worth a shot when you liked Super Metroid. For me personally, this is easily one of the best games I've ever played.
Date 2017-02-09 Playtime 15h 53m Rec Positive Although I haven't completed this game on Steam, I have done it on my Playstation 4 so I shall write my review based upon that.  This game is a pretty solid game. Gameplay consisted of a game similar to Super Metroid pretty solid controls and overall great soundtrack. The visuals in this game aren't much to write home about, but they fit the theme of this game. I can't say much more aside that I would recommend this game to someone whom likes the style of game of Super Metroid or wants to experience that style for the first time.  Gameplay: 78/100 Sound&Music: Sound 76/100 Music 89/100 Graphics: 67/100 Overall: 80/100
Date 2017-02-08 Playtime 16h 24m Rec Positive super fun but not quite a metroid game. if you want one of thoes go download AM2R. This is more of a hybreed between the orignal metroid and something like contra. The game doesnt leave to much of a lasting impression and is best played in short bursts. its easy to run and is a good way to kill some extra time.
Date 2017-02-07 Playtime 8h 38m Rec Positive Habs jetzt 2 mal durchgezocked, und diente als Metroid ersatz. Ich war sehr zufrieden. Sehr Gute Story. Das Spiel war für meinen Geschack etwas zu kurz.
Date 2017-02-07 Playtime 13h 10m Rec Positive It took me 13 hours to beat it. I liked it, and the music is good. Super Metroid bored me, believe it or not, but this didn't.
Date 2017-02-07 Playtime 16h 55m Rec Positive very good . ★★★★★☆  [h1]【商品説明】[/h1]  メトロイドのクローン ※日本語対応  [h1]【感想】[/h1]  SFCパッド対応させるために外部ツール使用。１週目クリアー時間は約８時間程。 細かな箇所で”スーパーメトロイド(SFC)”を超えることはできなかったが、クローンとしては恥じない出来上がりになっていた。僕は抵抗なく最後まで楽しむことができ、steamの好評価に納得できる作品だと改めて認識しました。  [h1]【おすすめポイント】[/h1] [b]アートと音楽による独自の世界観 [/b]
Date 2017-02-06 Playtime 38h 18m Rec Positive Best Metroid clone I have ever seen, good story line and a good amount of guns and power-ups. If you liked the original or the super version of Metroid than this is a must for your library!
Date 2017-02-05 Playtime 23h 30m Rec Positive Great gameplay with an insane story. Bonus points for including a speedrun mode.
Date 2017-02-05 Playtime 11h 55m Rec Positive One of the best Platformer i ever played. Even though it can't quite reach Super Metroid in terms of Atmosphere, Axiom Verge is a lot of fun.
Date 2017-02-05 Playtime 25h 39m Rec Positive Axiom verge is a thrilling romp through the metroidvania genre (Emphasis on the metroid).  The level designs harken back to  the bygone era of 8 and 16 bit platformers, but this one is beautifully crafted into a modern take on it's influential predecessors.  Vibrant backgrounds and a subtle story told not just through the discourse of it's (the game's) characters, but also the very world itself!  Axiom Verge's music does an excellent job setting the tone of the game and the designer even uses an absence of sound to good effect in certain areas, a somewhat rare skill among designers and one that speaks to the love and care put into every aspect of the game.  The game includes multiple difficulties and a speed run mode which allows you to test your platforming skills against previous runs as well as other players.  A huge catalogue of weapons (some of which are found in hidden zones randomly) allow for differing solutions and playthroughs.  If you love platformers then you will definitely love this game, easily a 10-20 hour playthrough on your first go. There is just so much to explore and try!
Date 2017-02-05 Playtime 19h 4m Rec Positive This game is a fantastic love-letter to metroidvania games.  I'm amazed that one guy put it all together.
Date 2017-02-05 Playtime 11h 56m Rec Positive Its amazing. The aesthetics are so good.  The best way to summarize it: Imagine a Saturday morning when you were a young kid, having cereal then booting up the SNES with a copy of Super Metroid. Except this time the cereal was laced with crystal meth.
Date 2017-02-04 Playtime 57h 39m Rec Positive De muita ótima jogabilidade, um dos melhores jogos 2D que já joguei.
Date 2017-02-04 Playtime 24h 31m Rec Positive I was enjoying Axiom Verge. Then I got to a point where I didn't know where to go next or get vital upgrades. It also got extremely difficult but I didn't seem to be getting any better. Consequently, my progress screeched to a halt so I lost interest. I doubt I'll ever finish this game.  Pros: Amazing music, pixel art, and atmosphere. Tight controls. I was genuinely engaged with the story. Lots of exploration. It's Metroid.  Cons: Lots of exploration. Suffers from where-the-hell-am-supposed-to-go-now syndrome. Lot's of back-tracking, which gets tedious. It's Metroid.  I can't give this game a thumbs down but I think it suffers some design flaws. Just be aware of what you're getting when you buy Axiom Verge.
Date 2017-02-04 Playtime 12h 4m Rec Positive About 12 hours to complete on normal mode, had to look up a guide to figure out where to go next a couple of times but had fun with it. Graphics and music are very open about the whole Super Metroid influence
Date 2017-02-04 Playtime 20h 28m Rec Positive never played super metroid. after axiom verge i started doing it. axiom verge is great!
Date 2017-02-04 Playtime 60h 19m Rec Positive This game got me into metroid style games. I feel that both people new to the genre like me, and those who are long time fans will enjoy this game equally as much. This truly is a masterful game.  Pros:  -Great soundtrack -Unique mechanics (Glitches) -Mysterious story -Tons of optional secrets -Tons of weapons/upgrades -Built in speedrunning timer  Cons:  -Short (8-12 hours) -Hard mode is not really harder -Certian randomized secret areas can sometimes be impossible  Overall: 95/100
Date 2017-02-03 Playtime 10h 29m Rec Negative A game that reaches for the lofty title of "the next great metroidvania" but falls short.  The story is boring.  The characters are forgettable.  The bosses are easy.  Very little differentiation between each area.  Finished the game underwhelmed by the ability upgrades.  There are some 12 different guns alone, but 3, maybe 4, are useful.  The grappling hook is jank.  The glitch gun is a really cool concept crippled by its very few uses.  At least the music is kind of cool.
Date 2017-02-02 Playtime 22h 26m Rec Positive This game is really good like Super Metroid
Date 2017-02-02 Playtime 2h 17m Rec Positive This game takes the love and greatness of the original and super versions of Metroid, and turns it into an awesome new experience. The music is breathtaking and the evironments are just as badass and unsettling as Metroid. Basically...Metroid. Which is not a bad thing at all.
Date 2017-02-02 Playtime 23h 47m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a breath of fresh air for the metroidvania genre. And I mean no disrespect to some of the other more recent metroidvania games, there are some great ones, but Axiom Verge has that “it” factor that sets it apart from the others. Starting out it's easy to notice how visually similar it is to the Metroid series. The next thing you notice how kick ass the sound track is for this game, with the exception of “Inexorable”, that song blows, trust me you’ll know what song I’m talking about the second you hear it. It should also be noted that this entire game, including that bomb ass sound track was created by one amazing man, Mr. Thomas Happ.  FULL REVIEW HERE:  http://snerdaperds.com/2017/02/axiom-verge/
Date 2017-02-01 Playtime 15h 19m Rec Positive Axiom Verge est un métroidvania très rafraichissant, avec une histoire relativement bien portée. Les armes y sont intéressantes, intuitives - mais difficiles à trouver pour une myriade d'entre elles. Labyrinthique au possible, avec des boss parfois retords, je le conseille à ceux qui aiment réellement se prendre la tête pour obtenir le sacro-saint 100% qui nous satisfait tous tellement.
Date 2017-01-31 Playtime 20h 33m Rec Positive This is a copy of  "BattleCat"`s review but its exactly what i think, too.  Great game. Kept me coming back for more.   Nice throwback to the old days with proper secret areas and a decent challenge on Normal difficulty.   There's a nice variety of weapons, but I found for the most part I stuck to 2-3. Some of them appear to have strengths against certain enemy types so there's an element of strategy too. Sometimes using a couple of weapons in tandem to kill an enemy.  I don't normally feel compelled to collect crud in games but Axiom Verge teased me enough that I wanted to figure out how to get to the secret areas. I think it also helps that they're not just placed on a map from the get-go (i.e. NOT secret and NOT a challenge).   The soundtrack is cool too. I kept finding myself humming the tunes when I wasn't playing it.  Over all, I really enjoyed Axiom Verge. Definitely worth purchasing if you're into sci-fi or platformers (especially if you enjoyed them in the NES/SNES days). Tom Happ, I salute you. What an effort!
Date 2017-01-31 Playtime 3h 4m Rec Positive Axiom Verge   7/10  Great game. Metroidvania done right in a self aware 8-bit way. Suffers from difficulty spikes and lack of direction at times. Overall one of the better games I've played in months.
Date 2017-01-30 Playtime 13h 32m Rec Positive Fantástico. Exemplo de jogo bem feito. Metroidvania em sua melhor forma.
Date 2017-01-29 Playtime 8h 32m Rec Positive Axiom Verge pays an obvious homage to Metroid but goes above and beyond in putting a unique spin on the classic gameplay.  The game introduces weapons/items that bring you back to old areas to look at them again in a different light which really keeps the game progression and exploration from getting stale.  It's challenging without being overly frustrating.  This is one of retro-esque favorites!  10/10 would buy again.
Date 2017-01-29 Playtime 14h 54m Rec Positive Für alle jene, die darüber hinwegsehen können, teils stundenlang durch die Welt zu irren und herauszufinden wie es weiter geht: Ein tolles Spiel, mit cooler Grafik, einer interessanten Story und einer abgedrehten Welt.
Date 2017-01-29 Playtime 12h 20m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania. Really makes you think for some of the optional items.
Date 2017-01-28 Playtime 15h 25m Rec Positive First Steam game I've ever bothered to review and there's a reason for that (Y)   Pros; MANY  - Cool biopunk aesthetic   - Really cool and eerie music in some areas  - Cool 'mad scientist' style weaponry and items  - Challenging gameplay (but not excessively frustrating)  - Interesting and unique 'glitch gun' mechanic   Cons; (a couple)  - The writing needs some work. The visuals are enough to make up for it but I think the devs need to hire a professional writer to make the dialogue sound a little more natural (or natural for in-universe anyway)  - There's a lot of back and forth exploring which can be quite frustrating. I understand why the devs did it and it's not a game breaker, but a small hint about where you need to go now and then wouldn't go amiss.    tldr = not perfect but definitely worth the money, highly recommended <3
Date 2017-01-27 Playtime 36h 21m Rec Positive Just about finished with the game, but I can say I'm deeply satisfied.  The story captivated me and world was so brilliantly made.  I cannot comment on the difficulty as I played on hard and haven't had too much trouble. The control scheme can be a bit hard to master though.  The little things you can do with it open up a lot of possibilities and the creativity needed to get to some hidden locations is satisfying to find.  The abilities you gain through the game make for a variety of approaches to situations and puzzles.   The world is incredible. A dark atmosphere and state of confusion piqued my curiosity to keep going forward. Seeing the standard signs for the areas I would have to back track to kept my mind interested in my next ability.  The little notes found throughout the world enrich the story and give it more life.  The boss fights fit and their dialogue insinuates the true dilemma going on in the world. Athethos lied.
Date 2017-01-27 Playtime 12h 29m Rec Positive Parece que cuando intentas comparar un juego inspirado por sotn, por lo general hay muchas cosas con las que discrepar, bueno, este juego toma tanto de sotn, que por momentos, pense que era una absurda copia, pero al contrario de mis sospechas, termine notando las claras y únicas diferencias las cuales, hacen de este juego, una aventura bastante disfrutable.

Date 2017-01-26 Playtime 12h 38m Rec Positive Quite possibly the best Metroidvania game to come out in years, Axiom Verge borrows all the right elements from the classics to make one of the funnest and most compelling game experiences.  Trace, a scientist from Earth, wakes up on an alien world. Guided by a mysterious presence, he sets off on a long and bizarre journey to save the remaining inhabitants of this dying planet. Axiom Verge's world is enormous, with tons of nooks and crannies to explore, and countless items and tools to acquire. The game's 16-bit art style suits it well, and the many locales of the planet are beautifully detailed. The music is excellent and sets the mood of each area well. From dark, brooding tunes, to adrenaline pumping chiptune techno, it's one of the best retro-style soundtracks I have ever heard. The story is very immersive and always leaves you asking more questions, all the way to it's cryptic ending, which is still discussed and debated to this day.  Axiom Verge is worth every cent and every minute of your time. If you love nostalgic indie titles with a deep and intriguing science fiction plot, this game will be your new obsession.
Date 2017-01-26 Playtime 36h 12m Rec Positive Control scheme is the worst thing about this game, and even that is negligible. It's impressively well made.
Date 2017-01-25 Playtime 27h 23m Rec Positive 第一次不熟悉地图，物品也隐藏的很好经常会有“竟然要这样才能找到”的念头，反正我有一些不看视频根本找不到；收集要素相当丰富，有收集癖的一定要试试。 有些地方还要解密码简直厉害。 作为一款2D横版超出了我的期待！
Date 2017-01-24 Playtime 52h 31m Rec Positive This game accomplishes some of the aesthetic goals of the original Metroid better than Metroid did, particularily the oppressively isolating atmosphere (with an ample helping of paranoia) and the eerie non-hummable (yet memorable) backgroud music, which contributes very effectively to the former.  It also manages to accomplish having more repetetive boss fights (barring one suppressive-fire-puzzle boss), which might be less of a credit, but still works out pretty well, as all of them require relatively consistent good timing and reaction speed to survive and defeat, as well as some effort to determine the best weapon for the job.  Ultimately, it also scarred my soul better than the original Metroid, which was itself already memorable.  I'm not forgetting this one, ever.  (... so many corpses ... *shudder*)

Date 2017-01-23 Playtime 11h 6m Rec Positive A good metroid clone, with also a few interesting ideas.
Date 2017-01-23 Playtime 38h 26m Rec Positive If you like Metroid, you'll like this.  If you like Metroid, Sumerian culture references, and homages to Eric Chahi games, then you probably already own this but if not you probably should.  It's a good game with a very strong personal touch.  A lot of skill and care went into making it and the game is all around fun with no particular dry spells or weak parts that come to mind.  One friendly tip - when you get a new ability, really push its functionality.  This game takes that aspect of the Metroid school of design very seriously.
Date 2017-01-23 Playtime 13h 55m Rec Positive I think this is the indie Metroidvania that has felt closest in production values to a Metroid or a 'Vania. Plays really well with your expectations and brings something new to the table pretty reliably! I recommend this more or less without reservation.
Date 2017-01-22 Playtime 4h 14m Rec Positive Un verdadero homenaje a Metroid pero que no es precisamente un clon. Aporta una estética propia, un sistema de items distinto y una historia bizarra y original.  Realmente, es como si se hubiera diseñado una evolución de los Metroid 2D hacía un juego de acción y exploración más completo, algo (un pelín) más difícil y profundo.  Como "peros", las repeticiones de algunos enemigos: hubiera molado algo más de variedad y la lentitud con la que desarrolla la trama, los diálogos no suelen significar mucho y son bastante parcos a la hora de aportar datos.  Me ha gustado mucho.
Date 2017-01-22 Playtime 15h 57m Rec Positive The best metroidvania game I have played. The gameplay and OST are the shining beacons which light the way toward it's classic status in my heart.
Date 2017-01-22 Playtime 13h 28m Rec Positive If you like the super nintendo super metroid game thant you will love this game. Played with a controller and the control are very good. Many types of items, creatures and bosses.
Date 2017-01-22 Playtime 18h 13m Rec Positive Axiom é um ótimo jogo para os amantes do estilo plataforma.  Com diversos tipos de armas, upgrades, notas e afins, a exploração do mapa [que por sinal é grande] fica ainda mais interessante.  As informações são bem organizadas e dispostas; as armas e upgrades diversificados; a trilha sonora não é extraordinária, mas cumpre muito bem o seu papel. O enredo é interessante e traz elementos de uma história distópica, com personagem principal empático, um tanto quanto descolado e perdido em uma realidade paralela.  Vale a pena!

Date 2017-01-18 Playtime 13h 7m Rec Positive Итак! Игра может показаться дороговатой, так и есть, это Истина. Графика уровня денди-сега, музыка иногда кайф, иногда завывания бабы, заевшие от сломанномежконтинентальнозараженного трафика сознания. В игре очень неординарный сюжет, но, мать его, увлекательный. Вы ученый, у вас эксперимент, и он, как это бывает, в очередной раз фатально, а может и нет, взорвал вас и вашу лабораторию, после чего начинает происходить необъяснимое. Всю игру вы пытаетесь понять, что же происходит, и осваиваете все новые и новые фишечки, будь то снаряд, рвущий в клочья заросли, или плазмопушку, рушащую цифровой код, а может даже плащ телепорт. Все это помогает вам попадать в места, раньше недоступные, открыть нынче запаленные секретки, но доселе не вскрытые. Жанр таких игр называется Метройдвания, как выяснилось позже... я этот жанр люблю.. Купил эту игру я однако на распродаже и то потому, что, просмотрев ролик, услышал увидев, знакомые мне звуки и спрайты из игры "Blaster Master" на денди, так и не прошел ее мать итить... ибо сейвов не было, а игры чертовски сложная и долгая. В общем, по итогам я теперь жду вторую часть, надеюсь, таковая будет, ибо концовка намекает, что это не конец. И что самое интересное, очень интересно, что там дальше. Собственно, ставлю этой игре 7 из 10 (минусую 3 бала из за стоимости, не каждый будет в восторге от денди графония 400 с кпоейкой деревянных рубля)
Date 2017-01-18 Playtime 16h 4m Rec Positive Great Metroid-Vania style game. I'm not as high on the story as some others, there just isn't much there. The gameplay makes up for it. There are a couple of very unique mechanics that you probably have not encountered in games of this genre before. Highly recommended.  *Edit* For Achievement!
Date 2017-01-18 Playtime 20h 3m Rec Positive Lots of weapons, lots of secrets and great character progression. Interesting and exciting mechanics explored in depth by the game as the story develops (the glitch gun, the drone and the teleport come to mind). The pace becomes faster as you progress and the mobility of your character increases, making the experience much more enjoyable, fluid and challenging. I personally love electronic music so I was sold after the first 5 minutes. I'm also a fan of cyber/alien/sci-fi themes and I was utterly shocked after discovering this was all made by one person.  This game and developer deserve your money.

Date 2017-01-17 Playtime 24h 55m Rec Positive This game was quite the experience. The weapons, bosses, seceret areas, soundtrack, everything about this game was way better than I expected originally. Would strongly recomend this game to anyone looking for a super metroid style game.

Date 2017-01-16 Playtime 14h 2m Rec Positive der soundtrack war der hammer!
Date 2017-01-16 Playtime 11h 16m Rec Positive 日本語訳は一部おかしいものの、あるだけでもプレイしやすく助かる。 ゲーム内容としてはいわゆるメトロイドヴァニラで、ゲーム性・難易度は他レビューで書かれている通り高品質。この種のゲームが好きな人は買ってOK。 個人的には程よく難解なSF設定が好みでそこすごくよかった、が、丹念に追わないとよくわからないストーリーやSF設定は合わない人は合わないかもしれない。  注意点としては拠点間ワープのような機能がないこと。 その代わりマップ中央にXXXがあるのでそれが高速移動の役割を果たすものの、個人的にはないとわかってしまえばその後の移動にストレスはなかった。
Date 2017-01-16 Playtime 13h 15m Rec Positive Great game. Kept me coming back for more.   Nice throwback to the old days with proper secret areas and a decent challenge on Normal difficulty.   There's a nice variety of weapons, but I found for the most part I stuck to 2-3. Some of them appear to have strengths against certain enemy types so there's an element of strategy too. Sometimes using a couple of weapons in tandem to kill an enemy.  I don't normally feel compelled to collect crud in games but Axiom Verge teased me enough that I wanted to figure out how to get to the secret areas. I think it also helps that they're not just placed on a map from the get-go (i.e. NOT secret and NOT a challenge).   The soundtrack is cool too. I kept finding myself humming the tunes when I wasn't playing it.  Over all, I really enjoyed Axiom Verge. Definitely worth purchasing if you're into sci-fi or platformers (especially if you enjoyed them in the NES/SNES days). Tom Happ, I salute you. What an effort!

Date 2017-01-15 Playtime 13h 25m Rec Positive When I bought this game, I didn't have high expectations. So many games claim to be Metroidvania, but only offer a few elements and slap their label on it. This game does not do that.   Axiom Verge gives an authentic Metroidvania feel and adds a unique spin on it. There's something about trying to find all the secrets with Metroidvania that makes it excellent. Really love this game and had nothing but a great experience.   There were times where I got lost in the fold, primarily around the 7th boss and where to go from there, but a quick look at a guide will set you straight.   9/10
Date 2017-01-15 Playtime 8h 41m Rec Positive This review is in english and spanish. Esta revisión esta en ingles y español.   English: The first thing you should know about Axiom Verge is that I DO NOT LIKE IT. I did not like it artstyle, I did not like it the sounds and music, I did not like the story and I did not like many design decisions. Why do I give it a positive review?Because it does a good job for a metroidvania, has enough areas to explore and enough items to collect. Duration approximately 8 hours, more if you try to get 100%. At least for me, it's a Metroidvania that I'll not play again.  Which game of this genre would i recommend you before buying this? Rogue Legacy  7/10   Español: Lo primero que deben saber de Axiom Verge es que NO ME GUSTO. No me gusto su apartado artístico, no me gusto su apartado sonoro, no me gusto la historía y no me gusto muchas decisiones en cuanto a diseño. ¿Por qué le doy mano arriba? Porqué hace un buen trabajo para un metroidvania, tiene bastantes zonas para explorar y bastantes ítems por recoger. Duración aproximadamente 8 horas, más si tratas de sacar el 100%. Por lo menos para mi, es un Metroidvania que NO volveré a jugar.   ¿Cuál juego de este género te recomendaría antes de comprar este? Rogue Legacy  7/10
Date 2017-01-15 Playtime 15h 51m Rec Positive A very good Metroidvania.  Very much influenced by Super Metroid, but with its own quirks, not just a copy.  Good weapon selection to tailor your own playthrough, though a couple are clearly the best. Quite a large game world that rewards exploration and backtracking. Interesting movement upgrades that don't play out exactly like a Metroid game. Plus the music is fantastic.
Date 2017-01-15 Playtime 14h 33m Rec Positive Great game! Awesome soundtrack!
Date 2017-01-15 Playtime 15h 25m Rec Positive From a huge Metroid fan's perspective:  Yes, it looks and plays like Metroid. If you are like me and think to yourself, "So what? I'm a huge Metroid/Castlevania fan and I have seen a billion 'Metroidvanias'. None of them have wowed me like the games ending in '-oid' or 'vania', so what makes this one different?"  Imagine, if you can, the first time you played a Metroid game. You would unlock one ability after another, each one opening the world in around of you. Try to remember that epiphany moment upon getting that upgrade you had no idea would exist, but made perfect sense after the fact. For me, it was getting the space jump in Fusion. "It's not only a double jump, but you can jump forever?? Awesome!" I was hooked ever since.  Axiom Verge starts out very by the book, as far as copying Metroid is concerned. Get the thing that destroys certain blocks, get the thing that makes you smaller, get the different gun with different properties. You know it, and you have played THAT game before. However, after certain point in the game, I had no idea what to expect the next movement based ability to be. I knew SOMETHING was missing, but didn't quite know what exactly. It was like I was back in that powered down elevator shaft, with no idea what my goal was, other than to explore. It's a magical feeling,   Also, I feel AV relies more on your abilities to move through your environment rather than blocking your way with a different colored block. I rarely found myself shooting my obstacle in AV, but rather moving around or through it.  Try to go into this game as blind as possible. This game shouldn't just be compared to Metroid, but in the same league. Maybe we could call this stupid genre Axoidvania... or Metroidvergia... or not.
Date 2017-01-15 Playtime 25h 48m Rec Positive If Genesis paid Psygnosis to make a Metroid game.  
Date 2017-01-14 Playtime 18h 7m Rec Negative This is a nearly great homage to the early games of the genre, crippled by a lack of insight into traversal mechanics, and a tedious combat ramp.  Explorers will be frustrated by the joyless hikes involved between corners of the map, as you hunt for inobvious ways forward.   Platformers will be saddened by the general lack of maturity in the jumping, as you never get a double jump. Vertical traversals involve awkward, rapid fire use of directional double taps and transformations. Grappling is reminiscent of Bionic Commando in a bad way. Attempting to jump while swinging causes an instant dead-stop plummet.  Action gamers will contend with an embarassment of weapons, leading to far too much Mega Man. Unless you memorize the right weapon or ability for each enemy, you will find combat a grind.  I've played dozens of metroidvanias, often for hundreds of hours. This one could have been great, but got too full of itself.  It reneges on the promises of the genre. Item completion is not possible based on in-game cues - you must create external cipher keys and decode hidden details. Often, you must use abilities never modeled elsewhere in the game. This sounds interesting, but is not fun. You can't win just by playing - you must work at it.  I waited years to savor this, and the ashes of its failures are bitter in my mouth. This would not irk me if it were not so very, very close to being great. If the teleport dashes were directional and triggered by a secondary button, that alone would fix it. If the grappling had a suitable range and better collision, that woudl help. If the secrets were anchored to in-game unlocks rather than translation hijinx, that would be nice. Instead, it's just a twisty plot with a stiff engine, and poorly clustered level design. There is a reason modern titles have standardized on a hub transit model, or provided movement enhancements.  The game is well made, but poorly thought out. I can't recommend it due to frustration level and a slightly high difficulty curve on Normal. Instead, consider Shadow Complex, a more fitting homage to Super Metroid. Other good options would include the new Strider, Aquaria or Song of the Deep.
Date 2017-01-14 Playtime 31h 21m Rec Positive 之前玩《鬼泣4》和《火炬之光2》分别都玩到了100+小时，这次玩到《Axiom Verge》仅十余小时（虽然还没通关）就有很想写篇评测的想法。本人接触游戏的时间还是比较早的，受先入为主的影响，最喜欢的当属《魂斗罗》、《忍者神龟》之类2D动作类，后来又玩到了GBA上的《恶魔城》系列和《银河战士》，所以最喜欢的游戏类型当属Metroidvania模式下的ARPG，所以当初看到《Axiom Verge》的时候我觉得这应该就是我想要的游戏，事实证明确实物有所值。  想必游戏的开发者应该就是铁杆的《银河战士》系列的死忠，游戏太多的地方模仿了《银河战士》，像变小、武器、快速移动、衣服、谜题以及进门的动画，会让你觉得这确实是款《银河战士》，想想大多Metroidvania应该都是这样，科技感强的像《银河战士》，魔法感强的就像《恶魔城》。  一开始自己没看过任何攻略，基本快通关了，流程方面的难度尚可，很多谜题并不困难，灵活使用一些能力大多可以办到，不像《银河战士》对跑酷的操作比较高，对手残党比较亲切。BOSS战难度设置也可以，大多是外强中干，找到相应窍门可以轻松解决。武器系统比较丰富，可以针对不同的敌人迅速切换武器。  关于本作亮点，第一是像素武器，可以用于改变敌人特性，或者发掘一些路上隐藏的机关，很有趣；再一个就是“隐藏房间”的设定，每一个新存档的房间位置是不固定的，会有一些不错的专属武器；另外第三点就是notes和passcode的设定，算是推动剧情的。音乐整体还不错，有一些令人比较印象深刻的段落，当然和山根大妈还是有一点差距。游戏最后还有一些完成度的数据展示，想全部100%还是有一点难度。   当然，游戏也不是那么完美，还是要说一些问题和缺陷，当然大多还是可以无视的。  武器是很丰富，但是大多可用性是比较差的，经常用的也就是三四种的样子；敌人的种类相对来说少了些；部分地图重复读偏高，后期经常有找不到路的情况，需多加练习才能搞定。  个人来讲，我检验一款游戏好坏的标准就是看我通关之后要不要再第二遍。所以，这款游戏还是非常值得推荐的，尤其对于现在仍然喜欢Metroidvania类型的玩家而言，绝对是不可错过的佳作。如果你想练习完美破关《超级银河战士》，本款游戏绝对适合拿来练练手的。
Date 2017-01-14 Playtime 19h 8m Rec Positive A great game and a great homage to metroid while still being unique. Reccommended if you are at all a fan of metroid or metroid style games.  This may sound redundant for a metroidvania game, but this game has clear inspirational ties to metroid. Its not just the exploration based platforming gameplay, so many things, from the tile designs and atmosphere to the way the first powerup  is to the immediate left of the start point, this game pays great homage to metroid, while at the same time not feeling any obligation to copy it exactly. Anyone who has ever enjoyed a metroid game will be pleased by the games homages, and perhaps even more pleased by how different it decides to be from its inspiration. you will find no morph ball in this game, nor will you collect a million missiles, and in their place you will find many versatile weapons and powers to collect, with clever and original concepts and excecution.  The game has an abundance of secrets as one would expect from a game with such heavy ties to metroid, but axiom verge is in my opinion far more fair about what constitutes a secret. No secret in this game requires that you bomb (or drill as the case may be) every floor wall and ceiling until you find a random energy tank or missile pack; all the secrets in axiom verge have clues to hint at their existence if you are observant enough, while still being subtle enough that it takes a clever mind and dedication to find everything.  The setting and story is compelling, and constantly left me wondering what was going on and trying to figure out the world i was in. The game gives answers out to these questions with a satisfying slowness, and the ending leaves just a little bit to the imagination, just enough to fuel theories and speculation.  The boss fights are all fair and interesting, if a bit easy if you are highly skilled at these types of games (which i am not). The bosses all have a specific way they need to be fought, and careful analysis of their attack patterns makes it possible (and given how strong their attacks are, neccessary) to avoid most if not all their attacks.  Without going into detail, there are some features and powers in the game that will appeal to anyone who have ever enjoyed encountering glitches or corruptions in videogames, such as the glitch worlds in metroid or minus world from mario. The feature is very interesting and a fun suprise upon first playthroughs.  Overall Axiom Verge is a fantastic game that I highly reccomend to any fans of metroid or similarly playing games.
Date 2017-01-14 Playtime 23h 56m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an obvious love letter to the 8-bit NES classic, 'Metroid'. From the title screen on, its a blast of nostalgia that captures that creepy mood, music and atmosphere of the original just perfectly. After a lab explosion, your character finds himself somehow on an alien world, guided by a voice communicating directly to him. It is not long after that a large, ominous 'mask'- the game's titular image- stands before him and gives him a brief explanation as to what is happening, that they need help, and you must be the one to do so.   ....but do you trust them? SHOULD you...? (..do you have a choice?) What is this thing, and its motives? Why are you here? Why are areas guarded by bio-mechanical abominations that call you a demon...and who is Athetos? Every answer seems to raise new questions as you progress through the multiple areas of the world. Its a decent story that keeps you guessing, but gives you JUST enough hints to figure it out -right- before the "big reveal", which feels satisfying once you do know.   As with the original Metroid, there are many powerups to be found. Most of them are functionally the same as the "source material", but have their own fun, unique twist. For instance, rather than a morph ball, you get a little flea-looking drone that you can control to get items, access switches, remotely fight enemies, etc. Instead of the bombs, you get a laser drill--- bore through rocks and enemies as you run with a constant stream of plasma! You also get a grappling hook which is similar to the one in Super Metroid, the classic "high jump" item, and later on an item which lets you pass through walls and teleport a short range (effectively making this a "double jump" type item). There are also items that increase max health, attack power, projectile size and range, and around 25 (!) different weapons to obtain, all with their own unique attack, which can be fast-swapped out with the push of a button.   However, the REAL star of this show is the GLITCH GUN, a fun toy with infinite 'ammo' that lets you glitch out enemies, walls, items and more.   Got a tough enemy in the way? Glitch it into something MUCH easier to deal with! See something graphically crap-out in a wall? Glitch gun it to reveal a new path! Glitch bubbles into invincible, rising platforms, and lots more. Every enemy (except bosses) seems to have its own glitch-out state of being, some more helpful than others, including breaking through bricks and revealing secret paths that you otherwise could not reach.   There are a fair number of varying monsters to fight, including an array of sometimes-HUGE boss beasties just waiting to challenge you, all set against a pretty decent soundtrack. Like Metroid, though, the enemy AI is either "homing or roaming" with regular monsters, and boss battles being "pattern-based attacks". Not to say it isnt tough, and most of the deaths youll experience in the game are your own fault, since its simply 'memorize the pattern and dont screw up'. I died 25 times in my first playthrough, but none of them felt overly cheap.   My main gripe about this game is the "where am I supposed to go now?" feeling youll get many times as you make progress. Unfortunately, thats par for "Metroidvania"-style games, especially in these 8-bit types where just about any block in the game can potentially be destroyed to reveal secret items or paths...youll either have to suck it up, or refer to a walkthrough. I consulted one 3, 4 times throughout this game; the layout is fine and making progress USUALLY doesnt get you stuck, but sometimes you just want to make some real progress instead of slapping mindlessly at blocks in rooms youve already backtracked into 5 times before.   Gifed to me from a friend over Xmas... it was on my wishlist. Had I purchased this myself though, I would have had no regrets. If you liked 8-bit NES Metroid, check this one out.   10/10 moody, creepy nostalgia 8/10 game itself overall
Date 2017-01-14 Playtime 36h 47m Rec Positive A nod to a classic that has become a classic itself.  There have been quite a few retro games I have enjoyed more or less than the original games they are based off of. A few years after playing Axiom Verge it’s still easily a top 3 for me for the best out of these types of games.  Everything I loved about Metroid but better. I really like the drone mechanic. The maps, level design, gameplay, and fun factor are all really great.   This is a must for anyone who loves the original Metroid. It’s an absolute gem. As someone who loves NES titles and has played hundreds of them over the years I have to give this a 9/10.
Date 2017-01-13 Playtime 25h 35m Rec Positive Wer Super Metroid oder Castlevania: symphonie of the night und alles was dazu gehört liebt und vor allem vermisst, ist bei Axiom Verge genau richtig!   Dieses Spiel sieht nicht nur fantastisch aus, sondern ist dazu noch unglaublich packend und hat meiner Meinung nach eine sehr Anspruchvolle und coole Geschichte die zum Nachdenken anregt!!! Vom sehr geilem Soundtrack brauch ich erst nicht anfangen!  Ich musste das Spiel in einen Stück verschlingen nachdem ich es nur anspielen wollte und es hat mich von Anfnag bis Ende vollends befriedigt! Zumal ich es nicht mal auf 100% gepackt habe und ich deswegen weiß das ich es irgendwann mit vollem Genuß wieder spielen werde!!!  Wer anspruchsvollen Retro liebt und braucht macht bei dem Kauf von Axiom Verge alles richtig!

Date 2017-01-12 Playtime 10h 16m Rec Positive Краткое отступление: в конце уже далеких 90-х именно 2D аркады были моим любимым жанром.  Цитата гг: "Я был полон решимости добраться до самой сути. Ведь это все, что у меня осталось."  Возможно громко и не совсем заслуженно, но для меня Axiom Verge - квинтэссенция метроидвании.

Date 2017-01-12 Playtime 17h 18m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is simply one of the greatest games  have ever played. Every aspect oozes personality. The gameplay and level design could make this a better Metroidvania game than certain Metroid games. The pixel art has a very unique and intriguing style. The music, aside from one or two certain tracks, is so eery and mechanical that it can make the player feel uneasy. While the story is intentionally vague, it is rewarding for those who seek out the extra peices of lore hidden throughout the world. If you have any interest in the Metroidvania genre you owe it to yousrelf to play this game. And even if you haven't is still one of the best indie games of all time.

Date 2017-01-11 Playtime 20h 4m Rec Positive Genel Yorum  Axiom Verge metroidvania* türünde bir oyun. Ben bu türü çok severim. Çünkü bu türdeki oyunlar insanı öncelikle başlarda gördüğü şeylerle meraka düşürüp, motivasyon sağlıyor sonradan ise aldığınız eşyalar ile gördüğünüz şeyleri kafanızda birleştirip; keyifli bir keşfe dalıyorsunuz. Bu sayede hem oyuncunun düşünmesi gerekiyor. Hemde oyunu uzun uzun oynamamıza sebep oluyor.   Oyuna dönersek adamlar türün hakkını vermiş. Geniş geniş her tarafı gizemle dolu haritalar var. Bu haritaların çeşitli olmasının yanında oyunun bölümleri de aynı zamanda dolu dolu. Her bir yerinde gizlenmiş keşfedilmeyi bekleyen bölgeleri var. Her aldığınız eşyayla bütün haritanın şekli değişiyor açtığınız yerler dolayısıyla. Bol bol eşya ve silah var. Hackleme aletleri ıvır zıvır tonla şey... Savaştığımız düşmanlarda çeşitli çeşitli. Eşyalarımızı silahlarımızı onların üstünde de farklı farklı şekillerde kullanabiliyoruz. Dolu dolu boss fight var oyunda, bu da güzel bir artı.   Hikayesi de güzel oyunun sizi sürekli arada bırakıyor. Sürekli acaba acaba diyorsunuz. Hoş bir senaryosu var böyle gizemli. Oyunun görselleri atmosferi her harita geçişindeki sizde bıraktığı "aaa burası da neresiymiş" hissi çok etkileyici. Her haritanın kendi biyomu var. Hatta kesiştikleri yerlerde ekotonlar bile mevcut dikkat ederseniz. Biraz daha ileri gidip benim gördüğüm en iyi harita ve bölüm tasarımına sahip oyun diyebilirim . Hele hele o haritalara girdiğinizde değişen müzik yok mu! Aynı zamanda oynadığım en güzel müziklere sahip oyunlardan birisi diyebilirim.   Oyunun çok iyi olarak değerlendiremeyeceğimiz bir kaç noktası var sadece; "boss fightlar, hikayenin anlatımı ve bazı minik hataları(spoiler vermemek için detaya girmiyorum.) ve oyunun haritalarının büyük olması sebebiyle geçen sıkıcı zaman dilimi. Ordan oraya yürümek.(oyun bunada bir çözüm sunuyor ama bence yeterli değil)." Bunların dışında gayet sağlam bir oyun. Alın, oynayın, oynatın. Çok başarılı !   "50" yi puan olarak ortalama kabul edersek puanım; 88/100  Not:1*:Metroidvania türü genellikle oyuncuyu keşfetmesi gereken kilitlerle ve gizli bölgelerle dolu bir haritaya bırakır. Aldığı itemlerle ve özelliklerle bu yerleri açarak yeni bölümler açar. Genellikle bu türde kısa yollar, gizli güçlü eşyalar ve düşmanlarınız yenmenizi kolaylaştıracak güçlendirmeler bu açmanız gereken bölümlerde bulunur. Bu tür genellikle oyuncuya ne yapması gerektiğini söylemez. Oyuncu kendi bulur.     Zulmetefza'ya oyun için teşekkürler. ^^
Date 2017-01-11 Playtime 36h 56m Rec Positive SO GOOOOD
Date 2017-01-11 Playtime 18h 34m Rec Positive I really like this game even if it has a few downsides. For example: Allthough I like the music, it is very prominent. Sometimes I need to mute audio because I need to concentrate or I'm simply annoyed by it. I never had this with any Metroid game I played. The controls are also not 100% there. There is a move that requires a double tap with the directional control. I own an Xbox 360 pad and prefer to play with the left stick. However for that specific move I must use the d-pad simply because I can't pull that move off otherwise. I also accidentally press the left stick weapon quick select all the time which means I select a weapon I don't wanna use at that time.  Other than that the game is almost flawless. Compatibility with Linux/SteamOS is also a big plus.
Date 2017-01-10 Playtime 22h 21m Rec Positive Axiom Verge es el mejor ejemplo actual de Metroidvania, donde en la piel de Trace tendrás que explorar diferentes zonas diferentes (una zona generosamente extensa), que tendrás que venir a reexplorar según vayas encontrando nuevas habilidades y características para acceder a zonas que no podías alcanzar previamente.  Los bosses tienen una dificultad bastante ajustada,si bien los primeros bosses del juego pueden ser más complicado, debido  a la escasez de armas potentes y a la escasez de vida también, pero en general está bien ajustado.  El aspecto gráfico tipo pixel está muy muy bien cuidado, no es el típico pixelado que se hace hoy día para quedar bien y "palante". El único punto negativo que le veo es que no puedes teletransportarte a otras zonas, lo que se hace un poco tedioso cuando tienes que ir a otra zona algo lejana, aunque tampoco es excesivamente molesto.  Tiene una barbaridad de armas y accesorios: -EN cuanto a armas, supera la decena de ellas, desde las típicas pistolas, hasta rayos láser, disparos que rebotan... muchas de ellas bastante innovadoras. -En cuanto a mejoras/accesorios, pues va desde lo típico (mejoras de salud, mayor salto, etc) hasta un taladro, una pistola para glitchear enemigos/paredes, etc... también hay muchas cosas innovadoras.   El juego es bastante rejugable debido a los logros, ya que si quieres el 100% de logros (son pocos, unos 27 en total), tendrás que jugarlo sin morir más de una vez, en modo speedrun o en menos de 4 horas, por ejemplo.   He dado unas breves pinceladas de todos los aspectos del juego, pero no puedo hacer más que recomendarlo totalmente. De lo mejorcito de los últimos años.
Date 2017-01-10 Playtime 29h 44m Rec Positive 从画面上来看的确够复古。整体地图重复感略强，有印象的场景只有小部分，但是后来知道了是一个人完成的游戏后觉得已经十分难能可贵。  简单说两个部分：  1.游戏氛围（世界观 & 环境营造 ）  作者应该是H.R.吉格尔的粉丝。很喜欢水仙女的设定，从角色及场景设定来看末日感氛围营造的很到位，类生物科技也可以体现作者对这一类风格的强烈喜好。 顺带一提，本作在利用8bits画面进行游戏塑造的同时，想到了电视波屏和画面损坏来设计游戏攻关逻辑。我认为这不止是一个小创新，甚至是整个游戏最大的亮点之一；不仅在游戏过程中因此设计充满新意，它也为这个世界的独特性舔砖加瓦！  2.关于剧情 IGN给了一个非常不负责任的评测！我相信评测人员只玩到前半部分，然后兴致寥寥地留下“作者把剧情给忘了”这样的评价。 说实话，的确前期剧情给到的内容非常少，boss战前的对话基本会让人觉得“作者是不是懒得编剧？” 但是后期剧情喷薄而出，悬疑气氛营造的非常足。在剧情的走向中玩家已经可以进行非常有趣和（背后发凉的猜想，并随之代入这种奇妙的不安感到游戏过程中。 我想说，它的剧情绝对算是此类游戏中饱满度排列前茅的。  恩，貌似主要是想说IGN这个差点引导我烂尾这个游戏的评测令人不爽，也为作者不值这样- -  ————————————————————————   最后，如果你是此类游戏的爱好者，千万不要错过他。 公理边缘会为你留下有趣的印象。

Date 2017-01-10 Playtime 9h 53m Rec Positive Great throw back to old school Metroid games. I will admit I got lost a few times (uncertain where to go next) but it was mostly fine. The combat is solid and the story is there enough to keep you playing and curious.  100%ing this game looks like quite the chore which can be a good and a bad thing so keep that in mind if you are a person into that (I am not).
Date 2017-01-10 Playtime 17h 16m Rec Positive If you liked 2D metroid try this.
Date 2017-01-09 Playtime 13h 26m Rec Positive I. Love. Axiom. Verge.  The music, the aesthetic, the playability. It's all perfect. I am not going to give this game a score becasue it is special. What I like most about this game is the feel of being in a very VERY strange world. [spoiler] One of the parts that kinda had me slowly retract was when you are riding this head/snail across a very long hall [/spoiler]. And the best part of the game is [b](MASSIVE SPOILER)[b] [spoiler] You get to fight Immortan Joe at the end!! [/spoiler]  Some of the environments are just fun to look at. And the music?! F***ing amazing. From the intro to the boss fights, Happ knows how to create atmosphere with a stellar soundtrack.  Having played his previous title ,Orn, I was eager to jump into the world of Axiom Verge.  I recommend this game to anyone who likes platform adventure shooters.  Happ if you are reading this, thank you so much for making such a beautiful game.
Date 2017-01-09 Playtime 29h 28m Rec Positive The premise is there, and most reviews are correct. Not much else to say than try it for yourself and have a good time.  Don't expect it to surpass historic titles though, that's unrealistic and unfair.  8/10
Date 2017-01-09 Playtime 2h 57m Rec Positive While I do recommend this game for Metroidvania fans, I have a bit of a gripe with the art style... they went almost full NES retro art... was it too hard to make sprites a bit better and not so close to pure 8-bit? The game could use a bit more of detail to the art, the color palette feels washed out and the level of detail is a level beyond NES Metroid and below Super Metroid... IT IS good, I just think the artwork could've been better if the artist was good enough to deliver this much.  If you want awesome 32-bit graphics like Super Mario World or Megaman X... this is not it. Even Shovel Knight has better artwork done :U  If you want great gameplay though, this is it!
Date 2017-01-08 Playtime 48h 34m Rec Positive Love the art style and the goodness of sci-fi experience of Axiom Verge! One of the best metroidvanias i played!  Pros: +Addicting and Charming Atmosphere +Sci-fi styled Metroidvania +Kinda Post-apocalyptic +Digitalized Pixel Graphics +Some of the Bosses are fun +It gets you pumped up  Cons: -Music is not relaxing at all -Some of the Bosses are a pain in the ass   Verdict: 9/10 Well, what i have expected, it's not really good as Environmental Station Alpha and other masterpieces. It looks too Retro. Yeah. Still good game through.
Date 2017-01-08 Playtime 17h 9m Rec Positive Хорошая игра, которая по мере прохождения скатывается в УГ В чем именно? 1. Управление самая слабая сторона этой игры. Например как организован быстрый выбор оружия на джойстике (это нажатие на стики по дефолту) я так и не понял. Ближе к концу добавляются разлчиные игровые механники по типу телепортации при двухкратном нажатии на кнопку направления движения. Это элемент, который на финальной стадии необходимо использовать в бою, то есть очень быстро, и то и дело происходит непроизвольное нажатие на стик из-за чего меняется используемое оружие. В общем от управления меня очень бомбило, всего тут нераспишешь, просто привел один из примеров. К тому же как я уже сказал новые механики вводятся по ходу прохождения и перенастраивать управление, к которому ты уже привык, под них совсем тяжелопереносимо. На клаве не пробовал, но думаю там вообще неиграбельно. 2. Боссы. А именно финальные два, не считая необязательного (его не пробовал). Первого из них я убивал в наглую расстреливая без применения какой-то тактики, то есть как по мне это лучшая тактика. А на самого последнего я вообще забил из-за дерьмоуправления, да и оттого, что он тоже неинтересный. Такое ощущение, что во всех элементах вообще разработчика под конец все это настое..ло, и он пошустрее хотел закончить проект. 3. Ну к минусам можно отнести сюжет еще. Он интригует, но потом отпускает так как яснее происходящее к концу не становится.  А так в общем и целом неплохая метродвания (плюсы расписывать не считаю нужным, любителям этого жанра она почти наверяка зайдет, выделю лишь местами ну просто афигительную музыку), но если бы она предстала изначально тем, чем оказалась в конце, я бы незадумываясь выкинул и забыл бы про нее.  6,5 из 10
Date 2017-01-08 Playtime 31h 9m Rec Positive Awesome Metroidvania game, great controls (gamepad), fairly large, great weapons and skills, awesome soundtrack and grafics. I just love this game
Date 2017-01-08 Playtime 11h 14m Rec Positive Beautiful visuals, stellar soundtrack, and extremely tight Metroidvania game play. Easily one of the best in the genre, and highly recommended at any price.
Date 2017-01-08 Playtime 16h 18m Rec Positive Являясь фанатом классических Кастлваний решился на покупку Axiom Verge. Поначалу поиграл часок, вырубил, и подумал не буду больше запускать до черного дня (пока совсем всё не наскучит) Но... все новогодние выходные тупо просидел за этой игрой. Если сравнивать с Кастлой - всё то, кроме музыки. Но оно и понятно, при одном единственном мастере на все руки). Но разнообразие пауэр-апов просто офигительное, к концу игры чувствуешь себя прямо Богом.
Date 2017-01-08 Playtime 12h 20m Rec Positive Very well done. Fun to play. Tons of weapons and powerups to hunt down. Pretty good music too.
Date 2017-01-07 Playtime 16h 58m Rec Positive Esse é o Super Metroid da Steam kkk. Se você gostou do original, este game tem tudo pra te agradar. A trilha sonora se encaixa perfeitamente com a ambientação do game, com estilo retro sci-fi. E o mais incrível é que foi feito por uma única pessoa, no mais é um excelente Metroidvania!
Date 2017-01-07 Playtime 28h 40m Rec Positive Danke für dieses Spiel
Date 2017-01-07 Playtime 14h 49m Rec Positive A very solid loveletter to super metroid. If you have any warm and fuzzy memories regarding that game, you really should consider picking this one up.
Date 2017-01-07 Playtime 15h 40m Rec Positive 말이 필요없는 갓갓겜.   엔딩 크레딧 보면 Thomas Happ 이란 양반이 혼자 만든 겜인거 같은데,  그게 맞다면 어디 악마에게 생명 한 10년 바치고 만든게 아닐까 싶을 정도.
Date 2017-01-07 Playtime 8h 24m Rec Negative Gah. Aethestically, this game is mesmerizing. Functionally, its feels like a mess.  What do I mean by that? There's no denying that this alien world has a very distinct artistry to it, and from a purely cosmetic standpoint it really, really works. What is this place? What's with these giant talking heads? Only the bare minimum makes sense, and from a Metroidvania perspective it does a great deal towards driving curiousity in the world around you. Axiom's Verge's amibiguity flat out captivated me; I wanted to know more.  And yet, that same amibiguity turned out to be a double-edged sword. You might think a strange, alien world would be filled with meaningful landmarks, but that just doesn't seem to be the case. The world as a whole just feels like a hodge-podge of random terrain that goes from "weird green-looking stuff" to "weird blue-looking stuff." Its nice eye-candy in the moment, but its make for terrible navigation. Getting a power-up essentially had me going, "Oh great, I wonder which forsaken dead end this thing hooks up with." Exploration can quickly devolve into aimless wandering as you travel half-way across the map just to find a health fragment (and subsequently pick another dead end to check out.) The poking around feels more like a mandatory exercise than a fun sidequest.  The cryptic nature of the world carries over into some of its powerups. It probably sounds cool on paper to run through walls, but again, which walls? Generic Wall #31 probably isn't a very good landmark to use for hiding secrets. You also hack enemies to produce all sorts of funky effects, like them being able to suddenly break seemingly random tiles for no obvious reason. And why can I hack only one out of five different pools of similar-looking acid? These moments of discovery feel less like "Aha!" moments and more like, "Oh, OK. That just happened, I guess." moments. Its wildly infuriating to feel like the world is just stringing you around, rewarding dumb luck rather than intelligent observation.  If that wasn't enough, combat is by and large boring. Early enemies are often placed in very exploitable positions, whereas later on enemies get really "homing" happy. The bosses, on the other hand, tend to be massive rinse-and-repeat affairs where you can, quite literally, stand and/or jump in place while mashing the fire button. Their patterns are often dreadfully predictable, and combat seems to favor raw damage output over finesse by a long shot. Combat can definitely end up adding to the tedium of randomly running to and fro.  Ultimately, its feels frustrating to have this incredible world held at arms length by obtuse mechanics. I can't say I've played anything quite like Axiom Verge and a part of me wants to keep absorbing its eccentric wonders, but I've found myself losing patience with all the wild goose chasing. The game more or less sells out completely to the cryptic dimension of Metroidvanias, for better or for worse.
Date 2017-01-07 Playtime 16h 31m Rec Positive Very fun to play, especially if you're into metroid.
Date 2017-01-07 Playtime 15h 3m Rec Positive Si vous êtes amoureux du metroid-like et notamment du légendaire Super Metroid, Axiom Verge est selon moi LE jeu à ne rater sous aucun prétexte. L'hommage à son modèle est évident, et la plupart des éléments de game design et de level design sont similaires, mais Tom Happ a su insufler suffisamment de passion et de talent dans son titre afin de le faire sortir du lot.  Je ne vais réellement pas trop m'étendre sur le jeu, qui reste pour moi un énorme coup de coeur. Gameplay au poil avec quelques éléments très originaux, difficulté abordable, graphismes old-school, musique incroyable, scénario basique mais efficace, ambiance atypique et univers un peu glauque et malsain... tout est quasiment parfait excepté une navigation parfois un peu laborieuse dans une map très labyrinthique.  Bref, si vous aimez le genre, foncez !
Date 2017-01-06 Playtime 8h 33m Rec Positive Fantastic, it's a great platformer (Metroid style) in a great world with fantastic pixel art and a catchy soundtrack. Recommend!
Date 2017-01-06 Playtime 9h 15m Rec Positive Were you a fan of the good old metroid or castlevania games? Do you like scouring a map in order to find all the items? If you answered yes to these questions, then you probably own this game already. But on the off chance that you don't, Axiom Verge is pretty amazing and I'd highly recommend it.
Date 2017-01-06 Playtime 3h 52m Rec Negative Its a hard game, but that doesnt magically make it good. It has a solid foundation but youll be left feeling directionless and dying a LOT of cheap deaths. unavoidable damage is everywhere.   I grew up with an snes and though the visuals are reminicent of the era, the game play isnt. this is the only "overwhelmingly positive" game on steam that i cant recommend, unless you really like walking in circles.
Date 2017-01-06 Playtime 31h 32m Rec Positive Simply amazing!
Date 2017-01-06 Playtime 24h 46m Rec Positive Axiom Verge does the Metroid formula perfectly, allowing you to explore the world at your discretion and exploring ever further into a surrealistic alien world of isolation.  With an immersive soundtrack, beautiful visuals, and fresh ideas on old concepts, Axiom Verge will present challenge and interest to anyone who enjoys exploration-based gameplay as they solve the mystery of just what happened to Trace, the talkative protagonist we know little about out the gate.  The moments in which you're given to get to know the characters are given just enough time to learn small pieces of information about the world and just who Trace is.  I'd describe the art direction of Axiom Verge "NES Metroid if its tilesets didn't suck," but it's more like somewhere between Cave Story and NES Metroid. The games assets are generally beautiful but the lack of clarity of depth can be seldomly problematic.  All in all, I'd say this game is a must-have for any Metroid or late Castlevania fan on any system they can access it on. This game is a beautiful and fresh take on that game's formula. 
Date 2017-01-05 Playtime 17h 43m Rec Positive It's worth every award it's ever been given. A superb entry in the metroidvania genre with most of its cues being taken from the first half of that tag. It pays its due respects to the 2D Metroid games of old while having its own identity with grotesque cyborgs, glitch-centric gameplay, and giant lady heads.  The pixel art and soundtrack both speak for themselves. The weapons have pleanty of variety to keep things fun. Enemies are well executed, and bosses keep getting tougher as the game goes on. You may have to experiment to see what works and what doesn't on certain enemies; but the game never punishes you for trial and error.  Don't feel shy about consulting a walkthrough if you get lost. Because this map is HUGE, with countless nooks and crannies full of secrets and upgrades. My only greivence is that there are bonus levels in the game which only appear randomly with each playthrough; meaning you could play this game 5 times over and still not experience everything. Seems like a needless restriction.  Aside from that, this game is a joy to play from start to finish. The fact that 1 guy made this game is incredible. If you're a Metroid fan who feels like they've been cheated by Nintendo for too long and you haven't played this game yet, pick it up. If you're cheap like I am, you can get this game half-off during sales.
Date 2017-01-05 Playtime 20h 10m Rec Positive After 16 hours, I finally beat Axiom Verge. I don't typically write lengthy reviews, but I do have a few things to say about this game.  I'll start off by saying that I recommend the hell out of this game. There were very few moments where I wasn't having fun throughout this. People said that it was a mix of Metroid and Castlevania, I think that hits the nail on the head for the most part. I saw some screenshots and, as someone who isn't really into sidescrollers, I thought I would give it a shot. I regret nothing. At first, navigating throughout the map seems tedious. However, as you improve in skill, become more familiar with the map, and accrue a variety of powerups and weapons, the game truly opens up.  If you want a challenging game with beautiful pixel art and a fun as fuck weapon loadout, check Axiom Verge out.
Date 2017-01-05 Playtime 11h 25m Rec Positive How good is Axiom Verge you ask?   So damn good we should start calling them  AxVer instead of Metroidvania.   Game is engaging,  music,  designs and overall layout are truly inspired.    Axiom rewards effort and exploration without diminishing the overall fun if you choose to beeline it to the end.   Highly Recommended

Date 2017-01-04 Playtime 16h 30m Rec Positive OKAY! So being a fan of Shovel Knight and other retro style games, I decided to give this a go. First off I would like to say that it feels like the genre "Metroidvania" was made for this specific game. It captures both gameplay and atmosphere from both of the iconic games from which the genre was named.   BUT THE STORY! This is the best part of the game. I have a great quote.  Trace: "I FOUND THE FRICKEN AXIOM VERGE!"  Absolutely riveting 10/10

Date 2017-01-04 Playtime 5h 12m Rec Positive O que dizer desse jogo? Que tem gráficos em puro Pixel Art? Trilha sonora bacana? Jogabilidade acertada? Yep, Yep, Yep!! Arrisco a dizer que é o 3º melhor Metroidvania que já joguei, ficando atrás apenas de Super Metroid e Castlevania SOTN. E pensar que o JOGO INTEIRO FOI FEITO POR UMA SÓ PESSOA! Joguei em outra plataforma mas esse jogo merece estar na minha biblioteca. Fator replay altissimo. Valeu cada centavo investido.

Date 2017-01-04 Playtime 35h 59m Rec Positive Трое суток херачить в платформер до победного - это лучшая характеристика игры. Из плюсов отличный саундтрек.

Date 2017-01-04 Playtime 22h 48m Rec Negative 整个游戏就是跑路, 怪物设计的很糟糕, 尤其是BOSS AI简直就是弱智. 我是直接玩的hard模式, 目前干了4~5个BOSS, 基本每个boss能找到站位, boss随着血少就是单纯攻击频率加高.  小兵简直摆设. 别想着跟恶魔城一样打装备变牛B, 整个游戏武器系统前期武器基本就是开门钥匙,后期没只有个电,还有水平散弹枪好用, 其余的我只能说是摆设, 问题是拿了好用的枪没卵用,因为游戏怪物基本都是弱智,你拿第一把枪和后期的武器打起来没卵区别. 主要是找到攻击碎片提高攻击力,不管什么抢到后期就很牛. 另外, 因为不喜欢看攻略, 所以自己玩的有点久,整个游戏就是一个跑路游戏, 没有传送点,强行浪费时间. 虽然我直接玩的HARD模式, 但怪物AI极度弱智. 新武器存在感低.

Just finished it, and it was a great experience. Lots of weapons, tight controls, and even the story, which seemed to deal with many subjects at once, showed in the end how a work made with care and love for the genre can be a classic already.

Date 2017-01-03 Playtime 40h 31m Rec Positive This game uses the analog sticks as weapon wheel (game pauses when activated), and are very sensitive, so be sure your sticks aren't worn out and go back to center.
Date 2017-01-03 Playtime 12h 39m Rec Positive Really enjoying this game so far ! i keep on hearing comparisons to super metroid which ive never played because i had a sega mega drive back in the day. But i highly recommend if your into old school games.
Date 2017-01-03 Playtime 34h 20m Rec Positive A stunning love letter to Super Metroid. The music, story, art, and gameplay are all phenomenal. The sprites are a little subpar, but I'm not complaining. Spritework is hard and takes forever. Nintendo has done worse. The bosses seem hard, but once you figure out their patterns, they're actually fairly easy. It's hard to believe it was all done by one guy. The final boss fight is underwhelming and anticlimactic if you find [spoiler]the flamethrower and most of the size nodes, range nodes, and power nodes[/spoiler], but I guess that's why there's a low% run achievement.
Date 2017-01-03 Playtime 22h 46m Rec Positive This game was everything I've been wanting and more. Feels a lot like the classic Metroids but still fresh. Amazing chiptune music, wide range of weapons and tons of collectables and secrets hidden all over. I can't even think of one thing i didn't like about this game, other than the fact that it's over now and i still want more

Date 2017-01-03 Playtime 40h 19m Rec Positive Axiom Verge delivers everything I expected and wanted from it.  This game looks and plays like the spiritual successor of Super Metroid, which is probably the primary selling point for at least half of the people buying it.  As video graphic technology accelerated, the 2D platformer style that was the bedrock of early console games has mostly been abandoned.  That makes new titles for fans of that style always welcome, as long as they're well executed.  If you have played the early Metroid games, then this game will feel incredibly familiar, like a homebrew bootleg port.  I say that in a good way.  The bubble blocks, lava pits, save nodes and doorway portals are all here, scattered around an unforgiving planet inhabited by insects, robots, biomechanical ghouls and vampiric monsters resembling creatures from the watery abyss.  The map is a complex labyrinth of pitfalls and hidden chambers and the soundtrack adeptly reflects the haunting atmosphere of the game.  This game knows exactly what it's trying to emulate and hits the mark perfectly.  Fortunately, Axiom Verge comes with enough unique twists on its mentor to deliver a fresh experience.  The full arsenal of weaponry is far more extensive and diverse than Metroid, triple the amount of various beam weapons that you might expect.  This provides a variety of options to eliminate your foes and I found most of them to be useful throughout all portions of the game.  Also, rather than using a "Morph Ball" to find and access smaller tunnels, this game provides you with a tiny drone to navigate those areas instead.  Like Metroid, you'll find various tools, such as a grappling hook, to traverse the rooms.  You'll also find powerups for your weapons and your drone that will eventually allow you to access areas you couldn't before, although the manner in which you eventually reach those areas is slightly different than it would be in Metroid.  The most unique tool is the Address Disruptor, which allows you to 'glitch' the enemies and environment.  This allows you to materialize hidden blocks or morph enemies into a different form with different behavior patterns.  Lastly, there are five separate entrances to 'secret worlds' that are randomly generated in different locations for each game, allowing you to gain additional powerups and secret weapons, if you can find them.  This makes the game slightly different each time you play it.  This game easily makes it onto my top five list of favorite platformers.  Aside from a few frustrating learning moments with the controls for some of the tools and one level with a very obnoxious music theme that sounds like a singing robot (Lower Kur), I loved everything about it.
Date 2017-01-03 Playtime 12h 21m Rec Positive Fantastic 2-d platform adventure game.  Lots of weapons, tools, upgrades, secrets, Intriguing and unique artwork, Bumping soundtrack combine to give the player a very complete gaming experience.  There's a good amount of scaling challenge without getting frustrating or being a cakewalk.  Localized checkpoints and you never lose progress.  Really worthwhile pickup!  9/10.
Date 2017-01-03 Playtime 15h 16m Rec Positive Это 2D метроидвания в лучших традициях жанра. Думаю, что если бы 2D Метроид вышел сейчас, то получилось бы примерно что-то такого же уровня. Однако, Axiom Verge имеет много оригинальных решений, способностей и загадок, при этом в нём есть и хитрозакрученный сюжет, и биопанк, и классный саундтрек. Впечатляет. Особенно учитывая то, что всю игру сделал один человек. Если будете играть, играйте на английском. В русской версии из-за трудностей перевода невозможно всё открыть без гайдов.
Date 2017-01-03 Playtime 10h 19m Rec Positive [h1] Decisamente un bel gioco alla Metroid, must have per gli appassionati![/h1]  [i] Axiom Verge	[/i]. Promosso a (quasi) pieni voti. Io adoro i giochi alla Supermetroid, ma di "cloni" fatti davvero bene se ne trovano davvero pochi, e questo titoletto finisce dritto dritto tra questi pochi fortunati. Un prodotto come questo, pagato all'incirca nove euro, vale decisamente più di parecchi titoli tripla A venduti al quintuplo, a mani basse.  Vestiremo i panni del dottor Trace, uno scienziato che, durante un'esperimento in laboratorio, si risveglia in un mondo alieno e con una voce di una donna nella testa...Da qui inizierà l'epopea che lo porterà ad affrontare un nemico molto, molto particolare, accompagnato da delle entità che lo aiuteranno nel suo viaggio per scoprire la verità che si cela dietro quel pericoloso universo.  Il gioco, tecnicamente parlando, è quello dei giochi a scorrimento 2D, con uno stile grafico 8-bit estremamente fatiscente, con richiami stilistici allo storico artista H.R.Giger (celebre per aver creato la creatura di Alien): il mondo di Sudra presenta delle aree esteticamente curate e ricche di dettagli (dettagli che a volte però creano momenti di confusione visiva), che vanno da claustrofobiche ricoperte da sostanze rigeneranti a ampie aree rocciose e innevate. Il sonoro fa la sua bella figura, e ogni tema musicale è perfettamente adatto ad ogni area o situazione. Dal punto di vista del gameplay parliamo, per l'appunto, di un Metroid-like, quindi di tutti quegli aspetti tipici dello storico sparatutto 2D di Nintendo. La peculiarità di AV è sicuramente l'enorme quantità di potenziamenti per la nostra arma (sono arrivato al finale con nemmeno la metà, e ne avevo circa 5 o 6...) e durante l'avventura potremo potenziare persino noi stessi (teletrasporti, rampini, droni telecomandati ecc.), ampliando la barra vita attraverso il ritrovamento di globi rossi o potenziando la gittata, la potenza e la dimensione dei proiettili della nostra arma. All'interno dell'enorme mappa del gioco (divisa in settori che scopriremo man mano nel corso dell'avventura) troveremo i savepoint con i quali potremo salvare e riempire al massimo la salute. All'inizio molte aree ci verrano precluse, per poi esplorarle mano a mano che troveremo potenziamenti adatti al raggiungimento delle stesse, proprio come avveniva in Metroid. Non mancheranno i soliti collezionabili e gli obiettivi opzionali utili per le statistiche personali e per eventuali record da battere.  Che dire. Il gioco scorre bene, è decisamente longevo (10 ore e 11 minuti tondi tondi) ed è citazionistico quanto basta da fare felici i nostalgici del genere. Unica nota negativa..  [i] La parte finale...Cristo...La parte finale...Mi viene male solo a pensarci...!	[/i]  Allora...Immaginatevi un gioco che per nove ore scorre fluido, senza particolari momenti ostici e con una curva di difficoltà modesta. Ecco, ora arrivate alla parte finale, entrate nell'area di gioco conclusiva per poi...RITROVARVI DI COLPO IN UN LIVELLO INCREDIBILMENTE FRUSTRANTE, AL LIMITE DELLA BESTEMMIA.  Davvero, il la curva di difficoltà nell'ultima ora di gioco impenna bruscamente, con nemici incredibilmente irritanti che vi annienteranno con pochissimi colpi. Non pensiate che questo, in se, sia un difetto, perchè la difficoltà rappresenta la sfida che un gioco vi può regalare, ma cavolo..Almeno andava calibrata un pelino meglio!   Resta comunque un piccolo neo di un'ottimo titolo, che consiglio senza se e senza ma a tutti quelli che amano questo genere...Non ne rimarrete delusi!
Date 2017-01-02 Playtime 35h 11m Rec Positive I've played through axiom verge twice now, once at somebody's house on ps4 and once on PC more recently, and I can confidently say that I will play it many more times in years to come, as it is quite simply one of the best metroidvania games ever made (and, to me, one of the best games ever made PERIOD). Axiom Verge gets everything right in my book, leaning much more heavilly on the metroid side of metroidvania. The game is not only incredibly fun, but also has immense replayability value, as playing it once only inspired me to pick it up again and go for a high percent run. The game is paced well and presents a perfect difficulty level, but if the game is too easy for you, there is a hard mode, and if thats too easy there's an achievement for dying only once if you dare to try that. It even has a speedrun mode for the insane people who attempt that type of thing.  TL;DR- 10/10 metroid style game with a ton of replayability. Buy today, its worth the money.
Date 2017-01-02 Playtime 10h 14m Rec Positive Axiom Verge es un título que se inspira en Metroid para recuperar las clásicas aventuras de acción y  exploración en 2D que tanto triunfaron en los 90'
Date 2017-01-02 Playtime 17h 40m Rec Positive Nunca um jogo foi tão fácil de indicar  Você gosta de Metroid ?  Já tá de saco cheio da Nintendo cagar para a franquia e nunca lançar nada que presta da Samus ?  Compre Axiom Verge, simples assim  Mesmo tendo fortes inspirações em Metroid o jogo é muito bem trabalhado em tudo que faz e seu Lore no final o faz se destacar como um jogo único e não só um plágio qualquer  Gráficos são simples, mas de um carisma único, level design é pensado em segredos e nos seus poderes que são muito diversos e bem criativos   Trilha sonora da o tom certo para o jogo, além de ter ótimas "boss fights" e uma história bem complexa, o que faz desse jogo uma excelente pedida para quem assim como eu sentia saudade de um Metroid decente  Ah detalhe ele não é fácil e pegar 100% vai exigir muitas horas  Recomendo fácil, assim como o criador do Dust, Thomas Happ se mostra muito talentoso fazendo tudo sozinho, imagina dar um time para um cara assim
Date 2017-01-02 Playtime 44h 56m Rec Positive This is the best metroidvania game in existence. The depth of the storyline will keep you craving more. The mechanics and challenge of the game is 10/10. The map is very complex and gives a real sense of adventure. A glitch gun allows you to access parts you couldn't reach before, and the map even allows you to set 2 reminder flags on parts of the map you may need to come back to in the future.  The graphics speak for themself with bright colors in an otherwise gloomy, subterranean setting. Bio-Mechanical creatures reminiscent of the works of HR Giger.  I cannot say enough good things about this game. I truely makes me happy.
Date 2017-01-02 Playtime 31h 35m Rec Positive 복고풍의 패밀리시절 게임의 향수를 느끼게 해주는 아케이드게임입니다. 맵을 돌아다니며 아이템을 줍고 보스를 격파하고 스토리를 이어나갑니다. 맵이 복잡하고 왠지 난해하기에 공략봐가며 하세요. 도전과제는 공략보면 15시간이면 다 완성할수있고 안보면 100시간만에 완성을 볼수있는 그러한게임.입니다. 아니면 도전과제를 영원히 못깰수도 있습니다. 하지만 재미는 있네요. 취향나름이겟죠?
Date 2017-01-02 Playtime 8h 21m Rec Positive Great game I really like this game, I only play one run but in the future Im gonna make another to get all the items. If you like the gameplay of classic metroid this is for you. But no only is the gameplay, the story of the game is great.
Date 2017-01-02 Playtime 13h 13m Rec Positive 就完成度来说很难相信这是独立开发的游戏，探索感和气氛营造都很棒
Date 2017-01-02 Playtime 21h 12m Rec Positive If you are a Metroid-vania head, this is one for the books. It draws heavily from the NES Metroid, which is not a bad thing. Much bigger and more indepth than most. A real treat of a game. You will even get stuck in a ways that make you love the game more. Buy this now. Seriously.
Date 2017-01-02 Playtime 14h 53m Rec Positive Not sure why I didn't buy this sooner.
Date 2017-01-02 Playtime 14h 1m Rec Positive Really liked the game. I expected something a bit more difficult but still haven't tried hard mode yet. The controls and mechanics are really fun and with a little creativity it's possible to combine them to go faster or avoid enemies. At first the weapons didn't seem quite interesting but after half of the game became lot more useful and I ended up switching them a lot more than at the beginning of the game. As a SoTN and Metroid fan, I had a lot of fun with this game and might play a little more.
Date 2017-01-02 Playtime 13h 33m Rec Positive Really great game it reminds me of playing Metroid for the first time again.
Date 2017-01-01 Playtime 84h 43m Rec Positive 10/10 Masterpiece. I used to look for games that are somewhat close to as good as Super Metroid... this one is actually BETTER. PROS + Great retro style music/sound + Amazing story + Engaging mechanics + Useful weapons + Usable intuitive interfaces + Solid programming (windows) + Challenging without too much punishment CONS - I wish they would have used the right controller stick to aim your weapon (while still moving with the left); the whole locking-aim mechanism is just cruel... - The grappling hook mechanism is somewhat annoying to wrangle properly.. NOTE: Even the cons are totally acceptable as challenging "classic-like" aspects of the game.
Date 2017-01-01 Playtime 14h 3m Rec Positive Axion Verge é um incrível (diria até inacreditável) metroidvania, ambientado num universo steampunk-futurista. Ele conta a história de Trace, um cientísta que, num dos seus experimentos, acaba acordando nesse mundo esquisito. Eu confesso que não dei muita atenção pra história quando joguei, mas ela é mais rica do que aparenta ser. Ela é cheia de significados, e há várias teorias na internet sobre os fragmentos de plot que o jogo apresenta no decorrer.  O que mais me agradou nesse jogo foi a trilha sonora. Cara, como ela é boa! Eu tenho ela no meu Spotify e ouço sempre. O visual também é muito bem feito, principalmente se você parar pra pensar que foi feito por um cara só. As cores são bem vivas, os cenários são bem desenhados, os trechos são bem memoráveis. O mapa eu também achei bem gigante. Não tem fast-travel [spoiler](na verdade tem, mas só mais pra frente na história)[/spoiler], então prepare-se para andar e explorar (o que na minha opinião é ótimo). Há muitos secrets pra se descobrir também, uns são bem óbvios, mas alguns tem que explorar bem pra encontrar.  Um ponto que achei mais ou menos foi o balanceamento da dificuldade. Alguns bosses são fáceis demais, principalmente se você sacar o weak spot dele. As vezes você vence um boss ficando parado e atirando, porém nem todos são assim. E em alguns trechos os inimigos são BEM mais dificeis do que o boss que vai chegar. Aliás, o jogo é desafiador, prepare-se (mesmo no 'normal').  A quantidade de armas, itens e equips é imensa. E, sem brincadeira, você acaba usando praticamente todos eles. Cada um tem uma utilidade, que vai depender da situação que você se encontra. E muitas delas requer treino pra poder ser efetivo com elas ou alcançar lugares pra poder progredir. Desses itens, o que eu mais gostei foi a "onda-hacker" (não lembro o nome certo haha), que ela "glitcha" os inimigos e algumas áreas. Essa mecânica é a coisa mais criativa do jogo e muito legal de se usar. As vezes vc glitcha o inimigo e ele fica mais fraco e fácil de matar, ou as vezes ele fica mais foda, ou as vezes ele se torna algo útil pra você progredir também. É bem interessante.  A jogabilidade é uma coisa que eu vi algumas pessoas reclamarem, mas eu achei fluida e responde bem. A única coisa que incomoda um pouco é o "dash", mas só pra quem joga no controle. Eu joguei no controle, mas me acostumei. Acho que é só questão de se adaptar.  Por fim, minha conclusão de que esse jogo vale muito a pena, não foi a toa que ele foi indicado pro TGA 2015. Jogo muito bem feito, história densa, jogabilidade ótima e muito bonito. Podia ter cuidado de alguns detalhes, como por exemplo [spoiler]a Elsanova estar em Absu e Mar-uru ao mesmo tempo perto do final do jogo[/spoiler], mas no mais é um excelente jogo. Recomendo!
Date 2017-01-01 Playtime 16h 22m Rec Positive Отличная метроидвания. Игра, сделанная одним человеком. Автор вложил всю душу и это реально чувствуется - с каждой смертью, с каждым найденным секретом или убитым боссом. Интересный сюжет про загадочную расу существ, которых почти не осталось по вине одного человека... вы должны исправить его ошибки. Отличная музыка и звуковое оформление в целом. Рекомендую сыграть всем, кто любит исследовать большие карты в поисках новых видов оружия и прочих предметов.
Date 2017-01-01 Playtime 139h 22m Rec Positive Do you like the original NES Metroid Game? How about Super Metroid for the SNES? You do, huh? Then you're going to LOVE this game!
Date 2017-01-01 Playtime 14h 10m Rec Positive Старый, добрый, атмосферный Метроид! Ещё бы карта не глючила вобще бы было-бы замечательно! (^_-)
Date 2017-01-01 Playtime 12h 9m Rec Negative I had heard some negative reviews and it but decided to try it anyways.  Long story short I think that there are much better metroidvanias for less money, the art style and combat/pace feels lacking, and it frequently crashes on mac after rebirth at save points. For those reasons I would suggest you purchase one of the other quality platformers on the market.
Date 2017-01-01 Playtime 3h 12m Rec Positive One word: Axiom Verge is a great game ! ! !
Date 2017-01-01 Playtime 12h 28m Rec Positive I came for a metroid "clone" expecting something mediocre. What I got was something clearly inspired by the concept, but taken much farther with some psychological thriller added in  It's definately worth a play through.
Date 2016-12-31 Playtime 12h 11m Rec Positive A nice game to scratch that Metroid itch. Story is interesting be it a little light.  Lots of goodies to find and achievments if thats your thing.   I give it a solid B.
Date 2016-12-31 Playtime 11h 7m Rec Positive Excelente Jogo. Simplesmente Indispensável para quem gosta de Metroidvanias.
Date 2016-12-31 Playtime 5h 42m Rec Negative *NOTE: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!*  This is another one of those times where I wish there was a 'meh' rating for games. I like the aesthetic of this game a lot, the music, the weapons, they're all cool, but overall I didn't enjoy my time with Axiom Verge that much. To begin with there is a lot of backtracking in this game, and while there are a few shortcuts you can expect to tread the same ground quite often and it isn't fun to do so due to how movement works. *spoilers* The way you traverse in the game horizontally becomes all about teleporting, you can never have a higher base movement speed like the old Metroid games so I was always just double tapping as much as I could to move as fast as I could. This is annoying and I should have looked in the options to see if I could rebind it. In addition it's pretty easy to not know where you need to go next so you're just wandering around, you don't always immediately use the ability you just unlocked to put you back on the right trail, which while a minor nitpick can be annoying.  My other main gripe is the spike in difficult near the end where enemies just become death dealing bullet sponges. I assume this is to balance out for people who went through and collected a majority of the powerups but I didn't and it made the last few sections extremely frustrating with many enemies taking up to 1/8th of your health in a single volley while taking many hits to kill. I also only used a couple of the weapons in the game, it doesn't feel like you HAVE to use the other ones so why bother? I ended up cheesing many enemies by turning into the droid and just running past them, then teleporting to my drone to avoid them, or gaming them by just running the drone into them and getting off one hit at a time before it died. This to me is not fun, but when you're on a sliver of health (or more in some cases) and the checkpoint is a ways away why risk it?  Overall it felt okay, movement didn't feel as good as I would have like and was finicky, and some of the combat was downright annoying (weird spikes in boss difficulty then being super easy, or enemies that did more damage than the bosses did). Overall it's worth picking up on a sale depending on whether you really like Metroid games and can overlook these faults. If not I would recommend avoiding it as it can be a very frustrating experience at points.
Date 2016-12-31 Playtime 24h 58m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an amazing Metroidvania game, it is very reminiscent of Super Metroid in appearance tone and gameplay, but it has a very large set of it's own unique mechanics that work really well. The story is pretty good for a platformer and the music and art suits the game very well, the only issue is that the default keyboard controls aren't very good, and although you can rebind them I'd still strongly reccomend using a controller. If you have enjoyed one of the 2D Metroid games then you will almost certainly love Axiom Verge.
Date 2016-12-31 Playtime 14h 21m Rec Positive I created a cheese meta in a world of sauce. 11/10 would put on my spaghetti.
Date 2016-12-31 Playtime 13h 7m Rec Positive 숨겨진 아이템들도 있고 퍼즐적 요소가 많은 게임이여서 굉장히 재미있다.  그래픽도 분위기에 맞게 잘 만들어졌고 연출도 좋다.  난이도도 너무 어렵지 않고 쉽지도 않아서 적당히 도전욕을 불러 일으키면서도 키보드(혹은 게임패드)를 던질정도는 아니다.

Date 2016-12-31 Playtime 16h 9m Rec Positive ♥
Date 2016-12-31 Playtime 27h 14m Rec Positive This is the true successor to Metroid. You truly feel uneasy and alone in an engrossing world. This is a real good piece that understands how to reward discovery, cleverness, patience and memory. It is a true adventure, and you have this tool belt for you to get through. It's up to you to figure it out, no handholding.  Being very similar to Metroid, you know what to expect, so there is little else to add. I will only say that the game immitates graphic glitches from the NES in wonderful ways that contribute to the mood, the gameplay and the story. It makes you feel like you're not supposed to be here.
Date 2016-12-31 Playtime 4h 24m Rec Positive Ich bin ja tatsächlich stets auf der Suche nach etwas, das die große Lücke füllen kann, die Rogue Legacy erzeugt hat, nachdem ich nach dem dritten Durchspielen gemerkt habe: Jetzt wird’s mal Zeit für etwas anderes. Axiom Verge ist als Metrovania-Verschnitt in 8-Bit-Retro-Optik vielleicht genau der richtige Kandidat. Und ja, das Spiel ist auch ganz gut, hat einen tollen Soundtrack und einige pfiffige Idee. Total umgehauen hat es mich aber nicht. Dafür gefällt mir zum Beispiel das Artdesign der 8-Bit-Optik nicht gut genug. Kurzer Exkurs: Ich bin ja ein unheimlicher Turrican 2-Fan. Das einzige Level, das mir nicht gefällt, ist das letzte, das Alienlevel. Weil ich die braun-braune Optik irgendwie trostlos, einfallslos und gar nicht ansprechend finde. Leider bedient sich Axiom Verge genau diesem Stil, auch wenn da etwas mehr lila im Spiel ist, muss ich für mich festhalten: Optisch ist das Game eher trostlos.  Der zweite Punkt, der zum Beispiel Rogue Legacy so interessant macht, ist der Ausbau des Charakters. Das fehlt, wie es bei einem echten Retrogame nun mal üblich ist, bei Axiom Verge ebenfalls komplett. Und so ist das Ganze eigentlich eher von der Marke: Kann man mal ne Stunde spielen, aber dann ist auch wieder gut.
Date 2016-12-31 Playtime 16h 19m Rec Positive Take a shot every time someone mentions the word "Metroid" on their review. you like metroid? then you like this game, no doubt. i know i do.
Date 2016-12-30 Playtime 8h 58m Rec Positive It's like Metroid, but more shooting.
Date 2016-12-30 Playtime 0h 32m Rec Negative Not sure what all the hype is all about.   I just don't feel anything fun from it.  It's like Metroid but doesn't feel like a completely new experience for me.
Date 2016-12-30 Playtime 15h 33m Rec Positive im not sure how many hours i have in this game but i have played this game longer then some games i have paid 40$ for. i bed the dev to please make a number two. take this game and run with it. i would like to see a 3d version made, with like an unreal engine. or something. im not a computer god, im not sure how games are made but this game deserves its own fanchise.
Date 2016-12-30 Playtime 12h 24m Rec Positive Jogo muito bom! vale cada centavo... Resgata a glória  dos games de 16bits!
Date 2016-12-29 Playtime 9h 53m Rec Positive Hey this is really good and fun.  The setting is super rad.  The story is cool.  There's a pretty good spread of weapons.  Mobility options are great and there's definitely a couple times where I figured out how I could do a thing (or combination of things) to get a thing and I felt really good about it afterwards.   Graphics are very retro.  Music is fantastic.  Default controls are passable but also customizable.  Does not overstay its welcome.  Highly recommended.
Date 2016-12-29 Playtime 25h 51m Rec Positive Very reminiscent of Metroid. Good narrative, excellent gameplay.
Date 2016-12-29 Playtime 14h 27m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an absolutely fantastic metroidvania game. It draws the best gameplay elements from the classics and rings out its own spin on things, solidly standing on its own while nodding respectfully to its inspiration.   The artstyle, soundtrack, and gameplay are all top notch. The amount of items is unbelieveable. I just finished my first play through on normal, taking a my time to explore, and I totalled 14 hours. The only 100% I got was of the tools.   The story is also cool, with some fantastic plot twists. If you personally find the story lacking, the gameplay is still great.   Seriously, if you like this genre, or want to get into it, I can't recommend it enough.
Date 2016-12-29 Playtime 2h 28m Rec Positive Amazing!  This is a 10/10!  The game is an amazing experience, any fan of the Metroidvania style would be pleased with Axiom Verge.  It definitely has some replay value and it's really worthy!  Great Story, Amazing gameplay and a terrific game overall!
Date 2016-12-29 Playtime 25h 45m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania game. It basically IS Metroid for what it's worth. Controls can be a little bit of a bear at times, but it just takes a bit of practice. So far the bosses have been pretty easy, all you have to do it figure out their "patterns" and then blast away.    Definetly worth a go if you like Metroidvania / Retro-Styled games!
Date 2016-12-29 Playtime 9h 58m Rec Positive Ah, a Metroidvania that actually plays like Super Metroid. In many aspects, anyways.  Overall, I recommend the game, but I feel that it should be stated that despite being "overwhelmingly positive", there are aspects in which it falls short.  PROS: + large explorable map with multiple sections, a lot to explore - and for me, it didn't get tedious even during "backtracking" and finding stuff in previous regions + many collectable weapons and items + 16/17 music is good  MEH: - there are 7 bosses, but 3 of them are so predictable that you barely even have to dodge, just jump (if that's even necessary) and shoot at them with your basic weapon: boss behaviors are very simplistic, they typically have 2 attacks on repeat - grappling hook mechanics are extremely wonky - some collectible weapons serve zero purpose/utility  PAIN POINTS: - 1/17 music is so bad, I got lost a few times just because I didn't want to go back to its respective area (lower kur) - most collectables are completely optional: the game only forces you to obtain 2 weapons out of 18, so the bosses are built only for those two weapons, which essentially means 1 of them is a bit more interesting, the others technically just rely on being shot at   Overall I enjoyed the game, but it has some shortcomings. For the Super Metroid-like exploration aspect, it's pretty neat. I actually finished this game, unlike Environmental Station Alpha where the backtracking got tedious after a while and then just never bothered. ESA had better bosses, but this had better exploration. And that's what you're going to do most of the time.
Date 2016-12-29 Playtime 24h 2m Rec Positive An excellent, challenging love letter to Super Metroid.
Date 2016-12-29 Playtime 10h 35m Rec Positive とにかくメトロイド サクサク進むので気づいたらラスボスの目の前なんてこともある 隠し要素が豊富なので焦らずにじっくりとプレイせよ  さっとやって１０時間ほどでクリア （全回収ではない
Date 2016-12-29 Playtime 17h 24m Rec Positive Where do I begin?...so being a Super Metroid speed runner and long time fan of the Metroid platforming series (been playing since I was old enough to hold a controller which is like 17 years now)I had to give this a try,and sadly I hadn't heard of this game till about a week before this review,after palying it fully through and doing a normal run I've decided I will be speedrunning this game and it has 100% earned my respect,It has great mechanics and tons of collectibles and weapons (even though the person who made the grapple hook should be fired),and with a completion rate of 72% on my first playthrough I feel like the game is pretty much on par with Super Metroid,getting stuck can be frustrating but Overall nothing you can't get though with a little time,I have a ton of respect for the game designers and only wish the soundtrack wasn'tso out of place in this game,one of the few things i disliked about this game was that the soundtrack didn't really fit the retro graphic style nor did it create atmosphere,personally though I loved every moment of it and can't wait to play through again
Date 2016-12-29 Playtime 10h 9m Rec Positive Great Metroidvania, nice atmosphere.
Date 2016-12-29 Playtime 2h 37m Rec Positive Great game but keep in mind that it has original NES levels of difficulty. There's no hand holding so easy button kids need not apply. Get in and get good.  Also it is fun.
Date 2016-12-29 Playtime 15h 7m Rec Positive I [i]really[/i] like this game. Excellent nod to Metroid.
Date 2016-12-29 Playtime 75h 1m Rec Positive Now $20 may sound like a bit much for a game like this, but you have to keep in mind that this game, like Undertale and Stardew Valley, was created by a single person.   Tom Happ created an absolute masterpiece of a metroidvania, made right from the love of the genre. Well-polished, fluid gameplay; a gripping story that keeps you wondering what this place even is, even after the credits; capable of speedrunning; and it's well-built. I would even go so far as to say that this game is the Metroid that Nintendo never made.  There's this one thing, however: the game itself is a glitchy mess - in a good way. One of the core mechanics is to actually "glitch" your way through the world, whether it be by phasing through walls or "corrupting" tiles and enemies. Never have I seen a game where glitches were intentional.  Not to mention that the art and the music fit so well with the game. A true sci-fi experience if you ask me.  I couldn't recommend this game any fuller, but - like any other game - Axiom Verge is more worth the money when it's on sale.
Date 2016-12-28 Playtime 9h 43m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvania games I've EVER played. I've played a good amount and usually get bored quickly, but not this one.  Although it has the concept of Metroid, it still does its own thing. Also, the music is fantastic!  Definitely a must buy!
Date 2016-12-28 Playtime 26h 15m Rec Positive This game wass gifted by a friend.  Fuck. Yes. This is hands-down a love letter to the Original Metroid and the 8 bit era action and exploration titles I was instantly reminded of the First two MEtroid titles, Blaster MAster, And the cutscenes from Ninja Gaiden from my plays so far. From the moody, Atonal soundtrack to the level design and atmosphere this title oozes charm and polish and it's not using it's retro appeal or theme as a gimmick, Easily standing on its own as a solid game. I've but played a tiny bit of it so far and right off would reccomend it. In fact I'm looking to buy copies for my brothers.
Date 2016-12-28 Playtime 36h 8m Rec Positive 10/10  Goddamn work of art.  One of the best ever.
Date 2016-12-28 Playtime 17h 30m Rec Positive Axiom Verge challenged, required me to see and use the game world in new ways. Reminded me a little bit of when I was a kid first learning to skateboard, and suddendly everything around me looked like something I wanted to skate on. The world in Axiom Verge has tricks across the map that I didn't realize were in front of me until after being granted the freedom to see them for what they are.. If I saw them.   I have deep appreciation for Tom Hess, the one credited dev who designed and created such a complex experience, beautiful, good music and sound. I had fun, even when I was running circles completely stumped, admittedly frustrated, lost, hoping providence would grant me to see the next waypoint.
Date 2016-12-28 Playtime 2h 2m Rec Positive Metroid, but designed by H. R. Giger.

Date 2016-12-28 Playtime 22h 46m Rec Positive muy buen metroidvania
Date 2016-12-28 Playtime 35h 20m Rec Positive Já faz muitos anos que não jogo um jogo assim tão bom. não consigo achar algum defeito no jogo, ele é simplesmente perfeito, eu dormi pensando na história dele quando estava no meio do jogo. Lindo, magnífico, uma obra de arte. O jogo contem quase tudo que eu gosto do bom e velho estilo metroidvania, eu adoraria ver uma parte aquatica, não rolou, mas tá perfeito assim. Além do mais, esses "glitches", mundos alternativos bugados e tal, era o que eu mais procurava quando era criança nos jogos kkkk, quando o cartucho tava ruim as vezes dava uns bugs tensos no jogo.
Date 2016-12-27 Playtime 0h 42m Rec Positive Just buy it.
Date 2016-12-27 Playtime 13h 48m Rec Positive The spiritual successor of Super Metroid we all wanted- but this game goes beyond the Metroidvania genre. Fantastically constructed pacing which allows space to get lost and confused but never so much that things seem impossible. Story is intriguing and journals scattered throughout the world, sometimes in obscure locations, offer cool insights. There's a good degree of additional exploration for the last items and maps that makes playing beyond the end enjoyable. Music is great and the world subtly pulses with the beat. Graphics somewhere between a NES and gritty Mega Drive vibe, which is perfect - this game isn't emulating the Metroidvania genre so much as using it a base for something entirely new. Also, tons of weapons! Almost any weapon idea you can think of has been placed in there somewhere. Wow, what a fantastic game, really.
Date 2016-12-27 Playtime 7h 19m Rec Positive Great metroidvania. Maybe the best in the past few years. But there's no teleport system to help with the grinding. So it's EXTREMELY tedious to go around picking up all the dope items. I got bored and stopped playing. But the ideas are cool and I do want others to check it out and play it and see what they think.
Date 2016-12-27 Playtime 11h 28m Rec Positive Thomas Happ, спасибо! Это были лучшие 12 часов в игре за последние 3 года. Безумно стильная, с прекрасным звуковым сопровождением, с сюжетом и в меру сложная.
Date 2016-12-27 Playtime 32h 6m Rec Positive This is one of the greatest games ever made.
Date 2016-12-27 Playtime 1h 58m Rec Positive I bought this game on a whim during one of Steam's many sales because I occasionally like to play retro platformers for 30 minutes or so a month. Usually they don't hold my attention much longer than that because with a lot of them if you've played one you've played them all. Axiom Verge sucked me in for hours on my first play. My initial impression was "wow, this is a Metroid clone right down to the map and enemy style" but it very quickly deviates and becomes its own game. Obviously it was heavily inspired by the original NES Metroid but the developer has added a ton of his own original ideas to make it both more challenging and more interesting.   I'm not very far into the game because it is actually pretty freaking hard at some parts so I'll just give my initial impression and why I think it grabbed me so quickly:  Plot: The plot is interesting from what I've seen so far and although "story moments" are few and far between, they give you just enough to keep you wanting to see the next "cut scene" and figure out what is going on. Aside from dialogue before boss encounters and at certain points when you discover something important, you're left alone to just play the game... which is nice but it is certainly different from modern games where you always know where you're supposed to go next. There is a lot of independent exploration in Axiom Verge.  Combat: Combat is pretty straightforward if you've ever played an action-platformer. It is, as I have already said, very reminiscent of Metroid but there are some key differences. For one thing as far as I have seen you don't need a certain weapon to defeat specific enemies. Which weapon you use is completely up to which ones you like to use. Thanks to modern systems that have more than two buttons on the controller, switching between weapons is easy and quick. The main difference between Axiom Verge and Metroid's combat is you can lock your character in place with one button so that you can freely aim your gun to hit targets at weird angles you wouldn't be able to hit while moving. I didn't use this a lot at first but let me tell you it is almost essential during some of the boss battles.  Controls: For the most part the controls are fantastic but I am using a steam controller and some of the default button bindings are messed up. If you're holding the left trigger to lock your characters movement and using the joystick to aim your gun, it keeps switching weapons because I guess that is also the way to quick select guns. I'm sure you can fix that yourself I just haven't gotten around to it yet.  Graphics & Sound: Both gloriously retro Nintendo. The soundtrack is phenomenal, I must say. The art is decent. Most of the enemies are smaller so there's only so much you can do with a handful of pixels but the bosses and character animations look great.  Overall: I really didn't think I was going to like this game this much. It was like a dollar and I just wanted more games in my library that I could play with my Steam Controller. I was very pleasantly surprised. I'd recommend checking it out even when it's not on sale.
Date 2016-12-27 Playtime 21h 51m Rec Positive gut
Date 2016-12-27 Playtime 8h 34m Rec Positive Definitely pick it up if you love classic Metriodvania games.   I loved this, but as a veteran of this genre I felt it was far too short, and the story feels like it could have had more. For the more hardcore players, the speedrun mode and higher difficulty will really shine for you.
Date 2016-12-27 Playtime 28h 56m Rec Positive Hace muchos años que no jugaba un juego de plataforma tan completo y que me atrapara tanto. La ambientación, la música, la dinámica de juego, todo realmente excelente, no se le puede pedir mas.  Mis Felicitaciones al desarrollador.
Date 2016-12-27 Playtime 32h 30m Rec Positive Wonderful!  Epic music, epic level design and gameplay.  It's like Metroid but I actually like it more than Metroid /Super Metroid.  If I had to find any gripe it's that the bosses are too easy.
Date 2016-12-27 Playtime 8h 36m Rec Positive I haven't played too much of the game yet but its basically super metroid so it includes exploration and unlocking different upgrades to use.
Date 2016-12-27 Playtime 8h 11m Rec Positive This wouldn't typically be my kind of game, it looked ugly and generic, but the reviews convinced me to give it a go and I have to admit I'm so glad I did,how wrong my initial impressions were, it's a true work of art and a labour of love.  Constantly reinventing itself with a curious game world and protagonist, very clever innovative game mechanics the likes of which are rare to see in this day of triple A rinse and repeat, addictive as hell, challenging yet relaxing.  Also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in ages.   Get this game.
Date 2016-12-27 Playtime 2h 43m Rec Positive dans ma jeunesse j'avais pu (sur GBA) jouir des jeux metroid. tel que zero mission ou encore fusion et la serie metroid m'a beaucoup marqué puis les prime et le other M etait tous exellent! et la depuis un bon moment je vois ce metroidvania qui a pas mal fais parler de lui, alors oui il m'a beaucoup intriguer puis je l'ai acheter. et ce jeu, mon dieu ce jeu! vraiment digne d'un metroid 2D! avec son univers, ses power up, ses ennemies/boss et son ambiance (superbe au passage) qui lui son propre! un exellent metroidvania que je conseille vivement! une veritable lettre d'amour a ce genre de jeu!
Date 2016-12-26 Playtime 13h 34m Rec Positive Best spiritual sucessor to Super Metroid I've ever played. And it's far more than just a clone.
Date 2016-12-26 Playtime 0h 33m Rec Negative For a game which basically screams at its users to use a controller, it is a shame that controller support is not shipped out of the box.  I'm running a mac and tried both an xbox one controller and a ps4 controller with appropriate driver support, and neither worked with Axiom Verge.  Ultimately I found a link to a tool I could use to manually map each button to the specification the game uses, then copy that specification into a text file which controlled which controllers the game would recognized.  After this, the game worked, but I realized I could get it on console for the same price and without ever having to fight this battle again, so I returned the game.  The game itself is awesome - I highly recommend picking it up on console.  It works great with a ps4 controller on the ps4, and I presume it works similarly awesomely on the xbox one with an xbox one controller there.  But I cannot recommend buying it on steam.  For those who are determined, or have no other option, the config tool is called "SDL2 Gamepad Tool by General Arcade", and the file to locate within the game is called "gamecontrollerdb.txt".  I found the tool did not handle analog shoulder buttons well, so you may be in for a bumpy ride.
Date 2016-12-26 Playtime 10h 6m Rec Positive 透過拿到新的裝備來到達先前未能探索的地方 非常有趣 應該算是相當接近銀河戰士系的遊戲 值得一玩
Date 2016-12-26 Playtime 1h 21m Rec Negative Does not have steam controller support for mac.
Date 2016-12-26 Playtime 9h 36m Rec Positive 8/10  jump ,search and destroy.
Date 2016-12-26 Playtime 25h 3m Rec Positive Imagine Metroid mashed up with Another World and you have Axiom Verge. The story is interesting, the pixel art is gorgeous and the music is awesome. Definitely worth picking up if you're a fan of the genre.
Date 2016-12-26 Playtime 11h 5m Rec Positive I will go against the grain with this mini-review. This game is a blunt Super Metroid copy. I don't understand where people claimed that it tried new things, because most of them are variations of things that already existed in Super Metroid, with different graphics.  That being said, I do not believe Axiom Verge is a bad game. In fact it is pretty good. I have been playing many metroidvanias as of late, and it is the only game that took me 10 hours to finish (I usually take 2-5 hours).  It does not stand on its own like Momodora does, since Momodora feels and plays like a unique game. Axiom Verge feels and plays like Super Metroid, and there's nothing wrong with that.  If you're looking for a new Metroid title that is platformer, but it doesn't come out, you can settle with this. It's that good.
Date 2016-12-26 Playtime 32h 55m Rec Positive The only real problem I have with it is the low health beeping in tune to the music; if anything, it makes me want to be at low health...
Date 2016-12-26 Playtime 14h 40m Rec Positive My whole life I've been looking for something that can rekindle my love of Metroid. Yes, there have been good 2D Metroidvania out there like Ori & the Blind Forest, but those... are not Metroid.  Enter Axiom Verge.  If you ever liked Metroid, and ever want to experience that kind of adventure again, then Axiom Verge is for you. It simply delivers on all front. Beautiful alien environment, winding paths with tons of secret, getting stronger as you progress, amazing lonely soundtrack. I booted up this game for the first time, and as I started playing, it reminds me of those feelings that I have when I played Super Metroid back then :')
Date 2016-12-26 Playtime 25h 15m Rec Positive Simply put, Metroid should have been this good.  The story is excellent, the controls are mechanically sound, and the weapons are rewarding and versatile.   There are lots of ways to work around puzzles, so you're not always repeating the same thing.  The game, however, is MERCILESS in its explanation of what to do next.   Like Metroid on the NES, you will be expected to EXPLORE and REMEMBER locations of things you haven't yet done.   Backtracking is essential in this game, as new tools and codeframes will unlock entire new areas.  A great game for the price, I hope this developer keeps it up!  
Date 2016-12-25 Playtime 15h 48m Rec Positive I thoroughly enjoyed Axiom Verge. Immense size of the game, innovative weapons and tools, very atmospheric visual and sound designs, and near-perfect gameplay is what makes Axiom Verge so good. This is actually the first major Metroidvania i beat. And i loved every second of it. Even though the game is obviously flawed, and has a couple of poorly designed bosses, the plusses outweigh the minuses by a great margin.  I rate the aspects of the game based on how well they work. 10/10 visual design 8/10 sound design and 7/10  music 8/10 story  8.4/10 overall A nearly perfect game in the genre.  P.S. I am mad scientist. It's so cool! [strike]sonofabitch[/strike]
Date 2016-12-25 Playtime 9h 12m Rec Positive Das Spiel macht vieles anderst als Super Metroid (NES) und kann sich deswegen super davon abheben. Aber es hat auch alles drin was Super Metroid damals so gut gemacht hat. Ganz klar ein Spiel für Fans der alten Schule. Ich hab das Spiel direkt auf schwer durchgezockt und muss sagen das das Spiel absolut Fair bleibt.
Date 2016-12-25 Playtime 6h 14m Rec Positive This is a well crafted ode to Metroid.  I may be a 16 year old that was born during the PS2/Gamecube/Xbox era, but I remember pestering my grandmother until she brought out her old NES for me to play with one day. Never have I ever found games so satisfying in my life!! And the first game on the ol' NES I got attached to day one? Metroid.  Now, I'm like the other Metroid fans from the old NES days. I worry about the direction Metroid is heading now, and I wish they'd just quit and reboot the whole series for what it's become. But this?! This is better than Metroid!! This will keep me awake for days as I figure out exactly HOW to defeat that next boss, where to go, and how many times I'm gonna die til I get it right...  If your a Metroid fan, meet Samus's older cousin, get a copy of this game, and start crawling the bloody, confusing labyrinth that is Axiom Verge for yourself. And make sure you got plenty of food and water, a place close by to use the bathroom, and a PSVITA/3DS to continue playing on the road, cause once you pick this game up you WON'T want to drop the controller (like I FORCED myself to do just to write this review...)
Date 2016-12-25 Playtime 9h 45m Rec Positive You should play this game. I can't believe that one man made it. I hope he makes another because it was lots of fun.
Date 2016-12-25 Playtime 17h 14m Rec Positive So I still haven't beat this game on Pc yet, but I did pick it up on Switch and beat it there.  The game is a modern day classic metroidvania, with all the best things of the genre, an interesting world to explore, many secrets, loads of cool unique weapons and new ways of getting about that draw you back to places you remember seeing earlier.   The soundtrack is top notch, has great atmosphere and I liked every track of it. Nice visuals, pixel work that looks good and has a great sci-fi aesthetic to the whole game.   The game is mostly well balanced, though I will say it can be tought at the start, and enemies damage seems to ramp up a lot near the end.   I belive this is also a one man project, congrats to the creator.  Overall if you're a fan of metroidvania style games or platformers then this is a must try game.  (As a unrelated side note this game supports uncapped frame rates, and runs flawlessly at around 700fps+ for me, yet we still get AAA games from devs who can;t figure out who to remove a 30/60fps cap.)
Date 2016-12-25 Playtime 1h 54m Rec Positive Imagine if the final game to be made for the NES was a Metroid game. This is pretty close to what I feel that game would have been. The only way this game could be better is if there was more exploration between powerups.
Date 2016-12-25 Playtime 10h 34m Rec Positive sexy
Date 2016-12-24 Playtime 19h 37m Rec Positive This is the closest thing we will ever get to another true metroid game since nintendo has apparently abandonded the franchise.   Great music, nostalig visuals, tight controls and gameplay. Bravo.
Date 2016-12-24 Playtime 19h 38m Rec Positive This game has twists like an invisible roller coaster. If you dislike platformers you're missing out. Pros: lots of guns, good story, nice level design, good soundtrack. Cons: the script is a little weird but it doesn't ruin the story. I recommend this to all people that have working computers.
Date 2016-12-24 Playtime 2h 9m Rec Positive Really cool, great soundtrack, and intresting story!
Date 2016-12-24 Playtime 25h 19m Rec Positive absoulutely fantastic. speedrun mode is a great addition.
Date 2016-12-24 Playtime 8h 6m Rec Positive This game is pretty and almost as good as Super Metroid. If you love metroid games you'll love this game as if it were one.
Date 2016-12-24 Playtime 17h 26m Rec Positive Axiom Verge may very well be the most interesting indie metroidvania of recent years. It’s not most groundbreaking and you can spot where the game’s roots are easily. Still, every element of the game is done competently and is tuned to fit in the whole system. You can’t overlook the fact that whole game was done solely by Tom Happ. Sometimes whole teams fail to not put average pieces in the way of really great ones.  At first glance the game is an undeniable copycat of Super Metroid (perhaps any 2D metroidvania centered around shooting is) with all the foundation taken straight of it: the isolation feeling, save point system, health replenishment particles that some of the dead enemies leave behind, and the eerie vibe of psychedelic 80s sci-fi.  So it goes like this. You are “the scientist” named Trace, there’s an explosion in your lab. You are awaken in the alien world and contacted by Elsenova who is giant war machine representing “species” of Rusalki. They are at war with Athetos a mad scientist destroying space-time. More accurately speaking they lost the war and now you are their last chance. But that are the bits of the story from later on, for now all the instructions you get are “There is a gun in the next room” and “You must go, now”.  So you get out and start exploring. Enemies hit hard encouraging slow and methodical approach. Learning attack patterns and using distance to your advantage keeps you from restarting back at egg-shaped rebirth chamber. You make your way to the next rebirth chamber. You find few upgrades in the process and a new gun, which has a different firing mechanic (making it a highly situational weapon). And then you get to the boss; the slow and tense rhythm fades away.  It all just goes nuts. Boss fights are punctuated with delirious high-tempo electronic music and filled with adrenaline up to the brim. The screen is traced with enemy shots. You dodge and jump. You keep firing. Precision, speed and reaction will get you through first few bosses. Pattern-learning and staying focused will pick up after that. Bosses will have phases with tricky moves and more deadly attacks. You avoid damage and keep shooting watching how your enemy slowly turns red. All of this just turns itself into red pulsating blur.  The rhythm slows down again. You proceed further to keep on exploring. This is a simple loop of going through building up tension to climax points and back to calm concentration. You’ll collect more items, more weapons. You’ll meet NPCs. Piecemeal storytelling: cryptic dialogues and ciphered messages. Backstory takes significant effort to uncover itself. Same for some of the most powerful weapons.  Somewhere around the middle of the game Axiom Verge suddenly plays homage to Blaster Master repeating one of its key mechanics in reverse. Trace is granted an ability to launch a miniature remote-controlled drone to explore narrow spaces. Most innovative though is the Address Disruptor. The Glitch Gun. You fire it in a cone in front of Trace and it lets you pass through inaccessible wall (by evaporating them). Or it changes the properties of your enemy. Or it materialises a platform hanging in the air. It glitches. Magic happens.  The game’s most amazing secret though is its very well hidden procedurall-generated dungeons system. The existence of such a system within the game is what defines its author’s dedication to traditions of the genre. It’s this little details like a special mode for speedruns with some thought put into it that make a metroidvanian labyrinth interesting to explore, not just pass by.
Date 2016-12-23 Playtime 14h 48m Rec Positive Follows the Super Metroid formula while being weird as fuck.
Date 2016-12-23 Playtime 0h 41m Rec Positive good game
Date 2016-12-23 Playtime 38h 1m Rec Positive alright holy shit this game was good. the story is a bit here and there but man if you liked metroid you have to get this game.
Date 2016-12-23 Playtime 30h 57m Rec Positive 复杂的地图，难缠的boss，丰富的武器，各种看似乱七八糟的字符，到最后我也没能搞定那个神秘的门。剧情感觉跟传送门有点像吧（其实传送门也没太多剧情）。
Date 2016-12-23 Playtime 11h 13m Rec Positive This was a really fun game much like the original Metroid game.  It is an open world game where you gradually find power ups that open up new parts of the world and allows you to go back and find items that you couldn't acquire before.  In the beginning it doesn't have much of a storyline, but as you go on, the storyline develops and becomes much more interesting.    The game does some pretty neat things with the physics of the game too.  It gives you items that allows you to hack the world around you so that you can teleport through walls, and destroy parts of the world around you.  It also gives you an item to transform certain enemies into different versions of themselves, rendering them either harmless, bigger so they are easier to hit, or helping you reach areas you couldn't before or killing previously unkillable enemies.    The one thing I didn't like about the game is how many weapons the game gives you.  I found 9 weapons and only about 3 of them were useful for killing enemies.  When I looked up a guide I saw that there were at least another 5 - 6 weapons that I didnt find.  Other than that, I had no complaint with the game.  The boss fights were fun and challenging, the storyline was interesting, and the gameplay overall was very enjoyable.  I would certainly play it again.
Date 2016-12-23 Playtime 48h 49m Rec Positive If you enjoyed super metroid on SNES, you'll love this game.
Date 2016-12-22 Playtime 34h 28m Rec Positive Excelente juego. Indispensable en su libreria.
Date 2016-12-22 Playtime 31h 31m Rec Positive Another pixel-art gem. Travel to NES times with this metroidvania. All is good: graphics, controls, story, sound. And the exploration-reexporation is a great value. 
Date 2016-12-21 Playtime 8h 41m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is the Metroid of this age. It's a great metroidvania which hits all the right marks.  [h1]Pro's[/h1] [list] [*]Nice retro-style pixel graphics [*]The ambience is really alien and creepy, also thanks to its great musical score [*]Decent game length [*]Lots of replay value to to tons of secrets everywhere (just like the old metroid games) [*]Lots of weapons to discover and play with [*]Challenging and tough bosses [*]Various endings depending on how much % you've completed the game [*]A "secret world" area, which has randomized rooms and a random reward (out of a pool of rewards) [/list]  [h1]Cons[/h1] [list] [*]I played on an xbox-controller and the default button mapping for quickly switching weapons was clunky to me. I often acidentally switched weapons [*]One zone had some weird music with some sort of vocal in it (I believe it was "kur") which really stood out to me as terrible [*]The hacking tool has a very long range. It disables most enemies and some even end up being useful  instead of a problem. This made some parts a bit easy to abuse by standing behind a corner or a wall, hacking everything, and just casually strolling through. [*]I felt that there's quite a gap in how powerful weapons are. I think it's part personal preference and part actual balance. [/list]  As you can tell by the cons, I've really been nitpicking, as it's overall a great game and one I'd definitely recommend!  Was this review useful to you?

Date 2016-12-21 Playtime 17h 28m Rec Positive The best metroid game I've played since metroid prime.
Date 2016-12-21 Playtime 44h 4m Rec Positive Awesome game. Very fun to play. There were some parts where it was difficult to figure out where to go, but other than the frustration there, everything in the game is great. Only the first few bosses are what I would consider easy. The last few 3 or 4 bosses were really difficult in my opinion. You'll feel accomplished from beating them the first time. The soundtrack in the game is also very fitting.
Date 2016-12-20 Playtime 12h 58m Rec Positive Fantastic experience. Plays on nostalgia, but is a truly great game in its own right.
Date 2016-12-20 Playtime 134h 6m Rec Positive Better than most Metroid Games Not even Meming
Date 2016-12-19 Playtime 19h 36m Rec Positive Sensacional. Fortemente inspirado em clássicos do metroid. Recomendado à todos os fãs do estilo MetroidVania!
Date 2016-12-19 Playtime 10h 23m Rec Positive This game certainly has it's problems, but overall I really enjoyed the 10 hours I spent with it. One thing I really liked was the feel of the game, it really felt like I was in a different dimension and the glitch gun thing is honestly a huge part of it, being able to change the behaviour of enemies by glitching them was a pretty cool idea.
Date 2016-12-18 Playtime 38h 17m Rec Positive Didn't think I'd like this game.  Now, after beating the game... I want more.  A prequel, or a sequel!  I also will probably go back and 100% the game; and up the difficulty.   If you're considering this game, and are a fan of metroidvania games...  I highly recommend this.  You won't be disappointed.
Date 2016-12-18 Playtime 8h 42m Rec Positive [h1] Axiom Verge [/h1]  Entwickler: [b] Thomas Happ Games LLC [/b] Publisher: [b] Thomas Happ Games LLC  [/b] Weiter Spiele des Entwicklers: [b] ------- [/b]   [b] Einleitung: [/b]  Axiom Verge ist ein Retro-Metroidvania aus dem Jahre 2015 und erinnert sehr an Super Metroid aus dem Jahr 1994. Damals musste man als Samus Aran zurück zu Ihrem Heimatplaneten, um noch einmal gegen Mother Brain zu kämpfen und die Weltraumpiraten endgültig auszuschalten.  Doch Axiom Verge ist anders. Die Story und die Welt erinnern eher an eine (Alb-)Traumwelt, als an ein Sci-Fiction-Universum. Axiom Verge ist keine seelenlose Kopie der „alten Zeiten“ sondern ein Ode an die Zeit der ersten Metroidvanias. Doch Achtung! Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist auf einem anderen Level, also heutige Spiele, soll heißen, einfach durchrennen und abschließen geht hier nicht.   [b] Die Grafik: [/b]  Wie anfangs schon beschrieben ist die Grafik vollständig auf Retro getrimmt und in wunderschöner Pixeloptik gestaltet. Auch der Sound passt hier zum Gesamtbild des Spiels. Aber der Grafikstil ist auch teilweise etwas unübersichtlich und so kann es passieren, dass man Gegner, die im grünen Gras sitzen, übersieht, weil diese ebenfalls aus grünen Pixeln bestehen. Diese Pixelgrafik muss man aber schon mögen, den schließlich kann die Grafik hier mit keinem teilweise aktuellem Spiel mithalten.  [b] Die Steuerung: [/b]  Die Steuerung mit einem Controller ist sehr zu empfehlen und auch die beste Möglichkeit, den Charakter vollständig unter Kontrolle zu halten. Natürlich ist auch die klassische MuT-Steuerung (Maus und Tastatur) möglich, aber Krämpfe in den Finger will nun doch niemand mehr, oder?  [b] Die Story: [/b]  Die Geschichte um den Wissenschaftler Trace, der anfangs keine Ahnung hat worum es überhaupt geht. Genau wie wir, wenn wir das Spiel zu ersten Mal spielen und dann endlich die Waffe, den Axiom Disruptor, den virtuellen Händen hält und die ersten biomechanischen Feinde pulverisieren. Erst gegen Ende des Spiels erschließt sich die ganze Geschichte und lässt einen mit einem „Ahh!“ zurück. Leider ist die Story nur teilweise ausgebaut und so mangelt es etwas an Tiefe und Details zu den Wesen, die man besiegen muss. Trotz allem ist die Story super und mehr als nur ein Lückenfüller.  [b] Gameplay: [/b]  Man startet unbewaffnet und ohne jeden Plan, irgendwo in einer fremden und feindseligen Welt. Nach einem kurzen Gespräch mit einer biomechanischen Dame, findet man auch den Axiom Disruptor, die Standartwaffe des Spiels. Nun heißt es, schauen wie es weiter geht, den Hilfe bei der Navigation, wie eine Minimap oder einen Radar, gibt es nicht. Am Anfang ist das aber kein Problem. Die Wege verlaufen linear und man findet sich gut zurecht. Hat man erst mal ein paar Fähigkeiten erlangt, geht es mit dem sammeln der Power-Ups soll und dass, kann dazu führen, das man sich verläuft. Nicht dramatisch, aber lästig, wenn man immer wieder an der gleichen Stelle 10 oder 12 Mal vorbei latscht. Auch die Waffenauswahl ist ziemlich groß und allein für den Disruptor findet man, wenn man sich wirklich alles ansehen will, 24 verschiedene Schussarten. Hier ist alles, vom Laser bis zum Bumerang, dabei. Ja, nicht alles ist sinnvoll, den wer braucht schon einen Bumerang wenn er eine Blitzkanone hat?  Das Sammeln von Ausrüstungen und das Besiegen von Bossgegner ist die Motivation des Spiels. Die Bosse sind mit der richtigen Ausrüstung zwar nicht das Problem, aber es gehört schon etwas Geschick dazu, nicht in die Schüsse des Bosse zu rennen und so schnell das zeitliche zu segnen. Auch die Weltenteile sind unterschiedlich aufgebaut und haben ihre eigenen Wesen und Viehcher, die man mehr mal weniger, nerv..... ähm, ich meine klug agieren. Rennt man einfach unüberlegt in den nächsten Raum, so startet man wieder bei einer der vielen Speicherstationen und muss den Weg  bis zum Todespunkt wieder erneut gehen.  Je nachdem wie viel Zeit man in das Sammeln investiert, beträgt die Spielzeit 6-14 Stunden. Nach dem ersten Durchgang warten der Speedrun-Modus und der Hard-Modus darauf, getestet und durch gespielt zu werden. Wer alle Errungenschaften ergattern will, der ist mit ca. 15-20 Stunden dabei.    [b] Fazit: [/b]  Axiom Verge gehört zu den wenigen Titeln, die sich den Zusatz Metroidvania verdient haben. Wer Super Metroid und Konsorten klasse fand, wird hier nicht enttäuscht werden und voll auf seine Kosten kommen. Der Preis ist für Axiom Verge geht auch in Ordnung, aber nur wenn man wirklich alles finden möchte. Im Sale kostete Axiom unter 10 € und das ist es auf jeden Fall wert!  Vom mir gibt es eine klar Empfehlung für AxiomVerge!   [b]Doch Achtung![/b] Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist auf einem anderen Level, als heutige Spiele, soll heißen, einfach durchrennen und abschließen geht hier nicht. Wer nur bedingt frustresistent ist, legt bestimmt den Controller nach dem 2ten oder 3ten Boss aus der Hand.

Date 2016-12-16 Playtime 23h 20m Rec Positive One of the best games I have ever played. I was totally surprised by its depth and the perfectly balanced gameplay. The soundtrack is amazing as well. Thanks for creating this game, man!
Date 2016-12-16 Playtime 37h 2m Rec Positive [h1][b]¿QUÉ ES AXIOM VERGE?[/b][/h1]  Axiom Verge es un titulo que se alimenta de los “metroidvania”, es decir, plataformeros de exploracion en 2D, con una poderosa estetica a primera vista, donde asumiremos el rol de Trace, un cientifico que luego de un accidente es encontrado en un mundo distante, en el cual debera hallar las respuestas de lo ocurrido y volver a casa.  [h1][u]LO BUENO[/u][/h1]  • Apartado gráfico donde se denotan fuertes inspiraciones en Metroid y el arte de H.R. Giger.  • El soundtrack y en especial sus silencios, anunciando lo que esta por venir.  • Gran variedad de artilugios por encontrar y todo un rico mundo por explorar.  [h1][u]LO MALO[/u][/h1]  • Las horas finales del juego se siente terriblemente perezosa.  • La mecanica de los “cheat codes”, necesarias para tener ciertos items.  [h1][u]Mi Opinión...[/u][/h1]  Axiom Verge me llamo la atención por una sola cuestión: su apartado gráfico que claramente parecia haber salido de la mente maestra y padre de una de las criaturas mas grotescas y de pesadilla del mundo de la ciencia ficcion: el Alien (de la pelicula Alien: El octavo Pasajero). Ciertamente se siente mas como un Metroid por el mero hecho que deberemos avanzar por ciertas zonas o lugares una vez adquirido cierto item clave que hace que la exploración del mismo sea mas abierta y que el resultado sea encontrar items importantes o nuevas armas. Este titulo es bastante fuerte y veo razones para que haya sido, en su momento, nominado a uno de los mejores juegos indie del 2015, pero mientras mas trato de enamorarme del mismo, mas le veo sus falencias. No que sea mal juego, pero se encuentra menos apetecible sus horas finales que por decir tira a la borda el concepto tras los jefes y sus estrategias. Obviamente esto no quita a la fortaleza propia de un titulo que tiene todo en su lugar para ser una aventura que quieras jugar si eres fanático de los “metroidvania”.  [B]NOTA:[/b][i] *B+*[/i] – Axiom Verge es un muy buen juego cuya presentación es mas que convincente y que una vez ahí metido, vas a querer jugarlo hasta acabarlo por su mundo y los fantásticos escenarios. A pesar de algunos problemas que puedas encontrarle, eso no quita el hecho que sea uno de los indies mas formidables de los últimos años.
Date 2016-12-16 Playtime 5h 25m Rec Positive The Metroid game Fed force should've been.
Date 2016-12-15 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive I don't know how to put this. I have thrown some hours into this game. I love Metroid and I love SOTN. This is niether, and a little of both (much more Metroid). This game has some amazing game play mechanics and then some very poor ones. I don't want to drop any spoilers, but I think some of the weapons needed to be thought through a little more and the reward items were definatly lacking. Great monsters and boss battles. The story has some obvious influences... *cough* lab coat, and yet still maintains originality. I don't know if it's worth $20... but over all I would give a Six out of Ten. Fun but not a ground breaking.
Date 2016-12-15 Playtime 14h 50m Rec Positive One of the best Games i played in the last time. Good dificulty, amazing soundtrack, only one or two "where to go next" phases where a bit tricky. Nevertheless, beats some AAA titles without a problem.
Date 2016-12-15 Playtime 13h 22m Rec Positive Metroidvania what can i say! love it!!!!!! Highly recommend it! Enjoy Hi5 all Metroid fan folks out there!
Date 2016-12-13 Playtime 25h 13m Rec Positive A solid game for Metroidvania fans.  The appeal to Metroid fans specifically is apparent, and I mean classic NES Metroid with how much the graphics look so much like the original game.  Lots of weapons to find means you have something to look forward to than incremental stat upgrades like health boosts.  And using the Address Disruptor to manipulate enemies and environments is a cool mechanic and a cool nod to anyone who's ever experienced graphical glitches in NES games.  The different areas connect together well enough, though it begs for a more efficient fast travel system.
Date 2016-12-13 Playtime 14h 44m Rec Positive Toller Indie-Platformer - fordernd aber nicht zu schwer. Absolut schönes Spiel - hab das Spiel rundum genossen!
Date 2016-12-13 Playtime 28h 15m Rec Positive [H1][b]Review | Axiom Verge[/b][/H1] Axiom Verge está na lista dos jogos mais incríveis que joguei na minha vida, ficando entre os primeiros dentre todos, não somete por abranger o tema “metroidvania” com perfeição, mas também por mostrar uma história belíssima e te deixar com gostinho de quero mais.  É perceptível que Axiom Verge tem inspirações muito fortes no Super Metroid, mas isso não quer dizer que ele é uma cópia, muito pelo contrário, o jogo tem a sua própria história, seu próprio protagonista, suas próprias armas e ao decorrer do tempo vai perceber que é um jogo único.   [h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1] A jogabilidade do jogo é simplesmente incrível, totalmente compatível com meu joystick (Xbox One), diferente da maioria dos jogos em plataforma que usam poucos botões, geralmente pular e atacar, esse tem função em todos. Para quem como eu quiser jogar com um controle de Xbox e não tiver costume de usar o d-pad, prepare-se para aprender, pois a precisão dos dashs é essencial, e para usar esse dash é necessário dar dois toques pra frente, bem difícil de ser executado no analógico.  [h1]AUDIOVISUAL[/h1] O pixel-art é encantador, recordando a época do SNES só que com a fluidez dos jogos da geração atual, perceptível a cada movimento do personagem e a cada comando dado a ele sem aqueles “maravilhosos” bugs gráficos que tinha no NES/SNES por causa da falta de hardware.  A trilha sonora é bela e empolgante, ela tem aquele som cyberpunk e futurista a mesmo, trazendo algo bem psicodélico, hipnotizante combinando perfeitamente com o Axiom Verge, alimentando mais ainda a vontade de joga-lo.  Pra quem gosta de um jogo desafiador é uma fácil recomendação, pois pra zerar ele é preciso de muita persistência e habilidade, coisa que falta muito em mim, então quem não tiver muita paciência com o jogo vai acabar desistindo cedo, arrisco a dizer que no primeiro chefe.

Date 2016-12-13 Playtime 21h 42m Rec Positive If you love Metroid, this game is for you.
Date 2016-12-12 Playtime 32h 11m Rec Positive What can I say?  The game is perfect.  I've just started my second play-through because I've been missing it since I played it right after it came out.  Just as fun the second time through.  The visuals a gorgeous, the music is great, the mechanics are all spot on.  There is really nothing about this game that I can complain about.  It can be a little on the difficult side sometimes, but I find it to be very well balanced overall, and it's always rewarding to get past a tricky spot.  There is a metric ton of weaponry to play with, and the additional tools are handy and fun.  Some people may hate me for this, but I actually like it better than the Metroid games.  (not that I don't love those, but something about this game speaks to me a bit more)
Date 2016-12-12 Playtime 20h 22m Rec Positive great
Date 2016-12-12 Playtime 15h 7m Rec Positive Um dos melhores jogos que joguei em 2016, rocomendo totalmente pra quem curte jogos no estilo Metroid, esse jogo é simplesmente fantástico!!!
Date 2016-12-12 Playtime 22h 21m Rec Positive Metroidvania at its metroidvaniest. If you ever hung a poster of Samus Aran up on your wall, this is for you.
Date 2016-12-11 Playtime 15h 51m Rec Positive This game really got me from the beginning - I even put Fallout 4 aside for two weeks, just to play and finish Axiom Verge. It is a clever mix of Metroid and Turrican and the setting also reminds me a bit to Kabuki Quantum Fighter. But don't get me wrong - it is definitely not a clone. It has a unique story, look and feel and somehow captures the all the positive things from the classic games I've mentioned before. I especially enjoyed the upgrades and new weapons. And if you think you know everything about a certain map you might be surprised by new secrets the next you come back with more powerful gear. The soundtrack also contributes to the great retro experience.
Date 2016-12-10 Playtime 11h 28m Rec Positive Solid metroidvania with retro pixel art done the right way and exceptionally good music. Gameplay is well varied, thanks to many weapons, upgrades and some interesting mechanisms, including enemy hacking, drilling through tiles and finding codes to unlock areas/story. Story is engaging, though the ending isn't particularly strong. The weak point is bosses, they aren't challenging on Normal difficulty, some are trivial with the right weapon.
Date 2016-12-10 Playtime 22h 51m Rec Positive A good time, nice story, and I liked the Giger like art directions.
Date 2016-12-09 Playtime 12h 57m Rec Positive Really, Axiom Verge has been praised to the high heavens. Some reviews are so effusive that you'd think it was even better than its obvious inspiration, Metroid. Looking at Metacritic, the PS4 version is only sitting at 84, and it's definitely better than that. So let's dive in, shall we?  First of all, I don't want to hit much in the way of the story. What's here is pretty minimalisitic, and very intriguing, but in the end it doesn't feel like there's much of a resolution to anything. It's left ambiguous, probably intentionally. I don't know if there might be a sequel coming down the pike or not, but the story is certainly rife for exploring more. And finishing the game either under the 4-hour mark or getting 80%+ on items and map coverage leaves you with a scene that's decidedly cliffhanger-ish. I intentionally avoided almost all information about the game until I finished it the first time. The only thing I looked up was how many weapons there were. If you don't want to read about all the powerups and weapons, avert your eyes now!  Yeah, there are a bunch of those. You have a ridiculous array of death-dealing instruments. And the more you explore, the more you're going to find. The default weapon is very much base Metroid. You can get a triple shot, reflecting shot, the Kilver which is a short-range shotgun-style weapon, standard stuff like that, but there's some oddball weapons, too. The Voranj sends lightning blasts out in a huge pattern, but is weak. The lightning gun is crazy overpowered, locking on to an enemy and continuously hitting until they're dead. There's a weapon that feels distinctly like a multi-directional Diskarmor from Rygar. One particularly devious bit of puzzling will see you snag a Flamethrower, and that thing is really powerful in certain areas. There are 23 weapons in total, although three of them are super-secret weapons that you can only find in glitched secret worlds, and there is only one of them generated per save file. I ended up with the Heat Seeker, a really powerful homing shot that is actually even more powerful than the lightning gun.  There are also many powerups for your weapons, and for traversal methods. You can snag range, size, and power upgrades for your weapons, although sometimes they don't apply to certain ones. You'll also find the standard health upgrades. Then there are the cool ways to get around. Sure, you get some standard stuff like the high jump, and you get a drill that takes the place of bombs. But eventually, you'll get some more interesting stuff like a lab coat that lets you "glitch" through walls. This will upgrade a few times through the game. You also have a glitch gun that can affect the environment and enemies. It's certainly an interesting conceit, because a few puzzles rely on glitching enemies to achieve your goals, and it also lends to a sort of "is this really happening" vibe.  Small gaps are also fun. We all know about Samus' ability to roll up for small passages. Well, Trace can't do that. Instead, he gets a remote drone that he can use to navigate the passages. Eventually, you'll get the ability to throw that further, which also pairs with one of the last abilities, being able to warp to where the drone is. Wild stuff, that. There's also a shout-out to Bionic Commando with a biological-looking grappling hook, and the physics behave almost just like the NES game. Cool stuff!  I like a lot of the look of the game, but some of it bothers me as well. The game clearly shoots for a sort of biological horror / H.R. Giger-style look, and it largely succeeds. My only real gripe is that while the game is tile-based, it looks too tile-based. A lot of platformers attempt to hide this a little better, including Metroid, and this one doesn't do that quite as well. It's still solid, though, because the alien vibe is always there, the creatures are monstrous and well-designed, and everything just feels... wrong, but in the way that the designer intended. That couples with the soundtrack, a thumping, pulsing, heavy-bass score that goes really well with the sort of biological/mechanical motif.  With all those weapons, you'd think combat was great, and eventually it gets there, but enemies feel very bullet-spongey early on, especially if you haven't explored well and gotten a few weapon powerups. This gets better, but the game overall feels a bit more combat-focused than a Super Metroid, where atmosphere is king and most enemies are felled pretty rapidly. This game feels much more like if Super Metroid had held quite a bit closer to the original game than it did.  I mentioned the secret glitched worlds earlier, and those are pretty slick, too. You'll always find two powerups in them. You'll know you're close to one when the screen starts to get a strong CRT scanline effect with some distortion. Apparently the location of these is randomized from game to game, and the layouts are as well. No drill-wall secrets, though, so just get your stuff and get out!  Overall, I really, really enjoyed my time with the game. I know a game has its hooks in when the first thing I want to do when I get home is play the game, so this totally succeeds on that front. If you've got a strong hankering for a Metroid game, and you've blown through AM2R, this is a worthy competitor. Play it. You may love it more than I did.  It doesn't dethrone Super Metroid or Metroid: Zero Mission, but it's certainly quality entertainment, and stronger than most Metroid-likes out there.
Date 2016-12-09 Playtime 26h 1m Rec Positive A blatant super metroid ripoff in all the right ways.  If I had a complaint, it would be the obscurity of certain hidden items, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LzmEleW5EE]especially one that doesn't count toward the map screen's completion indicators[/url]
Date 2016-12-08 Playtime 10h 20m Rec Positive It is a nice game made by someone who obviously knew NES games very well. The game painstakingly reproduces visual style of NES and SNES eras, and makes fun of some of the glithces that were found back when. it is obviously inspired by super metroid, although there were areas which looked like homages to titles like Altered Beast.   There are few issues with it, though: [list] [*]It definitely needs a dash key. Dashing by double-tapping an analog stick is difficult. [*]Weapon quick selection is ... weird. [*]Loses momentum after first few hours and becomes quite a bit more boring. [*]Secrets are a bit too over the top and could be better designed. Some items apparently can only be found by repeatedly probing every wall you find and carefully investigating every part of a map. The strange part is that story can only be uncovered via finding secrets. [*]Some bosses near the end are cheap. (Bird bee boss, for example) [/list]  In short... it is a decent game, but Super Metroid was much more fun when I played it.  Still, for essentially a one-man product, it is damn impressive.  Worth checking out if you're into metroidvanias and retro styled games.
Date 2016-12-07 Playtime 10h 6m Rec Positive Eines der besten Metroidvania Spiele überhaupt! wer Super Metroid mag wird dieses Spiel lieben!
Date 2016-12-07 Playtime 3h 27m Rec Positive Awesome! Reminds me of the old good days.
Date 2016-12-07 Playtime 21h 2m Rec Positive One of the best pixel games I've ever played in my life. Made me really go back some decades. 10/10
Date 2016-12-06 Playtime 19h 18m Rec Positive This was by far the closest game I found to be similar to Super Metroid for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.  As a Retro gamer, and a big fan to the Metroid series, I do enjoy indie game developers attempting to make their version of this 2-D platform game which now has it's own genre "Metroidvania"! So far, Axiom Verge is a remake of a timeless classic! With great music, different levels, unique items and great storyline, this is a priceless retro GEM you want to buy and play!  There's just something about being stranded on an alien world with alien technology while finding hidden rooms & upgrades while trying to help a race of sentient alien war machines (known as the Rusalki) and defeat a tyrant who wants to wipe them out that is just pleasantly intoxicating to me!  If they make a Super Axiom Verge then I will tell them "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!"
Date 2016-12-06 Playtime 24h 28m Rec Positive Can't remember the last time a game has hooked me in the story like this one has. Really tight controls, nice visuals, and a great atmospheric soundtrack that really takes me back to when I first played through Super Metroid.      I don't know how far I am through the game but I still don't know what's going on. Often builds up to something that seems like it might explain things, then it plot twists and you're left with even more questions than before.       I can't recommend this game enough
Date 2016-12-05 Playtime 11h 5m Rec Positive Прекрасная метроидвания
Date 2016-12-05 Playtime 27h 10m Rec Positive Amazing game!  Feels like playing Super Metroid, but with a bunch of new gear.
Date 2016-12-05 Playtime 13h 11m Rec Positive Wonderful Metroid style game
Date 2016-12-04 Playtime 12h 7m Rec Positive Loved it from start to finish.  This only problem is it was over too soon.
Date 2016-12-04 Playtime 17h 17m Rec Positive Spoiler Warning: Axiom Verge is good, but ultimately not that great. The developer was amazing in how he was able to get all of it done himself, but it shows, and brings down the game.   Positives: The way new mechanics of the "glitching" and drone are what really make Axiom Verge unique, and a welcome improvement on Metroid-like mechanics. The weapons have a good variety of behaviors.  The art has a distinct style to it, which is understandable from only one developer worked on this.  The universe has a lot of room for development and I would love to see more.  Negatives: The world does not flow in a very organic or progressive way. The areas have little sense of connection, and although one or two weapons are useful for opening areas, this quickly goes out the window. The game plays a lot closer to Metroid II (the very linear Gameboy version) compared to a newer Metroidvania game, for most of the game. Only at the end where one is getting the last few skills or items do you need more than what was immediately made available or have to go to a previous part of the map to advance the game.  The world is very tight, which is the most important aspect of what the game does poorly. It's all action all the time, with very little of the map being relevant story-wise, and very little of the story coming out in the gameplay or environment. Never during play did I think "I really like this room/level" because it was beautiful or the way it fit the moment. Additionally, there's usually only a few new enemies per area or less, and these will be what you see in that area. After a while the game gets into re-coloring a few enemies, which is a little jarring because they're seemingly only used for some obnoxious difficulty in certain locations/battles.  The story at first was very interesting, but it doesn't get developed beyond an absolute minimum required to make the game go through a handful of plot points. There's also some glaring plotholes, like somehow you're in a computer environment (hacking and glitching) but also on an alien planet, and in a decayed civilization, and it just doesn't come together. Only at the very end does the final location mostly make sense given the plot. The lack of coherency between the world, story, and gameplay is the biggest problem with Axiom Verge.  The controls could've used a little work. The grapple mechanic is hilariously bad. I was really surprised at how poorly it controls given the author borrowing so heavily from Metroid. The grapple is pretty quickly superceded so it's not that bad, but it stands out the most. The weapon quick-select is also confusing, and the weirdness of how it behaves disrupts the combat considering how many guns you can get. The controller seems to have some deadzone (maybe 15%) but the lack of the option can make dashing and menu controls difficult with analog joysticks.  On the guns, there's not much of a difference between them in practice. Most enemies move too erratically to be fought by some weapons, and a number of the guns have pitiful range or pitiful damage, both of which gets you killed. Eventually you get upgrades for both range and damage, but this just makes the "useful" guns even better. Combat is pretty boring too, with enemies never being stunnable or blockable, having no weapon-specific behavior, etc, so it just comes down to spamming enough bullets. Many of the later enemies just dive right at you with near-unavoidable hits. The glitching helps make this more interesting, but late-game you end up just taking damage if you want to glitch (it takes time and might only slow them down), or take damage if you run straight in, so there's not much of a benefit.  On the art, most of the art time went seems like it went into the backgrounds, and not enough on enemies. The world has have plenty of art, which could've been used in more rooms, and even something like rotating tiles would stretched out the existing art. More enemies! What I would've given for just more space with more enemies. All the enemies even have only a few frames of animation, so it's not like more would've been that problematic. The art itself is more of a NES/GBC feel than SNES/GBA, and the visual crowding in a lot of places detracts from the detail and what could've been a simplicity of art.  Late game-item hunting is a pain, because some items are hid behind foreground and you can't tell where anything is. Games used to get around this by having some hint-mechanic (noises, x-ray), and it's annoying Axiom Verge didn't inherit that.   Overall: For a game from a single developer, Axiom Verge is amazing. It brings some new mechanics to the table for other platformers to play with and take hints from. While the gameplay shines, the story and feeling of the game suffer immensely. I would absolutely only recommend it if you really really like the basic mechanics of Metroidvania games, because mechanics are all it does well.
Date 2016-12-04 Playtime 18h 30m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is the Metroid we were all excited for and was promised, but never got.
Date 2016-12-03 Playtime 11h 23m Rec Positive Simply put, this was the best Metroid-like game I have played in years. Highly recommended.
Date 2016-12-03 Playtime 25h 56m Rec Positive Русский: Я на 95% уверен, что примерно 25 лет назад при мне рубились в эту игру на чернобелом телевизоре и консоли вроде нинтенды.  Достоинства: сюжет, графика, музыка, куча секретов Недостатки: кривое управление (по крайней мере для Logitech кейпада или клавиатуры), линейный сюжет.   English: I'm 95% sure that about 25 years ago,  i have seen somebody playing this game on big black and white TV and i assume, super nintendo console.  Pros: plot, graphics, music, a lot of secrets to find. Cons: quite bad controls, not working with my Logitech controller, linear plot (low replay value)
Date 2016-12-02 Playtime 16h 35m Rec Positive Love, love, LOVE this game. One of the best Metroidvanias I've ever played. This game is a love letter to Nintendo and to Super Metroid. It has all the elements that made that game great: exploration, a broad range of weapons, power-ups, and upgrades (a LOT more than most Metroid-inspired games have, too!). Some of the upgrades are similar to a few of the Castlevania games, where you have to collect five or six pieces to complete the upgrade to your health, power, etc.  Much like many Metroidvania games, there is a lot of exploration and backtracking. Unfortunately, unlike most of these kinds of games, there are no teleportation devices (like the ones in Castlevania games from Symphony of the Night onward). --At least none that I've found yet. I'm a good ways into the game, haven't finished it yet, but if I find any, I will update this review.-- Fortunately, most of the areas are interconnected and fairly easy to get to. It can get a bit tedious, but a lot of times you'll find more upgrades and items on the way, so that's a plus.  The difficulty is just right. Just what you'd expect from a retro-style game, quite challenging, but in this case, a tad forgiving. Death only means you get sent back to the previous save room, and you don't lose any items or upgrades you've found. Also, you can save at any time, technically, though you will start back at the last save room you used. This can work in your favor, and save you time in backtracking. And another great feature is that save rooms are often right next to a boss room, and that is fortuitous because many enemies are vicious, and the game almost "punishes" you for bad gameplay. Enemies will make quick mincemeat of you if you are not vigilant and careful, and enemies are EVERYWHERE. Remember how some rooms/areas in Super Metroid only had a dozen or so scattered throughout (some only had half that!)? Well, expect to see a crapload of enemies in this game. Everything is out to kill you, and kill you they will. Same goes for bosses. Which is why there's save rooms so close to boss rooms.  As far as the items, weaponry, etc, there is a lot of them, as I mentioned. Some will remind you of the games that inspired Mr. Happ as he created this game, while many are quite original. There's a few that will destroy certain obstacles, pass through walls, swing around much like Samus does with the grapple, and even change enemy behavior! Bosses will prove to be quite a challenge, as some weapons can do more damage, while sometimes only a specific one will be able to hit a boss's "weak spot." And as I mentioned before, you will die, A LOT, until you learn an enemy's patterns and attacks.  And let me tell you about the music.... oh, man. The music is pure chiptune goodness. I never really cared for chiptunes, to be honest, though I do love the old Castlevania and Metroid tunes, but preferably arranged (Sound in Action, anyone?). However, this soundtrack really pulls you in, with its dark, brooding themes and wonderful variations.  So far, I've got about 7-8 hours clocked on my current save, taking my time with this game, and thoroughly enjoying it. I highly recommend this game if you love Metroidvanias, or just want a great challenge. Axiom Verge has it all: fun gameplay, awesome visuals, a great storyline, and lots of challenging fights and puzzles. For the price of the game, it's a great value. And if you're looking for replayability, there's a speedrun mode as well, which challenges you to complete the game as quickly as possible while gathering all of the items. Good luck!  tl;dr: GET THIS GAME. That is all.
Date 2016-12-02 Playtime 17h 55m Rec Positive In a nutshell, if you liked Super Metroid, you'll love this. It's a testament to how much just one developer can create. When I first picked it up, I played for 3 hours until my eyes watered.  Pros:  * Lovingly crafted old-school aesthetic. * A bunch of neat weapons and mechanics. * Normal difficulty feels well-calibrated.  * Each world-zone has it's own background-music which works well even for long periods of time.  Cons:  * You'll probably want a gamepad. You can play it with a keyboard, but the game is based around two directional pads and 10 buttons that may be hard to manage. * Some weapons fall into the "cool, but outclassed by this other gun" category.  Spoiler-free Tips:  * If you find a small area of a room where your screen gets fuzzy but you can't figure out what it means, take a note of its location for later. * In each zone, you can set two custom waypoints on the map as reminders. * Two dots can appear in the top-left of your map-screen. A purple dot means all the squares are uncovered. A yellow dot means you've acquired all the items in that zone. A nice touch to prevent frustration.
Date 2016-12-02 Playtime 12h 44m Rec Positive Awesome game, a must have
Date 2016-12-02 Playtime 12h 40m Rec Positive In Axiom Verge you play as Trace, a science man.  You get a cool gun and can be a real bad dude.  Good: -Plays just like a more responsive super metroid -All of the pickups are somehow different to what's in super metroid -Has aliems -Loads of secrets -The map doesn't ever lie to you unless it's regarding areas you will definitely visit later. -Story is full of cool twists and isn't intrusive to the gameplay -Rad H R Giger pixel graphics -Rad bassy soundtrack  Bad: -Not many advanced techniques beyond abusing tele-drone jumps -Some of the guns are absolutely worthless (though the best ones are hidden well and worth hunting for) -I wish it was longer  This game is sick. One of the best metroidvania titles on steam. Go get it.
Date 2016-12-02 Playtime 53h 9m Rec Positive [h1]Abstract[/h1] Axiom Verge is a beautifully crafted experience that seems to have come into existence as a result of its creator's love for Super Metroid. Yes, that's right, creator is singular! A single individual, Thomas Happ, created all the art, music, story, dialogue, code, and all the other miscellaneous required elements of a game. While I don't think that's something that can be factored into a review necessarily, I will say that I find that incredibly impressive. I find myself inspired!  If you enjoyed Super Metroid, you would probably find this a lot of fun. The mechanics are similar in terms of movement, exploration, and progression. It's a truly solid 2d side-scrolling platformer.  [h1]Synopsis[/h1] The game opens to a small sequence featuring a scientist performing an experiment. Something goes wrong, and the building they're in collapses. This scientist is revealed to be the player, as the focus shifts to the same man awakening in an alien room, having been enclosed in an egg-like machine. A voice speaks out to you from an unknown origin, and it names you: "Trace".  After some initial dialogue, the game sets you loose to complete your initial objectives and get yourself comfortable with how the game operates. As you complete your objectives and explore the dangerous paths from point to point, you'll reveal more about the strangely organic alien world. Are the machines biological, or is the life here machine-based? What are the implications of some of the characters' appearances and motivations? It will be revealed to you in time, as you fight your way through a hostile planet to find your purpose here.  [h1]Movement & Controls[/h1] The movement of your player is vitally important in a game like this. You need to be able to interface very strongly with the game to accurately control your player and the weapon(s) they may be using to interact with the environment and fight the aggressively hostile enemies. Patience is a virtue here, as with other games like Super Metroid, where being brazen and reckless will result in your quick death. Watching how your foes move and respond and predicting their actions will benefit you greatly.  The controls themselves are simple, and very responsive. Once you understand the functions of the inputs, you can often use them to their full potential immediately.  [h1]Game Mechanics & Progression[/h1] The progression in this game comes in the form of items and weapons, which I'll refer to jointly as 'tools'. These tools will help you remove enemies blocking your path, eliminate obstacles in your way, and create new weaknesses in the environment and foes for you to exploit more easily. You're offered large areas to explore, but there is one correct route that will yield you a new tool. This new tool will demonstrate its utility to you immediately, and you'll remember an area you thought was impassable. It may no longer be!  The first time I played this game, I found it performed exceedingly well at surprising me with new mobility upgrades. I had been mentally noting locations that I might be able to come back to with new tools, but some of the tools so fundamentally changed how I navigate the environments that I was caught by surprise several times and needed to revisit some areas to see if there was a new path present. There often was.  [h1]Environments, Sound & Music[/h1] The environment created by the developer in this game is excellent. Each zone has a unique feel to it, matching its purpose in the game world, and each room within has a carefully designed atmosphere within the zone.  The fact that it was all made by a single person becomes clear over time, as the thematic elements of each zone become unified in the music, tile art, and background art alike. The soundtrack immediately became one of my favorite game soundtracks in recent history, particularly the songs that play when [spoiler]you enter the 'temple' area[/spoiler] and [spoiler]in the final climb to the boss[/spoiler]. I'm listening to the soundtrack now, actually! And not just because I'm writing this review :)  If you, like me, are prone to getting tunnel vision in games like this, where you hyper-focus on the mechanical elements and grow somewhat blind to the actual audiovisual elements presented... I highly encourage you to periodically 'stop and smell the roses' by listening to the music and examining the background art in some of the rooms as you move about. It's worth it!  [h1]Difficulty[/h1] Axiom Verge is mechanically challenging. Even on its lower difficulty settings, bosses are not a trivial matter. But, this game is in no way unfair! I find that the distinction between fairness and difficulty is an incredibly important one to make, and while this game may be difficult, it is not unfair. You always have the ability to analyse an enemy and find its weakness. You always have the ability to be patient and careful in your movement to evade incoming attacks. I find that I'm sometimes an impatient gamer, and most of the times I died while fighting enemies in this game, it was purely due to my recklessness, or my greed demanding I take another few shots at the boss before it enters its firing phase.  This game has difficulty options present when you start the game. I almost universally select 'Normal' and enjoy a single playthrough at the 'average' difficulty, so I don't drown out the story or environmental elements with the mechanical complexity in a game. After I finished my 'Normal' playthrough of Axiom Verge, though, I immediately went again for a 'Hard' run. I had enjoyed exploring the environment so much in 'Normal' that I had obtained 100% of the tools available. I tried going through in 'Hard' while getting as few tools as possible, and it was a significant challenge initially. I later felt like I had an excellent mastery of the controls as a result.  [h1]Performance & Technical Aspects[/h1] Technically, this game is very solid. I experienced no obvious instances of the game malfunctioning or causing me to lose progress or resources by failure of the medium. Pretty much all errors were mine.  I wish to make a special note about this game that may be considered a spoiler. I'll enclose it in spoiler tags here for you to look at later. If you find the game may be malfunctioning in some way or are concerned that your computer is not running it properly, [spoiler]you should be made aware of the fact that it may be intentional. This game will present several effects to the player that seem like traditional glitches or malfunctions in video games, but they are intentionally presented in this game. Unless they're directly impacting your ability to play the game, please persist and see if you can discover what's going on![/spoiler]  Performance-wise, I had no problems running it. It's a very graphically simple game with no 3D elements to speak of, as I can recall. I think any relatively modern non-gaming computer could probably run this game with no trouble.  [h1]Conclusion[/h1] This has to be one of my favorite games in my collection. I really enjoyed playing through it not once, but twice, and experiencing the challenges it offered. I thought it was difficult initially, but grew much easier over time as I got used to the play style and the controls.  I would highly recommend this game to anybody who had fun with Super Metroid or similar games (Cave Story might apply!). I'm incredibly impressed with Thomas Happ, and very glad he decided to put his time and effort into this experience. Thanks!
Date 2016-12-02 Playtime 10h 49m Rec Positive Though it has different gadgets and a different world/story, this is Metroid in all but name. But that's not a bad thing at all. In fact, it does everything you'd expect from a great Metroid game: wide open exploration of a weird alien planet, an assortment of an usual weapons and gadgets, challenging but not impossible boss battles. It's all here. Definitely recommend.
Date 2016-12-01 Playtime 31h 34m Rec Positive i have to admit - i had some doubts spending quite a bit of coin for this one, and now i'd say bluntly: i feel like i've paid too little. Axiom Verge excels at every level of it's design.  the graphics is superbly set in it's 8-bit setting, while creating disturbingly alien, biomechanical and surprisingly alive world, looking like it was drawn directly from Giger's, or Beksinski's sketchbook. and all of that accompanied by disturbing, and well placed music, increasing feeling of alien, broken world, where everything gone wrong.  but it all plaes, when gameplay mechanics kick in. there are many weapons, but surprisingly, those are not the most important part of the game. there are TONS of upgrades, weird artifacts, alternative ways, hidden passages, and even way to HACK REALITY ITSELF. you'll find all the things you'd possibly want to help you find those little secrets game tries to hide - teleportation, drones, grappling hooks... and the best thing is - you won't mind any of the backtracking, so fast you'll be addicted to finding all secrets. and those are really challenging to find, and often require to think outside the box.  the only thing i didn't like about this game is it's lack of sequel. seriously. this game is so addicting, i want another one. ant maybe another one. and maybe few more. no - a lot more.  final verdict:  BUY IT. NOW. then convince all your friends and family members to do so. then make them, to covinceall their friends an family members to do so, and repeat  until every person on the planet played it.
Date 2016-12-01 Playtime 23h 25m Rec Positive A very fun game that takes some of the best aspects of the metroidvania genre and puts them together to create a fantastic experience.
Date 2016-12-01 Playtime 11h 1m Rec Positive Ce jeu est une perle, il m'a aidé a comblé le vide que Nintendo a laissé dans mon coeur avec l'absence de nouveau Metroid. Il reprend bien les codes de la saga mais dans un univers dérangeant qui arrive à se démarquer de son modèle avec une ambiance cybernétique et une histoire simple mais intelligente. Et ce charme retro <3 tant au niveau des environnements que des musiques vraiment géniales. Si les armes ne sont pas toutes très utiles, elles ont au moins le mérite d'être nombreuses et de permettre au joueur de choisir son style. Les diverses améliorations sont quand à elles très bien pensées et ne sont pas un simple copier-coller de ce qu'on trouve dans Metroid ou encore dans Castlevania. La difficulté est assez bien dosé tout au long de l'aventure mais offre quand même un pic en s'approchant de la fin.   Jeu créé par une seule personne ! Chapeau ! Franchement si vous avez aimé les Metroid voir le style Metroidvania, foncez !
Date 2016-12-01 Playtime 27h 34m Rec Positive Heavily influenced by the original Metroid but manages to make it unique enough to stand out in its own right.  Clever alternatives to industry standards such as "double Jump" keeps the experience unpredictable and exciting. a few of the collectables are very obscure and will likely need a guide but the main story arc was great. 9/10
Date 2016-12-01 Playtime 12h 28m Rec Positive The graphics and effects of this were truly an inspired throwback to the oldschool consoles... sprites glitching in and out, changing colors... and to build in mechanics that made it part of the game? Oh that's just brilliant.   I've yet to find a modern metroidvania game that doesn't seem short and linear compared to the SNES and PS1 era ones, and this is no exception. Still, good game.
Date 2016-12-01 Playtime 41h 4m Rec Negative The Developer pretty much slapped Steam and Steam users in the face.  This game became successful BECAUSE OF STEAM AND ITS USER REVIEWS.  As it should be since it's a great game.  Then it comes out for multiple platforms as it deserves.  Axiom Verge 2 gets released on EPIC Exclusively and Nintendo switch...  STEAM IS THE REASON YOU WERE EVEN ABLE TO MAKE A PART 2.  YOU SIR, ARE A PIECE OF #$&^   Don't you dare say "I had to because the money was better."  You would've made plenty of money releasing on every platform at once but you chose greed and to ignore the very reason of your success.
Date 2016-12-01 Playtime 16h 9m Rec Positive メトロイドヴァニア系のゲームが好きならかなりオススメできます。 翻訳に関しても公式で日本語化されていますのでご安心を。  探索が重視されたデザインで武器やアイテム集めに没頭していたタイプの方には好まれると思います。 雰囲気も不気味でホラー感漂う世界観ではありますが、SAN値チェックが必要になる場面はありません。  また、アクションの難易度も低めで、パワーアップアイテムをきちんと回収していれば大体のボスはゴリ押しできます。 しかもボス手前では必ずセーブポイントが用意されているのでリトライが多い方にも安心です。  ただ、武器の種類が豊富でありますが使い勝手が良いのは極僅かなのが残念。  なお、クリア時にはタイムと死亡回数、アイテム回収率などが表示されます。
Date 2016-11-30 Playtime 1h 37m Rec Negative I really wanted to get into this game I love the look of the art, sound of the music, gameplay feels tight but... everytime I try to play it, it makes me feel very very sick. I would not reccomend this to anyone who can very easily get sick from games or get motion sick.
Date 2016-11-30 Playtime 24h 54m Rec Positive Nintendo took too long to make a real Metroid title, so a hero stepped in to do an even better job. To fellow Metroid fans, Axiom Verge provides as tasteful and nostalgic an experience as it could possibly get. Contains enough deviation and creative design to feel like a brand new Metroid title, and not some knockoff ROMhack. 10/10.
Date 2016-11-30 Playtime 8h 45m Rec Positive Great game for that Metroidvania itch, though it may be a tad short for a casual playthrough it offers quite a bit of replayability and makes you want to get that 100%.  Here's hoping for Axiom Verge 2!
Date 2016-11-30 Playtime 38h 38m Rec Positive I had 14 hours of pure fun and I will definitely play it again. Anyone who likes Metroid, Mega Man, etc. - get this game!
Date 2016-11-29 Playtime 12h 21m Rec Positive Best newly made metrovania I've played to date.
Date 2016-11-29 Playtime 38h 39m Rec Positive Metroidvania games are my quirk - I can't get enough of them.  This one hit the spot perfectly.  It's like the love child of Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  If you like that kind of game, this one is perfect for you - worth it even at full price.  If you don't, it's still an excelent game in its own right, and worth it for a play through if you can get it on sale.
Date 2016-11-29 Playtime 9h 44m Rec Positive Metroid is dead... or is it? Axiom Verge captures the spirit of this classic 2D title perfectly while adding much needed tweaks to gameplay and setting the action in a bio-mechanical world reminiscent of the works of H.R.Giger. Oh, and the soundtrack is basically the greatest thing ever. Seriously.
Date 2016-11-29 Playtime 35h 28m Rec Positive Vraiment un bon jeu. J'ai adoré du début à la fin. Certains "tableaux" sont plus difficile à cerner que d'autres. Je le recommande à tous les gens qui aiment le genre "Metroidvania"
Date 2016-11-29 Playtime 18h 37m Rec Positive steam平台最具银河战士风格游戏没有之一，武器丰富度和地图探索性爆表。不过这次我没全收集，主要是由于地图太大，没传送点，你不能飞怪物血厚伤害高跑酷不方便，不过其实最大的原因是我懒。（想全收集可以看看社区指南）  说说不满意的地方吧。游戏流程难度不高，普通难度下中后期甚至可以一路莽过去。但是前期血少的时候比较蛋疼，怪物伤害高血厚，打起来略有点吃力，减少了些许爽快感；很多boss战设计比较弱智，甚至某看起来凶猛异常的家伙可以蹲下来无伤打死；抓钩设定蛋疼，操作手感特别差，摆动动作似乎只有4帧动画，看起来很别扭。  我觉得除了上述几点不太好以外基本上没什么缺点了。毕竟是一个人做的游戏，能做的这么出色真的不容易。  9/10
Date 2016-11-29 Playtime 14h 53m Rec Positive Solid Metroidvania title.  Several powerups are very reminiscent of Samus' abilities, such as the ball and grappling hook.  I think this game strikes a good balance between hand-holding and actually having dialogue to drive a story.  Ending a little ambigious, but defintely gives you something to think about.  The wide variety of weapons promises a chance of replayability, but I tended to gravitate towards a couple weapon choices, as they just seemed better. Strongly recommended for people who want to run around, blast enemies, and navigate terrain using a increasing set of abilities.
Date 2016-11-29 Playtime 22h 19m Rec Positive Axiom Verge has alot of in common with Nintendo's old title "Metroid" and the retro graphics style plays along just fine.  It's hard to believe that only 1 person, Tom Happ, has created Axiom Verge in such notably great quality. Excellent soundtracks, well designed levels, encounters and bosses. More than that, this sci-fi 2D platformer comes with a dystopian story and surreal settings that keep up a pleasant tension.  Open world exploration is fairly free in Axiom Verge. Quite some people might prefer to play the game with a walkthrough page. Yes, the game is considerably complex. Things that give the impression of a glitch reveal as part of the game mechanics with some very surprising moments.  I haven't found any major bug or error. Gameplay is very smooth and captivating, challenging. There was nothing that I could consider truely negative.  All in all, it's an amazing hommage to retro games and worth every minute playing - a "must have" for fans of the so called metroidvania genre.
Date 2016-11-29 Playtime 9h 53m Rec Positive Awesome gameplay and radical soundtrack! This game will tickle your metroidvania bone to the max! Steady game progression will keep you hooked and a pumping soundtrack will have you humming the tunes while driving around in your Camaro. Its mindblowing graphics will totally melt your brain into a puddle of retrogoo.  GRAPHICS       SOUND        CONTROL        FUN FACTOR      CHALLENGE 4.5/5                 5/5               4.5/5                  5/5                     ADV.
Date 2016-11-29 Playtime 23h 47m Rec Positive I am a Metroid player.  Metroid accompanied me through many long, lonely, and desolate hours...until I got a girlfriend.  And then, I often preferred Metroid to her.  I tried to continue the relationship, but the Super Nintendo version wasn't as good as the original, and neither were the Wii versions.    Axiom Verge is better than the original.    The dev is faithful, while being more complex and more fun.  The dev understands that exploration is a different pursuit than fetch questing.  The dev understands that exploring an alien world is about an immersive mood.  The most pleasing thing is that the game demands a freshness of mind that erodes after long hours of gaming.  When a game is limited to fetch quests, checking boxes, or grinding, you can go all night and make "progress".  In Axiom Verge, a tired mind misses the linkages between the protagonist's explanding capabilities and the demands of the in-game environment. OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE 
Date 2016-11-29 Playtime 8h 10m Rec Positive I love how more and more developers are running away from top notch GFX, latest technologies or full 3D enviorements and just go with tradicional features with the likes of gaming roots.  Axiom Verge will soon remind the player about Metroid game and NES style sound effects and graphics with todays vision of games.  It is impossible to give a bad review to this game even if weren't my cup of tea because the product here is just plain awesome.
Date 2016-11-28 Playtime 8h 12m Rec Positive super metroidvania, vraiment sympa pour les nostalgiques !!
Date 2016-11-28 Playtime 11h 27m Rec Positive 10/10 will be coming back again and again for those [spoiler] sideburns [/spoiler]
Date 2016-11-28 Playtime 15h 13m Rec Positive I can recommend this for fans of Metroidvania games.   The difficulty might be a bit rough at first, but you'll get used to it. This is not a game for people who want the next step pointed out for them, since you need to explore and experiment with your abilities to figure out where to go most of the time.   I also recommend using a gamepad to play it.
Date 2016-11-28 Playtime 7h 52m Rec Positive damn this game is awesome
Date 2016-11-28 Playtime 20h 5m Rec Positive Awesome homage to the Metroid franchise. A must-have for all Metroid fans!
Date 2016-11-28 Playtime 14h 59m Rec Positive Checks off every box in the metroidvania design manual.
Date 2016-11-28 Playtime 23h 5m Rec Positive rare videogame made by 1 person.. it's a bit difficult and you will get lost eventually, but it's worth it.
Date 2016-11-28 Playtime 15h 10m Rec Positive If you like Metroid, you should like this game. But even if it looks and feels like Metroid it's something else. First of all, you find different weapons, which seems usefull in different locations but useless at another location, so you change your weapon based on the area you are. Its not a rock-paper-scissor system, that some weapons do more damage on monster X or Y, its just that you can hit these monsters better when you use the right weapon at the right place.  The settings feels different from metroid, it feels more like turrican. The areas and the enemies are strange and unknown it just feels like another planet. And with the music in the background the game is realy great.  What a i miss a bit, are given mapmarkers. So that the game tells you that you should visit this spot. This doesnt mean that you get a Navigation system that tells you, take this portal walk that way. It means that it jsut marks a spot on your map and you have to find your way to it.  The graphic is made like the 16Bit era, so the game looks like, how it should look like. It's relative detailed and the animations are okay.  Result:  Gameplay 8/10 (-2 for missing map markers and the clunky grappling hook) Sound 7/10 (it works, but it's the same hurt soundfile for the different sizes of monsters) Music 10/10 Graphic 9/10 (realy detailed, animations okay, settings atmospheric)  85%
Date 2016-11-28 Playtime 27h 16m Rec Positive What a brilliant game.  Clearly an homage to Metroid/Super Metroid, but with more story (even more than Metroid Fusion). The upgrades are unique and with the plot line help to seperate Axiom from Metroid to make it stand on its own. Waiting for a sequal!
Date 2016-11-28 Playtime 13h 24m Rec Positive Finally, a metriodvania game that doesn't disappoint.  It was fun and challenging plus worked great with a PS3 controller using ScpToolkit.
Date 2016-11-28 Playtime 14h 5m Rec Positive If you enjoyed sidescrolling Metroid, you will very likely enjoy this game. I know I did!
Date 2016-11-28 Playtime 31h 18m Rec Positive The only good thing about this game is absolutely everything.  Play it!
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 7h 13m Rec Positive There's really no way to write this review without mentioning Nintendo's "Metroid". While many games have spawned from the platforming exploration genre it defined, few have been as true and accurate of a love letter as Axiom Verge. This is not to say that Axiom Verge is a rip-off. Not by any means! If anything, it's a tribute that knows exactly what made Metroid great, and pays homage to those elements.  The title starts in typical fashion with an extremely large (and unforgiving) world/map that you can only access scraps of, at the game's beginning. Each navigation item acquired opens up more of the map, until eventually the player feels like a space ninja, with nothing out of their reach or bounds.  On the topic of navigation and exploration, Axiom Verge is much more true to its roots than many recent titles in the genre. There's no color coded doors or blocks. When you get an item that expands your ability to traverse the landscape, it's on YOU (the player) to figure out or remember where said item can be applied. While this can result in a bit of frustration and backtracking, I found it to feel a lot more satisfying.  As for other factors:  * The graphics are great (Pixel art, but with very intricate and detailed designs) * Music is phenomenal (the game does a great job of capturing the feeling of isolation and an alien environment through the insturment choice and composition.) * The story was really enjoyable for me (A lot of things are left unresolved, but done so tastefully as to keep the player thinking about it long after beating the game. Lots of great worldbuilding, and plenty of room for a hopeful sequel.) * Gameplay in general is also great. (Fairly fast paced, good flow of enemy and platforming difficulty, with some real fun boss fights)  The best way I can really put it is that Axiom Verge is quite frankly the best "Metroid" game to come out in quite some time. (Not Metroidvania, Metroid. Thomas Happ is doing the genre better than Nintendo themselves at this point.) The elements of the Metroidvania genre (platforming, exploration, gatekeeping through items) are handled in a superb manner, and the game has enough personality to be memorable, standing apart on its own. For anyone who is remotely a fan of the genre (especially of the earlier NES and SNES titles) I can't recommend this title enough.
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 0h 16m Rec Negative Terrible/nonexistant controller support despite declaring otherwise, for a fucking METROIDVANIA game. Good jerb.
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 15h 7m Rec Positive If you love Metroid, you're gonna love getting lost in this game
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 20h 9m Rec Positive Good game well worth 20 $ and if u get it on sale, thats golden!!....makes me nostalgic for Metorid
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 26h 6m Rec Positive It's good.
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 13h 34m Rec Positive Very Good Game! If you are a fan of the metroid and castlevania series you will get sucked into this game. It has a huge map and many differnt weopons and equipment. My only hope is that there may be a sequel in the future. Try it you wont be dissaointed!
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 10h 5m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is one of the higher quality Metroidvania games out there, but ultimately suffers from the result of being a one-man show.  While I generally like the gieger asthetic, I wish there was a bit more color variety, as you end up looking at a very monochromatic scene at all times and it's often not clear what is a platform or background decoration. This is the reason I put off buying it for so long, the art is like very early NES when they didn't understand how to make tiles correctly.  But the main thing I think needs improvement here is the game will take you about 12 hours to complete, of which 6 hours is wandering around being lost. This could have been mitigated with a fast travel system or something but constant aimless navigation gets old fast, and the game is much worse for it (you'll get sick of the fantastic music first). Even SOTN had a teleporter.  If you just want to play the good bits, I would recommend the text-only walkthrough somebody has a steam guide here. I resorted to this after I realized I was no longer having fun and wish I would have started with it.  That being said, it's clearly a labor of love by the developer. Which it turns out is just one guy, Tom Happ, who did all the art, programming, music, and level design. It's incredibly impressive that he pulled it off, it explains why so much of it seemed under-developed to me. That being said it is worth it if you can pick it up on sale.
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 0h 21m Rec Positive Игра, в которой органично присутвуют пиксели и 8-битные сигналы вместо речи. Сама концепция к этому подталкивает и вызывает приступы ностальгии, а не отвращения. Геймплей и дизайн родом из тех самых первых платформеров с биомеханическим антуражен. Музыка и сюжет удачно всё это дело обрамляют. Можно смело рекомендовать даже тем, кто не застал подобного на заре игростроя.
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 57h 7m Rec Positive The best Metroid style game available. Fascinating universe, compelling story, solid platforming with incredibly fun mechanics and great variety.   Where this truly sets itself apart is the sense of discovery in Axiom Verge is satisfying. Everything you find means something. Totally nails the exploration aspect of this genre. Pick this up.
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 18h 57m Rec Positive Metroid mal anders. Und das wichtigste, es ist für PC Tolle Fähigkeiten / Waffen. Schöne Sprites. Teils gruselige Story.  Alle 5 Daumen hoch. ^^
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 22h 33m Rec Positive fühle mich gleich 30 Jahre jünger
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 33h 8m Rec Positive I don't write reviews often and when I do they are short and sweet.  This one deserves it. I love this game, it returns me to my childhood and along with that precious sense of nostalgia comes a curiosity of a brand new world that I'd have never imagined with an interesting storyline that left me wanting more.   Thomas Happ has done a truly astounding job polishing this masterpiece and I want to thank him personally from the bottom of my heart for having made this game just so playable and fun. I feel like that is rare these days.  From the first boss fight to the last I crapped my balls each time. I recommend this for anyone who loves a good metroidvania style game. You will not be disappointed!
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 27h 57m Rec Positive A psychedelic version of the classic Super Metroid. 
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 30h 12m Rec Positive Without a doubt my favorite indie game from 2015.  The glaring similarities to Metroid that many before me have mentioned is actually a selling point, especially since it's different enough to be less of a clone and more of a love-letter to fans of the series. It's just fun.
Date 2016-11-27 Playtime 12h 13m Rec Positive Awesome Metroidvania with lots of really interesting ideas, fantastic Creature- and Art-Design and some of the best and "bass'est" Bit-Sounds in recent memory - srsly, the soundtrack is pure gold! Would hack again.
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 20h 36m Rec Positive This game reminds me a lot of Super Metroid, which I played through when I was younger. It has a good feel to the platforming and interesting scenery. I haven't finished yet but the story is interesting and there are some really cool weapons to unlock.
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 49h 10m Rec Positive I could say a bunch of stuff here about how I grew up in the '80s and this game is a nostalgia bomb for me. I could say a bunch of stuff about how it would have absolutely rocked the gaming world back then if the hardware could've supported it, with its sprawling worlds, titanic boss fights, multitudinous weaponry, and secrets aplenty.  I would be right in saying those things, but to do so would be to diminish it in today's world of first-person shooters, 3D graphics, and oversaturated retro genre.  The simple fact about this complex game: it is absolutely amazing, whether you grew up in the '80s or in the '00s. Everything about this game is fantastically done, from the faithful Metroid-style artwork to the haunting electronic soundtrack to the fascinating storyline to the sense of balance you get from every upgrade. Even the ending is satisfying and doesn't feel rushed. Nothing about the game feels tired or rehashed...just familiar, like visiting your childhood neighborhood for the first time in 30 years.  None of the 20 main weapons feels overpowered, even the ones you find late in the game, and every one caters to a certain play style. No enemy is frustratingly difficult to kill, though some of them are -very- challenging. The maps will challenge your sense of exploration even as you go back through them to net that elusive 100% item completion rank.  I can't say enough good about Axiom Verge, but I will say this:  Tom Happ, please keep making games, because you've crafted a masterpiece with this one, and I can't wait to see what's next.
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 12h 38m Rec Positive If you were afraid that the Metroidvania genre was dead, have no fear for this game is proof that it is alive and well. The gameplay is everything and more than the metroid games I loved as a kid. Some of the puzzles are not incredibly clear and you may seem like you're stuck, but I actually enjoy the lack of hand holding, which resulted in me essentially going in circles for a couple hours looking for something I missed. Lots of hidden items, and enough weapons for multiple games keeps things interesting.
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 7h 35m Rec Positive Quite delightful retro platformer. I was hoping it'd be less linear but many of the upgrades are fresh and original.
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 21h 29m Rec Positive What can i say about this game? The atmosphere, the gameplay, the music, the arts, just amazing. The levels are challenging, the difficulty is not too easy but not too hard to play. 10/10 Played straight 10 hours.
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 17h 37m Rec Positive Excellent gameplay. Excellent music. Excellent challenge.  Praise Athetos.
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 4h 13m Rec Positive Ощущение будто я попал в сон из которого не могу выбраться...
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 30h 52m Rec Positive Going beyond the obvious similarities to the 2-D Metroid series, Axiom Verge evolves where Nintendo dropped the ball. New mechanics and ideas to the genre and an extremely in-depth and layered storyline that will make you question your motives.  Before long, you'll stop comparing this to being a Metroid successor, and see that it holds up on it's own as an amazing game, and is so much more than what it's inspired by.   Props to Thomas Happ, the sole creator of this game. Easily worth the full price and would highly recommend to any retro gamer or fan of exploration and creepy atmosphere.   
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 11h 11m Rec Positive Brutal metroid like. Armas guapisimas, mapeado muy currado, enemigos dificiles. En general un juegazo.
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 23h 47m Rec Positive A hidden gem for the fans of the classic 2D Metroid games.  It is similar of every aspect: level design, upgrades, puzzles, secrets, exploration, retro graphics & sounds combined with modern effects and a very satisfying character progression. I haven't played with the keyboard but the controls with the gamepad is amazingly responsive.      Tip: The game doesn't hold your hand and the beginning might feel frustrating. You give up early - the story ends, you quit the game and believe whatever you want to believe. You find your first tool and weapon - you stay in wonderland, and the game shows you how deep the rabbit hole goes. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 4h 18m Rec Positive Excellent game still did not finished the game as I was playing AM2R. Looking foward to finishing this game so far so good. great controls and graphics. Great music and soundtrack. 
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 13h 42m Rec Positive The best Metroid game since Metroid
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 9h 4m Rec Positive [h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine [/h1]  Axiom Verge is a game developed and published by Thomas Happ Games LLC. Right off the bat, it's easy to tell that this game was influenced by Nintendo's Metroid. There is a very minimal story and the gameplay is like all Metroidvania style games, lots of backtracking but the visuals and music are well produced and enjoyable to play  Axiom Verge is a challenging yet fun and enjoyable to play  [h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1] [i] Also, best to play with a controller [/i]
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 14h 29m Rec Positive A huge work has been put into this game. Its a masterpiece that every metroidvania fan should play. Definitely recommended.
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 30h 29m Rec Positive I SAW METROIDVANIA IN THE TAGS, THEN I BOUGHT THIS GAME  AND IT WAS WORTH IT
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 16h 21m Rec Positive This game is the hidden gem of metroidvania i have long been searching for
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 43h 38m Rec Positive Questo gioco è l'ideale per chi cerca qualcosa simile ai metroid in 2D di qualche anno fa: la grafica ricorda quella del GBA, la mappa grande, piena di luoghi da esplorare e piena di segreti, ci sono tante armi e tanti boss da sconfiggere. Sarà che a me questo genere piace, ma credo sia uno dei giochi più sottovalutati che io abbia mai giocato ed è davvero un peccato che così poche persone l'abbiano provato. Credo onestamente che questo gioco meriti più della maggior parte dei giochi di oggi. Sono assolutamente soldi ben spesi.
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 21h 0m Rec Positive This game was amazing. Great music, tons of weapons, fair challenge and being an 80s kid I love older looking games that play like metroid. Really hope there is a sequel or a similar game is created. Buy this game if you enjoy NES/SNES era metroid type games, you will not be disappointed.
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 20h 29m Rec Positive Лучший из платформеров, что я видел со времен знакомства с Metroid и Mega Man!  Игрушка сделана с большой любовью, это чувствуется во всем, в деталях по геймдизайну, в музыке, персонажах и общей атмосфере. Много реминисценций, но и открытий шквал будет, даже для искушенных игроков, на мой взгляд. В любом случае это что-то уникальное. И огромное спасибо разработчику за крутую биомеханику! 10/10
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 13h 7m Rec Positive De los mejores metroidvanias que he jugado, 100% recomendable
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 32h 14m Rec Positive Such a well crafted game! Easily up there as one of my favorite games :) Im a huge Metroid fan so Axiom Verge really strikes a chord with me, and it was SO worth the price!
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 24h 29m Rec Positive This is an absolutly amazing game with a crazy mindfrack of a story that is super deep and keeps you wanting to know more about the world you have somehow ended up in.  Gameplay is awesome, Music is super awesome and original and goes great with the game universe.  Only thing that can make this game better is a sequel Axiom Verge 2 please!
Date 2016-11-26 Playtime 19h 7m Rec Positive Awesome metriodvania game!
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 34h 44m Rec Positive Platform exploring game with a compelling story, some cool weapons, a tool to modify some enemies and environment. Story can be dived into a little more by finding and reading notes that are scattered throughout the world.  Exploring doesn't get tedious since most rooms are unique and there are hints in the environment around. It doesn't have a lot of backtracking either. Progress is made by finding new weapons and items that enables more exploring.  Awesome soundtrack.  Cool boss fights.  World design could have been better, it lacks memorable scenery. At least each world has its own unique style.  My old usb gamepad was a little tricky to get working with this game, might try again once I get a new controller.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 52h 52m Rec Positive This is by far and without a doubt the closest modern day game to Super Metroid. That's enough said. There are a lot of 'metroidvania, 2d, sidescrolling, action platformers' out there but this is [u]THE[/u] METROIDVANIA 2D SIDESCROLLING ACTION PLATFORMER. What an incredible game.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 12h 12m Rec Positive I really enjoyed this game. The music and sound effects really tied it together. I thought the story and amount of dialogue was perfect. Still so good.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 15h 43m Rec Positive Best indie game in the world.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 17h 29m Rec Positive Very nice. If you like metroidvania this is a must have.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 11h 17m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a metroidvania style game that follows the formula to a T. The game has minimal handholding, letting you explore to your hearts content. It'll often dangle rooms or power ups in areas that seem just out of reach, burning that area in your memory until you come back with that one power up you need to reach it. There's a wide variety of weapons allowing for different strategies for each boss and area or just straight changing up how you play each area. The world is large with plenty of secrets that'll keep most item hunters and speed runners busy.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 15h 5m Rec Positive Very cool indeed.  For fans of Metroid
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 6h 10m Rec Positive It's visually stunning.  It's hard but not facemelting.   The soundtrack is wonderful.  It's what you want out of a metroidvania.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 16h 19m Rec Positive I consider Super Metroid to be one finest games ever made. Axiom Verge not only manages to recreate the magic of Super Metroid but in many ways surpass it.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 16h 26m Rec Positive Amazing side scrolling shooter
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 0h 25m Rec Negative This game is buggy as hell on a game pad. Can't switch weapons without wildly spamming around the joysticks. Couldn't fire my weapon after I got the drill. Really don't want to play this with a keyboard so I'm done.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 6h 27m Rec Positive 메트로이드의 추억을 다시 한번
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 11h 5m Rec Positive Great metroidvania.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 21h 55m Rec Positive Nominated for "Whoooaaaaaaa, Dude!" award.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 14h 2m Rec Positive Metroidvanias are some of my favorite kinds of games but it seems really hard for devs to really nail the feel and playability of Super Metroid or Castilvania SOTN. Axiom Verge really scratches that itch. The game is paced well, the items feel powerful and the story is pretty cool. The only thing I found kinda lacking was the boss fights are just too easy.   Axiom Verge is a must play for any fan of the metroidvania genre.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 46h 44m Rec Positive лично для меня эта игра превзошла самого метройда. 12 топовых атмосфер из 10
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 12h 38m Rec Positive Fun and challenging. Exploring is fun, except those times when you're like I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE TO GO AND I'VE CHECKED EVERYWHERE.   I haven't played Super Metroid, but this plays very similarly. If you like that game, you will love this.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 13h 3m Rec Positive One of the best Metroidvania games to come along.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 1h 57m Rec Positive Very challenging, recommend it to speed runners
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 4h 21m Rec Positive When I first played this game, I thought to myself, "cool. Another Metroidvania game. This could be fun to play sometimes I don't think I'll get too attached, though." The second time I played this game, I couldn't stop until I was done with it and then some. I went back and completed it, found all the items and secrets, delved into the numerous theories floating around the Internet. I needed more. The deeper I got into it, the more it took its place as my favorite video game that I've ever laid my hands on. I've never purchased a single game for every console that I own so fast before. One of my favorite things about this game is just the artistical aspect of it all--the attacks are beautifully animated, and the environments all have their own feel for each area. The pixel art is well-crafted and isn't at all distracting from the action you're putting Trace through; in fact, it makes it that much more immersive when you're fighting off a boss at least 5 times the size of you. The fights are relatively simple, but each boss has its own weak point like the good old days, and you don't have to spend hours trying to figure out what to do to land a hit. Which is awesome. There are so many weapons scattered around, you can pick and choose your play style, and use the best weapon that you like most. Not every weapon is required to beat the game or certain enemies. The secrets scattered around the game definitely help add to the story events that lead up to Axiom Verge's story that you play through, and there were a lot of moments where I genuinely had to sit back and question the things that I was told in black and white. I've never played a game that kept me awake for 3 days continuously poring over information trying desperately to find out what actually happened in certain instances, and that's a damn good sign. Considering that this was crafted by Tom alone, this game shines in many ways, and if you grew up on the good old games like Metroid like I did, this will not only be a blast from the past, it'll keep you wanting a sequel in the future.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 18h 58m Rec Positive If you like Metroid, you will love this game. Tip: the music is great so buy the package deal to get the soundtrack at a super cheap price.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 28h 11m Rec Positive Do you like Metroid? Do you like platformers? Do you like awesome soundtracks?  If you answered no to all of the above, buy Axiom Verge. If you answered yes to any of the above, I assume you already own it.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 11h 20m Rec Positive One of my favorite games i've ever purchased. It presents a refreshing Metroidvania game in which you find numerous weapons that you can use in creative and fun ways. On top of it all plenty of secrets to find, with great difficulty levels, bosses, and story.
Date 2016-11-25 Playtime 13h 19m Rec Positive Overall: Axiom Verge is an excellent Metroidvania, worth the price of admission.  It feels more like Super Metroid than SotN, so if you're a bigger fan of the Metroid parts ofa  Metroidvania then Axiom Verge is right up your alley.  Pros: * The story presentation is a nice change on the typical "save the the world" trope commonly seen in the Metroidvania genre. * Your character controls very well. * There are a plethora of powerups and weapons to be discovered. * The world is large enough to feel "big" without being so large that navigation is time consuming.  Cons: * Many of the weapons are not very useful, or are only useful in very specific circumstances. * The environments have a sense of sameness after a while. * The boss fights can feel a little gimmick-y.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 13h 59m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a lovingly crafted "metroidvania"-style 2D action adventure; a genre that hasn't received a lot of love lately. It is set in a alien world and has a bunch of neat pixel art and great music.  It borrows gameplay elements from various old school games and even adds a few new tricks into the mix to really open up the movement possibilities  later in the game and make you re-think and see places you have already visited in a new light. It has minor flaws, such as some of the acquired weapons feel a bit useless compared to others and some areas are more memorable in design or have better music tracks, but nothing I would consider deal breaking.  Absolutely recommended if you can appreciate a game that gives you a vague idea where to go but doesn't hold hands all the time; one that is built around backtracking and exploration.  ps. Nominated this for the "I THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS COOL BEFORE IT WON AN AWARD" award.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 19h 54m Rec Positive They say that Axiom Verge is the result of a fever dream H.R. Geiger had after playing Super Metroid for an entire week. I say, those people are drunk. But it makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 9h 27m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a beautifully crafted action adventure platformer that takes a lot of inspiration from the Metroid franchise while, at the same time, adding it's own unique flare to the genre. Through it's art direction, creature designs and music, the atmosphere is nailed creating an all around stunning experience and a lasting impression on the player. While much of the basic ideas and mechanics from Metroid's gameplay are here, Axiom Verge showcases many of it's own concepts integrating them seamlessly into the game and establishing itself apart. No, this is not a simple rehash of a classic franchise. Axiom Verge is it's own, and it is perhaps the best Metroidvania style game I have ever played. I highly recommend Axiom Verge.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 13h 8m Rec Positive Is very much a metroidvania. If that suits you, just buy it.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 18h 23m Rec Positive axiom virgin
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 19h 23m Rec Positive Если вы играли в Super Metroid на SNES и если она вам понравилась - это то что вам нужно! Хотя это палка о трех концах... Ведь из метроида была взята уйма всего, вплоть до амтосферы! Но благодаря стилю, музыке и какому-ни-какому сюжету - вещь воспринимается иначе, самобытно) P.S. Я уже говорил о музыке? Музыка шикарна! :)
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 9h 12m Rec Positive I think this is one of the best Indie games i've ever played. It reminds me of Metroid a lot, which it should, and i love the story and game mechanics.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 66h 26m Rec Positive This game will scratch that Metroid itch that hasn't been scratched since Super Metroid!!
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 11h 12m Rec Positive Staying true to the classic metroidvania (almost to a fault,) this game is a great homage to the genre and I would recommend it outright.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 14h 24m Rec Positive What can i say, besides, GO AND BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW.  Truly one of the best games ever, one and only of its kind, the game you've been waiting for ages, and Tom Happ made it a reality, graphics alike those of metroid, and other nintendo games, one of the best soundtracks ever, all of which give a real feel of the environment.  Best Game Ever.   Period.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 2h 27m Rec Positive Nice metroidvania with both a classical and a modern feeling.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 27h 41m Rec Positive metroid
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 18h 6m Rec Positive Do you like Metroid? Do you like pixel art that is actually GOOD? Do you like soundtracks that absolutely fit the setting and creatures around you?  This is one of the those games that I saw the trailer and I knew I was going buy, love, and recommend. It hit the mark on everything save the storytelling, but considering the Dark Souls trend of 'telling by not telling' the game is just fitting the times.   10/10 WILL play again
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 20h 18m Rec Positive FUCKING AMAZING
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 62h 26m Rec Positive Molto Bello! Assomiglia tantissimo a 3 giochi della serie Metroid : Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion e Metroid Zero Mission, se vi piacciono questi tre Axiom Verge non vi deluderà!
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 17h 28m Rec Positive This game is great! One of the best metroidvanias I've ever played. If you liked Metroid and are searching for something similar, you should most definitely get this.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 16h 45m Rec Positive A fantastic little mix of Super Metroid and Contra. Tight controls, great music, some untypical power-ups and worth exploring till the end of the game. Boss difficulty tends to be higher in the beginning, but well-balanced otherwise. I'll be replaying it.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 30h 59m Rec Positive The best retro art design ever. And art means: Music, Graphics, Style.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 30h 52m Rec Positive Probably the best Metroid game to come out in years.  Unlike most of Metroidvania games, Axiom Verge is most clearly influenced by Super Metroid: there is no RPG inspired system of progression where you grow stronger by continuously killing monsters and watching your numbers slowly increase. Instead, your character grows stronger and more versatile by finding tools, weapons and health upgrades scattered around the world, both in plain sight and hidden in the levels. The game is similar to Super Metroid in length, with Axiom Verge taking around 12 hours to beat on my first playthrough.  The game does a good job introducing a number of new weapons and tools that only make it more efficient to kill your enemies, but also make it faster to travel around the world. Some of these are inspired by Metroid (a small drone you can remote control) while others are a bit more interesting (a gun that can "glitch" enemies, causing their graphics to go nuts,  become vulnerable or start destroying their surroundings, among other effects). There is a nice line of progression to these powerups, giving them more uses as you progress through the game, allowing you to backtrack and find more secrets. There are a few bosses, ranging from smaller ones to ones that fill out the entire screen, giving them nice variety while giving a nice break from the constant exploration every now and then.  The game has a story, told with the few cutscenes in the game and log entries you can find scattered in the world. While the story isn't all that groundbreaking, it complements the game's atmosphere without being too overbearing; the game rarely stops your progress with a cutscene and never forces you to go through a certain path or arbitrarily locks places in the game due to not having gotten far enough in the story; the meat of the game is gameplay, and the narrative is really a secondary element rather than the main course.  If there is something to criticize here, it's that the regions in the game aren't as memorable as in other similar games, even if the H.R. Giger inspired graphics aren't bad at all.  If you've had an itch for a Metroid game, pick this game up. And while you're at it, try out AM2R too.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 28h 11m Rec Positive Dieses Spiel.... wenn man es überhaupt noch spiel nennen kann, ich fände die Bezeichnung Retro Kunst eher treffend, hat mich von anfang bis ende Gefangen Genommen. Als langjähriger Metroidvania Fan war ich wie viele von uns sehr enttäuscht als das namensgebliche Franchise von Nintendo nach seinem 4ten 2D ableger quasi auf Eis gelegt wurde. Umso erfreulicher war die nachricht das es da einen verrückt genialen menschen geben soll der ganz alleine an einem solchen spiel Bastelt. Ich werde nichts weiter über diesen Titel sagen um auch nicht das kleinste bischen zu Spoilern aber Soviel sei gesagt:  ''Bist du ein Fan der alten Metroidvania Spiele dann KAUF DIESES SPIEL EGAL ZU WELCHEM PREIS! ^^   11/10 Wenn das irgendwie möglich ist.  PS: Sämtliche Rechtschreibfehler in diesem Artikel sind durch den BRUCH verursacht worden und als Eastereggs zu betrachten
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 9h 56m Rec Positive A metroidvania game that gets the aesthetic and gameplay feel very right. Even though it shares a lot of the same ideas of a metroidvania game, it leans much more heavily on the metroid side of the equation with a heavy emphasis on exploration without deep rpg elements. The game also has a decent amount of puzzle situations to it as well, but it never gets too challenging. Another interesting component to the game is the weapon mechanics. Just like in metroid the players main weapon has many different modes to it that dramatically alter gameplay and can change the entire experince of the game. The players weapon even takes the place of other staple movement abilities such as jumping and sliding.   Definite recommend to all metroid fans.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 10h 4m Rec Positive Axiom Verge - прекрасная Метроидвания, сделанная по всем законам жанра. Я бы даже сказал, что эта игра - в какой-то степени доработанный клон Метройда по части геймплея и дизайна уровней. Очевидно, что разработчики вдохнавлялись именно Метройдом, а не просто делали игру в этом жанре. Могут посоветовать абсолютно всем, кому нравился Метройд.  Плюсы: [list] [*]С такими системными требованиями пойдёт на любом ведре, умеющем считать до десяти. [*]Огромная и интересная карта. Очень часто приходится ходить туда-сюда, как и в Метройде, но это никогда не надоедает. Несмотря на размеры карты, она не пустая. Мир наполнен интересностями и секретами. [*]Интересный сюжет. Я не ценитель сюжета в играх, но я могу отличить неплохую историю от какого-то бреда. И это точно не какой-то бред. Концовка вызвала мурашки по коже, а концовок тут две. [*]Отличный геймплей. Эта игра мне показалась сложной, но честной (кроме некоторых боссов, которых я проходил чистой удачей). Также разнообразие "инструментов" не заставит скучать. [*]Разнообразие оружия. И это не тот случай, где тебе дают огромную кучу оружия, но на деле полезно только одно или два. Довольно часто в разных ситуациях полезно разное оружие. [*]Длительность игры - 10 часов. Это совсем неплохо, хоть и часы пролетают незаметно. [*]Удобное управление на клавиатуре. Я покупаю игры такого рода с опасением, так как у меня нет геймпада, но играть в Axiom Verge на клавиатуре было удовольствием. [*]Приятная графика и атмосфера. [/list]  Минусы: [list] [*]Некоторые боссы мне совершенно не понравились. Возможно, это просто я так плохо играю в такие игры (в СуперМетройде некоторые боссы мне тоже показались абсолютно ужасными и неинтересными), но в любом случае здесь лишь моё личное мнение. [/list] Я думал довольно долго, но так и не смог найти больше минусов. Axiom Verge не зря получила несколько наград (хоть страница в магазине и умалкивает о большинстве этих наград, какие стенистельные разрабы). Я бы даже купил ещё раз, когда (и если) она выйдет на 3DS.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 26h 32m Rec Positive If you liked Metroid, then this is the game for you! It has a quirky, kind of dark story, lovely pixle graphics, and creepy ol' heads for days! I really love this game, and it stands on its own as a platformer even without the metroid-vania nostalgia goggles. 8/10 Highly reccomend.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 1h 0m Rec Positive Excelente juego retro, al momento de jugarlo se siente muy familiar si es que jugaron Metroid de nes o Super Metroid, la forma de ir avanzando es muy similiar, puedes encontrar varias armas y se van actualizando para poder avanzar.  No duden en comprarlo si son fans de Metroid, no se arrepentiran y recordarán la epoca dorada del Nes  Un must have!!!
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 27h 30m Rec Positive This metroidvania game is the closest thing to being Metroid and Castlevania, without being either.  It has a retro feel, sound, and graphics, which all feel great rather than dated.  Powerups are cool, exploration isn't necessary but it is greaty rewarded, and there are deep secrets that throw you off balance if you discover them.  The story is a compelling mind-bender, that is enhanced with collectible back-story.  I've played this again and again, searching for more, puzzling out more riddles, and I don't get bored of it.  My only possible criticism (which isn't really one, exactly), is that some elements look a bit TOO much like Super Metroid.  That said, I love that it does!  It is definitely it's own game, and builds its own look.  Wait, more "criticism": It makes my thumbs sore from playing too much and keeps me up too late because I'm addicted to it.    Help me, I cannot escape The Breach!  If you like metroidvania games, this is a- no THE top choice.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 11h 16m Rec Positive Одна из лучших современных игр в жанре "Метроид". Графическое и музыкальное исполнение на высоте! Что самое важное, игра довольно разнообразна - интерес со временем прохождения возрастает как к сюжету, так и к геймплею. Игра заставляет игрока смотреть на прошлые локации под другим углом, когда даёт новые инструменты для взаимодействием мира игры. Просто посмотрите трейлер!
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 8h 33m Rec Positive This game brings back the feel of Metroid / Super Metroid while having its own style.  With some challenging boss battles, and a few interesting game mechanics, it is a fun nostalgia trip.  A must play for any Metroidvania fan.  I give it a solid 10/10.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 25h 34m Rec Positive Pra quem curtiu (e mesmo quem nunca jogou) Super Metroid. Posso apostar uma grana como cada um de vocês vai gostar dessa obra de arte produzida por apenas UM cara  história 10/10  Jogabilidade 10/10 Diversão tá garantida, não percam tempo e joguem jogo essa the líssia
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 8h 46m Rec Positive Visuals that are both trippy and retro. Game play that came right out of the NES playbook. This game is a classic love letter to the Metroid games of old, and should be on any fan's play list.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 29h 28m Rec Positive Axiom Verge borrows a lot from Super Metroid, but bring its own ideas to the genre. The art in the game is fantastic with retro and glitchy stylings. The gameplay is solid and is appropriately challenging without being too frustrating. I highly recommend this for any fans of the 2D metroid games of yore.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 18h 11m Rec Positive Right off the bat, it's easy to tell that this game was influenced by Metroid. Like heavily influenced. But, like all good games that are birthed from a love of much older ones, this game is its own beast.  There is "minimal" story. By that I mean not to the depths of, say, a RPG and such. But, for those of us old gamers, Super Metroid, comes to mind. Bits and pieces revealed between one area and the next.  The gameplay is like all Metroidvania style games, lots of backtracking to get 100%. Not that I cared. I've been playing these style games forever, why should I expect something different here. As a platformer, I really suggest the use of a controller. There are some items that take quick button switching that I could never reproduce on a keyboard.  I liked the fact that the guns were just that, weapons to kill enemies. You didn't need a certain one to open a door, or to advance to the next area.  I'm baised, I live in nostalgia with many games. But, I think it's worth the price. The replay value is an individial thing. I've replayed all my Metroid and Castlevania games many times. It just depends on what you like.  NNM
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 29h 22m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is, in my opinion, a great game for a few reasons:  1) Solid gameplay with tight controls 2) Mechanics are clever, yet practical--they will be familiar to fans of the genre 3) Story is present and interesting, but unintrusive--the focus remains on actually playing the game 4) Axiom Verge's artwork faithfully pays homage to the titles that inspired it 5) Soundtrack is fantastic  It amazes me that this entire work was made by only one man.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing Axiom Verge.  The only drawback I found was that, like the older games that inspired it, Axiom Verge suffers from a lack of replayability.  There is a hard mode and a speedrun mode for those who like to challenge themselves in that way and if you like the game for the game's sake, then there should be no problem.  However, if you are like me and are a bonus content/unlockables junkie, then it will be hard to find a reason to pick it up again after the first playthrough.  Nevertheless, I think Axiom Verge is a great game and would recommend it to fans of retro-style platformers.  If you can pick it up on sale, all the better!
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 11h 2m Rec Positive This game is basically the Metroid game I've waited years to play, and so much more. I seriously recommend picking it up!
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 3h 51m Rec Positive The Metroid game Nintendo refuses to make.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 4h 57m Rec Positive this game is so good
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 7h 54m Rec Positive Лучшая метроидвания за последние много лет.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 10h 50m Rec Positive While the music and story are both major highlights for what I enjoyed about Axiom Verge, the biggest part that surprised me is just how much it diverges from typical, trope-heavy mechanics; the twists aren't in the plot or the layer of meta-ness, but in the actual backbone of the genre, leaving the experience one that doesn't betray the genre while still surprising the player.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 19h 25m Rec Positive Une Pure claque. Tant au niveau de l'histoire énorme et passionante qui vous donnera envie de finir le jeux a 100% pour comprendre tout ses details, que son gameplay riche qui vous menera a chercher dans tout les recoin du jeux ou pour les speedrunner a chercher les passage vous permetant de grater le moindre millliemme de seconde. Ce jeux est le digne heritier des "metroidvania"
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 0h 16m Rec Positive If you love metroid games, this is a must have, between the level, sound, and enemy design it satisfies and itch that hasn't been scratch in a long time. The other biggest selling point is the intentional glitchy mechanics, that's taking nostalgia to the next level. Other things to mention, difficulty curve exists, and there are points where you hit a wall, usually a boss fight or two, eventually you'll get it, with patience and practice.   Lastly, after finishing, this game left me wanting more, thankfully the developer is gonna make more games (presumably a sequel).   
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 15h 49m Rec Positive The best metroid-vania game that is not actually metroid.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 15h 38m Rec Positive This game is a love letter to Super Metroid. It is more Super Metroid than Metroid Fusion. It is more Super Metroid than Metroid.
Date 2016-11-24 Playtime 23h 56m Rec Positive I can't say enough nice things about this game.  I still play classic Metroid and Super Metroid at least once a year since I bought those games when they came out.  This a great homage to those games, and not only that, has one hell of a soundtrack to boot that stands alone on it's own.  I hope the creator makes a Super Axiom Verge sequel!
Date 2016-11-23 Playtime 19h 19m Rec Positive This is the 2D Metroid-like game that Nintendo refuses to make. If you like 2D action and exploration combined with the trademark Metroidvania style power-ups then this is the game for you.
Date 2016-11-23 Playtime 11h 16m Rec Positive The gameplay is really enjoyable and it is an absolute blast to explore the enviroment and find secrets to help with your epic journey.
Date 2016-11-23 Playtime 0h 16m Rec Positive Capolavoro per chi adora i metroidvania sono rimasto sbalordito avevo letto molto su questo gioco ma giocarlo. Consiglio l'aquisto a tutti gli amanti del genere
Date 2016-11-23 Playtime 21h 50m Rec Positive An awesome metroidvania game, where you control a character with amnesia.

Date 2016-11-23 Playtime 19h 8m Rec Positive Un gran juego con un sentido muy retro, pero actual. Tiene buena sensación de exploración y apertura de nuevas áreas con base a las mejoras que vas obteniendo. El mundo parece enorme, pero no te pierdes gracias al mapa integrado. Llevo poco jugándolo, pero desde un inicio me gustó.
Date 2016-11-23 Playtime 22h 0m Rec Positive Metroid? Castlevania? If you loved those, you'll absolutely adore this game.  Buy it.
Date 2016-11-23 Playtime 59h 0m Rec Positive Best metroidvania I've seen.

Date 2016-11-23 Playtime 1h 19m Rec Positive Everything that a metroidvania fan needs in their life
Date 2016-11-23 Playtime 13h 7m Rec Positive I bought this game expecting something like Metroid. Instead, I got a bizarre and wonderful adventure through a world far more alien than almost any other game I have ever played. I'm still not entirely sure that I understand the story completely, and perhaps I never will. If Phillip K. Dick wrote video games instead of novels, they probably would have ended up something like Axiom Verge.  Very highly recommended.
Date 2016-11-23 Playtime 16h 42m Rec Positive Some try to copy great games, either failing entirely or not being able to make the game feel like its own thing.  Others take inspiration from them and create something worthy of that same level. If you liked Metroid, you'll love Axiom Verge.   Axiom Verge is known as a Metroidvania and has taken inspiration from games such as Metroid, Contra, Baster Master and more. The map in the top right corner, finding your way through a maze like area, finding new weapons and upgrades in order to explore areas you weren't able to enter earlier and the vibe all scream Metroid. And even though this seems like Super Metroid on steriods, Axiom Verge is able to feel like its own game. It doesn't make me feel I am playing Metroid, but it really does feel like a game of its own. The awesome soundtrack and level design add up to this. The bosses are challenging yet not too difficult as is finding out where to go. There is no better feeling than finally beating a fair yet challenging boss after 40 minutes of trying. I highly recommend this game.
Date 2016-11-23 Playtime 19h 16m Rec Positive Best Love Letter to Metroid
Date 2016-11-23 Playtime 17h 38m Rec Positive The most Metroid like game on Steam, this game deserves a play if you've a fan of Metroidvania games.  Retro graphics may be commonplace these days, but this game makes it work, including building into the game what were just glitches on the old nes.  Here they add to the gameplay.  Highly recommended.
Date 2016-11-23 Playtime 11h 34m Rec Positive Really fun to play Metroidvania. You feel that the developer loved the originals.
Date 2016-11-22 Playtime 15h 15m Rec Positive Highly recommended, very similar to Super Metroid, just as good.
Date 2016-11-20 Playtime 24h 26m Rec Positive Feels like a really mature version of metroid.  The gameplay is good, but the diagonal shooting is a nightmare. in addition the graphics (pixels) is good looking and the ambience and the music are awsome.  Really hard to belive this is the work of one man.  The speedrun option and the variaty of weapons give you a lot of "replayability". Well worth the price!
Date 2016-11-19 Playtime 39h 54m Rec Positive An incredibly enjoyable Metroid-style platformer with amazing art direction and music. All sorts of collectibles and secrets to give you an excuse to play the game multiple times; a lot of it is randomized which is cool becuase it keeps you from just looking up all the secrets online. Lots of weapons to unlock, and they all feel unique from one another. It borrows a lot of ideas from Metroid and is pretty transparent about trying to emulate it, but after playing Axiom Verge and Super Metroid back to back, I think this game might actually be the better of the two.   The story can be a bit confusing and hard to follow, but there are a lot of hidden messages around the game world that clarify bits and pieces of it. I'm guessing it's clearer if you collect all of them. The music is just incredible, there was only one track I didn't really like. The pixel art is all top-notch, realy conveys the feeling of a cryptic alien world.
Date 2016-11-19 Playtime 52h 12m Rec Positive Such an amazing f'ing game!!! This is the standard that all Metroidvania's should be held to! The retro style feels and looks retro (not faked retro), the sound and music have that 8-bit crunchyness to them that makes you eargasm to years past video games that pushed the envelope with the limited technology they had bringing a superior produt to market as a result. It was a VERY smart move to allow the soundtrack to be purchased because the music alone makes the game worth it. However, the spites, sound effects, gameplay, level design, powerups, etc. are on par with the quality and level of the music.   I cannot wait until the 2nd one!
Date 2016-11-18 Playtime 11h 11m Rec Positive If you're looking for a metroid fix, you won't be disappointed.
Date 2016-11-15 Playtime 16h 47m Rec Positive like a love letter to metroid and all that it was when i was a kid, secret worlds included
Date 2016-11-14 Playtime 66h 13m Rec Positive I Think it's beautiful but... i don't know what to do. I tried many things but it just crush when i run it.
Date 2016-11-13 Playtime 9h 40m Rec Positive WOOOOWWWWWW!  Eigentlich reicht dieses Wort. Wenn man sich überlegen tut, das ein einziger Mann dieses schöne Metroidvania Abentuer erschaffen hat. Lässt es mich schmunzeln, genauso wie immer wieder Staunen. Wer natürlich Metroid 2D Abenteuer so wie ich Abfeiern tut. Der ist genau Richtig hier. Ich werde hier nichts Spoilern, weil jeder Selber, der dieses Franchice schätz die Story geniesen soll. Jede Idee ist hier Perfekt umgesätzt. Ob es die Waffensysteme, Bosse oder die Welten sind. Die Musik passt zu jeden Abschnitt wie die Faust aufs Auge. Jeder Metroid Fan wird es lieben. Kein Spiel könnte so nah, an die ran kommen wie dieses Game! Eventuel drückt ihr genauso wie ich ein Tränschen ab, wenn er diese phänomenale Perle zocken werdet. Mich hat es begeistert und zu 1000% Glücklich gemacht.

Date 2016-11-12 Playtime 24h 8m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is the masterpiece of an individual who deeply loved Metroid and Castlevania. Retro game play is the calling card of AV, and the game play is spot on, with responsive controls and imaginative weapons. The intentional 'glitches' and classic pixel stylings harken back to the late 80's (16-bit era) when there was actually still a use for an imagination whilst playing video games. 2D platforming at its best, with lots of hidden areas, and nods to the original game (upon whose magnificent shoulders this giant stands) make this a wonderful gem of a game, with a price tag which won't blister your wallet! Axiom Verge is not perfect, for sure. Drilling straight down is a bit of a chore, but with so many motion options, there must come some compromise. I've only got about 4 hours (or so) of game play under my belt, so I won't even begin to try to write a complete review; for now, I'll say that I am very pleased with Axiom Verge as a whole, and look forward to many more hours of fun at the helm of this retro ship!!
Date 2016-11-11 Playtime 19h 34m Rec Positive make another one just like it with new items and different map you'll getm y money buddy
Date 2016-11-05 Playtime 13h 3m Rec Positive Wonderful game, great nod to the metroid series and beautiful music.
Date 2016-11-04 Playtime 46h 22m Rec Positive Not much of a reviewer, but extremely well made Metroidvania platformer. Utilizes vibrantly dark thematic tones akin to Super Metroid, noticeably present in its environments, dialogue, story, and music. Gameplay mechanics also mimic Super Metroid, with weapon upgrades and ability powerups peppered around boss fights. Overall, amazing instance of platforming and world exploring for anyone remotely interested in such genres.
Date 2016-11-04 Playtime 11h 25m Rec Positive 웰메이드 메트로베니아 장르의 게임 노멀로 플레이해서 그런지, 난이도는 그렇게 어렵지 않았고, 게임의 분위기도 매우  좋음 추천작
Date 2016-11-04 Playtime 27h 25m Rec Positive This game has platforms. The best platforms. Better than any other platforms. Some other games have platforms, but not as good as these platforms.   You want to talk about weapons? This game has weapons. This game has all the weapons. I know people, they like the weapons too.  I know all about art. All the artists support me. This game has excellent art. Some of it even has colors. Trust me, its good art.  Controls? Well the controls are a bit clunky but have you seen tose emails? I mean come on!
Date 2016-10-31 Playtime 38h 25m Rec Positive ﻿Good art. Good music.  I also like Super Metroid. And Axiom Verge bases on respect for it, but isn't merely a good imitation. I feel some originality and mystic space behind. If it interests you to explore abandoned facility (factory, power plant, military base, graveyard, etc) and to watch little creature flourishing covertly, this game likely keeps your playing enthusiastic to the last.
Date 2016-10-31 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive Biopunk, glitchpunk, cyberpunk -- it's got most of the punks, and they're blended beautifully.  The world is just one big ol' punky labyrinth that's buckets of fun to explore and, thanks to the handy-dandy automap, tough to get lost in.  The nifty narrative has a hearty dollop of that A.E. van Vogt mind-bending madness in it (and you should totally read [i]The Book of Ptath[/i], [i]Slan[/i], or [i]The World of Null-A[/i] on a lark; you'll thank me).   What can you say about a massive indie metroidvania that's perfect in almost every way?  You're fated to either adore or despise it based on your genre preferences, and that's that.  I'm with the former group, obviously.  It's way more fun than any 2D Metroid I've played!  And it's got a whole wardrobe full of magic lab coats!
Date 2016-10-30 Playtime 17h 22m Rec Positive Awww Man. I have never played metroid or castlevania much.  But after (just) finishing this game Im pretty damn content.   This game annoyed the shit out of me, but I still played it and I loved every minute of it. The style, the music, the simple but not easy gameplay had me by the heart.   9/10.
Date 2016-10-28 Playtime 22h 14m Rec Positive Whoever played and loved Metroid or Super Metroid will enjoy this game a lot: lots of items and upgrades to collect, an interesting story (waiting for the sequel) and some challenging parts. Just make sure that your keyboard has at least 4 keys rollover for some proper locked diagonal direction jumping and shooting.
Date 2016-10-26 Playtime 23h 26m Rec Positive GREAT GREAT GREAT!
Date 2016-10-25 Playtime 21h 19m Rec Positive "Developed solely by Thomas Happ." That's right. One man made everything there is to the game. The story, the art, the music, everything. Is it worth the price? Definitely. With at least 12 hours of base content and tons of secrets to discover, the game isn't going to get old anytime soon.   The story is, in my opinion, amazing. The art is great, and the cutscenes really stand out. The music is probably the best part of the game; no matter how bad things looked, the music always got my blood pumping for some old-school action. The mechanics do get repetitive at times, and I have a lot of issues with the way the Grappling Hook was implemented. I've also got some minor issues with the default keybindings, but they're nothing you can't change.   If you liked Metroid, you will like this game. If you loved Metroid, you'll probably love this game too, just like me. Even if you don't wish to play it as a nostalgia trip, play it to see what one man can accomplish with a good amount of experience in the game development industry and tons of free time. Notch, you say? Happ is where it's at, boy.
Date 2016-10-23 Playtime 7h 10m Rec Negative It's not a bad game, but it has too much backtracking. It's making the game experiece boring and absolutely not motivating at all. I've felt lost several times, because I could not go forward. Instead, I needed to go back several 'areas' to continue. I'm not saying I need a linear game, but this is the first Metroidvania game that I play that made me feel that way... I insist, it is not a bad game, but for me it's become a hard to enjoy experience.
Date 2016-10-23 Playtime 5h 29m Rec Positive This is the 2D Metroid game we've wanted for years now. It harnesses what made Metroid great while giving it's own unique (and slightly randomized) spin on it.   The weapons are fun to experiment with and the "corruptor gun" can have surprising results if your experiment on enemies - like turning them into platforms, chain explosives or remote controlling them.  Be warned though - the backtracking does not hold your hand. Make notes if you think the 2-flags per area are not enough. Some times it's obvious what upgrade you'll need, but this game did surprise me a few times with what it brought to the table.  One other small downside is the lack of teleport option. There's only a central hub "tunnel". Which is even worse if you, like me, didn't try standing on the giant heads there, which act as vehicles.
Date 2016-10-23 Playtime 8h 30m Rec Positive Without a doubt, one of the best games I have ever played. One guy put Nintendo to shame. Kudos, Tom.
Date 2016-10-23 Playtime 25h 16m Rec Positive After having run out of Metroidvania-style games to play, I'd hoped to find a game that would scratch that itch, even just for a little while. This game exceeded my expectations by so much, that I felt guilty I hadn't found it sooner.  Axiom Verge had me hooked from the start, I couldn't bring myself play anything else for quite some time, I just had to find out what the next piece of equipment or weapon would be that would open up new areas or pieces of the story and lore. Everything about this game fits together perfectly, you can tell how much love for the genre went into this from start to finish.  Want a Metroidvania game? Buy this game.
Date 2016-10-21 Playtime 22h 29m Rec Positive incredible game;   and Axiom Verge 2 ...... ¿ it´s a mith ?........
Date 2016-10-21 Playtime 33h 58m Rec Positive If you like Metroid style games with retro graphics, I cannot recommend this game enough. Awesome music, story and replayability. You can't ask for more.
Date 2016-10-19 Playtime 15h 46m Rec Positive It's pretty good, last boss is a bit of a dissapointment. Does pretty well with the steam controller. Fun to find the secrets, which are plentiful. If you don't like to backtrack you will probably get frusrated, it is essential to this game's completion. The other bosses, not the last one, are very challenging and require you to stratigize, you will not beat them on the first try (maybe the first ones) even on normal mode. I liked it, but I dont think it would be for everyone.
Date 2016-10-19 Playtime 12h 36m Rec Positive True to the metroidvania style; vast exploration, great music, fun gameplay.
Date 2016-10-17 Playtime 25h 15m Rec Positive If you missed old-school platformer shooters like Contra and Metroid, this game is definitely for you! Beautiful pixel art graphic, atmospheric soundtrack, tangled storyline, dynamic gameplay, a lot of secrets and dozen weapon types!  The main feature of the game is a special weapon allows you to "glitch" any enemy, making them weaker, changing behaviour pattern, making them your ally or even allows you to control them! If you want to feels like secret hunter on the alien planet - play it! It's totally worth it!

Date 2016-10-12 Playtime 11h 50m Rec Positive Liked it a lot but I felt the map was too big and the controls a bit cluttered. Double-tapping to dash sucked. Found myself running slowly through long corridors a lot. A more compact map or faster movement options would have been nice.  I feel like most of the combat was centered around finding a cheap strategy or safe spot, especially on a lot of the bosses. I didn't really have to learn how to dodge most attacks. Often it came down to just spamming attacks with the most effective weapon and hoping the enemies died before you did.  Good game overall though. The music was catchy and creepy, and the graphics very alien-looking, just what I'd want from a game like this.

Date 2016-10-12 Playtime 9h 3m Rec Positive  Un juego que me recuerda los grandes clasicos.  Es un juego de accion y aventura que divierte desde el principio, no cansa por la variedad de armas. Me gusta mucho ir tratando de obtener todos los objetos posible para ir evolucionando al personaje como algo adicional es la musica de fondo es espectacular.   Diversion 100 % garantizada.
Date 2016-10-11 Playtime 9h 43m Rec Positive this is a must have,   compelling gameplay and wonderous soundtrack make this metoroidvania a real pleasure   I played 100+ hours on ps4 and did beat the game after exploring a lot  bougt it on PC to support Happ studio, I hope he makes another one (fingers crossed)  highly recommended
Date 2016-10-10 Playtime 29h 25m Rec Positive Wow...  hab die Story gerade durch und bin absolut überwältigt! Eines der besten ... wenn nicht sogar der beste shoot em up side scroller ever! Ganz großes Kino an den Entwickler: Thomas Happ Kann das Spiel uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen!  Sound = genial ... Ich bekomme noch immer ne Gänsehaut  wenn ich "Cellular Skies" und "Without Place" höre!  Story: Beängstigend und Faszinierend zugleich Grafik: Einmalig wunderschön auf den Bildschirm gezaubert!  Fazit: Ich persönlich finde nichts aber auch überhaupt nichts Negatives an diesem Titel.  100% durchdacht an keiner Stelle langweilig und absolut fesselnd.  Ps. Als Kind der 80er kann ich mir den folgenden Spruch erlauben: "Sowas kam mir schon lange nicht mehr unter..."  Ein Spiel mit Charakter und einer Story zum versinken... Danke Thomas
Date 2016-10-10 Playtime 5h 41m Rec Positive For Metroid fans everywhere!
Date 2016-10-08 Playtime 27h 11m Rec Positive This game is truly awesome. It is comparable to Super Metroid (of course), but with brand new upgrades, another story (the story is a little more present than in Metroid games, but still stays in background), and more importantly, another atmosphere. It is not perfect, as there is a lot of back-tracking (but you should already enjoy that if you are on this page), the story and character lack personnality, but it definitly worth its price.  You can count around 8-12h of game for medium completion, there also is a speedrun mode.

Haven't played it for 10 months but it's still kinda stuck in my mind, a memorable game for sure. The story was hard to follow, but maybe I just wasn't paying attention enough.
Date 2016-10-04 Playtime 15h 29m Rec Positive The new metroid game that we'll never get
Date 2016-10-03 Playtime 67h 32m Rec Positive I only wish there was more, best metroidvania I've played since Super Metroid. The soundtrack is amazing as well, 10/10.
Date 2016-10-03 Playtime 3h 46m Rec Positive This has got to be one of my favorite games.  It brings me back to my days as a child when i would play games like metriod prime on my gameboy advanced.  Even though it brings backa lot of nostalgia it also creates new ones with the skills sets like transporting through walls and the variance in weapons.  All in all it brings back old memories and creates new ones at the same time.
Date 2016-10-02 Playtime 7h 6m Rec Positive The comparisons to super metroid are justified - nuff said
Date 2016-10-02 Playtime 0h 47m Rec Positive Старая добрая контра) Ну вы поняли.. ;-)
Date 2016-10-02 Playtime 19h 15m Rec Positive If you played and enjoyed the good old Metroid series this game is for you.  Really nice progression, lots of cool items and a creative story line.  Its crazy that one dude made this game.
Date 2016-10-02 Playtime 8h 49m Rec Negative I love Metroidvania games. I've played so much Super Metroid, Metroid Prime, Castlevania - Aria of Sorrows and Metroid Fusion. I even looked up a couple ways to speedrun Super Metroid because I have so much fun playing it. Naturally, when I started playing this game, I loved it too. The overworld is so detailed, it captured the aesthetic and vibe of Super Metroid perfectly all while doing it's own thing. I'm engrossed into it's complex story and I love every single itty bitty bit of it.  Unfortunatly, I have one big problem with this game. It crashes. Freaquently. On the Mac version at least. I've tried my hardest to fix it. I've tried to contact the developer about this problem and after all that work, still nothing. I have no way of contacting the developer (His Q&A page isn't functional) and his FAQ page hasn't helped me whatsoever.  I would love to give this game a perfect 10 and I would love to complete it but the fact that my game has crashed so many times, losing me several hours of game time, that just can't be a reality.
Date 2016-10-02 Playtime 4h 6m Rec Negative Remember that one retro sci-fi game? It's about some android named Samus. and there's this giant jellyfish that clings to you and drains all your energy. What was that creature called? I forget.  Anyway, that's what this game is like! All the fun has been drained out by alien jellyfish, leaving behind a dry husk of irritating busywork.  Enemies are aggressive bullet sponges. The wide variety of flashy guns are equally ineffective. New powerups and abilities do nothing useful, they're keys just to get past annoying barriers. Jumping and platforming is floaty. The graphics sometimes don't distinguish between foreground and background. Bosses are boring slogfests. Story is bland.  I've never had LESS fun in a 2D exploration game. How did they get every little thing wrong?
Date 2016-10-02 Playtime 12h 19m Rec Positive É basicamente Super Metroid com controles melhores. E isso é ótimo! Destaque para a trilha sonora.  Não é um jogo fácil, mas não é "apelão", todas as vezes que morri foi besteira minha. Mesmo assim o jogo (ao menos na dificuldade normal) salva automaticamente seu progresso. Então se você pegou um item e morreu antes do save point, seu progresso não foi perdido.  Ótimo jogo, e o mais incrível é que foi feito inteiramente por uma única pessoa, Tom Happ, que programou, fez os gráficos e a música.  Mais que recomendado.  
Date 2016-10-01 Playtime 12h 23m Rec Positive Cooles Metroidvania-Game, cool gemacht, vorallem dafür, dass es nur von eimem Programmierer ist. Musik ist echt nice und die Story auch noch cool. Ist zwar ein bisschen schwer, vorallem am Anfang, wo manf ast kein Leben hat, aber trotzdem machbar.  Einige wenige Male ist es zwar abgestürzt, sonst aber super Spielerlebnis, nur muss man X und B vertauschen, schiessen liegt nun mal normalerweise auf B^^
Date 2016-10-01 Playtime 18h 18m Rec Positive That one metroid-esque game is what you call a hidden (or, better, not very well known) gem highly recommended to everyone.
Date 2016-10-01 Playtime 35h 13m Rec Positive tl;dr This game is an excellent successor to the Metroid style platformers. You should get it if you liked those.  Wow, where do I even begin? I installed this to see how it was. Here I am, 13 hours later and I binged it. Played it in two 6-ish hour sittings because I couldn't stop for anything but falling asleep. There's a lot to talk about with this game, both good and bad.  [h1]Gameplay[/h1] This is the meat and potatoes of the game. This is what's going to keep you occupied for most of the time, so it's important that this works well. It does. I've found very few situations where I was annoyed or bored with the game. The shooting feels great and suitably difficult and kept fresh by the insane variety of weapons and tools at your disposal. I particularly enjoy that each weapon more or less seem to have a specific playstyle and enemy type in mind, which keeps you varying up as the game goes along. There were a few I simply didn't find useful at all, being the Nova (which you get very early), [spoiler]Firewall[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Multi Disruptor[/spoiler]. The only thing that stood out to me was the grappling hook. Yes, I'm spoiling that because the grappling hook exists in every Metroid game ever, so it's not a big deal. It doesn't act like other grappling hooks and that threw me off a lot and it took me about an hour of gameplay to get used to how it works and its quirks.   [h1]Enemy variety and difficulty[/h1] Enemy variety is good, although you keep crossing back through several areas multiple times, and this is where enemies can become very familiar after a while. There's also not really that many different types of enemies. You have wall crawlers, static sentries, chasing sentries and different kinds of flyers. But their art style, sound and attacks keep them from becoming stale regardless.  Bosses are suitably huge and while the first boss is a real pansy, they quickly become trickier and trickier to the point where you sometimes completely fail to understand how to beat it until you've tried different tactics.   Enemies are suitably difficult and as you ramp up in power with new weapons and strength, so do the enemies. I found that towards the very end of the game enemies became really difficult and I found myself dying a couple of times to certain rooms. This can frustrate some players, but I found it to be enough to simply press on. The game also allows you tools to explore ahead of you and deal with dangerous threats without really putting yourself in danger, on occasion. It's however incredibly easy to forget you have these tools.  [h1]Exploration[/h1] I have rarely found a game that compels me to explore so much as this game. While the storyline is fairly straight forward in where you need to go and what to do, this opens up later in the game, but I never felt I was stuck wondering what to do. I always knew almost exactly where to go next to progress the story, and when I didn't feel like doing that or I got a new tool I felt the urge to go back to older areas and explore and see what new areas I could visit with the help of the new tools. It's absolutely awesome in that regard. It rewards exploration greatly. My only complaint would be that some puzzles were perhaps just a little bit [b]too[/b] obtuse, requiring me to really use my head. When a game makes me take out my notebook and start deciphering messages, it's a good game.  [h1]Tools and abilities[/h1] I won't spoil any specific abilities you get in the game as I felt they were an incredibly refreshing array of abilities that I quite frankly haven't seen much in this kind of game. Usually what you get is the basic double jump and perhaps a dash and that's it. This game allows you to explore and manipulate the environment in such a way that you quite often forget just how much freedom you really have, and get stuck on a simple puzzle because you forgot you had this awesome ability that would let you pass this obstacle, because other games wouldn't have let you do that. It's definitely one of the games' great strengths, and also perhaps a weakness. Because, as I said, more than once I ran around lost because I forgot that the game allowed me to do things other games wouldn't and therefor I didn't think of them.  [h1]Graphics[/h1] This is a matter of taste. Some people can't stand the SNES style graphics and I respect that. However, I found them to work excellently for this game, and overall I found most areas to be distinct and creative, matching with its enemies. I have nothing to complain about here. Everything looks crips and colorful and effects are nice and easy to digest.  [h1]Sound and music[/h1] Sounds were very distinct and I could quickly learn what meant what, which is a good thing from these types of games. Usually sounds can be confusing, but I found every sound to be familiar after a while, which meant new sounds stood out and made me stop and wonder what that was. Music was really great and I liked almost every track with few exceptions. It has a chiptuney electronic soundtrack that fits the graphics style and the dark story perfectly.  [h1]Story[/h1] I grew up with the IBM 5150 and later the NES as my go to computer and console gaming as a child, so perhaps my expectations on a story are somewhat lower than others. Back then most games had a throwaway story, fitting on one page of the manual. It was all about the gameplay. This game surprised me with having a very Flashback-y style story with dialogue and I was really surprised to find myself being drawn in and wanting to know more. The world is simple, but crafted very well and the story is really very basic once you've seen it all. But the way the story is told keeps you guessing and wondering. On more than one occasion I admit to have been "mind blown" over how the story progressed. In spite of it being so it was still easy to follow and it really kept me wanting more.   [h1]Settings[/h1] The game has fullscreen and windowed mode, as well as graphics scaling to allow you leeway in the size of the window, should you go for windowed mode. Sound and music have separate sliders. Controls are rebindable for both controller and keyboard. The game allows you to use either a list or a selection wheel for weapons.  [h1]Length and conclusion[/h1] The game took about 13 hours from beginning to end from me and that was with a lot of exploration and running lost looking for secrets (yes there are secrets). I can easily see someone spending 20 hours on a single playthrough with sufficient exploration. But looking back at it I could probably have rushed through the main story in 4-6 hours if I wanted to. It's a great testament to the game that it kept me engrossed for so long in spite of being comparatively short.   I heartily recommend this game to anyone who likes weird, dark, sci-fi stories and platformers of old. It's not an easy game, nor is it forgiving. The puzzles take some real thought and it will put your platforming skills to test. But it's a great little game and when I see it was developed by a single man I am more than impressed.
Date 2016-09-30 Playtime 12h 34m Rec Positive Metroid is an Axiom verge clone.
Date 2016-09-30 Playtime 31h 9m Rec Positive Первая в списке игра, в которой стыдно жаловаться на баги, когда они являются частью геймплэя) В принципе неплохая игрушка, но управление просто жесть. Без геймпада очень сложно)
Date 2016-09-29 Playtime 27h 4m Rec Positive The Metroid series may be dead, but its spirit lives on, and nowhere is that spirit stronger than in Axiom Verge. It has just the right amount of that familiar Metroid feel while also bringing plenty of new stuff to the table.  First, though, I want to get the handful of negatives I have out of the way. Personally, I didn't like the fact that the 'glitch dash' is activated by double-tapping the d-pad - I found myself activating it by accident quite frequently. While the game has an impressive amount of weapon variety, most of the weapons are not very useful - on my last playthrough where I acquired every single sub-weapon, I found that I only really used 4 or 5 out of the 20 or so in the game.  Those are minor nitpicks, however. If you love Metroidvania style games, Axiom Verge is absolutely a game you should try. It's got great level design, fun powerups, great boss battles, tight controls, and is just overall an incredibly tight package.
Date 2016-09-29 Playtime 27h 42m Rec Positive So you've played metroidvanias? If metroid is your cute blonde ex girlfriend, Axiom Verge is her edgy younger sister, who actually got all the hotness in the family, and loves metal who you revenge-fvck on the regular to get back at your ex, and little sister knows your revenge-fvcking her and she likes it.  Play this game. 
Date 2016-09-29 Playtime 19h 24m Rec Positive O melhor jogo indie no estilo metroidvania muito imerciso porcausa dos glithes que vc fica livre pra fazer no jogo até parece que vc ta bugando tudo.
Date 2016-09-29 Playtime 40h 49m Rec Positive I am a major fan of Metroid and this game does most everything right concerning the 2D genre; the weapons are always good and major power ups are always rewarding. I was extremely surprised and happy about the new abilities given to us in the game which helps the game feel more updated. It makes me think about the cool new abilities Samus could have in another entry. The real major nitpick about Axiom Verge is that I often got lost not knowing where to go next. The map is very large and doesn't offer much help finding a new path. Other than that, the game is extremely solid and unique.
Date 2016-09-29 Playtime 7h 32m Rec Positive Beautifully executed, great game!
Date 2016-09-27 Playtime 16h 41m Rec Positive As a Metroid fan this game is a must play. Great atmosphere, good story, awsome controls. Its just an overall great game.
Date 2016-09-27 Playtime 11h 58m Rec Positive Pro: Enjoyable platformer/shooter. Nice variety of weapons and abilities. Lots of secrets to find when exploring. Con: Couple of the bosses in the endgame spewed projectiles in quantities impossible to dodge compared to previous bosses who had more pattern based attacks.
Date 2016-09-27 Playtime 17h 34m Rec Positive It's a better metroid game than most metroid games. 10/10
Date 2016-09-27 Playtime 14h 33m Rec Positive I like that one guy made a better Metroid game than Nintendo
Date 2016-09-27 Playtime 23h 44m Rec Negative After being on a Metroid kick for a while, I decided to heed Justin Roiland's advice to get this game. But after beating two bosses, i still wasnt as engaged in the game as i was in the Metroid 2D games. The environments are frankly kinda boring and the dialogue is pretty hokey. Its not by any means a bad game, but if you are interested in getting this game play Metroid Fusion, Super Metroid, or Metroid Zero Mission instead. This game isnt engaging enough to warrant such a high difficulty. Could just be personal bias, but the Metroid games do what Axiom Verge tries to do so, so much better
Date 2016-09-25 Playtime 19h 8m Rec Positive This game is good
Date 2016-09-25 Playtime 13h 47m Rec Positive Lange hab ich nach etwas ähnlichem gesucht wie Metroid auf der Super Nintendo und HIER IST ES! Das einzigste was ich bereue ist....es war bestimmt 1 Jahr in meiner Wunschliste aber ich hab mich nei getraut, doch das war ein Fehler. Super geiles spiel, gerne zu empfehlen. Nur die Bosse hätten ein wenig schwerer sein können, der letzte boss war für mich persönlich ein witz. ;)
Date 2016-09-25 Playtime 15h 36m Rec Positive I wish all platformers were as unique and awesome as this one
Date 2016-09-24 Playtime 14h 22m Rec Positive I can't keep comparing games to other games, I'm getting too old and out of touch for that. This game is a side-scrolling shooter with tight controls and mechanically rewards players for exploration. Players with incredible attention to detail will enjoy the way items are hidden. The way some secrets are concealed can be incredibly harsh, but if you discover them, it'll feel even more rewarding for overcoming the challenge.  Even though I felt like I was excruciatingly thorough, I do not feel cheated by the secrets that I missed, and I am glad that they are used so cleverly. I guess to criticize it, some of the solutions felt very rare or like surprise one-offs that added to their sense of excessive difficulty.  The game itself is not actually punishing however, and while many of the guns are cool to discover and, agreeing with the developer, provide life-blood to exploration through very fun rewards... Most of the discovered guns are far from required for completing the game. Upgrades that improve your general abilities, such as damage per shot and max health are hidden as well.   Again, this is an exploration game as well as an action game!   Some of the easier to find weapons are placed in map areas that seem to suggest a Zelda-inspired(whoops) approach to game mechanics, where the area will often contain a wepaon that seems to be designed specifically to defeat a nearby boss. This isn't *always* the rule, and all of the bosses can be defeated in a wide variety of means. That really adds a lot to ... letting the player approach combat in creative ways.  The story is pretty good as well, and I won't talk too in-depth about its details, but it manages to weave its narrative in with its artwork and mechanics very well! The digital effects, the subversive effects in a not-quite-16bit world, and the biomechanical all work well together to give the game an alien atmosphere.  The music is enjoyable, too. Loads of synth. Probably my favorite track is the title music. It gave the correct first impression that it was a very electronic, oppressive atmosphere, but that you'd be READY for it.  My complaints with the game are minor.   Sound design only fails with hitting invulnerable armor. The sound effect stacks loudly.  There is a small issue with not having enough tools to identify whether or not you missed secrets regardless of the reminder system (you place waypoints on map regions that persist until replaced) because it's possible to miss secrets that are in plain sight by tiles that may not respond to the tools you had 2 hours ago. That doesn't happen very frequently, it should be noted, and most of the secrets can still be discovered by being thorough, and being gated by map access (blank spots in the map mark obvious ways to continue exploring as you upgrade). And again: The secrets I missed were ingeniously hidden.  Also there's a speedrun mode and a silly reference to Metroid if you're into that sort of thing. It's always interesting to look up such things after playing a beloved game and exhausting it of gameplay.
Date 2016-09-23 Playtime 19h 13m Rec Positive Le jeu a été développé par une seule et même personne, ce qui est incroyable quand on a joué au jeu : une bonne durée de vie, une DA recherchée, une profondeur de gameplay (peu ou pas de bug) surprenante....nombreuses sont les qualités.  On peut juste déplorer un scénario tout bidon.  Le créateur est sans aucun doute un amoureux de Métroïd et lui a rendu un très bel hommage.
Date 2016-09-23 Playtime 17h 8m Rec Positive It's a fun metroidvania game, the graphics and general art style will make those of us old enough to remember the NES feel incredibly nostalgic, while still being vibrant and unique enough for you young whipper-snappers to enjoy.  The game can feel a bit cheap and frustrating at times. In addition there are certain parts that lock you into a section of the game - which flies in the face of true metroidvania spirit.  I would recommend only getting this on sale though, as the full price is a bit steep for what this game is. 
Date 2016-09-23 Playtime 14h 3m Rec Positive Stellar.  Challenging, but never unplayable.  The ultimate fix for a metroidvania addict.          Great Mythos, fun weapons.    Measurable rewards for thorough exploration.         I want more like it.
Date 2016-09-22 Playtime 28h 58m Rec Positive Tom Happ is on the short list of legends of 1 man developers who manage to make a masterpiece.  This game is amazing, for so many reasons. Play it on Hard your first blind playthrough, do yourself a service. Maybe it should be noted, I'm not sure I would like this game as much as I do without a controller (I used a 360 corded).  Game is worth every penny.
Date 2016-09-21 Playtime 18h 16m Rec Positive Super Metroid except better in pretty much every aspect. Doesn't feel obligated to just lift mechanics and power-ups from Metroid.
Date 2016-09-21 Playtime 42h 0m Rec Positive Amazing game. Beautiful music.  A true successor to Super Metroid.  And all made by just 1 person.
Date 2016-09-19 Playtime 18h 32m Rec Positive Never has a metroidvania-style game so engrossed and unnerved me with imagery alone. This is the type of game Cthulhu itself would beam into your frontal cortex if it was pleased with your service.
Date 2016-09-19 Playtime 12h 0m Rec Positive great game buy it
Date 2016-09-16 Playtime 12h 25m Rec Positive The game is just awesome.  The amosphere/design of this masterpiece is like if H. R. Giger and H. P. Lovecraft would have a baby, so that would be it.  I was little bit worried about how a game controller(for PS3, yea sorry guys I can't stand controller for XBox) would react under ArchLinux. Just plugged one into the PC and no problem at all.   Thanks guys.
Date 2016-09-13 Playtime 40h 40m Rec Positive If you enjoyed the original Metroid you should DEFINITELY get this game. Beautiful art, great story, and lots of fun upgrades. Great game!!
Date 2016-09-11 Playtime 15h 38m Rec Positive Bon metroidvania. Musique super.  Vraiment un jeux a faire
Date 2016-09-11 Playtime 9h 29m Rec Positive A dodgy and convoluted storyline doesn't spoil a great little metroid style game.
Date 2016-09-11 Playtime 20h 2m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is one of those rare shining gems that surpass the quality of the genre defining games that influenced it.
Date 2016-09-09 Playtime 13h 40m Rec Positive nostálgico!!!
Date 2016-09-09 Playtime 13h 24m Rec Positive Le gameplay est vraiment intéressant. Il rapelle un peu le style de super metroid au super nintendo. Les graphiques sont bien fait, la musique est vraiment accrochante. L'histoire est bonne et l'impression général est plus qu'à la hauteur de mes attentes. Je le recommande fortement pour tout ceux qui aime les metroidvania. Ce jeu est assez original dans son genre.
Date 2016-09-09 Playtime 10h 11m Rec Positive Want a game that has great control, music, sound, levels, enemies, bosses, etc. similar to Super Metroid and more?  Buy this at any price. You won't be disappointed.   Some AAA studios could take a lesson or two from just the sound and music direction they did in this. Never before have I not been annoyed listening to the low health sound till this game perfected it.
Date 2016-09-06 Playtime 9h 17m Rec Positive Best Super Metroid since Super Metroid.
Date 2016-09-06 Playtime 15h 13m Rec Positive The best Metroid... I mean Metroidvania game I have played in a long time! If you are a fan of the classic Metroid games and looking for something to fulfill that itch, then this is the game for you. Its been 30yrs since the original Metroid, and with Nintendo not seeming to want to appeal to fans and give them a proper game, I dont see how you can pass this one up.  Its your classic 8-bit side scrolling style. Shoot first, ask questions later. Which you will by the way, the story is very good. Some people would say "Its a little to chatty", I would disagree, or say to you that everything is there for a reason and that forms the story that the developers are trying to tell.  All of the weapons are very interesting, each one with its own unique abilities and altarnite fire. As you progress through the game and unlock more weapons and abilities you are able to backtrack and access areas that were previously cut off.  I have to say also, the bosses in this game look amazing! The colore detail and art style of each boss looks awesome. So when you enter a boss fight, you really take the time to look them over and apriciate the hard work that went into designing this game.  One final note: The music to this game is gold! I will review the soundtrack sepratly, but during the game play the sound and music come together perfectly.
Date 2016-09-06 Playtime 10h 2m Rec Positive So far I'm having fun, Its definitely a good game to play to scratch the Metroid itch. The environments and music set the tone really well, and there is a lot of variety in the equipment. I love that the game makes you feel like a rat in a maze as opposed to a lot of modern games that insist on holding your hand, it feels refreshing to be challenged.  The only problem I experienced was that my controller didn't want to work for it, but playing on the keyboard isn't too tough, so I'll be fine.
Date 2016-09-05 Playtime 9h 29m Rec Positive Do you love Super Metroid?  Do you want to play a game that feels like a spiritual sequel to Super Metroid?  Then this game is for you.
Date 2016-09-04 Playtime 44h 3m Rec Positive Fantastic work of art. A masterpiece of one-person game design - a lovingly crafted personal vision that deserves recognition and acclaim. It's not perfect (I had to resort to a walkthrough more than I would have liked, having found areas to be a little hard to differentiate and remember, and I personally would have polished some of the controls differently) but overall I was very impressed. The art design and the story are both captivating, the gameplay has a surprising amount of diversity, and the game nails the nostalgic spirit it is going for. It was engaging and surprising - the worldbuilding and characters fascinated me and I find myself wantng to return to its Universe to learn more. Hopefully there will be many sequels or spin-offs.  If you want something that is reminiscent of Super Metroid while also being new and original, it's a must-try.
Date 2016-09-04 Playtime 31h 16m Rec Positive Game is great, gives a rush, and actually quite challenging as you shoot your way though! I reccomend this game to everyone!
Date 2016-09-04 Playtime 14h 34m Rec Positive It's hard to find a game that "gets" what made Metroid so good more than this. This game feels more like a Metroid game than the more recent sequels ever could. I whole heartedly recommend this game but still there are pros and cons to show because nothing is universal. Also note I did not pay full price for this game, I got it in the Metroidvania bundle during the Summer sale but would recommend it for the full price regardless.  Pros: -The controls are perfect; no awkward motions, button placement makes sense, easy to understand. -The aesthetic looks like something straight out of H.R. Geiger's works or the Alien franchise; everything is biomechanical and looks great for the game. -Few retro games actually capture the looks of what they try to emulate; this game honestly looks like it could be running on an NES. -Interesting psychological/sci-fi story reminiscient of the works of Phillip K. Dick -A lot to explore and find outside of what's required by the game's main story.  Cons: -Lack of direction; the game is so hands off there may be times where you're unsure of where to go or how to advance the game. -Some enemies move in ways that are frustrating to deal with almost to the point of being cheap. -If you're powered up with optional upgrades things can get trivial at times.  This is a great game. Any fan of the classic Metroid games should consider this.
Date 2016-09-03 Playtime 9h 50m Rec Positive Awesome plot. Catchy gameplay. Nice game.

Date 2016-09-02 Playtime 20h 39m Rec Positive You have an itch to play super metroid?   Well here's the answers to your prayers...axiom verge.  its the best metriod scratcher on the market.    It's unbelievable one person made this...thank you Thomas Happ.
Date 2016-09-02 Playtime 60h 15m Rec Positive Out of the great many platformers on Steam, this one stands as easily one of the best, in my opinion.  Even more surprising is that it ALL--story, graphics, and music included--were done by one man.  Pros:  -It's got an immersive story that keeps you guessing, even after the end. -There are a great many secrets to find, just like the Metroid games that so many people compare this one to.  Some of these secrets are not only powerups, but also notes that will reveal more of the backstory and possibly help you piece together the story as a whole. -The powerups are original and interesting, remiscent of what you might find in a Metroid game but still they have their own twist to them.  Cons: -The keyboard controls take a little bit of getting used to, even with extensive re-mapping.  Overall, if you are a fan of the Metroidvania genre, this is a must-have.
Date 2016-09-02 Playtime 7h 27m Rec Positive Metroid, but with a lot of it's own personality and identity. Top to bottom a very polished experience.
Date 2016-09-01 Playtime 11h 14m Rec Positive Awesome Metroid clone
Date 2016-08-31 Playtime 30h 35m Rec Positive Being the NES was my first system I got in 1985, yes I did only get Gyromite with ROB and Duck Hunt, Super Mario Bros had to be purchased separability. Axiom Verge is fun a adventure game of everything I love about games growing up. Axiom Verge is a game that I found that I can relax back and casually play as an adult for hours to unwind my mind. The game has is beautiful and reminds me what I loved playing as a kid.   I will be honest that I do not care much for 3-D first person shooters and that I have preference for overhead and 2-D side scrolling games that give me a world to explore rather than a level to complete. If you loved games like Legend of Zelda, Rygar (NES version only), Metroid, Castlevania (the explorer ones like Casltevania 2 or Symphony of the Night) this game gets it right on so many ways.

Date 2016-08-29 Playtime 35h 54m Rec Positive Superb. Probably my favourite game from 2015.
Date 2016-08-29 Playtime 18h 11m Rec Positive Algún día será un juego de culto si no lo es ya. Mis felicitaciones a su creador, normal que se haya llevado premios es bastante largo, tiene muchísimos secretos y vale el precio que tiene. Hereda muchas cosas de papi Simon Belmont y mami Samus Aran, en especial de ésta última. El final quedó abierto por lo que supongo que más adelante habrá una continuación y si no es así, un nuevo proyecto sería genial.
Date 2016-08-28 Playtime 40h 52m Rec Positive Great game and great story!!! Super metroid on seroids!!!
Date 2016-08-28 Playtime 29h 3m Rec Positive [h1] Таки обзор	[/h1] Если по какой-то причине Вы еще омневаетесь - брать или не брать? - [spoiler] не сомневайтесь и берите конечно же! [/spoiler] Это маленький шедевр, где идеально сплелось все - от музыки и сюжета до визуальных эффектов цифрового шума. Про игру уже много сказано и мой хвалебный отзыв потонет в сотне других, но я его оставлю для тех, кто так же как и я когда-то заглядывал на страницу продукта, читал отзывы и не мог понять: ну это же наркоманский метроид от непонятных авторов, чем так нравится, до идейных праотцов вряд ли дотянется? Надо окунуться и прочувствовать, ничего больше не нужно, приятной игры!
Date 2016-08-28 Playtime 52h 5m Rec Positive This is one of the best games I have ever played, certainly the single best metroidvanian game and I can hardly find an issue within.  Pros:  [list] [*] Incredibly cool setting [*] Nostalgia fest for NES/SNES generation gamers [*] Probably one of the best soundtracks ever made [*] Incredible art style [*] Extremely good controls on both gamepad and keyboard [*] Brilliant storytelling [*] Addictive [*] Fun [*] Some randomized secrets which can be challenging to find [*] Extremely brilliant puzzles [*] Normal, Hard and Speedrun mode options, well suited for casuals and people who want a challenge [*]Fully changeable controls on both keyboard and gamepad which a lot of games lack... [/list]  Cons: [list] [*] Sometimes, the control for the dash move is a tad annoying [/list]  Verdict: What else is there to say? Good job, Thomas Happ, more please! This game is one of the few that cuts it to 10/10 for me. Why? Because it is not a simple regurgitation of the genre but it actually takes it to the next level, while also taking in a lot of things already well done in other games.
Date 2016-08-28 Playtime 20h 14m Rec Positive It's Metroid but better. I mean it's not like nintendo is gonna make a new 2D metroid game anytime soon. And even if they did it would be hard to live up to this.
Date 2016-08-27 Playtime 17h 7m Rec Positive Probably the best game I've played in years. I am not a fan of Metroid and this game got me hooked. The exploring is definitley the best part, and finding all the guns and secrets.
Date 2016-08-27 Playtime 13h 38m Rec Positive This game did an amazing!! job at carrying the metroidvania spirit with it, it is easly up there in quality matching that of the metroid games! i love it a ton!! would recomend it to any metroid fan out there even the music was awesome!! though metroids music was better :P still music aside easly stands with the metroid games!
Date 2016-08-26 Playtime 22h 14m Rec Positive 前一段时间入手了好几个类银河战士恶魔城游戏，然而这个游戏直接命中了我大部分的游戏取向！逐渐丰富的操作和移动能力，功能及弹道各异的武器，敌人和AI种类也还算丰富，地图大小和游戏难度也适合。如果可以的话求官方出个简体中文和繁体中文！
Date 2016-08-25 Playtime 25h 4m Rec Positive This is what's called a Metroidvania game, one of the finer ones in this category. If you enjoyed either of these nes games here:  Metroid, or Blaster Master (or Castlevania on NES), you'll enjoy this one.  8bit themed game, almost looks as if it could have come right off the NES or any of the similar 8bit systems, graphics music and all.  It can be unforgiving at times with a few of the bosses, but other than that, it's a pretty decently-balanced game.  It's nice because, if you're not strong enough, most times you can go back and get out of an area and power-up some more.  I have played through the game in full, and I definitely feel that if you're into 8bit or retro-style gaming, you'll enjoy this one and get your money's worth.    So if you like Metroid, a game which this is most-like, do pick this one up.  It's not just a clone, it's rather innovative, as if Metroid had never existed, and this was created in it's place.  Lots of weapon choices, health nodes to increase your total health, fragments of health nodes and weapon power ups to enhance exploration desires/reward.  Quite a bit of fun actually.    Most people who could beat Super Metroid, would be able to beat this one.  If you find some of the bosses difficult, make sure you got all the power ups you may have missed.  Super-secret areas abound, but nothing too difficult to find, though.  Exploration is quite rewarding as said earlier, but not tedious, usually.  There are guides if you get stuck!  A must-buy if you have a collection of retro games.
Date 2016-08-25 Playtime 10h 30m Rec Positive When people ask me what my favorite Metroid game is, I always say Axiom Verge.
Date 2016-08-24 Playtime 11h 5m Rec Positive Quite possibly the best "Metroid" game in over 10 years, Axiom Verge is the closest thing to a proper sequel to Super Metroid we're ever gonna get. Beautiful Spritework, music that is driving and wonderfully atmospheric at the right times, varied environments and weapons with great variety all make Axiom Verge stand out among other 2d indie metroidvanias that litter the market. Most suprisingly the game was made by a Single Developer! If you are a fan of Metroid, Hard Sci Fi or just games in general definitely don't miss this game
Date 2016-08-23 Playtime 15h 13m Rec Positive When I first learned of Axiom Verge, I immediately sent the trailer to a friend.  His response was something along the lines of, “It's Metroid...” He was partially correct.  The striking likeness to the acclaimed Nintendo series is what I initially found attractive.  At the time I even recall hearing that it was an outright clone.  It turns out this is mostly false.  Super Cyborg is closer to what I might call a clone (and that's not necessarily a bad thing).  Although its influences are obvious, Axiom Verge still brings a lot of originality to the table.  The game follows Trace through his adventure on Sudra.  Once the seat of an advanced civilization, the planet is now mostly overrun by flora and fauna.  Perilously close to the planet exists a spacial anomaly of sorts called the Breach.  Due to Sudra's proximity to the Breach, parts of the world are less stable than others.  This lack of stability, or perhaps corruption would be a better word, ends up playing a major part in several game mechanics.  As you explore the world you (may) encounter the many notes that are scattered about.  They function as one of the prime ways the story is conveyed, the other main way being dialogue.  There is surprisingly detailed story here, but the game makes very little effort to spoon-feed it to you.  It's easy to miss out on large chunks of lore if you don't spend significant time exploring.  While searching the map you're also likely to find some of the many weapons, upgrades, tools, and other secrets.  One of the more innovative items is the Address Disruptor.  It allows you to corrupt enemies and de-corrupt parts of the map.  Glitching has several different effects on enemies.  Sometimes they become less hazardous, other times they perform beneficial actions, and occasionally they take on characteristics of a different enemy type.  It is a cool concept that I don't recall having seen in other games.  There are a staggering number of weapons, so many in fact that I probably barely used half of them.  Most of them are pretty cool, but some are certainly easier to use than others. While the game does feature a quick swap option, the ability to omit weapons entirely from the weapons wheel would have been nice.  Although I only extensively used a little more than a handful of weapons, I imagine that on a planned run certain guns may be especially handy due to their proximity to your route through the game.  There is a speedrun mode, and I'm sure that players interested in that will be able to find sequence breaks and boss quick kills.  Aside from scouring the map for every item, this is where most of the replay value will come from.  There are achievements for beating the game under a certain time and finishing with under a certain percentage of items. It's all very reminiscent of the sort of challenge runs I remember people trying in Super Metroid.  I found some of the boss battles to be a little simplistic,  and couldn't help but wonder if this was an intentional design choice to make things faster for people running the game.  If nothing else, they're very impressive visually.  Several of the bosses are gargantuan, not unlike the regions of Sudra in which they reside.  All of the areas feel different from each other and very alien.  There are a few rooms in particular that appear to be there specifically to give the player an idea of the scope of this place.  It's clear a significant amount of time and effort went into creating every aspect of this world.  I doubt it actually abides to NES technical and color limitations (this is probably for the best), but it certainly managed to give me a hefty dose of nostalgia.  The majority of the soundtrack is good, and I especially enjoyed the track “Trace Rising.”  However there was one song (“Inexorable” is the title) that I disliked so much that after hearing it a few times I wanted to mute my speakers while traveling in that region.  The song's vocal sample quickly became grating.  Despite a few flaws, Axiom Verge is a fun ride.  As the credits rolled I was reminded of something remarkable, this game was developed entirely by Thomas Happ.  He has created a solid and memorable game that pays tributes to his inspirations while still remaining original enough to stand on its own.  I've heard he might expand the franchise and I really hope he does as I'd definitely like to revisit it.  I'd recommend this game to fans of 2D Metroid titles, and people that enjoy exploration.  Don't go into it expecting it to be a clone though, because it's different in more than a few ways.  [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25660729-CelerySpin/]Like the review?

Date 2016-08-23 Playtime 9h 13m Rec Positive Leafy's simple review - #11  Axiom verge: the title itself is so good! Metroid? Definitely inspired by it, yet, has its own unique charm that perhaps was a lesser (or closer?) model towards the spacey, sci-fi, surrealistic gameplay and art.
Date 2016-08-22 Playtime 16h 6m Rec Positive Excellent metroidvania.  Controls are responsive, gameplay is top notch, plot weaves through the game quite well.  And oh boy, it's hard to believe how much you missed the first time through an area.
Date 2016-08-21 Playtime 12h 18m Rec Positive I'm a big fan of the Metroidvania style games.  This one feels pretty good.  This one definitely feels Super Metroidy while being completely it's own game.  Highlights: -Art style, loved it. -Bosses were fun -Lots to explore! -Soundtrack was fairly good. -I  like the idea of the glitch weapon.  A homage to the glitchy NES days, but instead it's a part of the game play. -Lightning gun was awesomely hilarious (who ya gonna call) -Shifting through walls, cool stuff. -General game play.  Things I didn't care for: -There were way too many weapons.  Most I didn't even end up using, so they acted more like collectables than anything else. -Xbox controller, for some reason it was real easy to accidently switch weapons unintentionally.  This got obnoxious during some close combat fights. -This may have been intentional, but angle shooting was a bit of a pain. -I would have probably enjoyed the back story more if peicing it together wasn't so all over the place.  Over all, for anyone who likes the retro/Metroidvania style game, I HIGHLY recommend this game.
Date 2016-08-20 Playtime 26h 26m Rec Negative I have attempted to play and finish this game on three different occasions throughout the years. It always loses me in the same spot several hours in. Can't figure out where to go, what to do. Everything is a puzzle and you are abused for making a single mistake. Not fun. Shame, because the story and concept is really interesting.
Date 2016-08-19 Playtime 12h 11m Rec Negative В первую очередь хороший платформер - значит платформер с хорошим управлением. Об этой игре такого сказать нельзя. Очень легко запутаться в карте и в итоге заблудиться. Некоторые моменты вообще не поддаются логике, приходилось пользоваться видеопрохождением в интернете. Как платформер, эта игра предлагает много интересных фишечек. Так, например, после прохождения четверти игры, станет доступным высокий прыжок, который позволит вам забираться в те места, в которые раньше вы попасть не могли. Абсолютно тоже самое можно сказать о мини-телепорте. Отдельное спасибо за боссов, каждый из них требует изучения и многократных попыток его убить.  В целом, видно что сделана игра со стараниями и уважением к деталям. Однако, плохое управление и запутанность карты портят впечатление от игры.  5/10
Date 2016-08-18 Playtime 20h 3m Rec Positive Simply, this is how you do a solid Metroidvania. PC Users can't play Metroid? No worries, Axiom Verge is just great  - Interesting and profound plot - solid gameplay (more than 10 different weapons + other tools) and good differentiation for the enemies - lots of secrets - loved the graphic, suits perfectly. Good mix with pixel art and some special effects.  5 words: Great game, must buy it!
Date 2016-08-18 Playtime 18h 20m Rec Positive As someone who played the original Metroid as a kid, Axiom Verge hit me right in the nostalgia, and it felt great.  The soundtrack is also fantastic and I listen to it quite often.
Date 2016-08-18 Playtime 14h 29m Rec Positive A wonderful tribute to games such as Super Metroid and Castevania: Symphony of Night. Probably one of the best games ive played in years and definitely up there on my favorite games of all time.
Date 2016-08-18 Playtime 18h 20m Rec Positive Axiom Verge scratches the Metroid side of my metroidvania-itch better than most games that get lumped into that genre, but in the end some frustrating choices in design sour the experience.  PROS: + Visual design is fantastic and uses excellent contrast of colour to bring the world to life. + Soundtrack keeps you pumped with some amazing tunes that never get irritating + Interesting ability upgrades keep this from being just a Metroid-clone  CONS: + Some items are hidden without even minor visual indicators. An on map indicator (a dot) does exist for if an area is complete, but nothing in-game explains what this means. + Using the Glitch-Gun in some very specific scenarios results in different effects that are required to access some upgrades. + In-general finding all items in the game seems at it's worst leaves you feeling defeated, not triumphant.  MEHS: + No weapons feels like it has the gravitas of one from Metroid, and while there's a number of them, there's not so much that they simply feel like equipment as in Castlevania + Dialog - it's not super exposition-y, but I often felt like all I cared about was getting back into the flow of the game.  Conclusion: 7 arbitrary points out of 10, 8 if you got the cravings, 6 or less if you have no idea what metroid is.
Date 2016-08-17 Playtime 34h 29m Rec Positive Its the metroid sequel we all want that nintendo refuses to make 10/10 buy it
Date 2016-08-17 Playtime 12h 18m Rec Positive near pefect except for shooting downwards, locking your guy in place to shoot and the occasional game crash for no apparent reason. only crashed once. and the level with the giant boss Uruku, like the 3rd boss in has THE WORST MOST ANNOYING EAR DISINTEGRATING MUSIC. Sounds like your deaf grandma wailing from beyond the grave. INSTANT MIGRAINE STUFF. what and the flying rat turd! who makes unbeatable bosses!
Date 2016-08-15 Playtime 12h 24m Rec Positive Leia ouvindo essa música que faz parte da fantástica Ost de Axiom Verge. [h1] [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICcGa5DxXxY]Youtube - Axiom Verge Ost 8-Inexorable[/url][/h1]    Imagine um jogo que todos (ou a maioria) sempre pediu para uma desenvolvedora fazer, mas nunca fez, ou deu ouvidos. Imagine isso há anos sendo pedido. Agora coloque o nome do jogo de Metroid, e da desenvolvedora de Nintendo. Axiom Verge é um jogo com inspirações extremas de Metroid, além de ser, é claro, metroidvania, ele é, e parece muito com o Super Metroid.  Uma coisa muito interessante é que  Axion Verge foi feito por apenas uma pessoa, Tom Happ fez as músicas, gráficos e desenvolveu tudo sozinho.  O cientista chamado Trace e seu companheiro, Hammond, estão fazendo um tipo de experimento nas montanhas do novo México em 2005. Algo dá errado e uma explosão acontece, desmoronando todo o laboratório. Trace acorda em um lugar estranho, e uma voz o guia por esse lugar, onde ele vai descobrir vários segredos.  Axion Verge tem um enredo muito bom, uma história ci-fi com pontos, e até plottwist interessantes. É o tipo de história que não é previsível e desperta o interesse, fazendo você se perguntar: o que está acontecendo? Porque? Como?   Como um metroidvania que se preze, há muitos lugares secretos com equipamentos de tiro diferentes, ou powerups que aumenta saúde, poder de tiro e alcance do mesmo. São vários equipamentos de tiro.  Outros equipamentos que tem (efeito passivo) são os tipos: pulo maior, um drone que o jogador controla com o intuito de entrar em lugares menores, entre outros que tem a afinidade de prosseguir no game, como uma roupa nova que faz o jogador atravessar paredes finas.   Outra coisa que também fica escondido são os arquivos de leitura, que explica (ou confunde) mais o enredo do game. Alguns desses arquivos estão em outras línguas, como a Sudra, que é uma língua de outro planeta. Para conseguir ler esses arquivos, algum outro arquivo escondido terá um código para colocar em uma tela específica no menu de pause, ao colocar, ele vai automaticamente traduzir esses arquivos em língua alienígena.   Graficamente é muito bonito, pixelart 2d muito bem feito. A trilha sonora é fantástica, toda original, um eletrônico com melodias tristes, bem estilão ci-fi e cyberpunk, não sou fã de eletrônico, mas gosto quando esse tipo de música e inserida de um jeito bem feito, com o contexto da história, tanto em filmes como em jogos. Um bom exemplo de trilha sonora inserida com sucesso é do Half life 2, que é sensacional e usa esse estilo de música também. As trilhas que mais gostei de Axiom Verge foi o do cenário Ukkin-Na [Amnesia] e do Kur [Inexorable], totalmente viciante.  A dificuldade, pelo menos no difícil (onde comecei a jogar) é bem alta, morri diversas vezes. Alguns bosses são difíceis e outros bem fáceis, no todo é um jogo que você vai morrer bastante (pelo menos no modo difícil), não sei dizer algo sobre o modo normal por não ter jogado, acredito que não seja algo muito complicado.   Eu demorei, segundo o profile do jogo, 20 horas, mas na steam eu só tenho 12 horas jogadas. Fiquei um tempo sem internet na época que eu estava jogando, talvez o steam não conta o tempo do jogo quando está off-line, não sei dizer. Mas uma coisa é certa, é um jogo bem longo, ainda mais se o jogador for procurar os itens e armas escondidas.  Axiom verge é o Metroid que todos nós pedimos, (e torcemos para que em um futuro próximo aconteça) para a Nintendo fazer, mas nunca fez. E um metroidvania de alta qualidade, tanto sonora quanto graficamente, e claro, divertido e com um enredo muito interessante. Jogue, não irá se arrepender!
Date 2016-08-14 Playtime 23h 56m Rec Positive A 2D platformer in the style of Metroid. Lots of backtracking and looking for secrets. The geometrical map in the game often makes this a bit challenging as it provides very little information. There was an update post-launch that improved it a bit but it is still flawed. But as a whole the game is still a good challenge on the harder difficulty and there are a few game modes (i.e. speedrun) that give the game some replayability. I would recommend the game to anyone who is a fan of retro games; also cause I only buy games I feel are worth investing time into.
Date 2016-08-13 Playtime 17h 51m Rec Positive Super Metroid has always been one of my favorite games ever since I was a kid. After beating this game, I've come to the conclusion that it is better than SM in almost every way.  I wish more people played this game, it's so great. I consider it a masterpiece. I want more!
Date 2016-08-13 Playtime 10h 19m Rec Positive fun ass fuck
Date 2016-08-13 Playtime 23h 27m Rec Positive By far one of the best metroid games Ive played in years. Got it on sale and it was worth the wait.  Great exploration with a Good story narrative. If your a fan of these type of games I highly recommend you give this a try.
Date 2016-08-12 Playtime 14h 9m Rec Positive Now THIS is a Metroid game. Yes, I'm looking at you Other M.
Date 2016-08-12 Playtime 13h 44m Rec Positive Challenging 2D experience with an amazing soundtrack. Highly recommended.
Date 2016-08-11 Playtime 30h 19m Rec Positive This is a great metroidvania game very reminiscent of the first Metroid.
Date 2016-08-11 Playtime 56h 58m Rec Positive Hate how Nintendo REFUSES to make an actual Metroid game and instead just keeps making spinoffs? Wish there was a game that was like how Metroid used to be? Axiom Verge has you covered.
Date 2016-08-10 Playtime 18h 35m Rec Positive This game is fantastic! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the old metroid games. Has many similarities, but just as many differences. 10/10, probably my favorite indie game. I wish they would make more games like this one.
Date 2016-08-10 Playtime 0h 42m Rec Positive Finished this game a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it.   + Really, really great music + Good Metroidvania design + Sweet pixel graphics  - No real reason to use the different weapons - The story was uninteresting - Some annoying bosses  Well designed game which I recommend. It's hard to belive only one guy made the entire game.  (I played the PS4 version)
Date 2016-08-10 Playtime 33h 9m Rec Positive I'm having flashbacks to Metroid, and The Guardian Legend.  (Ok, I may be heaping a little too much praise on it. It's still really good!)
Date 2016-08-09 Playtime 15h 40m Rec Positive Awesome game!
Date 2016-08-08 Playtime 20h 49m Rec Positive Loved every minute of it! Epic game with a killer soundtrack. Old school love here boys and girls. Scoop it up if you like Sci Fi, Metroid, and Contra. Play it on hard difficulty even on your first playthrough, normal  is a waste of good suffering.
Date 2016-08-08 Playtime 14h 56m Rec Positive A pretty good Metroid inspired platformer developed completely by one person. Axiom Verge is probably the most successful indie Metroid style game outside ofCave Story. (I'm excluding other Metroidvanias as many of them focus or feature melee combat).  There's about 14hrs of content if your not a completionist on Hard difficulty (I completed it just under 14hrs with 95% of the map discored, 77% items, 36 deaths). Hard isn't terribly difficult, but there are some very cheap enemy placement and unfair-ish boss battles. There is an acheievement for not dying, but I find damage unavaoidable in many spots of the game.  The game is unique enough on it's own, interms of it's art style, soundtrack and item pickups. You'd probably expect the typical Double/Super Jumps, Morphball/Crawl powerup, Super bomb and flight upgrades, but many of the power ups are JUST different enough to be unique, even if the function is similar to most Metroidvania games. By the end of the game, I had too many weapons and it feels like Thomas Happ had to "fill in secret spots with items" and instead should have had some weapons be upgraded. It is as if he had fun making different weapon types and putting them in the game, versus thinking what should actually be in the game.  The story is also unique in comparison to Metroid, but I'm not convinced it's satisfying. (NOT A SPOILER) I'll just say that the ending either hints at a sequel or hints at more to come if you get a higher compeltion rate, but I didn't feel I earned a big story reward.   If you're a perfectionist/elitist when it comes to your came, you may not love Axiom Verge, and the newly released Metroid 2 Remake Project AM2R might be more your style, but this is still a solid game that outshines many games developed by more than one person.
Date 2016-08-08 Playtime 26h 25m Rec Positive 爽的飞起，根本停不下来
Date 2016-08-08 Playtime 11h 44m Rec Positive I am ashamed that I was a cheapskate and tried to wait it out until the price dropped more significantly than 20-30%. This game has proven itself to be well worth full price, and I don't think I'm anywhere near finished.  * Controls are razor sharp. Fighing the controls doesn't exist. If something went wrong, it's your fault. * Environments are weird and wonderful and disquieting and varied without having to resort to Lovecraftian mythos. * Powerups start out predictable, but then they get interesting. It's good to see there's room for a metroid game with something else in place of the overly-familiar metroid bits. * The music is a work of art on its own. Do yourself a favor and get the bundle with the soundtrack.
Date 2016-08-07 Playtime 37h 24m Rec Positive honstely if you want a metriod game thats not from nintendo this is the game for you. the controlles feels great and the music puts in the right mood but the story is so confusing and its very easy to get lost to
Date 2016-08-07 Playtime 17h 14m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a classic-style Metroidvania game (heavy on the "Metroid" part - as in, they could be long-lost twins). So, as someone whose list of top favorite games of all time contains Metroid and Super Metroid right up at the very top, you can probably guess how I felt about this… I loved it. The way I see it, if you're going to pay homage to the best, you may as well go all out, and do it right. And on that front, Axiom Verge does not disappoint. So if you’re a fan of those games (or the 2D Castlevanias, etc) then this is a no-brainer.   The game is extremely well-designed, looks great, has a good soundtrack, and plays well (for the most part). You can't ask for much else. I enjoyed the exploration, item collecting, boss battles, story, and the overall atmosphere of the game. My only small gripes have to do with the way a couple of the game mechanics work (or rather, don’t work) - specifically, the grapple tool and the dash/teleport ability were way too finicky and/or inconsistent to pull off, for my tastes. I'll concede that part of the issue is probably that I used the control stick on the controller rather than the D-pad for primary movement, which makes those abilities harder to reliably pull off, but in my opinion, that should have been accounted for as part of the design. In particular, the dash/teleport ability just didn’t work consistently enough for me, and made a few parts of the game extremely frustrating. But other than that, I really can't think of any other complaints.   All in all, this is about as good a game as one could possibly hope for in the classic Metroid style. It's a game I could/would have probably made myself, if I weren't too old and lazy now (or, like, had no job or family). So major kudos to the developer (just 1 guy) who not only had that technical know-how, but also the time, ambition, and dedication I lack, who actually followed through and made this. It's a very, very, impressive piece of work, and well worth checking out for anyone who is a fan of this genre, or classic-style 2D action-platformers in general.
Date 2016-08-07 Playtime 36h 29m Rec Positive A fantastic love letter to the metroidvania style games. Wonderful from start to finish. Lots to do, and has replay value. About 8 - 9 hours of play time for a first run. I tried to get everything and still missed a few items and a weapon.  Highly recommended.
Date 2016-08-07 Playtime 16h 47m Rec Positive This game brought me back to my childhood playing Super Metroid until early hours of the morning. While Metroid had a more scientific mysteria feel to it, this suggests more of a "Bladerunner" experience more than anything else.   Great game, looking forward to the sequel.
Date 2016-08-07 Playtime 0h 33m Rec Negative I want to start by saying that as a game of this type, it is wonderful. But, to be perfectly honest about it, it basically is Metroid - almost in every single possible way. The graphics are better than Super Metroid, and the music is better, but aside from that this is not a different game. i loved the Metroid games, but even more, the Castlevania games after SOTN, and was hoping for something more in that vein. Or if not, at least something original. This game is not what I was looking for.
Date 2016-08-05 Playtime 21h 35m Rec Positive Anyone who has ever loved metroidvanias owe it to themselves to check out this game.  In a world where we have endless rehashes or clones of the games that spawned this genre, Axiom Verge is a shining example of a reinvention of the style.  The graphical style is clearly inspired by Super Metroid and other 16-bit games from that era.  I have always had a problem with recent metroidvanias with the over-used style of "Get item A to get item B to get item C to get item D, etc" that makes it seem like you're seeing the same corridor hundreds of time as you pass back and forth through it.  If the metroidvania is done well, you don't notice that you're passing through the same area over and over again.  Axiom Verge doesn't over-use the same pathing, and even allows multiple paths in some instances.  The theming is beautiful and dark, while also keeping the game upbeat and moving forward.  The story is intriguing and always makes the player wonder what else there is.  Overall, a must-play for any metroidvania fan or for platformer fans in general.
Date 2016-08-05 Playtime 39h 41m Rec Positive Words can not express how long true Metroid/Blaster Master/Rygar/Bionic Comando/Castlevania etc.. fans have waited for a game like this.   I just finished with 96% of the map and 86% of the items.   Finally a game made based on taking you on an adventure instead of making some stupid company a buttload of cash.   Thomas Happ you are a genius. Sorry about your dog.  10000000/10
Date 2016-08-04 Playtime 12h 12m Rec Positive Man, if you at ALL have enjoyed a Metroid game in the past... this is right up your alley.  It's not just a knockoff though, there's a huge variety of weapons and interesting game mechnics, and a really cool little storyline.  I'm crazy glad I got this and played through it.  So good.
Date 2016-08-03 Playtime 18h 50m Rec Positive Pretty fun Metroidvania, Lots to explore and pretty fun. the later enemies are a bit cheap but still fun. only complaint is a lot of weapons felt useless.
Date 2016-08-02 Playtime 13h 10m Rec Positive メトロイドヴァニアというよりメトロイド。めっちゃメトロイド。日本語対応。 主人公の科学者トレースは実験中の事故で気を失う。目覚めた先は不思議なクリーチャーが跋扈する異世界。 この異世界から脱出するため様々なマップを探索する。  マップを探索することで手に入るアイテムにより、探索できる箇所が広がる、この手のゲームではベーシックな作り。 アイテムには壁すり抜け、ドローン射出、瞬間移動、敵と環境をバグらせる装置など多岐にわたり、視覚的な演出で楽しませてくれる。 武器の種類もびっくりするほど多く、終盤に手に入るような武器は特に画面効果が派手で楽しい。 それ以外にも、この世界に纏わるストーリーを解説してくれる文章や、細かいパワーアップアイテムなど、悪魔城で意味もなく壁を攻撃して隠し要素見つけようとしてたプレイヤーも満足させてくれる程度には探索要素は充実している。  ゲームの難易度は低め。ボスも意地悪な攻撃をしてくるわけではない。 例えアクションゲームが苦手でも攻略できてしまうだろう。 逆に、難易度設定を上げても敵の攻撃パターンが変わるわけではないので、歯応えのあるアクションゲームを楽しみたい人には物足りないかもしれない。 1周のプレイ時間は10時間前後。 マルチエンディングとなっているので、それらを踏破するとしたら15時間前後だろうか。 それ以外にもTAS向けのタイムアタックモードも付属している。  16bit風のドット絵や、その当時っぽい音楽はとてもよく出来ている。 操作に対するレスポンスもとても良い。 世界観とバックグラウンドストーリーも、不気味なクリーチャー達と共にユニークな物だと感じた。  気になることとしては、拠点間ワープが無いため何度も同じ所を行ったり来たりする必要があること。 これは公式でのタイムアタックモードが付いてるからかもしれないが、単純に不便なのでノーマルモードでは付けて欲しかった。  良質なメトロイドヴァニアをプレイしたい人、2Dメトロイドの新作を待っている人にお勧め。
Date 2016-08-01 Playtime 19h 16m Rec Positive Este juego fue disenado por una sola persona, y el resultado me pregunras. Pues te dire: Es excelente.
Date 2016-07-31 Playtime 17h 4m Rec Positive Um dos melhores metroidvanias que eu já joguei
Date 2016-07-30 Playtime 10h 52m Rec Negative THe game is pretty fun for the first couple hours, until that boss shows up. And there are a bunch of undodgeable minions rushing you, popping up right under you, as you get to the middle of the game. The worst thing is there is no way to heal up except visiting the checkpoint or hoping minions droping red dots, and it's so easy to get damaged.  Overall, the story is good, the setting is good, but the game balance is rediculous.
Date 2016-07-29 Playtime 12h 15m Rec Positive Holy crap was this game an experience.  Music is great. Gameplay is solid. Story will have you thinking long and hard. Holds true to a metroidvania. If you grew up with Metroid, do give it a try. The only downsides are some weapons feel useless and there is a huge difficulty spike at the end of the game though I enjoyed the latter.
Date 2016-07-29 Playtime 7h 35m Rec Positive Great game in the Metroidvania style that still manages to do it's own thing.
Date 2016-07-29 Playtime 6h 57m Rec Positive 本人第一次写评测，这游戏让我找到了小时候玩FC魂斗罗和NDS恶魔城的快感，找BOSS弱点，你能摸它，它不能摸你那种爽快，在这个喧嚣的时代，各种打着3A画面而无内涵的游戏，这种复古的画面，饱满的战斗体验给了我太多惊喜！强烈推荐！
Date 2016-07-28 Playtime 35h 5m Rec Positive I love the metroid games, but I love this even more. The setting is amazing and the soundtrack is too.
Date 2016-07-28 Playtime 15h 30m Rec Positive One of the best and memorable games I've played recently. I love the style and atmosphere. The story is just enough interesting but not so much that it takes away from the gameplay.  I love that the creator allows the player to explore and awards them  for doing so. The soundtrack is amazing, every song fit exactly with each area.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Metroid, exploration, or even H.R. Higher. 10/10.
Date 2016-07-27 Playtime 0h 47m Rec Positive addictive
Date 2016-07-26 Playtime 31h 15m Rec Positive Probably one of the best sidescrolling classic Metroidesque games I have played in the last 20 years.  I can't speak highly enough about it, it's minimilistic story fits well with the genre and can easily be expanded upon in possible future games.  Games which I await with near giddy anticipation.  If this had been made in the 1990's Axiom Verge would be have quite easily been a must buy, and Happ would have undeniably been a name synonymous with the genre, the way Koji Igarashi is with Castlevania.
Date 2016-07-26 Playtime 25h 17m Rec Negative This game was really really fun at the beggining. But for some reason the hardest boss is in the middle. Which I guess could be looked at as a minor design flaw, but this boss is un beatable. I spent almost 3 hours trying to beat it, despite looking up every online guide I could find. This is clearly a mistake on the developers part. Something must have been overlooked by mistake.  Once I spend 3 hours doing the same thing over and over again with no success, the game is no longer fun for me to play.
Date 2016-07-24 Playtime 15h 0m Rec Positive Finally, a new Metroid.
Date 2016-07-23 Playtime 19h 57m Rec Positive This game remined me off all my old memories playing games like metroid. There are alot of hidden items for you too find and alot of different weapons to use against the creatures in the game. I really liked the overall story as it has some great twists, and the graphics are very nice too. I learned that this game was made by one talented guy, very impressed with the game.
Date 2016-07-23 Playtime 21h 3m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a shining example in the Metroidvania genre with a fantastic soundtrack and a confusing yet intriguing narrative. It definitely has that hardcore element and most players will need a walkthrough for some of the more onerous/demanding challanges. Recommended for fans of the genre.
Date 2016-07-23 Playtime 11h 31m Rec Positive If you miss the days of Super Metroid, then look no further than Axiom Verge.  It follows the idea and formula of one of the most beloved Metroidvanias to the letter, while putting its own spins on the formula.  If you liked Super Metroid, buy this.
Date 2016-07-22 Playtime 15h 8m Rec Positive If you want the good old metroid 2d games back, this is the perfect fix for you.
Date 2016-07-20 Playtime 15h 39m Rec Positive As a major fan of Super Metroid, this is a wet dream come true.
Date 2016-07-20 Playtime 36h 13m Rec Positive love the creepy feel to this game.
Date 2016-07-20 Playtime 61h 37m Rec Positive Si pudiera le regalaría una copia de este juego a cada miembro de steam, llevo toda una vida jugando viedojuegos y pocos me han gustado como éste, asombroso en su arte y su música, un modo de juego versatil,  y lo mejor de todo: una historia por demás envolvente e interesante; pocas veces terminar un juego me causó emoción y algo de pena a la vez
Date 2016-07-20 Playtime 10h 0m Rec Positive J'ai énormément apprécié ce jeu, simple à prendre en main, très bonne jouabilite, et très gratifiant chaque fois qu'on bloque quelque part puis qu'on finit par trouver la solution. Un tout petit peu déçu par l'histoire dont j'espérais plus. Un grand bravo à son développeur qui a tout fait tout seul.
Date 2016-07-19 Playtime 25h 13m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a decent Metroidvania if you have that itch that needs to be scratched.  The game is a bit slow to get going, so I may as well address negatives first.   -	Movement initially stiff/not for sequence breaking It takes a while before you so much as get high jump boots and prior to that, there’s nothing like dashing or means of navigating small spaces, so it feels as if you’re stuck running around a giant maze.  The movement isn’t rigid in the way that Castlevania III is, but there’s not much you can do to adjust your y-axis level for quite some time.  The multitude of walls and barriers subsequently ensure that you’re never in a spot the developer doesn’t want you to be in before you’re supposed to get there.   -	Game feels like it was made in phases The initial few settings you’re involved in… well, despite the fact that you’re dealing with a formerly inhabited planet gone to semi-ruin, it’s hard to tell what purpose any of the environments served.  Some appear to have functions.  Others do not.  Additionally, the initial music tracks are a bit more chiptuney, culminating in a track in lower Kur with digitized singing that is not only bad, but doesn’t make sense in context of the caves you’re running around at present.  -	Passcode system because passcode system The game wanted to consciously make the “JUSTIN BAILEY” nod, and well, okay, but the passcodes are not well-integrated other than to get you the capacity to read a few notes in translation/flesh out the lore or later jimmy open a few hidden passages, which you’d have to backtrack to and then seek out to find.  The rewards are worth it, but the reality is that after the game has been out and people have found the locations, it boils down to “find location, punch in code, grab item, forget you have the code system again.”  -	Story exists in fits and starts This is either a plus or a minus.  Do you really care about a story?  Well, Axiom Verge is really trying to have a story here, with a bunch of potential interdimensional and/or time travel and ethical questions and morally ambiguous characters.  The trouble is that the story is usually used as a denouement in either reading the notes or immediately following a boss battle.  Despite the fact that you have the Ruskali stationed at various intervals throughout the planet and they’re your NPC helpers, you can’t really interact with them and you may go through periods of just poking your head in to see what they’re up to and getting no reaction at all.  Kind of a bummer.  As for the story itself, it’s trying to be deep and convoluted and while it’s nothing too extraordinary, it seems to be well-executed enough, if you’re thinking that specific slip-ups are intentional or could be made to be intentional.  It's a lot to complain about at the outset and I wasn’t initially a fan, but it does get better and more playable.  + Pretty darned good soundtrack! “Cellular Skies,” which plays in the overworld portion of Kur, might be one of my favorite tracks I’ve heard in a game in a while and from there, all the new regions have good, atmospheric tacks that are complementary of the overall atmosphere.  In particular, the Edin track, “Phosphene,” is very subdued and fits a backdrop where you can see open plains dotted by bits and pieces of ruined alien architecture.  + WEEPONS! Axiom really goes all out with the weapon selection for a shooty game.  If you’re comparing it to Metroid, you may be disappointed by the inability to combine weapons, but most of them have their own utilities and strategies and there are a bunch of them that one could conceivably use regularly during the game, discounting the fact that one is waaaaay better than the others and some, like the Firewall and Reversible Slicer, are unlikely to have any great functionality.  + Glitch Gun! It’s a sort of doofy method of changing enemy behaviors and opening up blocked off passages, but the Glitch Gun is pretty fun to use and handles well enough, along with having some interesting results.  I think that it makes the game a bit easy in stretches when you can get enemies to puke up health restoration.  I also don’t really get how you’re causing flora and fauna to trip out by shooting bio-mechanical whatsits at them, but whatever.  + Drone Travel! Midway through the game, Trace gets the ability to spit up a wee bitty squid that he can then use to navigate small spaces and fight enemies.  It's a plus over the "how does this work" morph ball of Metroid fame that, in Prime, led to countless space pirates getting mangled in confused attempts to replicate it. Your squid can shoot lasers and fight dudes and as you fill out your upgrades, it's finally possible to teleport to its location and go through silly processes to gain infinite height.  By then, you don't really need infinite height, but I explored one of my last map blocks that way.  + Secret Worlds! Remember when you played Metroid for the NES and bombed through some wall only to find yourself in an environment that you couldn’t tell whether you were supposed to continue on to get a prize or if it was even possible to do so.  Axiom Verge generates those on purpose and makes your screen look like a CRT to notify you it’s doing it.  Hot.  I’d say this is probably the second-most enjoyable Metroidvania I’ve played that was made by a single person, after Cave Story, which plays a bit better despite having not much reason to revisit a lot of the territories as you get in Axiom Verge.
Date 2016-07-18 Playtime 26h 33m Rec Positive このゲーム25時間もやってたのか…驚愕 面白いし、道なりに敵を抹殺して移動するだけなら難易度は低い メモとかアイテムコンプ目指すと途端に一々そこら辺チェックして回るゲームになる メトロイドヴァニアがそういうゲームだと言われればそれまでだが、移動に難があるので正直疲れた。 ワープさせてくれても良かったんじゃないだろうか… 隅々まで探したつもりでも１％マップとアイテムが足りないが、攻略見てやり直す気力はわかない。 ショットは9割なくても困らないショットなので、メモ以外は探すのは趣味で良いかもしれない。  ネガティブなことを書き込んだが、粗はそれくらいで、レベルは非常に高い  最後に、ストーリーの意味がわからない。 Trueのアレは一体…言葉通りだとすれば一番最初とは  
Date 2016-07-18 Playtime 10h 17m Rec Positive So you are looking for good old SuperMetroid feelings? Not much backtracking mapwise, progressive and innovative items, an awesome soundtrack and  some ~8-9h for your first playthrough? GO grab this game. It got all this. The best experience i had in a long time, Soundtrack is great, gameplay is fluent and it gets more and more difficult as you progress. Perfect!
Date 2016-07-18 Playtime 5h 40m Rec Negative In my original review, I mentioned that the grappling absolutely killed the game for me. I recently started the game again from the beginning (albeit on Xbox One X), as I recalled a response to my original review mentioning that the grappling doesn't play a very large role in the game. That's actually 100% correct. I still can't recommend this game, though.  Honestly, while I managed to get past the small amount of grappling that you need to perform in order to progress, I have to say that the post-grappling content really doesn't hold up to the earlier content in the game. The new areas just feel so bland and scattered, the new enemies similarly underwhelm (or annoy the hell out of you), the quality of the later boss battles (especially the final boss battle) plummets, the late-game checkpoints absolutely blow in terms of location, and getting from area to area never really feels anything more than tedious.  It's a shame, because the early parts of this game really shine, but the late-game content largely just stinks. I really can't personally recommend Axiom Verge.
Date 2016-07-18 Playtime 13h 39m Rec Positive I haven't played much of this game yet, but if there was ever a competition for the most Metroid-like game I've played, this wins hands down.  The graphics are very reminiscent of Metroid, with each area having a sort of color theme, the monsters manage to be unique enough to give a bit of unexpectedness to the game, but would be right at home in the Metroid universe. And the music is phenomenal. I don't know the name of the area I'm in, but when the music started playing it absolutely startled me. Not for its beauty or anything. It's a great song but it's terribly eery, and absolutely wonderful.  The controls for the game are tight, though I would prefer the Super Metroid method of shooting to the top- and left-right by using the shoulder buttons.  If you're looking for a 2d Metroid fix, or just looking for a fantastic action platformer, this game is perfect for you.
Date 2016-07-17 Playtime 20h 54m Rec Positive Cualquiera a quien le gusten este tipo de juegos debe saber que hay muchos juegos de este estilo que son bastante buenos y que seguido están en oferta. Así que ¿Axiom Verge puede destacar aún con esa competencia tan dura?, sí puede. Este no es un metroidvania del montón sino que es uno de mis juegos favoritos de esta fórmula. Cuando estoy jugando algo de este estilo normalmente sólo siento ganas de explorar más y mejorar a mi personaje, pero este juego además de eso me brindó muchas otras emociones que ningún juego de este estilo había logrado(junto con otras que sólo Super Metroid había logrado). De manera mas detallada puedo decir que:  [h1]Pros[/h1] [list]     [*]Excelente atmósfera     [*]Momentos emocionalmente fuertes     [*]De lo mejor que he visto en pixel art (mas que nada por los jefes).     [*]Gran jugabilidad (básicamente lo que uno espera de un buen Metroidvania)     [*]Una historia llena de intriga, que aunque no sea la mejor historia del mundo, es bastante memorable e hizo que durante todo el juego me estuviera preguntando bastantes cosas. [/list]  [h1]Contras[/h1] [list]     [*]Muchos secretos no se sienten como algo opcional, ya que narran cosas importantes de la historia     [*]La forma en la que están escondidos los secretos es muy inconsistente y eso hizo que me resultara frustrante (es decir, algunos bloques a veces los puedes romper y a veces no, algunas paredes a veces las puedes traspasar y a veces no, etc).     [*]Hay 3 idiomas diferentes en las notas escondidas en el juego, esto suena como algo bueno ya que el idioma sirve para imaginarte quien lo escribió; la parte mala es que los traductores de idiomas no los tienes desde el principio, y uno de ellos está demasiado escondido, de manera que te puedes perder 1/3 de las notas por eso, no las podrás leer aunque las hayas encontrado. [/list]
Date 2016-07-17 Playtime 11h 32m Rec Positive This game is sooo good. One of my fave metroidvanias.  It is challenging but also very rewarding because there are so many different powerups.
Date 2016-07-17 Playtime 20h 54m Rec Positive Thank you Mr. Thomas Happ for creating a game especially for me! Well... obviously you haven't, but playing this game feels, as if you've had.  "Metroidvania" done right!   (Please develop a sequel! Pretty pleeeeeease?)
Date 2016-07-16 Playtime 8h 0m Rec Negative 没有中文其实勉强也看得懂，只是各个存档点之间竟然不能传送...这个就有点麻烦了 分支这么多很容易迷路的好吗，在网上搜视频流程，直接一条命拿完东西然后读档返回起点位置，可是臣妾手残，真的做不到啊~ 好吧，那我就走回去好了，可是到了中途一个地方跳不上去了呀！！！ 是我漏掉什么隐藏物品了么？还是我操作不到位？ 玩了8个小时，地图还只一小撮，也跟不上视频攻略的步伐，只有说再见了 游戏是挺好的，只是对路痴不太友好，特别是手残的路痴
Date 2016-07-15 Playtime 22h 33m Rec Positive Ugly, alien aesthetic with an overall well-hidden but slightly covoluted narrative, and extremely familiar gameplay to anyone with any Metroidvania experience (especially the former half of the term). Varied and unique forms of movement allow for interesting platforming, and every weapon you find has a given niche that it works best in. Not quite as perfect as the codifiers of the genre (ie Super Metroid), but a well-done addition nonetheless.
Date 2016-07-15 Playtime 12h 38m Rec Positive the most metroid game since metroid (also the best since zero mission)
Date 2016-07-15 Playtime 21h 41m Rec Positive Beautiful environmental design and music, set an incredible atmosphere in every unique area of the game. Level designs felt fresh and intuitive, rarely caused a sense of being directionless, and had many 'visual leads' that hinted at uses for later upgrades.  Puzzles were clever and made intuitive use of the game's unique mechanics, though some lategame puzzles were almost too obscure to be solved through anything but serendipity. (Often involving the use of the Address Disruptor on enemies, which sometimes have less-than-obvious effects while glitched.)  Tools and upgrades offered a decidedly cerebral approach to Metroid-like platforming while avoiding the common power spike that renders later challenges pointless. However, I got the impression that the endgame was lacking at least one more upgrade to mobility to aid in backtracking, such as a Speed Booster. (There were many long, straight hallways I was expecting to be used with one.)  Weapon variety was impressive, but the majority of the choices lacked a niche or purpose, or were completely outmoded by even some of the earlygame options. It would have been interesting to see more weapon-specific puzzles as were demonstrated in the first area of the game, or at least retooling the selections to have slightly fewer weapons with more useful applications.  Bosses often felt either underwhelming or frustrating, as most of them had a simplistic pattern with an unusual hitbox and loads of health. There was one boss (Gir-Tab) where the hitbox was placed behind the enemy entirely, while the front was completely invulnerable to shots. The only weapons I had that could reach that far were the Nova, which felt woefully underpowered, and the Voranj, which could only randomly hit that area. The sheer amount of shots it took to take down the boss was frustrating, and I'd died at least 14 times before then thanks to the discrepancy in firepower at that point in the game.  The writing definitely kept me hooked, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it made up for what initially seemed to be an unfitting protagonist in an alien world. The foreboding hints at Athetos' history and the enigmatic nature of the Rusalki did leave me wanting more character development, or perhaps even an alternate ending considering there were some optional fights / interactions at key points in the game.  Overall, Axiom Verge is a wonderful take on the fairly small non-linear platforming genre that had me constantly going back to play more with few little nags. The game bleeds passion and attention to detail, especially in the lavish SNES-style spritework that paves every part of the game as a harrowing, but beautiful alien world. I'm finding myself wishing for a continuation already.
Date 2016-07-14 Playtime 15h 35m Rec Positive Good solid metroid clone with marvelous music and pretty neat pixelart style. Many exploration options, many weapons/tools to choose from. The story is kinda weird, but if you like science fiction, you can find it enjoyable. It worth to play a couple of evenings.
Date 2016-07-14 Playtime 13h 0m Rec Positive jogo muito bom. realmente me supreendir parecia que eu estava jogando metroid como antigamente
Date 2016-07-14 Playtime 86h 38m Rec Positive It's hard to believe, but I actually think I like this game more than Super Metroid and Cave Story. And that's before taking the amazing soundtrack into account.  This is easily one of the best games I have ever played. I can't wait to see what Tom Happ brings us next.
Date 2016-07-14 Playtime 9h 15m Rec Positive It's remarkable that one man is solely responsible for its creaion, but I do have some gripes. While there is a pretty vast amount of permutations for your primary weapon, combat itself isn't any more entertaining/cathartic than it was back in the 2d Metroid titles. The bosses, however, are much better here. Most (I wish they all did) utilize some puzzle solving to take them down. I also wish you could teleport between save zones, since it leads to tedious backtracking (mostly due to the mediocre combat). Oh and the music is very, very nice.
Date 2016-07-12 Playtime 14h 8m Rec Positive Great not-Metroid.
Date 2016-07-12 Playtime 9h 31m Rec Negative This game sorely needs a quicktravel option. Everytime you want to try out a new power or have an idea on how or where to get forward on the map you need to travel across the entire gameworld to get somewhere. It's fun when you did not uncover a lot of the map yet but it's a major pain in the ass later on. So much so that I just gave up on it. Maybe I just missed something, but other than that this is a fun castlevania game and totally would recommend it. It breaks my hearth to do this.
Date 2016-07-12 Playtime 18h 22m Rec Positive Yes it's a good game, but I wouldn't call it perfect.  The artwork is really good and gameplay is smooth and enjoyable. There's also a lot that's fresh and original aboutit, despite being a retro platformer firmly rooted in a lot of older gaming traditions. The music (while I couldn't really get into most apart from one track) is distinctive and well written, and there are a lot of powerups and mechanics that give an interesting dimension to the gameplay that are rarely seen in other games.  However, this is a two-edged sword. There is a bewildering number of weapons to find, each with it's own well thought out mechanic, but unfortunately most of them are entirely useless.  Another thing that is worth pointing out is the story. It seems a lot of people praise this game for that aspect, but I really don't think it's a strong point of the game. Yes, it has its share of reveals and little twists, but so do M Night Shyamalan movies and they are still mostly horrible. I just didn't find myself investing in it at all, and for all its bluster about alternate dimensions and technology and the nature of reality (which already wasn't new when the Matrix did it 17 years ago), it really doesn't have anything interesting to say. Now, I don't think the quality of a game necessarily rests on the story (there have been plenty of good games without good stories), but don't automatically buy in to the idea that this game has a particularly good one.  My last minor gripe is that I think the game is just a shade too long for the first play-through. Granted, I took my time and tried to find as many secrets and powerups as I could, but at 16 hours I found myself wishing it would just be over for about the last quarter of it.  But still, overall I recommend this game. It's expertly crafted and rich, especially for a single dev, and it's one of the best realizations of a Metroidvania I've seen.
Date 2016-07-12 Playtime 32h 8m Rec Positive Cool game.Wish it could make more use of all the weapons it has to offer.maybe in Axiom Verge 2
Date 2016-07-12 Playtime 15h 3m Rec Positive Wow. This game is equal parts a beautiful, proper homage to classic Metroid and a freaking modern marvel of human capability (this was entirely developed by one man). I was able to beat the game with minor completionist tendancies (I had 92% of the map explored and ~83% of all weapons) in about 15 hours. A lot of that will be spent backtracking but the game always feels fresh as the pacing with new items is very appropriate; you'll /want/ to revisit previously explored locations to see what new areas you can unlock and secrets you can find. The art, the sound, the atmosphere this game brings to the table is astonishing. Please go play this game!
Date 2016-07-12 Playtime 17h 44m Rec Positive Simply amazing.  If you like "metroidvanias" / platformers, you will certainly like this game. I feel kind of ashamed of waiting to buy during a sale.  Expect a lot of exploration, backtracking and platforming.  Of course, as others have already said, there are things that could be better. Some boss battles are just a matter of discovering the best weapon to use against it, others about positioning. Some secrets are way too hard to find. I know thats the point about being secrets, but I simply had to use a guide to get past the 90% mark (and didn't even finished with 100%).  Overall, a well done game (if you consider it was made just by Happ, it is an amazing game and feat.), that is well worth your time.  9/10 would play a sequel. 
Date 2016-07-11 Playtime 10h 31m Rec Negative A soulless and unlikeable game that tries to copy Metroid but fails in every aspect. The weapons are useless, the story is dull the enemies are either way to tough for your current health and weapons or it is over run by way to many annoying enemies that are not fun to fight, and traveling just feels like such a chore.  It really makes me hope that after Federation Force Nintendo announces a normal Metroid game so this game becomes forgotten instead of some "metroid replacement" that people claim it is.
Date 2016-07-11 Playtime 36h 36m Rec Positive I loved this game.  The music and story were highlights for me.  Occasionally I'll read or watch a good sci-fi story and think about it for days after ; things like when I first watched Brazil or read the orignal Foundation trilogy come to mind.  This complelty happened with Axiom Verge.  I hope there ends up being a sequel.
Date 2016-07-11 Playtime 22h 5m Rec Positive What a wonderful adventure. I have enjoyed playing Metroidian Style games since playing Metroid on the NES. To be able to capture that same vintage feel with retro graphics has been attempted many times over. I really believe Axiom Verge has succeeded in their attempt to bring a fluid well paced retro classic into the current video game age. Even going through multiple times still holds the challenge and charm from the first.  Pros: +Story is pretty neat with plot twists and turns +Tons of Tools  +Tons of Weapons +Soundtrack is pretty freakin' killer +Boss Fights are really cool +Story that helps new players to the genre understand their goals/objectives +Tons of hidden areas/weapons/tools to collect +Achvmnt Hunters will get probably 40+ hours out of this game  Cons: -Almost too many weapons that serve no purpose other than getting the 100% Achvmnt
Date 2016-07-11 Playtime 9h 49m Rec Positive Scratches that itch I couldnt reach for the last 20 years
Date 2016-07-11 Playtime 11h 30m Rec Positive A wonderful game for metroid fans. Axiom Verge took everything I liked about 2d metroid, made it better, then added its own great ideas. For non-metroid fans you may have some difficulty enjoying this game. While playing this game there is going to be alot of times when you are running around aimlessly madly drilling and glitching walls. Personally enjoy the lack of direction as for one you will discover secrets without even trying, and two its a nice feeling when you finally figure out where you are supposed to go and how you are supposed to get there. The boss designs were for the most part very unique and were quite challenging. This game is a must have for 2d metoid fans and even if you are unfamiliar with the metroidvania genre you should at least give it a try.
Date 2016-07-11 Playtime 40h 51m Rec Positive Anazing nusic, gameplay, and art style. Great Mevania.
Date 2016-07-11 Playtime 3h 40m Rec Negative    This game got very boring very fast, looks great but whoever's idea it was to control aiming with the same stick you move with needs to be fired, why would you map the weapons to the right stick and have to hold down a button and lock yourself in place to aim?
Date 2016-07-10 Playtime 22h 31m Rec Positive I've been searching for a great metroidvania for a long time. Unepic was ok, but kinda boring, La Mulana was good but I didn't have the patience for it, Ori and the blind forest I had technical issues with (hoping for the definitive version to fix that), but there is one game that beats them all. Axiom Verge is the game I was looking for. I [b] haven't [/b] beaten it yet, so please consider this more of a first impression than a full review.  It is the right ammout mix of great graphics, fluent gameplay, haunting story and an awesome soundtrack. All done by a [b] single person [/b]. When I found out about that I was blown away.  If you've played games like Metroid or Castlevania: Symphony of the night, you'll be instantly familiar with this game, because it follows the same exact formula. As you explore the world you find health and damage powerups to make your life easier and also unlock new guns and abilities. which grant you access to the next area. There are a ton of weapons, some more practical than others, some better against certain types of enemies. Interestingly most of the bosses I've encountered so far (with the exception of one) can be beaten by your basic gun.  You'll also make use of all of your abilities to find secrets, which range from a basic notes detailing the world to hidden powerups and weapons. They usually aren't too hard to spot, but there are some, which are quite tricky. But because the secrets are tied to certain game mechanic also means you'll have to do a lot of backtracking in order to find everything. There is no fast travel of any description, which is a little annoying. But then again, this is completely optional.  The bosses are giant hunks of biomass and steel, which all have clear pattern you can take advantage off. The only "problem" with that is that they generally get faster as they take damage, which turns every encounter into an intense battle. While the boss encounters can be hard, they're never unfair, in fact they're quite the opposite. Not to mention the music is so good, that I didn't care I died, it simply meant I coul listen to it a little bit longer.  While Axiom Verge borrows from other games (Contra, Metroid, Castlevania, Bionic Commando, etc.), it also has it's own original ideas. The ability to "glitch" the enemies, effectively crippling them, or turning them into floating platforms/ health generators is unique, fun and incredibly useful. [b] Intentional glitches [/b], I have to say, this is the most inovative game mechanic I've seen in years.  This game is also quite heavily story driven for a metroidvania game, if you're into sci-fi, you'll enjoy it. And if you're here only for the gameplay, you'll enjoy it as well.  There is also built-in speedrun mode, which is just that. It bypasses all the custcenes and slaps a timer on the screen.   So far I haven't encountered any bugs, so good job there. One ability could use some little tweaking though. Later in the game you'll acquire the abiliy to dash through thin walls using the D-pad or the left stick. I use the left stick for movement and I've noticed that sometimes Trace dashes on his own while I'm moving the stick. Normally it's only supposed to happen if you rock the stick twice in the direction you want to go, but I swear it happened when I simply touched it. I hope it makes at least a little bit of sense, explaining controls is always the hardest part.  In conclusion, this game is incredible especially if you consider the fact that it's a single person project. That's all I have to say.
Date 2016-07-10 Playtime 0h 43m Rec Negative Does not have full controller support, misrepresented that from the getgo. If you want to use a controller for this game, best to check if you have one of three controllers expressly designed for use with a computer before buying this.
Date 2016-07-09 Playtime 13h 31m Rec Positive Definitely recommend this for anyone who likes Metroid.
Date 2016-07-09 Playtime 9h 55m Rec Positive Genuinely amazing! Highly recommend!  I've been gaming since the nes era- That said I never played a 2d metroid game the 1st time round. Having player all the metroid prime games I decided to play a port of super metroid on the Wii several years ago. It was incredible and this could not be attributed to nostalgia.  Axiom Verge is not just a homage to this game, but a genuine masterpiece crafted by a single person who loves and understands the format implicitly. Indeed every element feels familiar, however he has managed to put surprising twists on the formula. Each power up is a joy to discover and play with.   Level design is varied and interesting. The difficulty level achieves that golden ratio where you battle to survive a section only to go through it later in the game feeling like a god.  The music is absurdly good
Date 2016-07-09 Playtime 13h 22m Rec Positive Das ist das Spiel auf das ich lange gewartet habe. Es sieht aus wie Metroid, klingt wie Metroid und soll sich ähnlich spielen wie Metroid, ist es aber nicht. Nachdem man ein wenig eingetaucht ist in die Welt von Axiom Verge merkt man, das sich das Spiel doch ein wenig anders spielt mit den ganzen Waffen und Fähigkeiten. Es ist glücklicherweise keine billige Kopie von Metroid und ist etwas eigenes. Verglichen mit Super Metroid ist es natürlich nicht ganz so perfekt, schon gar nicht vom Level Aufbau her, aber das wäre auch fast unfair zu vergleichen.   Es hat mir Spaß gemacht das Spiel durch zu spielen und nach Secrets abzusuchen. Es hat einen netten Soundtrack, aber die Steuerung ist nicht ganz so flüssig und nervt stellenweise, wenn man bestimmte schwierige Punkte erreichen möchte; oder mir fehlte nur die richtige Fähigkeit/Waffe dafür. Was ich gar nicht mochte waren die Bosse. Sie wirkten billig und waren eintönig und langweilig zu bekämpfen. Da hätte man sicher mehr machen können.   Ich kann das Spiel definitiv weiter empfehlen, wenn man Lust auf so eine Art von Spiel wie Super Metroid hat.
Date 2016-07-09 Playtime 17h 48m Rec Positive At first it feels repetitive and reuses a lot of metroid ideas, but after you put in the time to get deeper into it, you start seeing a lot of great new concepts and originality that not only drives it as a fantastic metroidvania game, but also a fantastic game of its own standing.  The story doesn't get too in the way but it's still appealing and interesting and it certainly has its share of nice secrets. And the art is gorgeous, weather you like pixelart or not, even if at first some areas feel too metroidy.  9/10 easiy, I find it hard to belive only one person did all this.
Date 2016-07-09 Playtime 20h 24m Rec Positive Exelente!! 
Date 2016-07-09 Playtime 43h 58m Rec Positive (9.5/10)   The true sequel to super metroid, this game is utterly packed with things to find, do, blast, run from, etc.  The music is intense, the story is cryptic but intriguing, the graphics are everything you would have ever dreamed of in the 16 bit era.  I honestly place this very close to symphony in the overall spectrum of amazing metroidvanias.   The only thing really lacking is any kind of true fast transportation system.  Its not critical/dire as later on you can generally just run through areas with some of the best weapons taking everything down, but still it can be something of a drag if you know you need to get to somewhere on the other side of the whole map.  Beyond that though the game really is stunning and I cannot reccomend it highly enough for all lovers of 2d platformers/metroidvania style exploration/unlocking
Date 2016-07-09 Playtime 11h 0m Rec Positive I can't recommend this game enough if you're looking for an awesome Metroid-style game.
Date 2016-07-09 Playtime 11h 18m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a well-made sci-fi Metroid-style game that has an interesting story. The gameplay is fun and it feels rewarding when you find new areas, items, and secrets! The music is both good at fitting the mood and to listen to as well. It's a must-buy in my book!
Date 2016-07-08 Playtime 15h 11m Rec Positive Excelente juego. no lo piendes dos veces y juégalo,no te arrepentirás.
Date 2016-07-08 Playtime 15h 26m Rec Positive Solid Metroidvania action with some clever gameplay twists.
Date 2016-07-07 Playtime 10h 47m Rec Positive Very enjoyable game. Worth the money put into it. A huge throwback to castlevania/metroid classic games. Neat twists on the story as it develops, although...  Overall, if you enjoy these 2d platformer puzzle shooters, get this game.   edit: Seriously; get this game already.
Date 2016-07-07 Playtime 15h 52m Rec Positive 9.5/10 HOoM  You enjoy games like Super Metroid/Castlevania with a science fiction vibe to it? Then this is the game for you.
Date 2016-07-06 Playtime 29h 4m Rec Positive Axiom Verge non è il semplice gioco indie che viene sparato su steam e viene elogiato, Axiom Verge è un capolavoro degno delle migliori case videoludiche e forse riesce a fare anche meglio! Il paragone con Metroid è evidentissimo ma Axiom Verge è un gioco così ben ispirato che non può essere chiamato un clone; le idee di base sono state ampiamente modificate e rielaborate a tal punto di poter parlare di un opera a se stante, originale e fresca.   Ovviamente la similitudine e il richiamo a Metroid è lapalissiana: scenari oscuri e dispersivi abitati da una civiltà (quasi) perduta, creature aliene voraci, oggetti e abilità da collezionare... praticamente in questo è identico! Però la cosa più bella di questo gioco è forse una caratteristica che persino Metroid, il campione degli action/platformer, non può vantare di avere. Nell'atmosfera del gioco, oltre l'aroma classico di questi giochi, si respira molto l'aria di un survival horror. Certo, le munizioni sono infinite, ma molto spesso, quando si incontra un nuovo nemico (molto spesso per la prima volta) si ha sempre paura di restarci secco anche perchè non tutti i nemici rilasciano energia, specialmente quelli più deboli! è una continua lotta per la sopravvivenza e dunque vi garantisco che se giocherete a questo gioco state certi che morirete tante, tante volte e questo è un fattore veramente positivo! Inoltre il personaggio non da assolutamente l'aria di essere un duro è il suo andare in giro solamente con una maglietta e dei pantaloni non lo rende affatto invincibile al contrario dell'armatura di Samus. Ancora di degnissima nota sono appunto le note presenti nel gioco che, una volta collezionate (e persino tradotte!) tutte potranno dare una visione più completa della trama e di cosa è accaduto al pianeta Sudran. La grafica è veramente spettacolare, molto creativo il desegn generale, le ambientazioni e soprattutto originalissimi i boss. La mappa è ciò che ci si può aspettare da un metroidvania che si rispetti: ampia, labirintica e con mille segreti. La musica è veramente fra le migliori mai viste: è come se i Kraftwerk, i Frakie Goes To Hollywood, i Depeche Mode, Aphex Twin del periodo ambient e Shakti stessero tutti facendo lo stesso incubo contemporaneamente! Ascoltare per credere! Come ogni buon Metroidvania che si rispetti Axiom Verge continua anche dopo averlo completato, le estensioni dei power-up non sono mai abbastanza e inoltre c'è anche una bellissima varietà di mondi nascosti dove tutto appare come un televisore a tubo catodico (!??!) e con tanti bug grafici. Bellissima anche la storia è i personaggi tutti, una vera e propria sorpresa che si estende piano piano e non sempre, soprattutto se non stiamo attenti alle note, possiamo capire tutto al 100%.  Axiom Verge non è solo un (evidente) tributo ad una delle serie videoludiche più importanti della storia, è un gioco che eccelle nel suo genere e spazza la concorrenza come se niente fosse. Veramente uno dei più bei giochi su Steam, da avere A TUTTI I COSTI!!  10/10
Date 2016-07-06 Playtime 1h 21m Rec Positive I played it first on the PS4 and loved it. The game does a great job at immersing the player into an a game that has tons of atmostphere. The music fits the tone of each area, as does the color.   Not only is this a great game, but it is an example of what a motivated developer can do.
Date 2016-07-06 Playtime 20h 1m Rec Positive This scratches every itch a metroid fan could have
Date 2016-07-06 Playtime 105h 31m Rec Positive Incredible game.  Axiom verge is a game designed to be much like metroid in the respect that it will have you backtracking to look for secrets and missed upgrades needed in order to progress.  The character "trace" has some really cool weapons and abilities available to him (once you seek them out).  The game has great immersion, I got sucked in from the get go.
Date 2016-07-05 Playtime 9h 28m Rec Positive Games dope, try it out.
Date 2016-07-04 Playtime 493h 8m Rec Positive If you are a fan of metroidvania games then this is a must!  The Artist who made this is Tom Happ and he got a lot of awards and nods from the industry for this and rightfully so!  I Didn't expect it to be as big as it is because it was just one mans project, but it clearly was a labour of love cos it's fantastic!  Lots of roaming and exploring, great soundtrack, some origional concepts and massive cheesey Bosses!  The controls are spot on and the buttons can easily be reassigned.  10/10
Date 2016-07-04 Playtime 9h 2m Rec Positive Great game, very mysterious story, awesome soundtrack.  My only complaint is that the ending left me wanting more of the story.  This definitely deserves a sequel.
Date 2016-07-04 Playtime 8h 46m Rec Positive The greatest metroidvania game since Metroid and Castlevania!
Date 2016-07-04 Playtime 15h 28m Rec Positive While the graphical style is something like 8-bit+, similar to Shovel Knight, the gameplay builds far beyond what was available in that era.  I especially like the variety of weapons available. It's much more than Super Metroid's different beams, as they vary in range firing pattern, and rate of fire.  Compared again, to Super Metroid, the combat is less forgiving. You've got less health and fewer opportunities to replenish between save points; however, at least the save points are pretty frequent, and basically only serve as respawn locations--your progress is saved even if you die, which is nice.  The art style is gorgeous, with a very H.R. Geiger feel, especially the game's trademark Rusalki--the giant heads nested in coils of tubing. I was a little disappointed with the design of the protagonist and some of the cutscenes; they stray a little too far from the rest of the game's look and feel. They're not BAD, but they could be more consistent.  The story is a little hard to follow, but it's supposed to be a bit of a mind trip. I only wish there were a full log so I could go back and review previous dialog in light of each new revelation. Also, part of the exposition is told in a broken-English style that is maybe a little over-wrought. I wasn't sure if the writer was going for 80s bad-Japanese-translation or trying to portray the character herself as a non-native English speaker. It's fine, but I'm not sure it adds more than it detracts. Over all, the story supports the weird sci-fi setting well with an interesting premise. I haven't finished the game, so time will tell if it delivers a satisfying conclusion.  The game mostly does interface very nicely. I like the ring menu for switching weapons; it takes clever advantage of the otherwise empty right analog stick that most 2D games ignore. The subscreen menu is fairly standard flip-left-and-right-to-change-pages. I'm not really sure why the menu screen pages scroll the opposite direction from what the buttons on the interface indicate (RB is in the top right and says "MAP" while you're looking at items, but when you press it, the items screen scrolls off to the right, and the map screen scrolls in from the LEFT.) It's like you're manipulating the screen itself rather than your viewport. A minor annoyance, but it messes with spatial learning of the interface which mostly just led to me pushing one direction or the other till I got the screen I wanted, even if it was the long-way-around. The other minor interface issue, and certainly more substantive is that some upgrade items in the item menu can't be highlighted for more information. So you have to remember the difference between the health fragments and power fragments if you want to know whether you're 3/5 to a new health upgrade or a new weapon power upgrade. Everything else is selectable with more info available. And I'm not sure if this is an interface thing, but I would have liked a fast travel/warp system like the Castlevania did in Symphony of the Night. There's a central "hub" area later on, but it can still take a while to get places.  The music is really cool, atmospheric chiptunes in the grand Metroid style. One of the tracks has these great synthy vocals that perfectly convey the otherworldly tone of the game.  And, to wrap this up, as far as I know, the game plays very "fair." It doesn't hide secrets in arbitrary places. It doesn't (to my knowledge) feature any secret timers or hidden conditionals. It's just pure, relaxing, explore-y Metroidvania. I really like it.
Date 2016-07-04 Playtime 17h 45m Rec Positive Wer Spiele wie Metroid mochte wird Axiom Verge lieben! Das wurde hier ja schon etliche Male geschrieben aber man kann es nicht oft genug wiederholen! Das Ur-Metroid (NES) diente eindeutig als Vorlage, Axiom Verge hat aber viele weitere Elemente, die es einzigartig machen. Der Entwickler war da wirklich sehr kreativ (!) und es steckt unheimlich viel Liebe zum Detail drin. Ich dachte  z.B. anfangs erst, es gäbe einige Bugs im Spiel oder dass mein System Grafikfehler verursacht - bis ich geschnallt habe, dass das alles vom Entwickler so beabsichtigt war ;-) Als Fan des Genres hat man hier durchgehend seinen Spaß. Der mittlere Schwierigkeitsgrad ist sehr gut ausbalanciert. Nicht zu schwer aber stellenweise durchaus herausfordernd jedoch ohne dass Frust aufkommt. Die Speicherpunkte sind fair verteilt so dass man auch "mal eben" eine kurze Runde spielen kann. Meistens bleibt man aber eh hängen und der Forscherdrang macht Minuten zu Stunden ;-) Die Steuerung mit dem Gamepad ist flüssig und direkt, Grafik ist schön Retro - gut gemacht - und der Sound ebenfalls erstklassig! Alles in allem ein tolles Spielgefühl! Das Spiel ist wirklich jeden Cent wert und ein must-have für alle die dieses Genre mögen!
Date 2016-07-04 Playtime 17h 30m Rec Positive Solid game with neat music.  I consider this game to be a spiritual successor to Metroid with a LOT of guns. Played it on Normal difficulty, which felt just right.  My only complaint is the bosses were quite easy once you found their weakness.  The Final boss fight was so easy it was rather anticlamactic.
Date 2016-07-04 Playtime 35h 27m Rec Positive Got this game over the weekend and spent the whole weekend playing it.  If you like the 2D Metroid series this is bigger and better in just about everyway.  Awesome gameplay, awesome music, awesome story.  After finishing the game you can even go on youtube and find some guy talking about this game's multiverse theory for like 20 minutes.
Date 2016-07-04 Playtime 15h 41m Rec Positive It's indie Super Metroid.  Very solid, not much bad to say about it.  Was shocked it was made by one person.
Date 2016-07-04 Playtime 8h 37m Rec Positive "Super Metroid if you took mushrooms and LSD while listening to Pink Floyd played in reverse."  Axiom Verge is a 2D metroidvania that harkens back to the original era games, namely Super Metroid. Boasting a good 5+ hours of gameplay, it turns many of the conventional tropes on their head, creating a psychadelic and interesting game that can leave you wanting more.   The story begins with a lab explosion and you get very little else besides a voice. As the player navigates the alien world, you discover and slowly piece together a very strange and cryptic story that may or may not make sense at its conclusion. Along the way, your power grows as per a normal metroidvania but instad of getting staples of the genre, you get "different" types of movement. This is both a strength and weakness of the game, as navigate the map on a macro level feels very awkward and forced. Some of the movement items feel very awkward or even atrocious to use while others feel like a dream. This is a running theme of the game where experimentation creates both interesting items, weapons, or bosses while also creating trainwrecks.  Level design is mediocre at best, the surroundings and environment more lending to a surreal world. It is fairly easy to get lost without spending time making sure you are going the right way, and inconsistency plagues the game's design. Sometimes, the game forces you to use an item or movement ability on something that, before then, simply didn't work but does in that room. In one specific time, it even works on only part of the room despite there being other sections that are identical!  Difficulty tends to run in a feast or famine situation: Early on you have a fairly smooth curve but entering a new area often ends with you getting destroyed. Death can be used as a shortcut and is also part and parcel of a speedrun. Bosses are likewise hit or miss, serving more as puzzles than challenges, though some bosses can be a bit esoteric in terms of their gameplay or strategy.   All in all, Axiom Verge may not be a perfect game, but it's a unique and interesting one. If you look past its flaws, you can get a great sci fi experience and a story that will leave you thinking deeply. If you're afraid of complex designs (or just feel like you may get disoriented from the truly alien feel of the game), feel free to skip it, but watch a let's play.
Date 2016-07-04 Playtime 10h 9m Rec Positive An incredible Sci-Fi throwback to the super nintendo. If you like Metroid games or Castlevania, you'll love this. This game is goood. Highly recommend.
Date 2016-07-03 Playtime 13h 32m Rec Positive This game is basically Metroid Fusion 2 since Nintendo is too lazy to make their own. Any Metroid fan will definitely love this game.
Date 2016-07-03 Playtime 28h 29m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is the world's biggest love letter to Super Metroid (my personal favourite game of all time) and it was all created by one guy. Somehow, Tom Happ has managed to replicate the atmosphere, gameplay and even best the visuals of the SNES classic while also managing an incredible soundtrack... all while maintaining its own originality. It was a absolute joy to play and one of the best games I've played in a very long time.  Give Tom Happ all your dollars and play it. You won't regret it. Promise.
Date 2016-07-03 Playtime 7h 20m Rec Positive Fun metroidvania with great music, mechanics, plot and a cool glitchy aesthetic.
Date 2016-07-03 Playtime 13h 10m Rec Positive SF2Dアクション探索ゲー ジャンルでいうとメトロイドヴァニアとかの流れになるんだろうな  探索→ボス撃破→新アイテム入手→探索、の古き良き伝統のループを繰り返していくゲームです 最初に訪れたときは行けなかった場所も、アイテムを入手した後なら行けるようになる だからその時が来るまでここにアイテムがあった事を覚えておいてね、という一連のアレが大好きな人には大変おすすめです 探索範囲を広げる移動用のアイテムの他にも、いろんな種類の武器が隠されており、敵によって有利不利があるのでその点でも楽しめる  また日本語にも対応しており、ストーリーも十分に楽しめます
Date 2016-07-02 Playtime 18h 2m Rec Positive What a bone-chilling atmosphere permeates this game. Pure awesomeness. It's like imbibing HR Geiger through the eyes and ears
Date 2016-07-02 Playtime 15h 54m Rec Positive Incredible game. Brilliant music and very atmospheric. Amazing how a game designed to be in the 16-bit style manages this. Only issue I had was that its controller support was difficult. Apprently it only natively accepts Xbox and PS4 controllers, so if you have a generic PC Logitech or something like that, it won't work straight away. I had to download a very obscure controller -> keyboard mapping program (Not even JoytoKey works with AV which is kind of strange) to get it to work. Once I did, though, it was perfect.
Date 2016-07-02 Playtime 9h 39m Rec Positive A mastercrafted future classic, truly one among the best of its genre  My only real gripe was that the bosses were a bit too easy
Date 2016-07-02 Playtime 1h 17m Rec Positive This game is awesome! If you love pixels, 8 bit soundtracks, Turrican, SuperMetroid YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS GAME ! This game is made by one person, and this guy is a great!  pro: - wonderful retro sensations - original and amazing soundtrack - if you remember SuperMetroid then you'll love this game - complete joypad support - multilanguage translations  cons: - if you hate pixels games (or old retro style) maybe you should choose another game  My Vote is 9.5/10    
Date 2016-07-02 Playtime 41h 59m Rec Positive I have to say that I rather enjoyed this game quite a bit. It was worth the money and I'd love to play more of it. I've always enjoyed this style of game and to have one that's so well done is a breath of fresh air. The scenory makes me feel a bit uneasy at times and the enemies(and even allies) can be rather frightening at times. Over all it was an excellent experience and I'd recommend picking it up for sure.
Date 2016-07-02 Playtime 11h 6m Rec Positive I can't believe it's not Metroid. (particularly because it's so well made, it reminds me of the good old days of Super Metroid)
Date 2016-07-02 Playtime 10h 28m Rec Positive 可以，这很Metroid。 [strike]不管作者嗑了什么，总之也给我来一点。[/strike]
Date 2016-07-02 Playtime 48h 45m Rec Positive Excellent Metroid-like game. The controls are solid. The level designs are great, with plenty of tricks and hidden spots. Ton of different weapons to find. As well as some pretty creative tools.  But it is more than just another Metroidvania. Axiom Verge has much of what I loved so much about Metroid. That eerie sci-fi feel (both in visuals and music) is totally there. The freedom of movement between levels. Add to that a really interesting (and sometimes creepy) story that slowly unfolds, and you have a really really good game.  Highly recommend it to anyone that enjoyed the original Metroid.
Date 2016-07-02 Playtime 17h 1m Rec Positive Can't say much more, If you have any intrest in any sort of older style metroidvania game this takes the cake. it is everything i havnt played in  so many years and just that much more, and unique to make it feel like it is the first time i am playing a game like this. the music is done great and if you have any sort of paitence to try a hard platforming, deep story, long confusing maps, lots of secrets and upgrades type of game. Then you need to give it a try it.
Date 2016-07-02 Playtime 16h 5m Rec Positive It's what you'd expect from a good Metroid clone with some interesting twists on the formula. It also has one major hangup.  [h1] This Stuff's Pretty Neat [/h1] [list] [*]Big ol' map to explore with a way to get to each area quickly. [*]Really enjoyed how the graphical glitches were actually a game mechanic. [*]Wide variety of enemies. [*]Interesting enough story. Has some pretty crazy moments. [*]Controls are tight. [*]Cheatcodes in this day and age? Cool! Yeah! [*]Hope you enjoy collectables because it's got them. Power upgrades, health upgrades, upgrades that make you shoot farther, freaky arm things coming out of your shoulders [i]what even are those?[/i] [/list]  [h1] Didn't Mind These Parts [/h1] [list] [*]Lots of weapons. You'll find your favourites and leave the others to collect dust. [*]Some of the bosses aren't all that memorable while others give a good challenge. [*]The grappling hook is kind of awkward to me, personally. [/list]  [h1] Could've Done Without This [/h1] [list] [*] [b] The crashes. [/b] Out of the ten times I've booted this game up, I've been kicked out eight times by some computer japery. I've had to defeat the most time-consuming boss twice due to this, and that sours my mood. [/list]  All in all, it's a good time if you save often. I'd wait for a patch, but if you can pick it up on sale, go ahead.
Date 2016-07-01 Playtime 19h 37m Rec Positive Closer to castlevania than metroid in terms of gameplay, the controls are fairly good although there are some issues with certain movements triggering on you without you wanting them to due to the nature of how the ability works (being generic to prevent spoilers).  As far as difficulty, it's below average.  Enemies are predictable, and you rarely have any length between saves to make things problematic.  The strengths and reasons to buy the game are the story, sound track, and the exploration.  If you want a difficult game I would suggest something else, but it is worth it for sure for anyonethat likes a good game.
Date 2016-07-01 Playtime 0h 40m Rec Positive На первом уровне играет музыка, похожая на музыку из "Тайны третьей планеты"...  Отличная атмосферная игра.
Date 2016-07-01 Playtime 3h 19m Rec Positive I'm sure the entire concept process of this game, which was made by one guy, is. Dev: "How long until Nintendo makes another 2D Metroid game?  Never?  SCREW THEM!  I'M GOINGTO MAKE MY OWN 2D METROID GAME!  AND IT'LL HAVE BLACKJACK AND HOOKERS!"
Date 2016-07-01 Playtime 39h 51m Rec Positive Best game released this year :)
Date 2016-07-01 Playtime 18h 36m Rec Positive Really like this game. Had the right metroid feeling, but still got it's own atmosphere. The homages are all over the place. The backtracking some people complain about isn't as bad as it may seem. The map is well thought out, so it won't take too much time.   I got stuck a couple of times, most often because I missed a doorway. The controls are spot on and matched with great soundeffects. The music was really good.  I was actually hesitant to buy this at first, mainly because the gameplay didn't look that fun on screenshots and lets plays. But after trying it out I had a hard time putting the controller away.
Date 2016-07-01 Playtime 12h 21m Rec Positive 《公理边缘》（Axiom Verge）是一款很难让人找出缺点的游戏。海量的探索内容，舒适的操作手感，合理的难度曲线，以及极具8bit风格的画面和音乐使整个游戏从总体看几乎达到了类银河战士最成熟的高度。在得知这个游戏是由Thomas Happ一个人独自开发完成后，我对游戏中夸张的画面细节和极其洗脑的音乐更加肃然起敬，很难有勇气去指责游戏中出现的问题。  但反过来说，《公理边缘》在类银河战士的设计中已经非常完美，但也因为如此，也很难找到它存在的闪光点。游戏被“类银河战士”这个风格套得太深了，以至于除了艺术风格几乎没有其他的特点。当然游戏提供了一些特别的玩法，比如召唤小怪兽探路，分解枪改变地形结构这些比较特殊的玩法，但很难称之为改变游戏基础逻辑的要素，都是一些比较锦上添花的东西。 可能是最近类恶魔城银河战士游戏玩得太多了（没错我买了暑促metroidvania大包），玩这个游戏时并没有产生这类游戏应该有的魔性，环境虽然细节优秀但重复度略高，让人玩下去的动力却并不是很足，花了好几天才玩通了这款游戏。也许是审美疲劳了吧？  ……  似乎从上文看我有点贬这个游戏了，但游戏绝对是好游戏，如果你喜欢类银河战士，那你也绝对会爱上这个游戏。我只是不知道该用什么特别的语言来赞美这个游戏，因为从某种角度上来说，没有特色也是它的特色吧？  +关于银河战士的一切 +充满细节且魔性的8bit画面和音乐 -环境重复度有点高，后期易乏味  评分：8/10
Date 2016-07-01 Playtime 21h 59m Rec Positive This is one of my favorite games of 2015, maybe even my favorite. I can't really say much bad things about it.   The game feels great, there are a lot of weapons and you can choose your favorite, the music is awesome, there are tons of secrets and I love the look. The story is basic, that's about it, I can't really say more about it, good or bad.  If you are looking for a 2D metroidvania with a focus on shooting things, check out Axiom Verge.
Date 2016-07-01 Playtime 11h 35m Rec Positive 플레이 방식은 전형적인 메트로베니아 류의 게임입니다.  메트로베니아 게임을 접해본건 [오리와 눈먼 숲]과 이것 뿐이라 장르 내에서 평가하는건 좀 힘들지만  스테이지 구성은 밸런스가 잘 잡혀있고 맵 볼때 쪼금 불편한거 빼면 인터페이스도 만족  어린 시절에 콘트라 플레이하던 기억 떠올리게 해주는 분위기는 무척 좋았습니다.  전자음+글리치가 적절히 섞인 사운드와 이펙트, 기거의 아트를 연상시키는 그로테스크한 디자인 등등 개인적으로 저런 전반적인 비주얼이 핵심인 게임이라고 생각합니다. 고전적인 향수를 자극하는 점도 있고요   ＊ OST 용량이 무려 500메가. 본 게임 용량은 700메가...
Date 2016-07-01 Playtime 6h 17m Rec Positive Classic metroidvania style, good pace and nice array of weapons and pick ups
Date 2016-06-30 Playtime 4h 20m Rec Positive This game makes my axiom verge right up at a 45 degree angle. A delightful surprise that mixes old and new elements from the best games, and also brings it's own flavor. I'm having to force myself to stop playing after 4 hours because my eyeballs hurt.
Date 2016-06-30 Playtime 15h 1m Rec Positive Seriously, just get this game. Music is awesome, controls are awesome, weapons are awesome, and the difficulty curve is really well balanced. There's no school like the old school!
Date 2016-06-30 Playtime 2h 11m Rec Negative 买夏促大包里的，开始新游戏就闪退。。玩不了啊，有什么解决办法吗= =
Date 2016-06-30 Playtime 9h 35m Rec Positive An excellent little love letter to Super Metroid with just the right balance of combat and exploration, with an exquisite art style that mixes H.R. Giger with NES and SNES era Contra and similar games. It's packed with secrets, has a strange world that hints at just enough backstory that leaves you eager to learn more, and tells a short but fascinating story.  The only downside is that there aren't any warp rooms like in IGA's Castlevania games.
Date 2016-06-30 Playtime 14h 51m Rec Positive If you like Metroid, it's a must buy.  It's basically a love letter to Metroid.  Amazing soundtrack, great level design, interesting storyline.  Really hoping a sequel gets made.
Date 2016-06-30 Playtime 4h 10m Rec Positive What a super cool game!+++++++
Date 2016-06-30 Playtime 17h 55m Rec Positive Amazing
Date 2016-06-30 Playtime 14h 14m Rec Positive This has to be one of my all-time favorite games. It is literally on par with Super Metroid on SNES imo. I love the nostalgia feeling of the game, the music is also amazing.   I used an Steam controller for most of my playthrough but eventually swapped to my XBone controller for 2nd joystick.   If you grew up playing NES, SNES, Sega, in the 80's an 90's, you will love this game.   I CANNOT WAIT for a sequel for this game. Still love this game. :)  Still one of the best games of all time. :)
Date 2016-06-29 Playtime 14h 24m Rec Positive Tenía tiempo ya que venía con ganas de jugar un "Metroidvania". Axiom Verge es un juego que da en un buen clavo y, a mi parecer, pone un punto de partida que te deja con ganas de ver otra entrega donde se pulan aun más lo que está entregando. Es como si Contra, Metroid y Castlevania tuvieran un hijo.  De las cosas que me gustaron:  +Gran variedad de armas +Buena interfaz en menú +Controles intuitivos y con buena respuesta +Ambiente y terrenos muy bien logrados, precioso pixel art +Historia interesante y cautivadora +Buena dificultad +Muy buen soundtrack  De las cosas que creo debiera mejorar: -Enemigos finales relativamente sencillos (me faltó un enemigo con "maña" como Death de Castlevania, o Draygon de Metroid) -Algunas de las armas no son muy útiles, o bien el juego no genera necesidad de utilizarlas -El sistema de password le quita gracia a la exploración, preferiría poner en juego mis habilidades más que buscar el código correcto para acceder a una parte específica (ej: Lanza llamas) -Loop de música está compuesto por Fade in y fade out, le quita ritmo a la exploración. Esto es un elemento muy importante en un juego donde tienes que ir de aquí a allá buscando cosas, la música es un acompañante primordial.  De todas maneras, veo mucho aquí de un Metroid (NES), con elementos potenciales maravillosos. Es un gran comienzo de saga, más aun sabiendo que lo hizo una sola persona.
Date 2016-06-29 Playtime 14h 2m Rec Positive Fantroidastic!
Date 2016-06-29 Playtime 15h 14m Rec Positive The best metroidvania game I have played (by far) since Castlevania:SotN
Date 2016-06-29 Playtime 30h 7m Rec Positive I love metoid(vania)s. And it was a shame that we haven't seen another Metroid game in years. A true Metroid. ...and then Axiom Verge came out. It's THE Metroid we couldn't even dream for. It may as well be the best game in it's genre (i mean, Metroid genre, NOT Metroidvania, because it's a pure Metroid). Axiom Verge has everything that good Metroid game had - deep exploration gameplay, tough and massive boss battles, grim and Giger-ish atmosphere, beautifull soundtrack... And  it has something that Metroid, as long as i remember at least, never had - a good story. I could even say - excellent story that i wanted to know more about. Hell, this game even has cutscenes, and the plot uses not only dialogues between characters to tell the story, but also Notes as well. Though, i have gripes with this game too. At least half of the secrets/puzzles can be found only on accident or total digging through every wall. And even if you know where and what you need to do, sometimes you just can't understand HOW you has to do this. Most of the enemies are annoying as fuck and pretty hard too, at least in first half of the game. On the contrary, game becomes almost super easy in the second half, considering you've been collecting stuff. And yet, i'm in love with this game. I never been so immersed with Metroid game as i was in Axiom Verge. It's a masterpiece, even if it has some stuff to gripe about. Though, i can't praise it and love it too much. BECAUSE I FCUKING HATE CLIFFHANGERs
Date 2016-06-29 Playtime 15h 34m Rec Positive 好，很好，非常好。那么结局是挖坑还是有新作
Date 2016-06-29 Playtime 8h 31m Rec Positive It's like if Metroid took a shot of H.R.Giger while tripping on NES game glitches.
Date 2016-06-29 Playtime 17h 22m Rec Positive I am not easy to please when it comes to games. I have to say that I really enjoyed this one.  It has a really good Scifi story that pretty much tells you there will be a part two.  The controls and gameplay flowed well and I liked the weapons and abilities.    Good game. 
Date 2016-06-28 Playtime 0h 27m Rec Negative Ich finde es toll, dass man bei Steam Spiele zurückgeben kann. 
Date 2016-06-28 Playtime 14h 12m Rec Positive Very impessive hommage to Metroid. May seem too bit hardcore for a newbie.
Date 2016-06-28 Playtime 8h 14m Rec Positive Oh you like Metroid?!    Then you like this game, and if you don't you're wrong.    Bye.
Date 2016-06-28 Playtime 6h 53m Rec Positive Aw3some metroid-inspired game with great atmospheric graphics and music....
Date 2016-06-27 Playtime 14h 6m Rec Positive Difficult and amazing game.   Reminds me of metroid
Date 2016-06-27 Playtime 9h 58m Rec Positive Do you like Metroid? Do you like good Storytelling? Eerie Atmosphere? Yes, yes and yes? Then you [i]may[/i] like Axiom Verge because it offers at least the Metroid'y parts you like and love. The game handles just like Samus on SNES, the upgrade and exploration system is quite similar while adding little interesting knacks to the powerups and their usage.  Axiom Verge is trying hard to be a homage to Metroid while struggling to define its own identity. The graphics have that distinct NES flair, even turning flickering and glitches into a smartly implemented mechanic. However the design overall more often than not looks bland and samey, alterated only by monotonous color schemes that quickly turn boring to the Samus-spoiled eye.   The soundtrack has its moments, driving the dark sci-fi shivers up your spine in rare moments. However there are also the flaws: sound assets and music parts are often unfitting, sometimes plain annoying to the ear. Music often appeared as very unfitting to the sceneries shown, taking me out of the immersion. The story offers great potential, but falls flat on its face during the later parts of the game. Boss fights look interesting at first glance, but quickly devolve into a "find the ideal position and fire away" fest.   In short: For every bit of light there are quite a lot of shadows lurking in the corner.  Overall Axiom Verge has some great ideas, but the "wow" moments are rarely spread. There's a huge load of backtracking involved and secrets are often discovered by hard trial and error instead of smart hints. The gameplay is overall fluid, without major flaws and the character controls are as tight as can be. Axiom Verge gives you 10-15h of "good" content to chew on, depending on your expertise within the genre.  If you're in desperate need for a "Metroid'y" game, give it a shot. However it's not a must-have in my book. 
Date 2016-06-27 Playtime 13h 36m Rec Positive De los tantos metroidvanias que se hacen llamar que existen por ahí, Axiom Verge transmite el miedo a lo desconocido que debería evocar este tipo de juegos, además de contar con habilidades muy interesantes. Buena dificultad, buena duración.  Algo que no me gustó fue la variedad de armas, me parece que solo era diferente la forma de disparar cada una sin tener un fin claro y que rebotaran rayos o balas por todos lados sin razón.
Date 2016-06-27 Playtime 17h 1m Rec Positive The best Metroid game since Zero Mission.
Date 2016-06-27 Playtime 20h 36m Rec Positive Quelle claque !  Ce jeu est une petite perle, ça faisait un moment qu'il me faisait de l'oeil et vu l'arrivée des soldes Steam, j'ai tenté le coup ! Et bien la seule chose que je regrette, c'est de l'avoir acheté à ce prix. Pour me donner bonne conscience j'ai d'ailleurs acheté l'OST.  En parlant de l'OST, les musiques sont absolument magistrales, totalement en accord avec le jeu, ambiance et level design de folie, science-fiction pure. J'en ai encore des frissons...  Gameplay solide comme les bons vieux Metroid en leur temps mais avec quelques spécifités bien à lui et une multitude de secrets et choses à trouver qui ne sont pas uniquement cosmétiques comme dans tout bon AAA mais qui diversifie le gameplay si on se donne la peine de les trouver (p. ex. améliorations ou armes). Pour les plus acharnés un mode "Speedrun" est également disponible.  Et dire que tout ceci n'est l'oeuvre que d'une seule et unique personne, et bien je vous tire le chapeau M. Happ !
Date 2016-06-27 Playtime 24h 4m Rec Positive really fun metroid-like game with a bunch of silly weapons, but the writing has SERIOUS problems. obviously we're here for the metroid type gameplay and story takes a big back seat, so its no deal breaker, but with all the really cool geiger-esque art, a better story would have done wonders.  there's a heavy amount of backtracking, though maybe thats just the way i played it, and the path forward is hard to find sometimes, and the bosses, aside from one boss early on, are for the most part kinda lame (aside from the art, which all look pretty cool), but other than that, its pretty good
Date 2016-06-27 Playtime 23h 14m Rec Positive This game is just frickin' fun.
Date 2016-06-27 Playtime 7h 44m Rec Positive It's exactly what I expected: Not quite as good as Super Metroid.
Date 2016-06-27 Playtime 11h 3m Rec Positive Axiom Verge has been characterised as a Metroidvania 2-D sidescrolling shooter. Although this description is certainly true when glancing at the game's surface, it is misleading as to what this game is truly about. Axiom Verge is about the atmosphere of the world rather than depth of gameplay.  Axiom Verge was created entirely by a single man. That man has done a phenomenal job on the aesthetics of the game. But just beneath the veneer of beautiful pixel artwork and retro techno music lies a game that falls short to deliver a challenging and ultimately satisfying experience.   Most of the game's enemies are pushovers that do not have the numbers or intelligence to pose a serious threat. The only time that they become dangerous is when the player gets impatient and tries to rush through a particular section of the game. In addition, the boss fights are completely repetitive once you understand the boss's weakness, requiring very little  thought or skill. All of this amounts to a game in which the player's responses to new areas of the map are more or less the same.   The story is shallow and trite. The developer of this game should not be writing for anything, let alone a video game. I wager that he could have paid any amateur with a modicum of hobby writing experience to flesh out a skeleton storyboard and they could have come up with something better. Some reviewers have said that the story is interesting. While the setting may be interesting, the writing and overrall narrative structure is cliche at best and just plain bad at worst.   All of that said, the artwork and atmosphere are still quite beautiful. That alone justifies at least a 5-15$ price tag depending on how much that means to you. Indeed, I myself originally bought this game for the artwork and was not disappointed on that front.   In essence, Axiom Verge is an atmospheric Metroidvania-style 2-D sidescrolling shooter with good artworkand smooth gameplay mechanics that could have used significant input from a more seasoned game designer.
Date 2016-06-27 Playtime 23h 45m Rec Positive This game is a perfect spiritual successor to Metroid, modernized, made grittier and less comfortable. You're going to get a lot of game play, and be forced to actually think some times to get where you need to be. The variety of secrets and weapons is worth it alone. The soundtrack is incredible, the nostalgia is spot on, and the plot is more surprisingly complex than you're going to expect at the onset.
Date 2016-06-27 Playtime 13h 48m Rec Positive Short story: if you love Metroid you MUST have this game, it's awesome (especially since it's not like we're gonna see a Metroid anytime soon because someone in Kyoto can't manage their brands)  - - -  A slightly longer story: Axiom Verge is a real beautiful and well thought game, especially if we consider that it has developed by a single person. High quality 2D retro graphics and on point music take you on a journey on this strange world, a fantastic mix of organic and cybernetic that made me constanstly wonder on the true nature of my surroundings. There are a lot of creative ideas and the game is challenging enough even for Metroidvania fans: you can see all the love for the genre poured in this game.  There are a couple of downsides though: there are too many secrets... Don't get me wrong, I know it's the point of the Metroidvania genre, but I feel like Axiom Verge takes it to an extreme. Normally there are a majority of easy to guess secrets and a certain number of secrets that are a real pain to find. In Axiom Verge, there are way too many secrets that are a real pain to find. I'm all about thinking outside the box, but sometimes I found items for dumb luck and even then, despite being an avid collector, I scored a 72% on my first run: too many way to interact with the surroundings, too many things to check, too frustratring in the end. Combined with no way to fast travel (a running power-up or a teleport between areas), it discouraged me from aiming to 100%. Going back to the roots of the genre it's cool, but I think you can take a couple of pages from modern games too: Metroid Fusion marks the rooms with items to find, but even then you have to struggle to get it. I think this would have been great for Axiom Verge.  So:  >>Pros<< +Graphics +Music +Atmosphere +Story +Cool ideas +Challenging  >>Cons<< -No fast-travel -Too many controintuitive secrets -Too many items for interacting with the surroundings, risulting in lack of focus  It's not perfect, but it's a great game, altough I can't see myself completing at 100%  8,7/10
Date 2016-06-27 Playtime 31h 25m Rec Positive This is the best metroid-like game since Super Metroid. You start out weak with no abilities. As you progress you pick up health, damage increasers, projectile size and distance increasers, unique weapons, and of course various abilities. Unlike Metroid weapons don't do anything except let you kill enemies; you open up new paths purely with your abilities.  Abilities include a drone that lets you get through those tiny places because Trace can't crawl for some reason (it's ok because the drone is sweet). A drill that lets you break blocks to find hidden areas. Coats that let you "glitch" through walls. A glitch gun that changes the properties of enemies, making them easier to kill and sometimes becoming the key to solve a puzzle and getting a powerup. And more!  There's over a dozen weapons in the game, all with unique ways to kill enemies. The only problem is some weapons are clearly superior, and others are so bad you'll never use them.  The enemies are fairly unique, and satisfyingly explode into little pixels when you destroy them. The bosses are also challenging and fun. You almost never feel like the game is cheating, but instead that you just haven't figured out a good strategy.  The sound effects and especially music are top notch.  The world is large with many secrets. There are even Secret Worlds you can find that give you extra powerups. The game will likely take you 10-12 hours to beat on your first playthrough. There's also a hard mode and a speedrun mode to add more playability and challenge.  I do have a couple complaints though. The story is very confusing. Even after beating the game and reading all the notes I'm still not sure what was going on. It's ok though because a game like this the story isn't important. My last complaint is that powerup locations don't appear on your map. In all 2d Metroid games with a map, there's a circle on a map section to show there's an item there, and it becomes a dot when you find it. No such thing here. But there is a yellow dot in the upper right if you've found all items for that map, and a purple dot if you've uncovered all parts of that map.  If you love the Metroid games you are all but guaranteed to love this game too. Buy it, you won't regret it!
Date 2016-06-26 Playtime 9h 23m Rec Positive If you liked the old school 2D Metroid games, this one is for you.
Date 2016-06-26 Playtime 13h 58m Rec Positive In una parola: STUPENDO!!  Trama, atmosfera, giocabilità...tutto al TOP. Mi pare impossibile che ci sia una sola persona dietro a questo gioiello. Per i miei gusti se la gioca (se non addirittura supera) i vari Metroid 2D che ho giocato (praticamente tutti) e, insieme a Metroid Prime per gamecube, rappresenta il meglio che questo genere abbia da offrire. Da giocare assolutamente.
Date 2016-06-26 Playtime 15h 25m Rec Positive I'd say the best way to sum this game up is combine the feel of the alien visuals from the orignal Contra with the play style of Super Metroid and you have Axiom Verge.  The game is visually impressive, the music is killer and the game has quite the atmosphere.  The technical aspects like control and such feel pretty polished as well.  I'd say if you grew up on Super Metroid and wanted a successor this is pretty much it.
Date 2016-06-26 Playtime 42h 39m Rec Positive I'm not sure why this new wave of gaming critics have become so jaded? This is quite a solid and well polished Metroid-Vania 2D adventure platformed. I've been playing all genre of games since pong was released in the late 70's, so I think I can offer an unbiased opinion.  The game doesn't break any new ground, but, Axiom dies what it does in a great and stylized way that gives it, it's own identity.  1. Solid and actually pixel perfect jumping. 2. Unique weapons make this game fun and also creates the need to explore every nook and cranny for hidden modifications and upgrades. 3. Game Play makes up for a thin story, but! The game is very fun to look at and explore.   I highly recommend this game to anyone in the need fire many hours of game play and 2D adventure.
Date 2016-06-26 Playtime 1h 44m Rec Positive This game is awesome.  It's like Turrican and R-Type had a pixel baby!
Date 2016-06-26 Playtime 25h 2m Rec Positive This game is what you get if you put the gameplay of Super Metroid, the music and setting from System Shock, and characters from HR Giger, in a blender. You get an interesting mess. It's a mess because the story is just all over the place. Struggling to make sense of what's going on, you pick up datalogs about priestessess, kings, wars, dimensions, and it's all absolutely random and mostly completely unrelated, and in the end, you are left just as clueless as you began. If the author tried to make sense at all, he failed. ...but I think that the gameplay makes up for it.
Date 2016-06-26 Playtime 14h 0m Rec Positive I put this game off for a long time, I am kicking myself wondering why.  This game is a throw back to all the early NES games that i grew up with. Metroid? yep its in there. Castlevania? It's got some of that to. just about every popular original NES game is in this game!!! I played it for about 8 hours today and only stopped because my thumb hurts. great game!!!!!
Date 2016-06-26 Playtime 23h 2m Rec Positive Wonderful game. Please, more!
Date 2016-06-26 Playtime 23h 59m Rec Positive 画面风格十分不错，配乐很有感觉，融入恶魔城的探索乐趣，很久没有这么纯粹的横版act了，只是配上手柄才完美。
Date 2016-06-26 Playtime 10h 59m Rec Positive Yep - good, very good!(halfway through the game)  I have played many 80's/90's platformers, since the mid 80's, and this little guy just oozes with nostalgia: -Metroid/Castlevania(of course) -Konami-ish art style from the NES days -Mega Man strenght/weakness system for bosses(intentional or not, it's the way I see it)  Pretty cool story!  The only thing wrong with the game is the map layout...maybe I'm not looking at the different 'zones' connecting together correctly, but it's confusing as heck...good thing I have a good memory.  All in all, the game is perfect, except for it's map system, which I rely on at 'GPS-grade'(a regular paper map always being better than a GPS).
Date 2016-06-26 Playtime 22h 56m Rec Positive Excellent Metroid-like  It's a bit tedious to backtrack every time you find a powerup to find new areas that are opened up, but still highly recommended!
Date 2016-06-26 Playtime 28h 7m Rec Positive Metroidvania at it's bestest!
Date 2016-06-25 Playtime 13h 2m Rec Positive I wish Nintendo would give this guy the license to Metroid.
Date 2016-06-25 Playtime 16h 28m Rec Positive Excelente jogo, apesar de ter sido feito para os orfãos de metroid plataforma eu recomendo a todos
Date 2016-06-25 Playtime 11h 26m Rec Negative 前から興味があり、今回セールで値下げされていたので購入しました。 しかし残念ながらこのゲームには致命的なバグがあります。  少しネタバレになるのですが、ストーリー途中で「改良された白衣」というアイテムを手にいれ、壁をすり抜けるようになりますがこれがバグですり抜けられません。 この現象により行けない所、取れないアイテムが出てきます。  また、このアイテムは人にもよりますが入手時のプレイ時間が2時間前後なので場合によってはギリギリ返金出来なくなる恐れがあります。  これから購入される方はご注意ください。
Date 2016-06-24 Playtime 13h 52m Rec Positive Loved this game.  The atmosphere, music, weapon variation were all fantastic.  Very well done.  And as a retro gamer, this hits a homerun.  The one issue is I use the steam controller, and it kind of sucks... I could not easily get the dash to work which is a simple double tap command, but not easy to pull off with the steam control.  Regardless, the game is fantastic!
Date 2016-06-24 Playtime 11h 38m Rec Positive This is the best Metroid game since Zero Mission, and thanks its the unique flavor, manages to completely blow away the expectation that it won't evoke the sweet, sweet feeling of being lost in a strange and well-crafted labyrinth of a world.
Date 2016-06-23 Playtime 27h 48m Rec Positive Amazing game, awesome soundtrack... I can't think of anything negative to say about this game.
Date 2016-06-22 Playtime 12h 31m Rec Positive Fun Metroidvania. Lots of exploration and a neat story with a good twist. One of the things that sets it apart from other metroid clones is its large selection of guns. You dont really need to find all the gun upgrades to progress, just a handful of them. But there are just a huge amount of guns you can find and just use whichever one you perfer since they all work differently, but do about the same amount of damage. Some are better for boss fights, some better for mass AOE, some good for killing an enemy behind a wall ect. Plus the usualy metroidvania upgrades like grapple hook, higher jumps ect.
Date 2016-06-22 Playtime 27h 38m Rec Positive Yes, yes, yes. All of this in my face.
Date 2016-06-21 Playtime 46h 30m Rec Positive Seriously a really fun Metroidvania style game with fun gameplay, great music and challenging bosses.  I spent a long time playing this game, and I would recommend this to anyone out there who's feeling a little Metroid withdrawal.
Date 2016-06-20 Playtime 15h 8m Rec Positive I didn't realize how much I needed another dark sci-fi game about murdering aliens in another dimension until I played it.  Thomas Happ is clearly a massive fan of Super Metroid, but Axiom Verge still feels like its own thing; especially the controls. The main character, Trace, doesn't really feel like Samus. It's a riff on Metroid, not a remake. It takes the Giger influences and cranks them to 11, throws in some System Shock, and tops it off with a pulsing 80s synth soundtrack.  Taking my time during my first playthrough, it took just under 9 hours. I'm already thinking about playing through again on Hard and/or going for a better item collection percentage and completion time.
Date 2016-06-18 Playtime 63h 41m Rec Positive Pretty much Tom Happ's response to the question: "If Nintendo won't make a new 2D Metroid game, who will?" It's amazingly made, and its all done by one person over the span of 5 years.   9/10  At times you seem to get stuck, especially for players who never played a 2D Metroid game before. It has a lot of secret places and ways to go, and finding those may be a little too difficult for some. Other than that it's an amazingly well crafted game!
Date 2016-06-18 Playtime 24h 18m Rec Positive 这游戏还是有点必要来一发测评的。 首先,这游戏定位是动作解谜类，动作占9成,解谜占1成。虽然需要解谜的地方不多,但是有些道具有些地方需要开点脑洞才能拿到或去到。比如有个房间就一个机械脑袋漂浮在房间中央,但是地图明显上面还有很多地方可以去的,这时候你把能放出的虫子打进他嘴里,他就直接带着虫子向上走了..然后就能上到上面去了。 再来说说动作方面,过于难了,特别前期,血不多,武器弱,怪略强的情况下,死个10次都算少了。我依稀记得,有个地方,也是放出虫子然后穿过几个房间拿道具的,那个虫子,碰那么几下就得死,你还必须步步为营,记得就这个地方玩了我整整一个晚上,玩过去简直和特么解完一个特难的数学题一样的快感。后期武器,血量足了,还有铁布衫跟基因炸弹的话,基本上就是你在玩怪。 武器方面不得不讲一下,十个武器九个都是废的,玩来玩去你就发现,卧槽,电那把是无敌的,其余都什么几把玩意..不仅没新意也很没用。 最后说一下一个比较酷炫的地方..就是不断重复向上瞬移一段距离再向上放出虫子然后移形换影这几个步骤从而能到达某些极其高的地方的这个隐秘技巧,在我看来是有点炫而且很考操作,算是有点意思的一个地方。  画面:像素游戏,打个毛分。 音乐:从来玩游戏都是听歌的,颗颗 游戏性:10/10(真的挺值得一玩)  [spoiler] PS:有个地方,就是几个里面会跳出敌人的熔浆的那个房间,哪个扑街想出hack然后在熔浆表面出现台子这个主意的,就这个坎,让我跑全图跑了起码5个小时,放置4个月,前几天无意间按了一下,才发现还有这种吊东西..[/spoiler]
Date 2016-06-16 Playtime 16h 17m Rec Positive 8/10   I will start with the negative first. This game is incredibly time consuming/repetitive while you try and figure out which way to go. You get items that grant you abilities to access different areas of the same parts of the map you were already in. You need to constantly retrace your steps to make sure you have gotten the upgrades needed to advance the plotline. You need to remember where certain areas were that you could not reach before and go back to them. It is a giant effing headache. I realize some people may enjoy this but I don't have the time to mess around doing monotonous tasks, I wish they had an option that showed you your objective on map instead of blindly guessing where to go next.   That said this game is very fun to play overall. The control is great, plotline keeps you interested and the graphics aren't bad either considering this is made to resemble an 8bit side scroller.
Date 2016-06-16 Playtime 14h 32m Rec Positive Classic Metroid/Castlevania style game. Plays great with Steam Controller. Maps utilize weapons/gear you find like this type of game is supposed to. Good soundtrack. Etc. etc. etc.
Date 2016-06-14 Playtime 8h 34m Rec Positive The plot is a little too strange and complex for my liking. But, I love the atmosphere and the gameplay so much that I am fine with it. It's a really great throwback to Metroid. Anyone who liked Super Metroid back in the day has to give this a try.
Date 2016-06-12 Playtime 13h 44m Rec Positive Axiom Verge  Let us forgo the usual, metroidvania, copy, etc etc etc here and look at this game based upon its own merits.  Axiom Verge opens with an incredibly vague story of a young man blasted out of his lab, and into a world unknown to humanity.  Our protaginist, Trace, must accept the words of mechanical women of gargantuan size known as Rusalki, who are his only link to what has happened and why he is there.  +Gameplay+ The controls in this game are extremely smooth, though being a metroidvania style game, I would be extremely disappointed if it weren't otherwise. Movement is rather smooth, and the addition of the classic Super Metroid lock button for contorls makes combating some of the bosses and enemies easier.  +Options- Options, or rather weaponry and gadgets are varied in this case. While the gadgts are well balanced, and extremely cool in their use, the weapons I found lackluster due to balancing.  Gadgets - You will be introduced to a slew of gadgets to help Trace get across the world of Axiom, from zipping thorugh walls, to controlling a drone that will later on help you reach sections that were accessible due to Trace's size.  Weapons- Weapons offer a huge variety, but very few of them really offer anything good, which presents the issue of Quantity of Quality. I feel that less weapons with improved power would be a better focus here, as many of the weapons shown, are cool, but highly ineffective, since their capabilities generally do not mess well during combat, and the reduce damage some weapons make, keep them on the unselected list, which by the end of the game, your having to quickly run through the weapon ring becomes a minor hastle, not game breaking.  +Level Design+ I enjoyed the level design that this game offered, various locations had their own unique feel and generally included their own flora and fauna. Though the maps may feel large at times, and one wishes they could teleport from save egg to save egg, overall, these various locals offer enough of a distinct atmosphere as to push Trace onward.  +Plot+ Oh yes, the plot of this game is phenomenal, and it does push you, as the player, to find all the key notes to help explain what is going on. As you begin to unlock answers, it may make you doubt who the real hero and villains are. Combined with the alien landscape, the story and Trace's interactions with the Rasalki are both interesting, and at times, heart pounding as you wonder why thigns are the way they are.  +Music & Sound+ The Music from location to location is varied, and unique, helping to define the many areas that you travel through. It harkens back to the days of Genesis and SNES sound tracks, with limited room for instruments, thus forcing the composer to work in a creative twist to make each track memorable. The Sound design of creatures, weapons, and enemies are good, clear, and not obnoxiously loud or annoying, and I give it to their sound designer for creating good clear audio that fit the weapons, creature, and ambience of the world.  +Final Thoughts+  I highly recommended this game, I've played through it a few times, and like Metroid, it can be beaten fairly quickly once you have the locations and the rhythm down. With a story that makes so many questions a challenge to find answers to, the end left me wanting a sequel, and as old as this game maybe, I certainly would play a sequel to continue on the adventure of Trace and the world of Axiom.  I hope many of you found this review informative, without crossing into spoilers, and that you give this game a chance, you'll find it worth it.
Date 2016-06-12 Playtime 30h 9m Rec Positive Metroidvania that broke its own cartridge.
Date 2016-06-12 Playtime 14h 38m Rec Positive Let's face it: we'll probably never see another proper metroidvania in either Metroid or Castlevania series. Koji Igarashi is taking care of the latter right now, working on his much anticipated Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. As for the former -- here it is, the Metroid we were wating for, made by one person. Axiom Verge follows the genre formula to a T, dropping the player into a vast world, full of interconnected rooms with a plethora of weapons and upgrades to find, monsters and bosses to kill and secrets to uncover. It somehow also manages to be innovative, introducing some unconventional weapons and mechanics, the most prominent being the glitch gun. The SciFi story is somewhat nonsensical, but the world it takes place in and the characters it makes you meet are memorably eery -- a dead planet inhabited by several AIs in form of colossal severed female heads that would make H. R. Giger shiver. Visuals are awesome -- while anyone can try to lure the nostalgic audience with "retro graphic", it takes a real artist to create pixel art that stands well on its own. Same goes for music: catchy and atmosperic, it's much more than your average chiptune. Forget the nostalgia factor: Axiom Verge is an awesome game by itself. If you long for a fresh metroidvania experience, grab it and get your fingers blistered!

Date 2016-06-09 Playtime 16h 47m Rec Positive Masterpiece
Date 2016-06-08 Playtime 28h 42m Rec Positive Are you looking to relive the Metroid games from NES, SNES, Gameboy and GB Advance? This is the game you want right now! Since Nintendo is moving Metrid games into the FPS direction, this would be a wonderful game to ignite a new series from. The story is weird, but cool. The weapons and abilities you aquire are fun to use and also both similar to, but different from those of Samus. Similar enough that it feels like the same series, but different enough to set the main character, Trace, apart from the Space Bounty Hunter we all know and love.  This game has just taken my heart. I fell in love with it when I first saw it's ads 2 years ago for it's kickstarter. I stayed away of playing it all this time because I wanted to see if I could avoid spoilers other than what the ads themselves show. I was successful and even purchased the game over 6 months before I played it to further my own personal hype.  In the last week, I put 17 hours into the game, all livestreamed on my YouTube channel. I have never been so happy playing a game on YouTube, even though my views were very limited. It was worth it and I intend to try playing it again in my free time and on normal mode (I played it on hard). This game is worth buying at full price, but if you see it on sale, GET IT!!!
Date 2016-06-08 Playtime 26h 37m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a Metroidvania. We have plenty of those. But Axiom Verge is a cut above. It is a quality title and unlike many others in the genre, AV takes most of its inspiration from the original Metroid from the NES. In fact, it almost feels like spiritual successor of both Metroid.  You step in to the shoes of Trace, a scientist who awakes in a mesmerizingly desolate world after apparently dying in a laboratory explosion. The plot of AV is Trace finding out the strange truth behind the world he's arrived in, the creatures that reside there, and what happened to him in that explosion.  The presentation of AV is a knock-out. Everything from graphics, the character designs, the sound, the music, the plot, and even the carefully-picked dialogue comes together to build this eldritch, dreamlike journey through the world of Sudra. The moment-to-moment action is already quite engaging and responsive but having that extra element of atmosphere just heightens the play and makes Axiom Verge a very captivating experience.  This game gives you many upgrades to find (many of them secret) and they are always satisfying to procure. There are more than 20 guns for the player to use including a special “Glitch gun” that has unique wild effects on each of the world's enemies. You are welcomed and encouraged to experiment with all of Trace's arsenal and chances are you'll be surprised with how fun some of these weapons can be.  There is a flaw to this game and it's hard to put one's finger on. Exploring this psychedelic world should be a little bit more exciting. Maybe its the backtracking or maybe the world just doesn't have enough detail in its design, but moving through the world isn't as fun as the more critical moments in the game. Dare I say, it can be boring.  However, overall this is a recommended game. It takes many appropriate lessons from the classics of genre and is put together so well that it will likely be considered a classic in the coming years. Those wanting to play a truly great Metroidvania or maybe those who have not been sold on the genre should check out Axiom Verge.
Date 2016-06-08 Playtime 9h 35m Rec Negative Me ha resultado un juego muy frustrante. Un clon del metroid, pero más lento, con mucho backtracking, enemigos aburridos, jefes sosísimos. Entiendo que no hay mucho dónde elegir en este género, y que la base del juego está trabajada, pero es en los pequeños detalles donde me parece que el juego no aguanta el tipo.  Desde tonterías como que la música no hace loop (hace fadeout/fadein cuando tiene que volver a empezar) hasta enemigos que son espojas de balas y lo único que hacen es alargar el juego artificialmente.  Es mejor idea rejugar el Super Metroid original o algunos de los Castlevanias de GBA o NDS. Una pena porque el juego está hecho por una sola persona, y es algo elogiable, pero preferiría que hubiera recibido algo de ayuda y el juego hubiera resultado más redondo.
Date 2016-06-07 Playtime 21h 35m Rec Positive Si eres fanático de los Metroid, te gusta el estilo Retro y una buena historia, este es tu juego. Simplemente Excelente. Montones de Armas e Items por descubrir, un mapa extenso, buena dificultad, muy buena banda sonora y una duración sorpresivamente extensa para ser un Indie (15h+).  100% COMPATIBLE CON EL CONTROL DE 360.  RECOMENDADO.
Date 2016-06-06 Playtime 12h 41m Rec Positive I can't recommend this game highly enough. With Super Metroid being my favorite game of all time, Axiom Verge scratched the Metroid itch way more than I thought possible. The guns and enemies are creative, the level design is mindful, exploration is fun and the story is actually quite impressive. If you're looking for old school fun with a new school feel, this game is for you.
Date 2016-06-02 Playtime 17h 32m Rec Positive Great game, perfect if you like the metroid series. crazy to think that it was developed by one man.
Date 2016-05-31 Playtime 8h 46m Rec Positive Borrowing heavily from the Metroid formula, this game does a wonderful job rekindling the wonder of adventuring in an unknown world.  The game feels great to play and a provides the player with a diverse set of obstacles, enemies, and puzzles to overcome.  It also features an impressive number of weapons, and secrets aplenty to discover!  If you have fond memories of Super Metriod and would like nothing more to re-experience that kind of gameplay, you couldn't do better than Axiom Verge.
Date 2016-05-30 Playtime 15h 23m Rec Positive One of the gems that I've discovered due to the IndieBox system. Axiom Verge is a Metroid-like game that is designed SOLELY by one person, Thomas Happ. For me Axiom Verge is one of the best games I've played during 2015. Where to start? the gameplay is very good and fluid, the atmosphere is enthralling, the music is very captivating, and the story is very intriguing and fresh.  In Axiom verge, you play as a scientist who becomes involved in a bizzare science experiment and wakes up in an alien environment. This premise is very similar to Another World, but the moment the game starts you realize you are in a totally different game both in gameplay and tone. All of the game mechanics, including dying and respawning is explained in story which increases the immersiveness of the game considerably. As the game progresses, the story becomes more and more bizzare. In order to understand the storyline, you have to collect a lot of hidden items throughout the game world.  One major weak point of the game is the fact that after mid-game, you are left alone with very little direction to go in a huge game world. Since the Indiebox package I got included a full game world map I had little problem where to go, but without such a map I can understand the game requires A LOT of trial and error and backtracking. Also, one of the last upgrades you receive near the end of the game is operated hard by keyboard compared to a gamepad.  Pros:  - Very well written and intriguing storyline  - Fluid gameplay with a lot of different mechanics  - Extremely good visuals  - Amazing soundtrack!!!  - Tons of hidden materials that increases the replayability of the game  Cons:  - Without a guide or a map, finding where to go becomes a very hard task after mid-game  - Some late game mechanics work much better with a gamepad and doesn't work as fluid with a keyboard.  
Date 2016-05-30 Playtime 19h 47m Rec Positive El mejor Metroid desde Super Metroid, largo complejo, lleno e secretos y con una historia que sinceramente me ha gustado un montón, ¿Recomendado? Ya te digo! Una de las mejores inversiones que hice en 2015 en Steam

Date 2016-05-29 Playtime 11h 11m Rec Positive A heartfelt homage to Super Metroid, with a superb chiptune score — and all done by one guy.
Date 2016-05-29 Playtime 85h 58m Rec Positive One of the best games of our time. Must buy for any fan of the metroidvania genre.
Date 2016-05-27 Playtime 28h 44m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a great looking and great sounding Metroidvania style game that puts its best foot forward and puts a few good twists on genre expectations, but trips a little bit at places which prevent the game from being truly amazing all around.  As said, the game looks and sounds beautiful. The graphics are tile-based and done in a stylish faux-8-bit fashion which causes things to look alien and abstract, creating an eerie atmosphere that draws you in from the start. The backgrounds are more detailed and often beautiful in their own right as well, however the cutscene art is less impressive looking with human characters looking weirdly off-model. The music is all well done and chiptune in style, with each zone having a unique and memorable soundtrack that further establishes an otherworldly alien atmosphere.   Gameplay is very tight and responsive, Trace, the player character controls very well and there are a TON of collectibles to find: health expansions, weapon upgrades for range and projectile size, and -19- different weapons plus a secret weapon to find. There's also a large variety of unique tricks to Axiom Verge such as a mechanized drone that you can swap places with, a "glitch" gun that solves puzzles, reveals secrets, and alters enemy behaviors, a drill that allows you to break through tiles and explore further areas and a teched out labcoat that lets you phase through solid walls. There's a lot of variety in player ability and makes exploration fun and rewarding.  However, for all its neat tricks and secrets, Axiom Verge does fall flat in a few places. First and most notably are the enemies and bosses - while visually many enemies are unique looking and a few have some interesting tricks, most are just fodder and aren't very remarkable. Moreso lacking are the bosses - there are technically 10, but two of them are fake outs which come in the late mid-game, and the final zone alone has 3 boss fights to itself - one of which is skippable. That makes half of the games bosses there, and the other half are largely concentrated in the first 1/3 of the game before you gain the ability to backtrack to previous areas. So in effect, you fight four decently designed bosses before you even really start gaining any good abilities or weapons, then go through a large stretch of the game without any boss fights at all - aside from the two fake outs, theres only one true boss fight in the mid-late game, and then have the last three thrown at you all in the final zone.   It is a very awkward and honestly grating pace, as the first few bosses can be very difficult with your low item collections at the time, and as stated you can't backtrack to search for more items until these initial bosses are dealt with, then by the time you fight another boss you've likely gotten so many new toys that the remaining ones are pushovers. Axiom Verge just doesn't let you use all the toys it gives you in a very enjoyable way outside of exploring its game world, sadly.  Lastly, the game's story is just very lackluster. The atmosphere is fantastic and intriguing, the game world eerie with a backstory hidden behind collectible notes and files of a world that had advanced technology and faced catastrophe.... but little is done with it. The notes only paint a vague image, and the primary supporting cast - H.R. Giger looking creatures called Rusalki - only pitch in the story occasionally. A big deal is made about awakening them from a stasis and repairing them, but once you do nothing really happens with them besides the first one you meet. I know gameplay should be prioritized over story, but story is important too and I feel if Axiom Verge was going to be this minimalist with its plot, perhaps it shouldn't have had one at all, or at least just a very bare bones "game manual" plot. As it is, Axiom Verge introduces a lot of cool concepts, characters and visually interesting places but does very little with them, sadly.  This all said and done, I do reccommend the game. For its flaws, it still plays and sounds and looks beautiful, and is a well designed Metroidvania for the most part. It's a much needed science fiction style Metroidvania and for a game made entirely by one person in his free time, it certainly shines. Also, you can put Trace in a leotard with the legendary Justin Bailey code. That's amazing.
Date 2016-05-27 Playtime 0h 42m Rec Positive Amazing.
Date 2016-05-27 Playtime 18h 45m Rec Positive Wonderful stylized graphics meant to invoke memories of the 16 bit era and tight play control means you go where you want every time you want to go there.  No harder than say Super Metroid makes this an eminently approachable game for people new to the genre or just wanting a breather after La Mulana or Environmental Station Alpha.    The game features a higher than average volume of primary weapons, in addition to the expected mobility powers (double jump, high jump, grappling hook), and passive stat upgrades. Beyond that it takes a unique spin on the Maru Maru that I don't want to spoil.  Oh and those weapons?  Not just gimmick trash, I have found a reasonable and probably intended use for every weapon I picked up.  No useless armaments for you my friend.   TL;DR 10/10 wonderful metroidvania
Date 2016-05-26 Playtime 10h 30m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is fun metroidvania style game very very heavily influenced by the old 2d Metroid games. Fortunately it has a similar level of quality to them, Personally I didn't like the art style but the gameplay is great. There's a wide variety of guns to use and most of them are fun. The huge sprawling map is well designed and only certain parts of it feel tedious to navigate.  Apart from finding your way around the large maze like world, the main appeal to these kinds of games is going back to a roadblock you found and using your new powerups to surpass it and solve the puzzles ahead and there's plenty of that in Axiom Verge.  Overall the game is a lot of fun to play with a great sense of progression as you gain new techinques, find new weapons and explore every nook and cranny for more powerups. However I feel it is let down by lacklustre boss fights and a very disappointing ending preceeded by an unnecessarily tedious level. Still worth a play though.
Date 2016-05-26 Playtime 68h 36m Rec Positive A great metroid-vania game!
Date 2016-05-26 Playtime 12h 16m Rec Negative Not that I think it's a bad game, because it really isn't. It just isn't as good as what inspired it. It's basically a less fun version of Super Metroid. It gets boring and monotonous pretty quickly. Some of my key problems with the game are...  *The weapons system. The sort of weapons you upgrade to and get to use aren't really all that helpful. Some just seem like they have no purpose at all, other than the make the game more difficult. They also seem underpowered, as they rarely stop anything. Some enemies will be all over you instantly while you're blasting away. That's the main thing I found annoying. I found myself avoiding than engaging.   *The enemies. Like I said above, if I could avoid all the enemies I would. Some are all over you in seconds. Others are just plain annoying. I feel as if the weapons are underpowered.   *The flow of the game. One minute you're exploring a new area, the next you're scratching your head. This happens way too often, and you're forced to just go on to the next area. Happens in the next area also, just keep moving forward until you get stuck. This is how SM was also, but in that game it was fun to do so. In this game, it just feels like such a drag to go back to an area with annoying enemies and such. The graphics of this game doesn't help which brings me to...  *The graphics. I think the animations of the main character and for the most part the guns are great. The bosses too, but man, the backgrounds and everything else is too drab. Too much gray and red, really bleak. It gets pretty boring to look at after a while.  *The boss battles. Like I said, the bosses look great but they're way too easy. Just feels uninspired. I never finished the battle feeling, wow that was some fight! Eh..

I've never played Metroidvanias before and this game has definitely made me want to look more into the genre. I just picked up Overwatch and I can't stop coming back to this game. Definitely worth the money.

Date 2016-05-22 Playtime 25h 47m Rec Positive Without getting into a ton of detail, here's what you should know about Axiom Verge.  - It's hard. You will die, and you will die a bunch, at least at first. - If you've been yearning to scratch that Super Metroid itch, this'll do the trick and nicely.  - Explore everything. Do it twice. Then go back for a third serving. You missed something. - Seriously, go back. You didn't get all the upgrades in that section. - Again. - Plays way better with a controller. Keyboard feels way too clunky, but that's more opinion than fact. - Those aren't glitches. Your game isn't messing up. - You sure you cleared that section?  10/10 would explore the map [i]seven[/i] times over again.
Date 2016-05-22 Playtime 39h 47m Rec Positive This game is excellent. People say that it has a Super Metroid feel, but it is much different. The cutscenes and dialogue take apart the Super Metroid-esque experience and rebuild it into something different. With Super Metroid, YOU were Samus. In Axiom Verge, Trace is himself, and you control him. This in no way devalues the game, which crafts sound effects, music, and visuals into a truly amazing experience... It merely sets itself apart from Super Metroid. The story is interesting, and was thought out... This game is just a masterpiece and is highly under-appreciated; It should recieve as much feedback as Super Metroid, at least.

Date 2016-05-18 Playtime 13h 34m Rec Negative This game is so close to being a recommend, but I sadly cannot.  While I like games that don't hold my hand, I felt lost an AWFUL lot.  Many times I'd just run around aimlessly until finally figuring out where to go.    I think the reason that it is so difficult in this game, versus others, is the maps are not one big map, but a bunch of mini maps.  On top of that, each map doesn't show you where you are going when you go just off to the right. In other words, if you keep going right you eventually leave the map you are on, but you have no indication of where you will end up until you finally get there.  This creates 5x more backtracking than most other metroidvanias.  I nearly gave up 4-5 hours in, then I played another 1-2 hours going step by step with a guide, but even that was too tedious.  This was SO close to amazing, it's sad that I couldn't justify the time to finish it.
Date 2016-05-17 Playtime 10h 16m Rec Positive É bem óbvio que o jogo é, no mínimo, uma homenagem à Metroid (NES), com uns toques de Super Metroid, como os mapas etc. A trilha sonora, também, segue na mesma linha, lembrando até um pouco a trilha de Metroid Prime, por ser obscura, mas moderna. Os gráficos são simplesmente sensacionais! Para os órfãos de Metroid, este jogo faz o papel que a Nintendo não nos oferece à muito tempo, infelizmente. Vale MUITO a pena comprar!
Date 2016-05-16 Playtime 26h 58m Rec Positive One of the best games I've played in a long time. Super Metroid is one of my all time fav's and Axiom Verge totally does it justice. I loved it!
Date 2016-05-16 Playtime 13h 10m Rec Positive One single game probably held closest to my heart which defined my childhood is Super Metroid, very few games came close to how much I ever played that title and for good reason. From its action oriented gameplay centered around an atmospheric planet no game could ever top it until Metroid Prime, another entry into the series. Sadly nintendo has lost touch with the series and what made it great, other M while it could have possibly been the perfect re-entry into the series took a few turns which didnt cope well with many gamers and instead of trying to rectify this they shelved the series entirely. Thankfully now we have Axiom Verge, a love letter to Metroid fans, an increadible game with so many nastolgic nods to Metroid this game absolutely hits the nail on the head with its creative design, atmosphere and intriging science fiction plot. I cannot recommend Axiom Verge enough to any gamer who has longed for a Metroid style title.

No, but with respect, this game is truly an evolution of "metroid" - I am SO sick of people and companies going "Not another Metrovania" the companies going "Yep, let's toss $ on another pointless FPS that could build a dozen Castlevania type games plenty of people want..."  But this game is amazing with the exploration and dark but very beautiful theme (R.I.P. H.R. Giger!) and the biomechanoid sirens that urge the "hero" on.
Date 2016-05-10 Playtime 28h 16m Rec Positive This game is the spiritual succesor of the original Metroid.Great 8 bit graphics and the sounds and music are incredible.If you like games like Metroid, Castlevania Symphony of the night, Cave Story or Shadow Complex you need to buy this game.Recommended to any metroidvania fan.
Date 2016-05-10 Playtime 31h 48m Rec Positive Для меня, наверное это первая игра которую захотелось познать полнотью, и найдя все предметы и облазав все доступные локации этого оказалось мало. Эта первая игра после прохождения которой я полез читать статьи в посвященной ей wiki. И то, насколько она хороша, несколько огорчает, поскольку все попытки найти нечто похожее обречены.
Date 2016-05-08 Playtime 17h 16m Rec Positive Excellently done metroid spinoff. Does an excellent job of recreating the cold spacey vibe that the first game had.  Lots of interesting power ups and game mechanics. Worth buying and worth playing if you like this genre of game!
Date 2016-05-08 Playtime 7h 39m Rec Positive Loved it!
Date 2016-05-07 Playtime 9h 10m Rec Positive AXIOM VERGE has been praised - and deservedly so. Everything the positive reviews tell you is true: The controls are tight, the game is expansive, it lets you explore at your own pace, the difficulty is perfect (tough yet fair). It is everything modern games are not: earnest in design, unpretentious, filled with mechanics waiting to be learned and applied. That's all you need to know - If I went into any more detail, I'd just be repeating what the other fellas told you. It's true. This game is terrific.  Let me point out something else instead: AXIOM VERGE is trippy. The right kind of trippy too. They totally chanelled Tsutomu Nihei's BLAME and BIOMEGA mangas in terms of story and aesthetics. (If you haven't read those: get 'em, they're fun!) You won't see ACTIVISION or BETHESDA doing that anytime soon.   To sum up: I totally dig this game. It's the best kind of pop-culture: playfully referential, tight, well-designed, flowy, psychedelic and, oh yeah, the soundtrack is super too.
Date 2016-05-07 Playtime 11h 30m Rec Positive When I stumbled over Axium Verge I had my doubts, but the Steam Rieviews were so good and almost everybody praised this as a true Metroidvania game that I bought it and never regrettet it.  The story is intruiging and the atmosphere gives you a Super Metroid vibe. This lonly, mysterius and at the same time wonderus feeling while you explore the world. The soundtrack is excellent, it is so damn good that I bought the soundtrack DLC.  The only problem I have with this game, is the controll over the grapling hook. It is not realy intuitive and I had problems hitting anything with it. But that is a minor problem. Just buy this game.
Date 2016-05-07 Playtime 22h 20m Rec Positive Axiom Verge captures the dream-like and alien motifs of games like Contra and Metroid, in addition to decent gameplay and excellent music.
Date 2016-05-06 Playtime 51h 17m Rec Positive [i]Я даже не знаю как описать эту игру... Она просто.. шикарна? Неет.. Великолепна?.. Что-то более, чем эти слова..[/i]  Итак, так как я не обладаю красноречивостью, приведу Плюсы и Минусы этой игры и обосную их.  [b]Плюсы:[/b]  [u]1. Графика[/u] Многие из вас когда-то играли на приставках 90-х годов, где были только 8-ми - 16-ти битные игры, которые всем нравились... для всех они были шедеврами, как и данная игра, поверьте. [i]Для этой игры не нужна никакая сверхграфика.. Достаточно всего пикселей.[/i]   [u]2. Саундрек[/u] Саундрек действительно отличный и атмосферный для разных частей карт. Согласитесь, ведь многим будет приятно играть в игры с отличной для ушей музыкой.  [u]3. Сюжет[/u] В такой игре есть запутанный сюжет  про [spoiler] ученого, который при неуспешном опыте попал в другое измерение, где его ждут приключения, враги, боссы и...Русалки, которые главные в этом измерении и их нужно будет спасти от  Атеттоса, захватившего этот мир. [/spoiler] Ну а подробности вас ждут при прихождении игры.  [u]4. Хардкорность[/u] Еще один повод поиграть в эту игру любителям хардкора и не только. При попытке пройти игру на 100%, вы столкнетесь с многими препядствиями, такие как: враги, боссы, запутанность карты, труднодоступность к предметам и т.д И ведь с каждой смертью от босса или от врагов тебе все чаще хочется  убить их, чтоб побыстрее открыть для себя новые части карт или оружия, чтобы дойти до финала игры. Однако игру можно пройти, не умерев не раз. Так же у игры присутствует Спидран.  [u]5. Геймплей[/u] Игра, как не удивительно, является платформером метроидванией с разными частями карты, где существует множество всяких секретов. Так же,в данной игре можно найти много пушек и прокачки для них, у которых есть свои преимущества.  [b]Минусы:[/b]  [u]1. Управление[/u] Для меня управление показалось не очень удобным на клавиатуре, но так как эту игру портировали с PS4, со временем пришлось привыкать к нему, хотя его можно будет поменять в настройках, чтоб было удобно.   [b]Вывод:[/b] В эту игру стоит поиграть любителям инди игр, метроидов, платформеров, киберпанка или научной фантастики..Ну или же настольгирующим игрокам :D  У меня все :)
Date 2016-05-06 Playtime 11h 58m Rec Positive People are calling this Metroidvania-style, but I don't think so. This feels way more like a pure Metroid game than anything. Gameplay wise, your character's strength is defined by the items they find; no amount of killing will make you healthier or faster. However, there's a massive amount of weapons that makes fights enjoyable, and exploration tools that open up the world around you, with pickups that increase your health, damage, weapon range and even projectile size, so exploration is well-rewarded. The main issue with this is that a good 20% of the items can only be found with one end-game item, and finding the right areas to plunder can become a massive hassle if you aim for 100%  The story was intriguing enough to keep me going to the credits. One scene near the midsection played out rather well, with the gameplay changing to match the character's state of mind... somewhat. I'd describe the ending, but I'd rather avoid spoilers so let's say that, on a personal note, I wasn't a fan. However, I liked the game's use of graphical glitches as a gameplay and story element, and was very pleased that the player-character, Trace, doesn't [i]once[/i] remark on how the glitches reminds him of things he saw in a video game he once played. It's all played straight, with mentions of "artifacts" and "The Breach" being things that affect the world in unnatural ways.  The game-map is pretty big, or at least it [i]feels[/i] big. There's lots of things to be found, as was mentioned in the first paragraph, and returning to old areas with new tools not only makes exploration fun, but makes killing once-annoying enemies with new weapons all the more fulfilling to one-shot. One of my main gripes with the game (along with what makes me not want to dub it "Metroidvania") is that you have no method of warping to places late in the game; your main method of fast travel is to make for the hub-corridor and catch a ride with a local monstrosity. Which is pretty neat in how streamlined it is, but with the way lore is presented, I'm surprised there wasn't a way to get taken to specific save-points around the world. There's also an annoying habit of having secret areas hidden behind blocks that are identical to other blocks, so you'll spend a lot of time hugging walls near the end.  Sound is good. Music loops similar to how old PS1 games used MP3 tracks in that they finished the song, then played it again after a moment's silence. I wouldn't call it stuck-in-my-head-for-days memorable, seeing as it's mainly ambience. But the final boss fight is easily the exception, and I'm sure it'll find its way onto playlists here and there. One track ended up grating thanks to either dying and returning to a save point over and over again, or just revisiting said area and slowly losing patience for what started out as a really cool track. As a plus, if you go into low HP values, the game will do the usual "bdeep-bdeep" thing, but it's in time with the music, and will slowly dip in volume so that you're not being assaulted by "[b][i]BDEEP-BDEEP-BDEEP-BDEEP[/i][/b]" like some annoying £5 alarm clock.  There's also an optional Speedrun mode that adds a timer and cuts out story and "randomised" elements so you can try to beat the game as quickly as possible. It's something I might use, and I'm sure others would be pleased to see it.  I'll add in as a disclaimer that I got the game as a birthday gift so the value of the game is a bit nebulous. But I would easily recommend the game to people with £15 knocking around, if they're a fan of older 2D Metroid games. For anyone else, I'd say check out gameplay videos first.
Date 2016-05-05 Playtime 12h 0m Rec Positive This game is basically a new version of Super Metroid. Now, being that alone isn't worth a purchase, but it is very creative in its own right, and it's just all-around an extremely awesome and smooth game. This game is for anyone who likes platformers that has extremely intelligent design or simply someone who has been looking for a fun game to learn how to speedrun. It's difficult, but not too difficult, and it operates on the classic balancing system of "well, if you don't want your ass handed to you, go and find some upgrades and come back, you coward." It's just a great game, and it's well worth the base price. If it goes on sale, you better grab this game asap, because it's absolutely marvelous.
Date 2016-05-04 Playtime 16h 46m Rec Positive Muito bom, impossivel não pensar no Metroid 3 do SNES, mas ao longo do jogo se ele se torna algo totalmente original. muito bom, a história realmente é boa.  Vale a pena!
Date 2016-05-03 Playtime 8h 59m Rec Positive 挺不错的
Date 2016-05-03 Playtime 17h 24m Rec Positive Genius.
Date 2016-05-02 Playtime 56h 50m Rec Positive Amazing.

Date 2016-04-30 Playtime 18h 4m Rec Positive If you enjoy metroidvania style games, definitely pick this up.  This game is amazing!  The soundtrack is phenomenal!
Date 2016-04-30 Playtime 14h 49m Rec Positive So much Metroid nostalgia...I loved every minute of it.
Date 2016-04-30 Playtime 74h 53m Rec Positive 游戏性高，剧情吸引，制作精美，值得推荐！
Date 2016-04-29 Playtime 43h 33m Rec Positive [h1] Best game ever! [/h1] I almost never feel compelled to use my energy to write about a game, but this one really deserves it! My best game experience since ... er... e-v-e-r! Best controller to play this game in my experience is: the Xbox One controller. Solid, snappy controls.  I played it with the Logitech F310 controller, the  Xbox 360 controller and keyboard (off course).  Also played the soundtracks loud on my headphones and pc speaker system. Awesome tracks!
Date 2016-04-29 Playtime 13h 2m Rec Positive This is a fantastic game. From the moment you hit the title screen you can tell this a labor of love.   The art is great. This is NOT "pixel graphics as an excuse for bad art". This is high quality artwork. Beautiful details, perfect animations, all within a minimalist pixel framework.   This music is perfect. Super cool; I love every track.  The story and dialouge is cool.   The gameplay is good. Ultimately, it's just fun to play, and that's what matters.  I have only two small gripes. First, it can be hard to know where to go next. By the end of the game I had to consult Google just so I didn't have to wander the entire game looking for which corner my latest upgrade will let me traverse. Second, I think combat is a tiny bit off. Maybe I just never got it, but I felt like some of the bosses had cheap loopholes while some seemed to have no discernable pattern at all - just shoot it and hope you kill it before it kills you. Personally, these issues (the second one really) keep me from playing the game over and over (hey, I got a lot of games to play). But, don't get me wrong. This game is worth every penny. It's just so unique these days, and a whole lotta fun.
Date 2016-04-29 Playtime 20h 44m Rec Positive Fun, different enough from Metroid to keep me entertained.  The upgrades and story were interesting enough to keep me playing.  Almost 20 hours and 92% map, 71% items.  I won't be playing it through again.  There was a point where I didn't know which way to go which probably took me an hour to determine.  The bosses weren't all that exciting skill-wise but fun to look at - mostly button mashing damage (why doesn't holding x keep firing my weapon?? - though my aged thumb didn't tire)  I enjoyed the game and would definitely recommend it.  The story was interesting enough to keep me playing and it never got difficult to make me quit (I no longer have the paitence of my youth!)  <b>MAYBE THERE IS SEQUEL?!</b>
Date 2016-04-29 Playtime 23h 1m Rec Positive Liked Super Metroid? Buy this one.
Date 2016-04-28 Playtime 13h 48m Rec Positive Je ne suis pas un spécialiste des metroid-vania. Je n'ai donc pas de point de comparaison par rapport à Axiom verge. Et je précise que j'ai fini le jeu. Néophyte dans ce genre, je suis clairement charmé par cette création, même si j'y repère de lourds défauts.  Une des caractéristiques qui est chère à mes yeux est l'ambiance, l'immersion. De ce côté là, AV est solide. La direction artistique si particulière sert efficacement un monde étrange et presque onirique, bercé par une bande son convaincante et agréable. Là où ca pêche un peu, c'est dans la personnalité du héros de l'aventure, qui passe juste pour le gros neuneu de service avec ses répliques en demi-teintes : une grosse tâche grise difforme en plein milieu d'un magnifique tableau coloré, mettant parfois trop brutalement en scène dans ce monde mystique et sinistre Bobby, 12 ans d'âge mental qui joue dans le bac à sable :/  Moi qui n'aime pas l'exploration, je me suis surpris à prendre du plaisir à reparcourir les coins déjà visités, à la recherche du petit item caché, ou plus simplement de la porte qui mène à la suite de l'aventure. Mais parfois, à quoi bon ? je ne me suis globalement servi que de 3 armes parmis la dizaine proposée, la faute à un level design à revoir !  Le jeu est globalement trop facile, jusqu'à la dernière partie où, si vous voulez mon avis, les niveaux sont bâclés, à base de "j'te mets plein de streums bien badass, pour que t'en chies comme un russe et que tu bourrines sans aucune finesse". J'aurai tellement aimé (et ça manque au jeu au final) qu'une partie du gameplay soit consacrée à une exploitation intelligente des niveaux ! Mais, ne crachons pas dans la soupe : les contrôles répondent très bien, et le tout reste très plaisant.  Axiom Verge : Envoûtant, bien réalisé, surprenant, possède indéniablement ce petit côté de monde mystérieux et énigmatique qui nous fait encore nous poser des questions après l'avoir terminé. Mais il mérite une correction de certains éléments narratifs et surtout, surtout, un travail supplémentaire sur le level design en dent de scie. Bref, un diamant brut fraîchement extrait de la roche qui ne demande qu'à être taillé.
Date 2016-04-28 Playtime 15h 15m Rec Positive It's not quite as good as Super Metroid; the world isn't quite as immersive; the bugs aren't quite as exploitable; the level design isn't quite as masterful.  But I stopped caring about a third of the way in, because it's still the best Metroidvania I've played in a decade.
Date 2016-04-27 Playtime 33h 58m Rec Positive Dann wiedermal was von mir. KAUFEN :) Metroidvabia lässt Grüßen, aber vom feinsten. Vor mir haben das schon viele geschrieben, muss ich ja nicht wieder alles wiederholen. Es ist für mich das Game 2015/2016. Ich bin eher so der Lustlose Gamer, dem fast jedes Game anödet. Aber Axiom Verge hat mich gepackt. So, das ich es durchgespielt habe. Bin eher der: ich fange ein spiel an und breche nach paar Stunden ab um mich dem nächsten Game zu zuwenden. So liegen haufen Games auf der Platte die ich nur angspielt habe. Warum erwähne ich das? Es gibt bestimmt genug solche Player wie ich. Und genau die möchte ich besonders ansprechen Axiom mal zu Testen. Das Spiel pack einen nicht von der erste Minute an, aber das dauert nicht lange. Was mich reizte ist der Level Aufbau, die Menga an Items und der Style. I LOVE ELSNOVA ;)  Das Retro Gefühl ist bei diesem Game einfach am besten ausgeprägt. Aber nicht so schrecklich Bunt.   Die Musik wurde besonders angepriesen, die hat mich nicht so geflasht, aber passt Perfekt ins geschehen.  Wann kommt denn ein zweiter Teil? Ich brauch mehr davon :)  Ahh eins noch. In normal ist das Game recht einfach. Besonders die Bossfight sind nicht so anspruchsvoll. Würde es gleich auf schwer probieren. Habs selber noch net getestet. Die Mobs gehen, aber wie gesagt, die Bossfights sind keine große Herrausforderung. Aber egal...dennoch Nice :)  cu´s
Date 2016-04-26 Playtime 13h 17m Rec Positive (tl;dr at bottom) Very enjoyable game in the Metroidvania genre. Story was okay, but the exploration was what drove my interest.  The game was very good at showing you when you could not enter an area, and could clearly tell another item was needed.  Unlike Metroid (in my experience) the game did not require specific weapons to get to different areas, but instead relied on the secondary equipment that had a focus on mobility.  The second-last boss was surprisingly difficult (and was practically a bullet-hell game compared to the rest). However, some areas that were difficult to get to were quite important. If one was to get stuck I would recommend  looking up a map or guide to find where areas connect.  Played on Windows with the Steam Controller (final two bosses completed with Xbox 360 controller).  NOTE: Some difficulty occurred when configuring the Steam controller (playing via Steam Link). It would always recognize the trigger as the trigger even when the config set it to map to a different button. I assume Axiom Verge hooks in at a lower/earlier level than usual. Luckily the game allows for customising controls in-game.  The Crunch ======== Playtime: 12h22m OS: Windows/Steam Link Input: Steam Controller, Xbox 360 Controller  Pros: - lots of weapons (not tied to enemy/damage types, pick what you like) - broke the rules with its movement equipment - fitting soundtrack - lots to do for completionists (I am not though so this is biased)  Cons: - Surprisingly difficult/different penultimate fight - Didn't show how to get to/where the last few areas were very well.
Date 2016-04-25 Playtime 19h 31m Rec Positive I really enjoyed playing this game, it brought back fond memories from when I was younger.  The only negative I could find was that most of the weapons, while creative, were not necessary.  If you like metroidvania style games you'll have fun this one.
Date 2016-04-25 Playtime 17h 43m Rec Positive This metroidvania game is an amazing tribute to the likes of classic Metroid titles, yet at the same time it offers some very interesting and innovative mechanics. To often we now see "retro style pixel art nostalgic" indie games that almost always fall short of the classics they immitate. I have been somewhat disillusioned with indie games in recent years because of this, but axiom verge is different - it doesn't try too hard to strive to compete with the games it takes inspiration from, but humbly suceeds at doing so regardless. The game is very hard to flaw in any way; the artwork, gameplay, sound design, music... the whole game is of exceptionally high quality. I noticd a few very minor bugs, but nothing gamebreaking - but taking into consideration that the game was developed by JUST ONE PERSON, I am astounded at the superb quality of the whole game. I take my hat of to Thomas Happ, he has done an absolutely  fantastic job. As someone who has dabbled in game dvelopment, I find this game and its developer very inspiring. BUY THE GAME!
Date 2016-04-24 Playtime 19h 16m Rec Positive This is a heck-of-a-game. Best Metriodvania I've played that isn't Castlevania or Metroid! It's tons of fun with cool weapons and unique gameplay mechanics. The game is gorgeous and the soundtrack is equally as good. I'd definitely buy this game if you're looking for a good Metroid-esque experience. It isn't perfect as there's a few issues I had.  Pros -Fun -Gorgeous -Good Soundtrack -Good Mechanics -Difficult -Lots of weapons  Cons -Crashes occassionally -Repetetive bosses -Anticlimactic last boss -One point in the game where it's really difficult to figure out where to go, I spent hours on just one area trying to figure out what to do. 
Date 2016-04-24 Playtime 37h 42m Rec Positive Très bon jeux indé !!!!
Date 2016-04-23 Playtime 17h 38m Rec Positive Absolutely brilliant game. Feels like it akes a lot of influence from Super Metroid, and the storyline is amazing.
Date 2016-04-22 Playtime 14h 46m Rec Positive The best Metroidvania to come out since 1994. Although it's complete heresy to say it, I enjoyed this game a bit more than I did Super Metroid, partly because Axiom Verge has so much variety in how you can play it. If you like solid Metroidvanias, you'll like Axiom Verge. Solid mechanics and level design, cohesive sound design, and consistant visual direction make it all worth it.
Date 2016-04-22 Playtime 0h 26m Rec Negative This game is PROBABLY good. I won't play this game off like it was rubbish, it wasn't rubbish. It was god awful slow.  I only played 25 minutes but it was a long 25 minutes where nothing really happened, so maybe it IS rubbish.  There was nothing about this game that inspired me to keep playing. I feel like I am the target audience for such a game, and for me it just fell flat. Maybe if I had pushed through and invested a bunch of time into it then I might end up liking it... But I feel like I would waste the opportunity to get a refund which I am certainly going to want.  I really wanted to like it, it just didn't seem interesting enough for me to get very far.
Date 2016-04-20 Playtime 8h 42m Rec Positive The game essentially is Super Metroid, but it doesn't scale those lofty heights of genius. It is brilliant all the same and a highly enjoyable experience. If you missed the SNES era then this is a fantastic indie game you'll love playing, and you'll appreciate the Metroidvania elements a great deal. Considering this was made by one man, it's highly impressive!

Date 2016-04-19 Playtime 17h 9m Rec Positive This one-man labour of love is an almost perfect Super Metroid clone. The art is beautiful, the music oozes atmosphere and the gameplay is fast and fluid throughout. Highly recommended.
Date 2016-04-19 Playtime 10h 11m Rec Positive I love this it perfectly captures the feel from the metroid games. A very fun run through the past.
Date 2016-04-18 Playtime 16h 57m Rec Positive One of the best metrovanias I have played in recent memory.
Date 2016-04-18 Playtime 10h 42m Rec Positive Great game, very interesting setting and presentation.
Date 2016-04-17 Playtime 33h 47m Rec Positive Superb entry in the field of metroid inspired games, absolutely get this if you like 2D exploration platformers heavy on atmosphere.  I like the way it mixes up how the various powerups work from what you would expect while still keeping them fun and useful.  My only gripe is the double tap input to use an ability later in the game should have its own button.
Date 2016-04-17 Playtime 14h 23m Rec Positive Perfect Super Metroid throwback with a lot of nice twists. Tons of weapon variety and secrets to find. Good game for the completionist plus lots of replay value.  Now I have only played on Normal difficulty so far but, to me, it felt like the boss fights fell a bit short of epic. The bosses were very limited in abilities/movement and very quickly became predictable and exploited. The bosses LOOKED outstanding but the battles themselves felt short. Just not quite up to the example that a game like Super Metroid set.  Still an amazing game that I would recommend to anyone, not just the old school Metroid/Castlevania fans.
Date 2016-04-17 Playtime 12h 37m Rec Positive Отличная игра. Хорошее музыкальное сопровождение. Интересный сюжет. Разнообразные боссы, куча вооружения, секреты. В общем, самое то! :)
Date 2016-04-17 Playtime 20h 27m Rec Positive This is a great game with an Amazing art style and an even better soundtrack.
Date 2016-04-17 Playtime 10h 3m Rec Positive I would recommend this game, with caveats...it's well done and definitely scratches that Metroidvania itch, but there are some things that would make me want to give this a neutral review if possible.  Pros - Great pixel graphics, good sprite animations - Some very detailed backgrounds and areas. - Interesting characters in the story. - A nice variety of weapons to use.  Cons - The music is grating after multiple repeats. - The boss battles were uninteresting for the most part. - I didn't get the same sense of exploration I would have liked as from other Metroidvanias. There was too much of a requirement to use items against walls with no indication that anything was hiding behind them, so I simply didn't do it. - Controls were decent, but some of the advanced mechanics were clunky and I didn't enjoy navigating the game with them. - Too many weapons also means too few uses for many of them too.
Date 2016-04-16 Playtime 1h 38m Rec Negative This game is to buggy.  With keyboard there are key conflicts an sometimes "f" the fire key will just do nothing.  With steam controler it constally fires a short drill and does not let you switch weapon, untill some unknowable event it will just start working right randomly.
Date 2016-04-16 Playtime 21h 53m Rec Positive Incredibly fun metroid-esque game. You play as a physicist who, after dying in a laboratory accident, wakes up inside a strange, egg-like machine. Run around and murder giant crabs by cartridge-tilting you're way to victory. Also, it has linux support.  10/10, definetley going to play it a second time.
Date 2016-04-15 Playtime 15h 36m Rec Positive I really enjoyed this game. It's quite refreshing to play a no-BS 2D platformer once in a while. The first thing you'll notice is how quickly the game boots up or exits! The gameplay is great: fine controls, intriguing story, a lot of exploration and secrets, and an abundant variety in enemies and weapons/abilities. And the music and graphics are simply delightful.   Minor critiques: some of the bosses are a bit of a button mashing fest., the password mechanic isn't exactly transparent, and the save system is a bit lenient.
Date 2016-04-15 Playtime 16h 47m Rec Positive The last Metroid game that came out was years ago -- you all know the one -- and the only Metroid game lined up is on the 3DS and... well, you can go check that out for yourselves if you haven't seen what it's all about yet. Suffice it to say, we haven't seen, and won't be seeing, a Metroid game for quite some time, and that's a real shame because there's something about that mix of being stuck on an alien world alone with hundreds of aliens that want to eat you, and collecting upgrades to explore a labarynthian planet while blowing up your enemies that just so intoxicating. I'm not ashamed to say that I don't completely understand why Metroid is such a captivating game, but the whole point of this paragraph is to tell you that if something captures it, it's this game.  Axiom Verge scratches the itch I have for a new Metroid game so very well, and tows you along with an intriguing story that you'll piece together as you explore the mystery of Axiom Verge's world. In some respects, it outperforms the original model with new ideas and a huge array of weapons to pick from, provided you take the time to find them, and provides you with plenty of challenge with tough enemies and frantic boss battles, while rewarding you for poking your head into the nooks and crannies of the pulsing, decrepid terrain you walk upon. This game understands what makes the Metroid genre good and you'll know within an hour of playing that it's no mere copycat.  If you like Metroid and are itching for something that captures the essence of it, this is the perfect game. If you've never played a game of the Metroid style before, then this is a great place to start.
Date 2016-04-14 Playtime 20h 31m Rec Positive I've only played a few hours of this game so far, mostly exploring and messing around. The gameplay is solid enough that I can easily recommend it for anyone that is a fan of metroidvania style games. I'll likely come back and give some final impressions once I finish the game but I highly doubt anything would take away my recommendation of the game.  What really pulls this game together, however, is the amazing soundtrack and delightfully surreal landscapes. There's a lot of variety to be found in the visuals and each new area was a marvelous experience taking in the environment and new enemies. Exploration is definitely the highest mark of Axiom Verge.  While the gameplay is solid and holds up, a lot of the unique features (Such as the address disrupter/glitch gun, glitching through walls, etc.) are little more than a novel way to substitute locked doors. I've been told that they're more prominant when searching for some of the more obscure secrets, but as far as shuffling through the story they haven't been more than ways around simplistic roadblocks.  Difficulty feels okay for the most part. Environmental difficulty actually feels perfect, but bosses thus far have felt a bit on the easy side. A little more difficulty or ingenuity with the boss attacks would have been welcome, but they aren't an unsatisfying experience - just a fairly generic one.
Date 2016-04-14 Playtime 21h 33m Rec Positive [h1] Том Хапп он же программист, дизайнер, композитор и художник в студии имени себя - Thomas Happ Games сотворил Axiom Verge - научно-фантастический платформер прошлого года с насыщенным запахом третьего поколения игровых систем.[/h1]   Несколько причин для прохождения: 1) Идейный наследник классических Metroid активно цитирующий своих вдохновителей. 2) Гигер стайл. 3) Аудиовизуальная стилизация под SNES (тема с "glitch" вообще доставляет) 4) Дает небольшой спэйс для творчества, а-ля некий генератор идей (творческим людям заедет для вдохновения). Вывод: Десять часов в катакомбах (есть и пейзажики) и еще пара часов на исследование некоторых локаций согреют игрока ностальгией (без спидранов изучая самому, не скипая диалоги). А вот юнцам не угодишь ныне. Нельзя такое им.

Герой нехотя соглашается помочь и при этом бросает фразу, емко характеризующую весь сюжет Axiom Verge: «Что-то мне эта история про Избранного кажется не слишком правдоподобной».
Date 2016-04-12 Playtime 8h 34m Rec Positive Super Metroid is one of my all time favorite games. Axiom Verge doesn't hide the fact that it is a love letter, heavily influenced by the classic masterpiece. The game succeeds in many ways. The areas you will traverse are ranged and all have a beautiful, 16 bit scifi theme. The music melts nicely into those environments. There are a range of weapons and upgraded abilities to acquire. Boss fights are challenging without being too challenging and catering only to the obcessive gamer population.    Where the game falls a little short is in the late game pacing and the story in general. I never really cared for the Keanu Reeves super scientist bro story line. Samus was the strong silent type. I felt this game could have benefited from that model. Late game pacing with no fast travel eventually ended my trip a little prematurely. After hour 8 I ended up just traveling back and forth between distant locals hoping to explore a new piece of the map with a newly found ability. I found myself not enjoying that process or caring much about the story I was involved in so I stopped playing. Too many great games out there with not enough time to play them all to continue on when I'm not in it, just for the sake of beating it.  However, if you are in the market for a retro Metroid game for PC, look no further. This is still worth snatching up during a Steam sale.
Date 2016-04-12 Playtime 2h 44m Rec Positive Esto no es análisis sino una primera toma de contacto,que ha sido bastante positíva,este título esta inspirado en Super Metroid lanzado para la SNES,se enmarca dentro del genero metroidvania,es un juego en mundo "abierto",con esto quiere decir que podremos explorar desde el principio muchas zonas,algunas accesibles por no necesitar cierto objeto clave,pero los enemigos de esa zona seran distintos,con mas fortaleza y seguramente muramos por el hecho de necesitar cierta arma para combatirlos,es recomendable si juegas por primera vez jugar en modo "normal",con esto me refiero que el juego tiene una dificultad base a mi juicio suficiente y que no vayas explorando las zonas ocultas sino que juegues de manera lineal y vayas a por las armas y las mejoras.  En cuanto a los jefes los dos primeros son muy sencillos,no tienen mucha vida,de hecho ni siquiera tienen barra de vida asi que vas a a tener que imaginartela,esquivando proyectiles y demas,hasta vencerlo....  Si te gusta Metroid cosa que a mi no demasiado vas a encontrarlo muy divertido,lo recomiendo  Los efectos de las armas sobre los enemigos me flipa...no me lo esperaba en absoluto.Asi que ya sabeís dadle una oportunidad ya sea en oferta o no merece la pena totalmente.Yeah!
Date 2016-04-11 Playtime 8h 20m Rec Positive Excellent in every way. I grew up on Metroid and Super Metroid, and this scratches that itch quite well. The music is wonderful and creates atmosphere for every section of the game. The weapons are varied and interesting, even if a couple are almost useless aside from puzzle-solving. Controls are tight. 8-bit-esque retro styling fits instead of feeling tacked on.  Con: Short-ish in playtime; but that seems to almost be the status-quo with these types of games.
Date 2016-04-11 Playtime 10h 19m Rec Positive O jogo é simplesmente incrível. Especialmente pra um jogo indie com tão pouca mão-de-obra. Recomendo muito e, inclusive, comprei (Apesar de tê-lo zerado pirata... por isso poucas horas de jogo -ainda-) porquê acho muito justo para com o desenvolvedor. RECOMENDADÍSSIMO.
Date 2016-04-11 Playtime 15h 41m Rec Positive So to state the obvious that this is a Metroid clone (and a really good one). This game plays out in such a way that you never really know or predict HOW the exploration will change or pan out. Which makes the first playthrough of Axiom Verge an absolutely delightful experience. You will get lost. You will git smert. Then you will progress.  It's all tied together with an interesting story, satisfying exploration, cool weapons and a unique and alien world.  The first playthrough of this game is pure Gold. Go into it blind and unspoiled.
Date 2016-04-11 Playtime 1h 33m Rec Positive 这真的不是银河战士吗？我去买手柄了....这游戏键盘玩着好难
Date 2016-04-11 Playtime 7h 20m Rec Positive Gameplaywise it feels very much like a reskinned Super Metroid with some added cream, and that is a good thing.  The story is really engaging though confusing at times but still interesting.  If you enjoy games like Metroid, Castlevania and Ori and the Blind Forest then you would definitely like this one.
Date 2016-04-11 Playtime 2h 21m Rec Positive Everything I have wanted from a metroid-style game, and everything I didn't know I wanted. This captures the feel of Metroid, and expounds upon it relentlessly. To the game developer - Thank you so very much!
Date 2016-04-10 Playtime 12h 29m Rec Positive 游戏从刚开始就表现出鲜明与自成一派的神秘风格，怎么说呢感觉就是那种浓厚诡异的感觉。 尤其是第一区的BGM迷之怪异，给我很强的冲击【一度要放弃的那种冲击，当然听多习惯了就觉得很带感了。  在这之下的就是超丰富的解谜、探索要素了。其丰富度个人感觉甚至超过了银河战士。 给新人的一个建议：一定要多看地图，耐下心来多赶路[spoiler] 毕竟找路是银河战士类游戏的一部分不爽不要玩【手动滑稽 [/spoiler]  这份耐心下的收获还是十分值得的。  动作部分，游戏的手感十分扎实，与银河战士不相伯仲。难度比较硬派，但是配合丰富的武器系统，攻略起来并不会觉得乏味。checkpoint设置还算合理，死死死以后不至于太难受。 唯一比较诟病的就是最终boss战，至于有多蛋疼就请各位自行体验吧233
Date 2016-04-10 Playtime 1h 48m Rec Negative there are worse things to spend money on. probably
Date 2016-04-09 Playtime 9h 41m Rec Positive I only have to say this:  You can play this, one of the original Metroid games, or Environmental Station Alpha, all awesome , true to the classic games!
Date 2016-04-09 Playtime 19h 55m Rec Positive Well, someone has finally done it. The developer of Axiom Verge managed to create a Metroid style game that captures the essense of the Nintendo masterpiece better than anything I've played since the actual Metroid itself. Forget the other "Metroidvania" games you find on Steam, this bar none the best of the bunch.  Everything from Maps, Weaponry, Items, Music and level design is a wonderful homage to Metroid, and yet the developer managed to turn this into his own unique game. I couldn't put the controller down, and I was hooked from the first night. My first run took somewhere close to 16 hours becuase I did get stuck quite often, so this game does not hold your hand in the slightest. There are plenty of secrets and some obscure locations and items to find, I suggest a walk-through if you're desperate, but there are some things I was positive I would have never found on my own because of cryptic puzzles and hiding places.   My only complaint is that some items and areas were hidden pretty well and a little too obscure, and honeslty there were too many weapons and most of them were not worth using. I like the fact that there is variety and people could potentially use a certain weapon the entire game if they wanted to, but there are just so many, and so many of them are junk or far too situational. I mean, there is one weaopn in the game that I literally used once for a certain boss and never touched it again because it had no other practical application beyond that. Kind of a waste.  I also felt that the last section of the game, namely the final two maps you visit, were a little rushed. The final boss is also kind of a let down and I was hoping for much more.  I can't fault the game entirely for the ending and the abundance of (bad, junky, worthless) weapons, because overall this game really does belong in your library if you're a fan of these types of games. I will be playing this again, maybe trying for that speedrun or low item % run, you never know.  I hope the guy that made this game releases a sequel, I really do.
Date 2016-04-09 Playtime 8h 19m Rec Positive Axiom Verge finishes pretty weakly but it's style and surprising twists on nostalgia make it worth the price of admission.
Date 2016-04-08 Playtime 15h 14m Rec Positive A great Metroidvania style game, with some unique twists.  Remember all those glitches you'd run into with NES games (graphical distortions, weird colors, enemies not behaving right)?  This game actually applies some of that into the gameplay in a fairly neat manner.  The story isn't revolutionary, but it's decent.  Definitely worth playing.
Date 2016-04-07 Playtime 1h 8m Rec Negative For the record I've played about 2.5 hours of this game. Most of that time was spent thinking about how much fun I wasn't having. Don't get me wrong I wouldn't say I hated the game, its just that there wasn't anything to keep my interest. I just kept thinking "The original Metroid did this already".  The visuals of this game are quite unattractive and lead me to believe that the developer doesn't really understand pixel art and what makes it appealing. Most of the levels are built from a terrible disjoint mismash of ugly blocks and enemies are equally uninspired. The sound effects are   The few weapons that I did encounter in my time seemed underpowered and unuseful. Power ups to the weapons didn't seem to make any noticeable difference.   Tools that you find to progress seemed to be used for one specific instance and then forgotten. There game makes no effort to introduce the tools by giving you various fun things to do. No, they feel like elaborate one off keys.  The games exploration amounts to spraying every block in the game with each tool you have to see if it opens a secret area. Its time consuming and not particularly fun. It just doesn't seem very clever. Just random.  Audio didn't blow my hair back either and some of the sound effects are just plain bad.  In closing, If you're like me and don't have much time for gaming, this game doesn't offer much in the way of new or interesting game play. I'd pass on this one in hopes of finding something that's more orignal. If you want nastalgia just play the original Metroid games again.  If you have all the time in the world to play games I still recommend you pass. If you want to play a good Metroid game I highly recommend just playing through the  actual Metroid series all of which outshine this pale immitation. Again.
Date 2016-04-05 Playtime 21h 24m Rec Positive The best Metroidvania game I've played since La Mulana. Thomas Happ has crafted the closest thing to Super Metroid we're likely to get; and that's a good thing.
Date 2016-04-05 Playtime 40h 43m Rec Positive The most accurate, and best compliment I can possibly offer is that this game is better than Super Metroid / Metroid. And the music is god damn incredible. Please make a sequel :)
Date 2016-04-05 Playtime 13h 38m Rec Positive An excellent Metroid clone, this one gets almost everything right.  I think the general creepiness of the world feels like the original Metroid, but the controls are more precise like the SNES iteration.  I love that the game never tells you exactly where to go next, this is what's missing in today's action/adventure games (with the notable exception of the Dark Souls series).  The upgrades that allow you to progress from one area to the next constantly surprised me - I was almost always wrong about what was needed to access a new location.  A few examples: you don't need missiles to open doors, you don't use bombs to blow up weak blocks, you don't roll up into a ball to get through tight spaces, and you don't get a freeze gun to turn enemies into stepping stones.  There were a couple exceptions, but for the most part the developer did an excellent job coming up with new ways to solve these old puzzles.  The music is some of the best I've heard in gaming, from any time period - dark synths with the occasional bit of creepy chanting.  And the graphics, while a little bland in some of the wall/floor textures and enemy sprite designs, more than make up for any shortcomings with several rooms that are absolutely jaw-dropping.  Many of the weapons also put on a nice light show, and are worth tracking down for this alone.  Speaking of weapons, most of them are completely optional, and unless you go back and thoroughly explore you won't find half of them.  You probably also won't find many of the other secrets the game has to offer - I already know I didn't get the best ending, but I'm looking forward to going back in the near future.  If I had to come up with a complaint, I would say the bosses, while looking very impressive, all had fairly easy patterns that did not really change during the battles (most simply got faster as you damaged them).  This is a minor issue though, and did not affect my enjoyment of the game much.  If you enjoy Metroidvanias, this one has my highest recommendation.
Date 2016-04-03 Playtime 7h 2m Rec Positive If you love Metroid and classic NES/SNES games with that old-school sense of exploration, then you'll likely want to get your anus probed by the H.R. Giger aliens in this game. Um... I mean, you'll love Axion Verge.
Date 2016-04-03 Playtime 38h 32m Rec Positive 这是我玩过的，最好玩的第三方银河战士类型游戏……  地图很庞大（其实我觉得还可以再大一点），也没有方向性提示，只能根据现有能力到处挖坑，找到新道具后需要仔细回顾一下可以新开哪一块地图。这样一点点的探索感，非常让人着迷。  武器方面，其实我感觉很多武器都不实用，日常用的武器就两三把。各种能力上限道具和笔记的收集倒是要花不少心思，但是大部分难度适中，既让人有挑战感，又不会太难让人无语。  不过，说实话，有几个物品的拿取方法实在是恶心人，尤其是对我这样的手残党来说，比如EDIN这个地图里，那个悬在屋顶上的注射器，我死活都拿不到。  100%地图和物品基本上放弃……  9.5/10
Date 2016-04-02 Playtime 11h 50m Rec Positive Come and get the Metroid fix that Nintendo refuses to give you!  It's got exploration, creepiness, isolation, and thrills for all.
Date 2016-04-02 Playtime 25h 36m Rec Positive I love, love, LOVE this game.If you ever enjoyed the original gameboy metroids you will love this game. It has a good story, depth, and really cool concepts being tossed around. Upgrading on here is very vast and enjoyable. The bosses are so much fun to fight because how much focus they require to figure them out and get the advantage. The soundtrack is so so good and every song resembles each boss and area. Lastly the pixel art is so solid. The detailed art reminds me of how beautiful metroid fusion looks. Highly recommended.
Date 2016-03-31 Playtime 32h 59m Rec Positive Wow.  Since playing Super Metroid a few years ago, nothing has come close to satisfying my urge to play a good metroidvania title, until now. Controls are tight, motion is fluid, art style is fantastic, soundtrack is great, and gameplay is amazing. While it's not without flaws (mediocre rewards and some bad design issues), Axiom verge is a labor of love, and one that Tom Happ gave us to enjoy.  Hope you all enter the breach :)
Date 2016-03-30 Playtime 28h 2m Rec Positive I was very impressed with this game. It is longer than anticipated, but in a good way and very challenging. I hope they release a sequel or a similar game in the future.
Date 2016-03-30 Playtime 15h 38m Rec Positive Great metroid like game with it's own interesting story. Fun abilities and challenging secrets.
Date 2016-03-29 Playtime 42h 23m Rec Positive Hands down the single best Metroid style game I’ve played since Super Metroid itself.  If you’re a fan of the genre I can’t recommend this enough. Great Run ‘n’ Gun platforming, exploration, item finding, secret hunting, an outstanding soundtrack and the story, while very short, I found to be original and interesting (which is saying a lot).  -Playtime- Expect about 6-10 hours on your first play through, depending on how badly you get lost. Subsequent play throughs can be done in less than 3 hours once you know where you’re going.  -Achievements- Most of the harder achievements are for completing the game in a different way such as hard mode, speed run, or zero deaths. I found these achievements to be appropriately challenging without being frustrating. The total playtime to get 100% for this game felt just right, it was all enjoyable without ever feeling like a grind.  Recommended at full price.
Date 2016-03-28 Playtime 23h 20m Rec Positive 我觉得这是最metroidlike的非同人作品了（虽然作者自称IGA粉丝，然而本作无论是画面、音乐还是游戏系统都活脱脱密特罗德啊！）……而且个人认为制作十分优良 可惜的是，也许是游戏本身比较cult向，似乎知道的人并不多啊～
Date 2016-03-28 Playtime 29h 55m Rec Positive Metroid clone doesn't do it justice.  This was a love poem and reply to the original Metroid.   10/10.
Date 2016-03-27 Playtime 11h 25m Rec Positive The best love letter to Metroid I have ever played. 10/10 would backtrack again.
Date 2016-03-26 Playtime 26h 50m Rec Positive <3 The best Metroid style game since Super Metroid!
Date 2016-03-26 Playtime 33h 44m Rec Positive After playing for a 30 plus hours, beating it multiple times and getting all the achievements available i have to say axiom verge is probably one of my favorite indie games ever. I'm a huge metroid fan and this game has that amazing super metroid like 2d feeling that we haven't felt in years. This just proves that if nintendo doesn't do it the fans will. Amazing work tom happ serious props for making such an amazing game all by yourself.  Pros: Amazing exploration Great gameplay Sick as hell sound track A million guns and great upgrades highly replayable Awesome boss fights  Cons: Honestly I can't think of one that would be extremely nit picky many other reviewers have expresed that you get lost alot in the game and you can get stuck easily and i can see why they say that buy is that really a con? I mean I got lost a million times in super metroid before finding out where i had to go and no one complained about it it's part of any good exploration game.  In the end this game is awesome and if your a metroidvania fan like me you owe it to yourself to play this game 
Date 2016-03-26 Playtime 41h 56m Rec Positive 终于通了
Date 2016-03-25 Playtime 19h 48m Rec Positive Ein absolutes must have für jeden Metroidvania Fan. 10/10. In diesem Sinne GG!
Date 2016-03-25 Playtime 28h 54m Rec Positive Great game! Old school and very fun.
Date 2016-03-25 Playtime 11h 6m Rec Positive Innovative yet oldschool, unique yet familiar, evocative, mysterious, beautiful. If you like Metroid, you will love Axiom Verge. I must say however that the bar of entry for the game is somewhat high, since you have to do a lot of backtracking and exploration, but that's just a part of what makes the game great.
Date 2016-03-24 Playtime 31h 48m Rec Positive Axiom Verge, ist ein Spiel das sehr nah, an die sehr beliebten Metroid Spiele heran kommt.  Das Spiel läuft unter Windows sowie unter Linux Mint Mate einwandfrei.  Auch werden, unter Linux Amd Radeon Grafikkarten unterstürtzt.  Da mir jetzt nicht bekannt ist, ob das Spiel nachträglich zu Linux portiert worden ist.  Man sollte dementsprechend, den Programmierern gratulieren, zu der sehr guten Portierung.  MfG Tatzu
Date 2016-03-24 Playtime 16h 51m Rec Positive The best PC metroidvania game I've played.
Date 2016-03-23 Playtime 4h 24m Rec Positive If you like games like Metroid and Castlevania you will definitely find yourself enjoying this game The only downside of this game is that you get lost a lot like the classic Metroid games.
Date 2016-03-22 Playtime 11h 32m Rec Positive A beautiful pixel-art metroid-like. It's not a metroid-ripoff, though, as it has many unique weapons and mechanics that set it apart. I personally found the game very difficult toward the end. But after beating it the game told me I only found 53% of the items, so maybe that had something to do with it.  Also this game was made by one person which is pretty amazing.
Date 2016-03-21 Playtime 24h 45m Rec Positive Everyone's been waiting for Nintendo to get around to making a new Metroid game since Metroid: Other M came out nearly 6 years ago. Unfortunately, it seems that the amazing series isn't worth reviving, which is a sad disappointment to fans of the series, myself included. Even if NIntendo did decide to revive the series, it would most likely be revamped into something that is unlike what we all know and love. So, you ask, how can I relive my childhood memories of searching for hidden items, exploring exotic worlds, fighting bizarre bosses unlike any I've ever seen. Well, look no further. Ladies and Gentlegamers, Axiom Verge is what you've been looking for.  The series starts you off with an elusive plot that introduces you to your main character, but is vague enough that it keeps you searching for answers for the next several hours of the game. You wake up in a strange egg-like structure, forced to begin making your way around. Despite the fact that it doesn't contian a near-silent protagonist like the classic Metroid games, Axiom Verge still manages to keep you in the dark with it's plot, slowly revealing pieces to you for a mind-blowing finale. The game is chock-full of interesting environments, creatures, and boss-fights that will give you a rush of adrenaline and nostalgia that you haven't probably felt since you beat Metroid Zero Mission a decade ago.   The best part of all is the replay value. Heck, you'll find yourself searching for all the hidden items and secrets scattered all over the map long after you've beaten the game's final boss. The game has a similar end-game bonus if you manage to get nearly all the items in the game, giving you a secret ending. The world also has several pieces of paper and tablets that reveal parts of the plot that aren't normally obtained during the main gameplay.   My only major gripe about the game is the keyboard layout. It's unlike any I've ever seen in a game, especially a platformer, and won't have you holding your mouse and your fingers on the WASD keys. For this reason, I highly recommend grabbing a controller if you've got one handy, if not, it takes a little while getting used to the layout, but it's by no means a deal-breaker.  So, I'm sure you're asking yourself, is this game merely a copy of Metroid? Will I just feel like I'm replaying Super Metroid, except now I'm out twenty bucks? Absolutely not. While Axiom Verge will tingle your nostalgia senses, but it's got it's own wonderfully crafted story and world that stands all on it's own.   Is it worth it? Heck freaking yes. I'm gonna stop writing so you can do yourself a favor and buy it.
Date 2016-03-21 Playtime 33h 49m Rec Positive A lot of people will classify this game as Metroidvania but it is a pure Metroid homage, but with a life and style and mythos all its own.  Anyone who loves this style of game or that kind of esthetic really should give this game a shot.  It's fun to play just for the hell of it, long enough to satisfy the explorer's itch but short enough to not overstay its welcome - this combines to give a fair bit of replay value.  Definitely worth playing multiple times for all the achievements, definitely worth trying challenges like low% or speedruns - definitely worth playing, period.
Date 2016-03-20 Playtime 16h 13m Rec Positive Here's one retro game that has no need to hide behind the genre's classics. It probably has much to do with its hypnotic soundtrack and even greater pacing, leading to some very fluid gameplay. Also I really grok the worldbuilding and flavourful if somewhat sparse backstory.  On the technical side it's pretty solid for what it wants to achive. There's always some upgrade, new weapon or ability patiently waiting for you to buzz by and grab. It's making the map ever bigger/smaller and constantly tuning up exploration and shooting things.   All in all this has been a refreshing trip down memory lane, with even some elements lingering on in my mind.  +Flair: Like a well lubricated biomechanical engine.  +Music: Maybe buy it! -Enemies: Too many coloured blobs and geometric objects
Date 2016-03-20 Playtime 11h 31m Rec Positive I was honestly enjoying this game so much; it has excellent aesthetics, gameplay is slick and smooth (especially with a controller) and the story is engaging. However I have to say the final section of this game is just simply awful. The 'skill' curve goes from "enemies doing a fair whack of damage" to "enemies are impossible to dodge, have enormous amounts of health and kill you in two shots". The game is really excellent right up until the end, where the final area just simply fucking sucks.  Everything else was so on point, it's really sad that the last section is so bad.
Date 2016-03-19 Playtime 13h 56m Rec Positive Clever power ups and gating.  Retro but Interesting art style.  Good difficulty but mostly easy bosses.  One of the better Metro-vania games I've ever played - highly recommended for fans of the genre.
Date 2016-03-18 Playtime 21h 14m Rec Positive Es ist wirklich wie Metroid und auch wieder nicht. Es hat einen wunderbaren Soundttrack und wirklich ein sehr inventsiven Story abschnitt.   Das wirklich tolle an dem Spiel ist das "legale" durch die Wände Glitchen. Am Ende des Spiel wird eine Geschwindigkeit erreicht, die einen durch das Spiel - "Flow" t - :>  Sehr Sehr Geil   Doch der Anfang ist etwas Zäh. 
Date 2016-03-18 Playtime 10h 8m Rec Positive Axiom verge is a throw back to the old NES/SNES Metroid style gameplay that some call Metroidvania that references Castlevania and Metroid.  It is a side scrolling shooter that plays about as fast as Metroid or Castlevania and can easily become difficult if you increase the difficulty.    The story is based on a scientist that has something go wrong in his lab and then he ends up elsewhere.  Without going further into the story, it gets unique to say the least.  You get a multitude of different weapons, one for each number key on your keyboard and a few secrets as well as abilities that enable you to access more parts of the level. Things like phase shifting through walls to upgraded weapon power and health nodes.  The graphics on the store page are what you get.  A retro throwback to the golden days of gaming.  As you explore the level you will find secrets in the walls as well as secret levels that give you more upgrades.  Overall, my play time logged is how long it took me to finish the game with most of everything collected.  You can speed run the game in a much quicker fashion if you like but you miss out on the exploration and the bosses can be considerbly harder without additional power or health increases.    My only complaint, is without hard mode, the bosses are incredibly easy to beat and can be cheesed with ease.  Even the final boss was relativelty easy.  As I have said before, this can be remedied with hard mode and can make things a bit more difficult and possibly frusterating.    For anyone looking at a side scrolling action platformer, I would recommend this game.  I couldn't pull myself away at times and wanted to keep on playing.  When a game does that to the player, it tends to show how well designed it is.  I hope there is a sequel planned, I had read talks about it but who knows.  The story was well designed and threw a curveball at me as I progressed, which is an awesome way to immerse the player.  The only negative things I can think of with this game that would detract and possible sway a purchase is that the bosses are indeed cheesable.  Even on hard, you can still cheese them but everything else is generally much more difficult.   
Date 2016-03-18 Playtime 5h 27m Rec Positive great metroidvania game
Date 2016-03-17 Playtime 15h 24m Rec Positive Have you ever played a metroid title, and did you enjoy it? If you're doubting whether or not you should get this game and answered the previous question with a yes, then you should definitely get this game.  It's like the 2D metroid sequel you've always wanted. It took me a little over 8 hours to beat, but there's definitely more time you can get out of it by speedrunning it/100%'ing it. One downside might be that the controls can be a bit icky when you're playing with keyboard, but otherwise its an amazing experience.  (8/10)
Date 2016-03-17 Playtime 6h 6m Rec Positive It's dope as fuck so far. I say this as a big Super Metroid and Castlevania DS fan. I grew up on this formula. I still adore it. If you feel the same, you will enjoy this.
Date 2016-03-17 Playtime 7h 42m Rec Positive One of my favorite games of all time, amongst the plethora of fantastic and inventive games that have surfaced over the last 30 years, is Metroid Fusion for the GBA. It had a fantastic story, superb controls, the extensive length and repla ability associated with the Metroid series, and some of the most suspenseful and immersive music that I have ever heard from interactive media.  Axiom verge reminds me of this game in all of the best ways. It has a fantastic soundtrack, a lengthy hour count for being such a small game (took me 11 hours to complete the story mode at ~60% item collection), and visuals that match the old Metroid games perfectly. This is undoubtedly a game for the sake of nostalgia, bringing back the feel and attraction of old Metroid games while adding an entirely unique world and story. It is extremely difficult to believe that so much variety and creativity came from one developer, who managed to create what I must call a masterpiece.  That being said, there are a few issues I would point out to both the developer and to those who have an interest in playing this game:  - It is extremely challenging, but not always in the best ways: Most of the bosses and enemies are creative, unique, and require some problem solving to defeat that make each new area a pleasure to find. However, some enemies (heavy turrets and a boss you will recognize when you fight it) are simply infuriating, as their patterns make them nearly impossible to skirt or stun using even the best end-game weapons. However, a bit of patience and well-placed fleeing can mitigate this issue.  - There are so...many...guns: This game involves an  upgrade system common to the Metroid series, in which new items unlock new areas by adding some new form of movement that allows the player to access new parts of the map that they passed earlier in past areas. Included amongst these upgrades are a plethora of different weapon types that can be equipped at any time once they are found. However, there are ~30 different weapons, which means that any normal player finds 4 that they like and never use any of the others. This could be interpreted as a positive aspect of the game, adding a large selection to the player, but I prefer a smaller selection of weapons that are individually more useful. This makes the weapon selection much more akin to the tool selection from any LoZ game.  - No instruction or direction whatsoever: Again, this could be interpreted as a positive aspect of the game, forcing the player to search for their objective rather than being pointed in a particular direction and being told to fetch. However, I have found that a small amount of instruction (what you should be doing and a general idea of where to do it) is preferable to no instruction at all, simply because it removes the 1 1/2 hours devoted to backtracking to find that one door that you can open now. In an attempt to help prospective players without directly spoiling anything, I would recommend that players assume that the tools they are given are capable of doing more than what they say, and that no two tools perform exactly the same task (IE some tools may be useful for doing things other than what their explicit instruction text says in-game).  These are my main concerns with the game, but otherwise I found it extremely enjoyable and unique. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys old 8-bit metroid-vania games and unique science-fiction.
Date 2016-03-16 Playtime 17h 27m Rec Positive 所謂メトロイド的な探索型アクションRPG、ちょっと不気味な世界観ですが逆にそういうところが魅力だと想います。 ファミコン世代には懐かしい表示のバグが演出やシステムとして取り入れられていて、ファミコンへの大きなリスペクトを感じます。とは言っても古臭いゲームかと言われるとけしてそんなとはなくしっかりと作られたUIや操作感があるので最近のゲームと比べても遜色ないと思います。 難易度的にはアクションとしても難しさよりも謎解きに対する閃きのほうが重要かなって感じです。 スーパーメトロイドが好きな人には是非遊んで欲しいです。
Date 2016-03-16 Playtime 1h 31m Rec Negative In the time I spent playing this game, all I it felt like I was doing was wandering around aimlessly to the right while occasionally fighting bosses. The game was clearly sucessfully guiding me somewhere, but I had no idea where that was or how many meaninglessly named areas I'd have to pass through to reach it.  The controls also felt like a hassle to manage, and between that and the lack of purpose or direction, I just wasn't having any fun with it. If there's an excellent game buried in there, I'm never going to reach it.
Date 2016-03-15 Playtime 16h 34m Rec Positive H.R. Giger meets metroidvania.
Date 2016-03-15 Playtime 16h 36m Rec Positive Highly recommend this game
Date 2016-03-15 Playtime 28h 38m Rec Positive Space. Bass. Robot Face.   If you enjoyed Super Metroid, this game will caress your eyes, ears, and mind with something that just feels.. right.  Thirty seconds in, I was completely immersed.  The only thing that bugged me was the lasers right before the end boss. Otherwise, it's the best games I've played the last few years.  
Date 2016-03-14 Playtime 15h 33m Rec Positive Forbidden platitudes in this review: Metroidvania, Nintendo, love letter, retro, Super Metroid, indie, pixel art, 90's, 8-bit, chiptune, nostalgia.  [i]Axiom Verge[/i] is deeply rooted in the 2D action/platform adventure genre. Aside from excelling in every area, what sets it apart is a compelling intrigue and a wide range of pretty unique mechanisms, which I will do my best not to spoil here.  The first right note that the game hits is the atmosphere. The visual design might not be everyone's cup of tea (it surely wasn't mine at first), but the somewhat crude colours of this alien world in which you find yourself stranded play their part in creating a deep sense of immersion. The sounds and music are on point, and set the perfect mood for the 12-15 hours you'll probably spend exploring and backtracking across the different areas on a casual playthrough.  The sense of progression is extremely satisfying throughout the adventure. The level design teases you along the way with a good number of inaccessible areas and/or pickups, which you'll be encouraged to revisit once you've acquired new tech. Aside from lore logs and the usual upgrades (health, range, weapon damage), a good number of the items you will find are inherently specific to [i]Axiom Verge[/i] and will have unique consequences on the gameplay. The movement upgrades really redefine the platforming, and the rather sizeable pool of weapons will leave you with a lot of options when it comes to combat.  The difficulty balance was just right for me - some of the end-game rooms and bosses are pretty brutal, but exploring and acquiring enough upgrades will make it possible to push through without too much grinding and frustration. With a clear mind and a bit of experience with the genre, finding your way on your own is perfectly possible (and I would deeply recommend doing so, as it is infinitely more satisfying than following a guide). The more hardcore-oriented players will be glad to know about the inclusion of a Hard mode as well as a built-in Speedrun mode, complete with global/split timers, reduced RNG and leaderboards with separate categories (any%, 100%, low%)! Nonetheless, [i]Axiom Verge[/i] is perfectly suited for casual gameplay as well.  Did I mention one person did all of this? Yep. The coding, the art, the level design, the music (!)... all the work of a single man, Tom Happ, who created [i]Axiom Verge[/i] as a personal project in his spare time over the course of five years. For a game this close to perfection in every area and a product far above the industry's usual finishing standards, this is truly impressive.
Date 2016-03-14 Playtime 10h 35m Rec Positive I love how this game commits to its theme.  From the pixel art, to the weaponry, to the AMAZING music (if you liked the soundtrack from Super Metroid, then you'll dig this too), I find this game really jives artistically.  You'll really appreciate it if you grew up in SNES era, as this title really harkens back to that time.  The controls are well done and so it combat.  Even the story is interesting, if a bit strange at times.  The one thing I'll criticize here is the lack of direction the game provides you with.  Even in exploration based games like Castlevania or Legend of Zelda, there are usually SOME hints of where to go and what to do.  I have spent hours searching for my next objective.  Some areas are difficult to traverse, and so it gets frustrating when I can't figure out where I should be!  Note that I enjoy explorative games.  I don't enjoy being forced to backtrack repeatedly until I can miraculously find the new area the power up I found an hour ago opens for me.  Overall, still a fun game.  I'm almost finished with it (last boss), so I'll update again soon.
Date 2016-03-14 Playtime 26h 56m Rec Positive One of my favorite games of all time. Nominated for the whoa dude award!
Date 2016-03-13 Playtime 10h 21m Rec Positive Need more games that are as fun, creative, and atmospheric as this. Brilliantly made. 10/10
Date 2016-03-13 Playtime 12h 16m Rec Positive I'm a jonny-come-lately to this game.  Three weeks ago, I never knew it existed.  It was a Steam recommendation as 'similar' to other games I play.  That couldn't be more wrong though.  Something about this game pulls me in like no other.  It's like nothing else in my game library.  I won't bother trying to review the game here, it's been done many times more eliquently by others.  Suffice to say the praise for the game is well deserved.  Cannot get enough of this game, I've even boughten the PS4 version hearing news on twitter that the Vita version is about to drop soon.  I hope sometime in the next few years (sooner?) there is a continuation of some fashin to this game.  Even if there never ends up being one, this is still one hell of a stand-alone game.  If not, I sincerely hope that effort gets put into either an Android or iOS port... how cool would that be?!
Date 2016-03-11 Playtime 6h 26m Rec Positive This was the first game I picked up, sat down, and played on my newly built PC. As soon as I hit the title screen I knew it was going to be aa good game. I loved the Metroid series and was eager to play a game similar, and boy, was I not disapointed. Brings the pixel animated goodness of classic games with a modern touch. The speedrun mode is also really cool, inspiring competition between players. I loved it so much, I decided to use it as a series for my YouTube channel, you can find the videos here: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198259346355/videos Amazing game, a must buy.
Date 2016-03-11 Playtime 10h 25m Rec Positive An expertly crafted love-letter to the metroidvania genre that you cannot pass by.
Date 2016-03-09 Playtime 9h 24m Rec Positive A truely heartfelt Metrodvania experience. If you are a big fan of oldschool Metroid games then you NEED to get this.
Date 2016-03-09 Playtime 31h 27m Rec Positive Un jeu exceptionnel : à la façon d'un Métroid, vous ramasserez de nouvelles armes qui renforcerons à chaque fous votre expérience de jeu.  Des BOSS Epics, une carte intéressante, des mécanismes de jeu joliment étudiés... Et j'aime ce style pixel sur base de bug, c'est beau bordel ! Vite, sautez sur ce jeu !
Date 2016-03-09 Playtime 33h 19m Rec Positive Sometimes a game like this comes along that make you remember that like Beowulf the oldest tales are the best, and we cannot help but keep telling them. And for those of us lucky enough to have been around in the early NES days, when a true classic is reworked into something new and relevant IN OUR LIFETIME! We must remeber to be humble, for we are still living in fresh footsteps of genius.  
Date 2016-03-09 Playtime 6h 30m Rec Positive This game is amazing   it is the best super nintendo game (n)ever made   if you like super medroid and want something to scatch that itch you found your game right here
Date 2016-03-08 Playtime 13h 41m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is just what the doctor ordered; Fun, meaty scifi metroidvania. Gameplay is responsive and smooth and there are a lot of guns in the game. None of the guns are mandatory for different bosses etc. so instead of giving you new guns that makes the old ones obsolete as you progress, it gives you a lot of options to find your own playstyle.   In the vein of old classics like Super Metroid, you explore a big map divided into several pieces. The game doesn't always tell you explicitly where to go so you're gonna have to do some exploring which is rewarding because you find different upgrades all over the maps.   Driving the events of the game is a fascinating scifi story that takes some twists and turns just when you thought that you figured it all out. It left me wanting for more of this universe and it's characters.  Music is very on point with 8-bit melodies mixed with cavernous, reverby bass drums with a little bit of glitch sounds sprinkled in to create a suitable, catchy alien aural landscape.  The visuals pay homage to the games of old with 8-bit looking -yet- high resolution sprites. The bosses especially look impressive. Whereas Super Metroid took Samus to some really claustrophobic places, Axiom Verge's visuals have a more monolithic quality to them with big, cavernous rooms with giant ancient structures hanging around in the background. Combined with some of the more ambient tracks of the game, it makes for a very effective atmosphere.  Thomas Happ has created a game that feels nostalgic yet modern and new, dressed it up with great level design and pacing, making it one of the best games of it's genre.   Highly recommended.
Date 2016-03-08 Playtime 18h 5m Rec Positive Really good metroidvania game.  Saw agdq speedrun(which spoiled minimal amount of story) and decided to pick it up.   The weapons are interesting though you're bound to stick to a few.  The tools are almost all useful throughout the game.  LOTS of stuff to pickup for upgrades and notes, be prepared to scour everything when you have the third coat.  
Date 2016-03-07 Playtime 1h 18m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a very enjoyable game inspired by games like metroid with good artstyle and great game play
Date 2016-03-07 Playtime 42h 6m Rec Positive великолепный атмосферный платформер
Date 2016-03-06 Playtime 123h 6m Rec Positive I do recommend trying this game, but there is one thing about it that is flawed (the story) and one thing that I hope is a technical error and should be fixed by the developers (the audio options).  The gameplay is solid and evokes the spirit of Metroid very well, including the beautiful levels, excellent use of backtracking both to show you how far you've come and how far you still have to go, and exploration that expands as you gain more means of mobility. The story isn't anything to write home about in my opinion, and the fact that you can get stuck and potentially experience story events out of order is a problem for the games coherencey. It is flawed, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. This game is worth recommending just on the strength of its gameplay and should be picked up by most people interested.  However, the audio options need to be fixed. Not the audio itself, the game sounds great, but the options force you to listen to that audio even if you don't want to.  This is important: It is impossible to mute this game. It won't let you. If you turn the audio options for music and sound effects down to minimum in the main menu (they are inaccesible in game, which I also consider a flaw) you may still be able to hear the louder sound effects, especially the drill. I was listening to audio that was turned up well above the game and the drill and certain enemy cries were still audible. I thought I was going insane as I kept hearing this loud grinding drill sound even when I was listening to my own music, because I thought I had muted the game.  Again, the music and sound are fine, but I consider it a massive oversight to leave out the option to mute them completely. Audio options in games are an accessiblilty matter, not just an aesthetic choice and having as wide a range as possible is important. Having said that, the game is still fun and would recommend it. If you want to play a good metroid game this is a fair substitute and the plaforming becomes really engaging once you have a range of mobility options. Good game. Plays really well. Sounds nice. Just wish it would let me listen to something else.
Date 2016-03-06 Playtime 10h 9m Rec Positive Simply put, calling this a metroid clone only does it half justice.  I would call it a masterpiece if it wasn't for one song in the soundtrack, and you'll know it when you hit it.
Date 2016-03-06 Playtime 9h 36m Rec Positive Metroid Prime sounds REAL good right now, doesn't it?  Rating: 7 out of 10, the game nails the look and feel of the NES age, especially with its atmospheric environment and sound design. But the repetative levels, irritating combat, and downright infuriating exploration mechanics stop it from becoming the true successor to its inspiration. Then again, I wasn't a fan of the original Metroid game, so go figure...
Date 2016-03-04 Playtime 21h 38m Rec Positive Yeah,metroidvania Mostly enjoyable because the songs are great. YES,YOU WILL GET MAD SOMETIMES But it's normal,isn't it? It's innovative. It's Glitchy It's Axiom Verge P.S the beggining may seem slow,but trust me,if you want challenges in metroidvania,this one is for you.
Date 2016-03-04 Playtime 4h 6m Rec Positive It's a pretty decent game, although not perfect.  If you are dying for a metroid like game, this is probably it.    That said, it's my opinion that a lot of the weapons and the way you use them is pretty weak.  I'm not going to pretend to be an excellent player, but there are some guns that seem to serve little purpose in most fights.  I did, however, find myself switching guns quite a bit to clear trash mobs, and I did not see it as much of a plus.  In general, I would say there are some balance issues, but it isn't trying to be a modern easy to play game, so maybe it's fine the way it is.  I havne't gotten too far in the game, but it was pretty obvious to me that there is no clear progression to the game.  Some games, even metroid, have good pacing, but in this one you can explore quite a bit more than you need to before having to backtrack.. I'm not sure that everyone will have the experience, but I did find myself fighting my way through the same areas multiple times, almost pointlessly.  There are a lot of good things about this game, like the soundtrack.  It's also a pretty good adaption to the retro castlevania/metroid games.  I would say if you haven't played the old school games that this is based on you should go back and find emulators for them.  Most of the emulators are free and work in your browser.  
Date 2016-03-03 Playtime 34h 30m Rec Positive 对于喜欢银河战士或者恶魔城的人来说，这个游戏绝对值得一玩。隐藏要素满载，难度中等偏上，剧情扑朔迷离，画面无比猎奇。这游戏很和我心意啊，在任天堂没推出银河战士新作前，这游戏我估计可以玩好长时间。
Date 2016-03-03 Playtime 22h 8m Rec Positive 简直神作！几年来玩过最好玩的独立游戏，剧情很棒！剧情很棒！剧情很棒！画面很带感觉，最主要的是：音乐太好听了！音乐太好听了！音乐太好听了！第一个BOSS战的BGM让我简直不想结束战斗！
Date 2016-03-02 Playtime 21h 57m Rec Positive From the moment you hit the start button for the first time and the 80's techno track hits your ears (play with 7.1 headphones, you'll thank me) and the sci-fi mystery begins to unfold, your hooked.  It combines elements of Mega Man, Castlevania Symphony of the Night and Super Metroid into a mentally orgasmic experience that I have not fealt in a long time.   This game brings everything to the table that the 80's babies grew up with in terms of gaming.  The controls are tight and intuitive, the weapons and tools are unique and diverse.  You will use everything the game gives you to beat it.  The boss battles are fun and turn into bullet hell battles as you damage the enemy.  Each boss has it's own unique fight involved in beating it and that point brings me to this point.  The game gives you just enough to know how to play but the game itself teaches you how it wants to be played just by playing.  This is something that gaming has been missing all to often lately.  Most games now a days hold your hand with tutorials explainig every single aspect or you get railroaded into a graphic novel with way to deviate and explore.  This game is all about exploring and backtracking.  If you have played many a metroidvania game this will be complete second nature to you.  The assets are clean and retro harkening back to Metroid on the NES, yet are unique to themselves.  The game gives a constant feeling of being alone in an alien atmosphere with the constant feeling of danger.  The enemies will mess your face up if you don't pay attention and employ some fancy footwork.  This game is such an original in the sense of story and music.  Oh the music!  The tracks are out of this world!  You are absorbed into the game intantly.  I could go on and on about what makes this game a masterpiece but my words wont do the justice of you actually playing it and experiencing it for yourself.  Buy this game, no BS just a great game well worth every penny.
Date 2016-03-02 Playtime 1h 43m Rec Positive Axiom Verge est un beau jeux, les graphisme sont super! Le principe du jeux en lui même est bon et pour tout les nostaligue de Metroid, ce jeux vous rappelleras des souvenirs! Je recommande!
Date 2016-03-02 Playtime 18h 32m Rec Positive Very nostalgic of metroid, very well done. everything felt like it belonged together and the story was interesting without being forced on you.
Date 2016-03-02 Playtime 14h 54m Rec Positive I bought this because I've warn down countless controllers between Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night and Super Metroid. If you like metroidvania, this will please you. I'd sooner suggest picking up one of the above games than Axiom Verge however. Axiom Verge aims to attack your nostalgia gland with it's wonderfully crafted soundtrack and beautiful visuals. My biggest issue was the items.  In a Metroidvania game, you want each item to feel like an accomplishment. "Hey, I got (insert item here) I can use this back at that place I found two hours ago to progress further!" Instead you're met with "I found another weapon. *Fires at wall* this will never be of use." One of the games selling points is easily its story. Complex, dark, a bit metaphysical but hey! I dig it.  8/10
Date 2016-03-02 Playtime 2h 6m Rec Positive AXIOM VERGE... The best shi-fi metroidvania NES-style platform game ever made. 10/10 in all the aspects of the game.Only one man/genius  but, how much talent... THESE ARE THE DEVS THAT I THINK IS RIGHT TO SUPPORT,(IF YOU CAN) DON'T WAIT THE DISCOUNT AND BUY THIS MASTERPIECE TODAY.
Date 2016-03-01 Playtime 38h 19m Rec Positive 10/10 would backtrack again.
Date 2016-03-01 Playtime 30h 14m Rec Positive Honesty, i didn't really get a kick out of this game at first. However, after i started playing and getting through challenges, it started to get very interesting. Like really. This game is really cool and fun, and i would reccomend it to anyone who likes exploration and fighting lots of unique bosses.
Date 2016-03-01 Playtime 33h 0m Rec Positive One of the most amazing metroidvania games I have ever played. The story, music, and gameplay are all perfect. It is truly extraordinary that this is the work of one human... DEMON?
Date 2016-02-29 Playtime 13h 15m Rec Positive It’s [i]about time[/i] someone put the Metroid back in Metroidvania.  Like the “roguelike,” the “metroidvania” genre has been watered down as of late, sometimes meaning nothing more than “you can backtrack if you want to find shortcuts and stuff.” Axiom Verge is about as faithful as you can get to the source material. There are no waypoints telling you where to go next. You [i]will[/i] get lost. You [i]will[/i] spend half an hour trying to figure out where to go next. And once you find the way, it’ll feel [i]amazing[/i], kind of like discovering a hidden room in your own house. But being lost for a while isn’t so bad, because there’s optional hidden stuff everywhere that will make you more powerful in a staggering number of ways. Rest assured that you will definitely need to hunt around a bit for some power, as the game’s difficulty can ramp up to near-impossible levels if you don’t have enough HP or firepower to deal with the stuff you'll stumble across. With its branching paths, interconnected areas, and numerous secrets, the level design borders on perfection.  And then there are the upgrades. You’ve got your standard expected powerups like high-jump, life expansions, and alternate weapons… but there’s also a half-dozen powerups that you [i]will never see coming[/i], and this is where the game really shines. In Metroidvania games, we’ve trained ourselves to watch our surroundings and say “Hey, there’s a blocked passage with some obstacles in front of it. Guess I better come back when I’ve got the right upgrades.” But Axiom Verge does a great job of keeping this from even happening; the powerups are [i]so[/i] unique and different than what you’d expect that you’ll never be able to spot where they’re used ahead of time, so you’ll have to periodically wander around with a fresh eye to re-evaluate the world using your current abilities. If you remember that magical moment when you got the Space Jump in Super Metroid and realized “Whoa, I can [i]fly[/i] now?!” You’ve got a good idea of what to expect from the powerups in this game. (In fact, don’t even watch the trailer. It spoils some of ‘em.)   The sound and art direction is scary good. Without spoiling anything, the game pays [i]very[/i] close attention to detail, and you’ll constantly be finding little things to appreciate. The artistic design of the environments will trigger a lot of recognition not only from Super Metroid, but also from Fusion and Zero Mission. I love how creepy some of the environments are; if you’ve ever felt that Metroid games didn’t have enough creepy organic elements in the stage design, this game’s got you covered.  My nitpicks are comparatively small:  - Late into the game, the controls start to get questionable. You’ll have to juggle about 6 buttons for special items alone, and there’s one item which is too easy to misfire on accident if you’re not careful. Hope you've got a controller.  - The story’s a bit on the incomprehensible side. There is no awesome “baby Metroid saves you” moment; instead there are only a handful of "WTF" moments and no straightforward explanation for them. The ending was less than satisfying, and apparently the biggest questions will be answered in the sequel.  - While the soundtrack is very stylish and distinguishable, I found it lacking some powerful melodies. Out of all the tracks, only about one of them is melodic enough to hum. Most of the tracks have a heavy, same-sounding techno beat which could get tiring to hear after a while.  Overall, Axiom Verge does for Super Metroid what Shovel Knight did for Mega Man, going above and beyond a simple homage and demonstrating an astounding understanding both of what Metroid fans wanted, and how the formula could be expanded using new ideas. Game length is about 10 hours on the initial playthrough if you take your time and hunt for stuff without a guide. The homage bits are spot-on, and the new ideas are brilliant, sometimes shocking. Despite some nitpicks, I give the game a solid 9/10. The gameplay was thoroughly satisfying from beginning to end.  Is it worth the $20 asking price? It’s a bit steep. I think that if you’re not sure what you’re getting into, wait for a 25-50% sale. But if I were to ask you “Have you ever wished that you could go back in time and re-live the day you played Super Metroid for the first time, so that everything would feel new again?” and you were to respond “hell yes,” then the game is worth every penny. Go support this developer; you won’t regret it.
Date 2016-02-29 Playtime 4h 56m Rec Positive just when i thought i ran out of metroid to play
Date 2016-02-28 Playtime 21h 9m Rec Positive [h1][b]This game is simply amazing![/b][/h1][list] [*]Everyone who is in love with the [i][b]Metroid Series[/b][/i] should definitely try this one out. [*]It's full of secrets and optional stuff and has a ton of weapons for you to explore! [*]It has a great backstory, and most importantly: [i][b]one of those creepy atmospheres ♥[/b][/i] [*]The soundtrack is as the game itself pixelated and gives the player exactly that kind of emotion you wish for while playing it.  I'm a great Fan of [i][b]Super Metroid[/b][/i], would even concider it as my favorite game but then [i][b]Axiom Verge[/b][/i] comes into my hands and now after playing it till the end I can say that it's almost Identical with [i][b]Super Metroid[/b][/i] only that this one here is made in 2015.  It's like the Metroid Game we always wished for Nintendo to make.  Thank You Tom for creating such a great game ♥
Date 2016-02-28 Playtime 22h 47m Rec Positive There's a craft to making an experience. Making sure realizations happen at the right time. Creating a sense of wonder. Building a world that for some time can contain the fascination of the mind. Axiom Verge creates a definite experience that I greatly enjoyed.  The gameplay is simple, tried-and-true metroid-style exploration, shooting, and tool-based puzzle solving. If you're new to them, this is a fine game to start with. If you're familiar, Axiom Verge will give you a chance to flex a lot of old muscles, but often in ways that will surprise you.  The atmosphere is great. Every background, wall  and enemy comes together to create a world that feels both alien and alive. Walls and floors are often constructed of what looks like intestines or pipes of blood, creating the feeling of wandering through a giant monster's innards, which ties in nicely to the story.  Axiom Verge's story does an excellent job of giving meaning to its unsettling aesthetic, and many of the mechanical surprises it has under its hood. In the end, I wish there were a little more of the story, but then, wanting more is usually a sign of a good story.  Axiom Verge creates an experience I enjoyed immeansely and its easily one of the best platformers I've played in years. If you've ever wanted to wander through strange and hostile alien landscapes, or just want to remenisce on the days of the 2D Metroid games, don't miss this one.
Date 2016-02-28 Playtime 9h 16m Rec Positive I think this game shines in creating a good atmosphere. The environments and atmospheric music taken together really sucked me in. I loved the boss soundtracks.  Perhaps one complaint I have is that I feel some of the boss fights are not well designed; one boss had a complete blind spot from where you could shoot at the boss until it dies in complete safety. I was playing at Normal difficulty though, not sure if this happens if you pick the harder difficulty.
Date 2016-02-27 Playtime 12h 33m Rec Positive This game is incredible, and it's surprising how much content it has. Buy it immediately, especially if you are a metroid fan.
Date 2016-02-25 Playtime 10h 51m Rec Positive J'aimerais vraiment que Steam permette un jugement plus nuancé que "oui" ou "non"...  Ce jeu est excellent sur bien des points. Il constitue un hommage aux premiers Metroids, et il le fait avec beaucoup d'inventivité au niveau des power-ups. La possibilité de "glitcher" les ennemis est une véritable trouvaille : chaque ennemi a ainsi deux formes, réservant souvent quelques surprises. L'exploration est plaisante et il y a de nombreux secrets, ce qui fait qu'on a toujours envie de progresser, de dévoiler les mystères de la carte. En somme, en tant que Metroidvania, c'est une réussite. Par ailleurs, le gros point fort du jeu est son esthétique : les décors sont magnifiques, dans l'esprit des vieux Metroids avec un petit quelque chose en plus, uncôté cybernétique et organique à la fois, je ne sais pas vraiment comment dire. Quant à l'ambiance sonore, je pense que c'est là que le jeu impressionne le plus. C'est à la fois dérangeant et parfaitement adapté à l'univers ; le travail fourni sur ce point est vraiment impressionnant.  Pour autant, j'ai hésité à le recommander. Tout d'abord, il y a le contenu, qui me parait assez pauvre. 10 heures pour découvrir 90 % du contenu, c'est honorable, mais peu, surtout à ce prix. Comprenez-moi bien : je pense que le prix est justifié, mais surtout pour le travail artistique.  Les boss sont une déception. Si les premiers vous demanderont un peu de stratégie, les suivants peuvent tout simplement être vaincus par force brute, sans souci de comprendre leurs patterns, qui sont d'ailleurs inintéressants. Enfin, l'histoire me parait complètement négligeable (de toute façon, ce n'est (quasiment) jamais le point fort de ces jeux).  Aux antipodes de ce jeu, vous avez Environmental Station alpha, qui rétussit tout ce qu'Axiom Verge rate (boss extrêmement travaillés, contenu plus que conséquent, secrets cachés de façon très intéressante...) et est loin de démériter sur les aspects esthétiques.
Date 2016-02-24 Playtime 12h 45m Rec Positive Super awesome indie game, worth the money and several hours of your time it takes to go through it. Satisfying  story, strange and sci-fi-y, good development with not too much diologue. Satisfying length - I don't feel as if I paid money for some short-lived thing with pretty graphics as some indie games can leave you feeling. This is well developed, solidly made and fun to play.
Date 2016-02-24 Playtime 22h 35m Rec Positive This game is very good. Let me go over some things that helped me decide to play the game.  For a very long time, I haven't played a Metroid game. Not a Metroidvania game, just any Metroid game. When I saw this I instantly thought it wasn't very original from a gameplay stance. However this game isn't just some clone with no personality. Axiom Verge is very different from the rest of its competitors in that it doesn't simply emulate its inspiration, it uses its it as a means to help cement its identity. You play as a scientist, not as some bounty hunter or mercenary, but just as a normal dude. You get thrown into the world of Sudra after an explosion and after very little to no real heavy explanation as to why you are there the game tells you to "explore".   From a gameplay standpoint the mechanics are solid, and well implemented. The game plays like butter, and it is very challenging. Nothing isn't impossible to overcome, but will take time and persistence. Don't give up.  My only complaint is that there are too many weapons in this game that are not very useful. I feel like the oversaturation of weapons made collecting them towards the end of the game more like a chore than a reward. However that is soley my opinion.   If you enjoyed Super Metroid, Zero Mission, or Fusion please do yourself a favor and play this game. It is simply fantastic. If you haven't played the former, do so because those games are awesome too.
Date 2016-02-24 Playtime 23h 22m Rec Positive Pour faire simple, il s'agit d'un des meilleurs jeux de type "neo-retrogaming de cette décennie. En effet, Axiom Verge est, en quelques sortes, la suite spirituelle de Super Metroid, avec des mécaniques nouvelles et plus poussées, voire différentes.  Le jeu est prenant, possède un scénario crédible et cohérent, et propose au joueur une expérience hors du commun.  Bonne durée de vie, bruitages sympathiques, quoiqu'un peu répétitifs et assomants parfois. Il en est de même pour la musique.  Je le recommande fortement à tous les fans de jeux du type "metroidvania".
Date 2016-02-24 Playtime 34h 43m Rec Positive Used to play Super Metroid on super nintendo when I was a little kid. It was the first game I ever bothered playing over and over and over and even into the next generation of systems, I'd still boot up the SNES for some metroid play. This is honestly better than super metroid in every way. Obviously a clone of the franchise but done in a unique and fitting way for the 2015-16 audience. My only SINGLE gripe is that it ended too soon. Not saying the game is short on playtime, but that for how fun and lost I got in that world I wished it would last forever. Cannot wait for the next installment.
Date 2016-02-23 Playtime 1h 22m Rec Positive Since i've been drinking, i should tell you that this game is easier when you haven't been drinking....
Date 2016-02-23 Playtime 18h 4m Rec Positive Un grandioso juego, es inevitable compararlo con el ya famoso Metroid, pero no todo por el gameplay si no por la historia, los personajes y el ambiente 'oscuro' en el que se desarrolla el juego. Existen armas bastante originales, así como los escenarios de fondo. Lo recomiendo mucho.
Date 2016-02-23 Playtime 9h 12m Rec Positive Axiom Verge. The Call of Metroid is a very apt description.  Pros: [*]Awesome Visuals Often many of the visuals are only as detailed as allowed by a pixelated environment will allow letting your brain fill in for most of it, giving it often a more creepy style in return. [*]Beautiful Sound Many of the creatures have very noticeable hit/invul noises letting you know when you are doing damage, this is a plus if you are trying to snipe something off screen. [*]Chilling Music Several of the tracks are semi midi with full music placed with it giving it a mecha organic sound. One of the best tracks is Inexorable which plays in the lower area of Kur.  Cons: [*]Too many options Both a blessing and a curse, you are handed a great many weapons and tools that are all useful in specific way. You get a lot of options and like me you may forget you have one or two of them. [*]Strict Gameplay Not particularly difficult gameplay overall, but unlike most metroidvaniaes where you can kinda power though weaker foes late game, you can still get mercilessly slaughtered by any creature you come across no matter where if you aren't careful. [*]Semi-unituitive controls When I initially started some of the control scheme kinda felt like it was fighting me for the first 30min or so untill i got use to it. The lock position button is now something I wish I could have appreciated earlier.   I am leaving the story out of this review because of 2 reasons. YMMV as far as it concerned. It is an interesting story but if you are only looking for a strong bit of gameplay all of that can be brushed aside for "Speedrun Mode" which isn't even required to be unlocked. You start the game able to skip the story, but I still suggest you go through it once. It's a bit of a mind screw and that is what makes it all the sweeter.
Date 2016-02-23 Playtime 28h 19m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is described as a love letter to Super Metroid, but I want to put that idea aside and just say this is an amazing game. It's visually stunning and fun to play, and has an elegance I wish every game had. It has one central them that everything ties into, which I'm sure will be clear even before I explain everything at the end of this review. Visually, this is one of the prettiest games ever to be made with pixel art. Each environment is unique, both when compared to other areas within this game and to other games. The pixel art is wonderful. The characters and enemies look great, but it's the levels, areas and environments that really shine. It's a sci-fi adventure that looks like nothing else. The exploration aspect is fantastic, with levels being fun to explore and rewards being plentiful. There are multiple points in the game where I looked at the level layout and thought "Oh, there's no way they did that..." or "Oh, I wonder..." and when I tried it, sure enough, there was a secret reward waiting for me. The secrets and power-ups on top of the beautiful environments make this game a pure joy to explore. (Also, the music is fantastic.) Power-ups also work very well. Like with any Metroidvania, a lot of them give you access to new areas, but leave you to rememeber where they might be useful. The place this game shines is with weapons. Unlike in Metroid, where the weapons are just bigger missles, this game is full of weapons that aren't at all required (I think you can get through the entire game with only 2 or 3 weapons), but each one functions a little differently and opens up a huge variety of ways to fight. Instead of just being more powerful, these weapons might instead change the way you play by giving you more options on how to approch enemies. None are way more powerful than the next, but each one is more or less useful depending on the situation or the enemy (plus there's no ammo, so you can use whatever weapons you like without worrying about resources). This really adds to the exploration, helping the rewards feel more unique and like you're truly missing something if you don't find them. Of course, there's a ton of damage upgrades, health upgrades and other such powerups along the way too, which are more frequent than the weapons. There are also notes, which help you out almost not at all but give you lore, story and background to the characters and world. Between the notes, upgrades, weapons and required power-ups, there's tons of different stuff to find and searching for rewards never becomes boring. The combat in this game is solid. It's simple and not the reason you'd play the game, but crucial nonetheless. It makes the world dangerous and challenging to explore, acts as an obstacle between you and your next destination, gives most of the findable items (except notes) genuine value. The excitment of finding a heatlth upgrade or a cool new weapon is real, because the combat makes those things useful. The enemies are not pushovers either, so that alone will motivate you to find every last items to use along with your wits and your aim to overcome baddies. The eneimies theselves are well designed and give each area even more uniqueness, especially in the way you play through each one. Different attak patterns and weakness mean different stratagies for killing/getting past them. The story of this game is fairly good. Minimal and nothing to right home about, but it gets the job done. The best part about the story is how little is explained in cutscenes and diolauge and how much is left to discover through notes that you find. To top it off, this game's map has NO markers. No waypoints, no friendly arrows telling you where to go, nothing. The only in-game markers are the ones the player can place on the map, which can be useful, but these are just tools for you to use as reminders. You get very few hints as to where to go, you get 0 icons or other visual indicators pointing to your next destination. The map itself isn't even complete - it starts off blank, and then records rooms that you've been to, meaning the only thing on the map are the places you've already been. This is one of this game's strong points, because it forces you to explore the world for yourself. It lets you get a little lost, then find your way. It makes you feel like you're wondering a foreign world, not following directions.   Overall, this game is elegant in a way most (if not all) games should aspire to be. What I mean by this is that everything ties into one thing: exploring. The envoirnments are gorgeous and fun to explore, and getting to new areas feels great because of the darastic change in atmosphere and appearacne. The weapons and power-up are helpful, but most of them are optional, rewarding you for exploring the world thoroughly. There are some require items, but these are tools that give you new options for exploring the world. The enemies add challenge to the way you traverse the world, and value to the items you find while exploring. The story is explained at a surface level, but there's so many details, extras, lore and background to the story you can discover by, again, exploring (and if you don't care, you don't have to read them, so it's a win-win either way). Even the required objective is not pointed out for you, so it will require you to explore around for it. This game has one central theme - exploration - and everything else revolves around that. EVERYTHING. Envoirnemts, items, combat story, map, all of it is one tightly-woven experience that I highly recomend to anyone who is a fan of retro games, sidescrollers, metroidvania, sci-fi, or exploring. (My one complaint is some of the extra stuff is honestly TOO hard to find - I would be impressed by anyone who 100%s this game without a walkthrough. God knows I needed one.)
Date 2016-02-22 Playtime 28h 34m Rec Positive Me gustó  mucho el juego, la trama, los escenarios y el diseño de los personajes es excelente. Vale la pena comprarlo.
Date 2016-02-22 Playtime 19h 57m Rec Positive [i]So metroid, it hurts... but it hurts so good. 10/10[/i]  True to its genre, you will do a lot of back-tracking and exploring. But at no time did I ever feel frustrated by it. The game is jam packed with things to find and you will willingly double back over areas that have places which now look suspicious in light of your most recent upgrade (the map marking feature is exceptionally useful here). Discovering new items or getting past a previous obstacles is extremely satisfying - and it happens often!  The setting is excellent. The game does a great job of building atmosphere through the level design, little bits of lore hidden throughout the map, cutscenes and music. You really do feel like you're alone, trapped on a strange dead alien world, struggling to find answers.   The story is very compelling. It's delivered in small, short segments which feels like a great choice. The pacing is good and will keep your curiosity piqued as you move forward.   The graphical style is wonderfully retro. It's pixel art, but it's extraordinarily done. One thing in particular I really love about Axiom Verge is the way it works "glitches" into the world. If you've ever played an old NES game on real hardware, you will immediately notice familiar looking sprite/tile corruptions, flickers, and placement errors. This is done to great effect in this game and it's incredible how it manages to bend them to actually work in a good way!  The music is perfect.  My one and only complaint would be the controls are a little tough to get used to at first. I kept finding myself reflexively using the right analog stick expecting to aim while moving. In actuality, no such feature exists. I also found myself frequently clicking the analog stick buttons by mistake and accidentally activating their functions. Not a deal breaker, but again, it does take some getting used to.  I've only just completed my first play through and there is so much left to discover. This game will keep you entertained for a good long time!
Date 2016-02-21 Playtime 18h 39m Rec Positive I, much like many of you out there, have a problem with getting overhyped for a game. Then when I finally play it, no matter how much I enjoy it, there's always a small lingering sense of disappointment when it didn't meet my completely unjustified expectations. Axiom Verge was a surprise.This game is one of the few games that actually blew all my expectations out of the water. I wanted it thinking it'd fill the metroid-shaped void in my heart. I'd heard very good things and everyone equates it to Metroid which I agree the gameplay is very similar. But I don't feel grouping it as a Metroid-like does this game much justice. Axiom Verge has more weapons and upgrades than you can shake a stick at. It's story is phenomenal and will leave you guessing even at the very end.   I can't recommend this game enough. I absolutely adore it and you should too. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. 
Date 2016-02-21 Playtime 10h 29m Rec Positive Good game overall. +enticing mechanics +backtracking is not boring +items and weapons are really interesting +tons of hidden stuff  -some gamepad/control decisions are bad -level design could be better
Date 2016-02-18 Playtime 10h 53m Rec Positive I really liked the game in the beginning, but by the last three bosses I was cursing my self for being unwilling to walk away from this game unfinished. I didn't really have fun for the last part of the game and it was mostly a stressful difficult push to try to finish it so I could stop playing. maybe it was low item percent (I finished with 47%) but I felt weak and like my weapons were all garbage through the whole game. The damage dash is really a fun mechanic but you get it so late and then you have to rely on it so heavly to get through the last bosses. Dunno I have mixed feelings about this one.  B?
Date 2016-02-18 Playtime 37h 0m Rec Positive More or less the exact game I've been wanting Nintendo to make for years now.
Date 2016-02-18 Playtime 11h 0m Rec Positive This is one of the best Metroidvanias ever made. My only complaints are that the bosses are too easy and it left me craving more. The art direction, music, atmosphere, exploration, and even story are all top notch and it is the perfect scratch to the Metroid itch that Nintendo will never satisfy.
Date 2016-02-18 Playtime 12h 22m Rec Positive This game is amazing. Maybe it's because I never played Super Metroid, but even if I had this game does enough to separate itself from that game. The music is great, the bosses are a lot of fun, the feeling of progression is fantastic and the exploration is very ingenious and well done and the visuals are very Alien-ish, which is a win for me. My only complain would be the story because while it is not bad by any means and is actually quite interesting, I couldn't help but feel unsatisfied by how the world and the plot was explored and some of the character could have used more screen time.  But in the end I enjoyed this game a lot and I would recommend it to anyone. I even bought the 25$ Indiebox with the soundtrack, a map of the world and a figure and I would gladly spend more.  My playtime is missing 6 hours that I played when I didn't have internet btw.
Date 2016-02-17 Playtime 31h 30m Rec Positive Highly recomended if you enjoyed super metroid.
Date 2016-02-17 Playtime 15h 48m Rec Positive Justin Bailey, 10/10
Date 2016-02-17 Playtime 10h 40m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a good game. Good, but not perfect. While the inventiveness surrounding a number of the game's mechanics make it an excellent exploration and action game in the vein of classic Metroid that is well worth your time, I feel that there are a number of design flaws that could have made it a lot better.  The difficulty curve suffers from tremendous spikes towards the end of the game, where enemies hit for massive amounts of damage, so if you haven't been exploring every single nook and cranny, there is no way you will have enough health to take four hits from the shower of bullets late game enemies dish out.  The way powerups seem to be distributed just comes across as (imo) badly designed sometimes, as many times I had barely survived a rather difficult gauntlet only to find a node piece, or even worse, a note.   And yet despite all that, if you enjoyed the early Metroid games, then Axiom Verge is well worth checking out.
Date 2016-02-16 Playtime 7h 36m Rec Positive This game is trippy as fuck.
Date 2016-02-15 Playtime 18h 4m Rec Positive Fun retro platforming! I love pixel style, retro games, and have tried a few based on visuals alone. Axiom Verge did not disappoint. From its creepy atmosphere to its vague and mysterious storyline the game feels like the awesomest sci-fi horror game you never got to play on your SNES. Bottom line: if you're a fan of old school metroidvania with a bit of old school difficulty, Axiom Verge is a game you should definitely pick up.  EDIT: After playing several more metroidvania style games recently. This is still one of the best!
Date 2016-02-15 Playtime 25h 39m Rec Positive PROS: Everything but two things. Fantastic game.  CONS: No wall jumping and some of the guns were complete crap.  10/10 will play again.
Date 2016-02-15 Playtime 23h 55m Rec Positive I have always loved Metroidvania games, even the crappy ones lol. But this one is so awesome from the boss fights to the exploration. I really haven't found anything to complain about yet. It was quite funny fighting the first boss, the giant colon.  Definitely worth the money.
Date 2016-02-15 Playtime 22h 4m Rec Positive [b]9/10[/b] Axiom Verge is a solid action platformer that I highly recommend. It has fun and unique elements that seperate it from other popular metroidvanias. It is a bargain at the current price, and a complete steal during the sales, so pick it up.
Date 2016-02-15 Playtime 22h 37m Rec Positive This game has an amazing story, ominous but catchy music, and a visual style and pallet that it very impressive and overall nice to look at. My one small gripe with the game would have to be the difficulty, this game... is HARD. Now I like a challenge so this was great for me but I dubt this would please everyone. Axiom Verge is a great game, I give it 9/10 stars!
Date 2016-02-15 Playtime 12h 22m Rec Positive Overall good game. The only parts I disliked were: - Not knowing where to go, and having to go online and look for walkthroughs, which are limited. This is to be expected as it is a metroidvania game. - No fast travel to various points  - The drone If you enjoyed the 2d Metroids then you will most likely enjoy this game too.
Date 2016-02-14 Playtime 27h 16m Rec Positive Picture, if you can, a world in which the original Metroid, Dark Souls and general anxiety are actual living game cartridges that can get it on.  Now picture a love motel that is a literal Nintendo Entertainment System, which they check into.  While they are doing the sex, tilt the cartridges so they start glitching out.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's Axiom Verge.  Having a gun that glitches the game is such a great idea. Why'd it take this long for a developer to actually make something like that a central mechanic of the game?  Make these space wasp nests shoot out health instead of wasps. Make these worms break walls so you can get secrets. Turn these annoying flying guys into platforms.  Then glitch yourself through walls, floors, and the ceiling with your magic coat.
Date 2016-02-13 Playtime 103h 52m Rec Positive Good game
Date 2016-02-13 Playtime 10h 54m Rec Positive ストアページには表記されておりませんが日本語完全対応しています。 ゲームとしてはスーパーメトロイドを更に探索寄りにしたゲームと考えて頂ければよいかと 武器にドリルが存在しており何も無さそうな壁が実は掘れたり 敵キャラをブロックに変える事が出来る装備もあり 様々な探索ライフを楽しむ事が出来ます。 クリアに必要でない装備やマップも多くそこを楽しめるかどうかで別れるかも知れません。 
Date 2016-02-13 Playtime 16h 24m Rec Positive -Pretty good Metroid-game-  To say it's a Metroidvania is misleading. This is pretty much a modern version of Metroid 1 with a different story and actors. Controls are very responsive and a gamepad is a must as the game is also of "classical" difficulty. (I just came from Batman and AC and got a beating) There are a bunch of different guns and you switch them around a lot to deal with the different enemies. The chiptune futuristic soundtrack is also satisfying. As another reviewer mentioned the secrets aren't mapped out for you so you actually have to look for breakable blocks in suspicious areas and dead ends some of which you can easily guess. I don't think that's a bad thing. Using pen and paper might also help.  The game doesn't come close to Metroid 3 which is still one of the best video games ever despite being from the last millenium but Axiom Verge is very good to play on its own and we're starved for those games on PC anyway. Also one guy made this while Nintendo had hordes of workers.  [u]Fans of the genre should absolutely play this.[/u]  Don't buy if you're neither persistent nor good at jumpnshoot-games and think metroidvania is about clearing icons from a minimap without effort like with Ubisoft.
Date 2016-02-12 Playtime 16h 17m Rec Positive Extremely atmosperic and engaging game!
Date 2016-02-11 Playtime 37h 57m Rec Positive Awesome game. No flaws.
Date 2016-02-11 Playtime 17h 25m Rec Positive I originally got this game thinking it was a fun Metroid clone.  But that label does an injustice for what the game presents.  There is an unbelievable amount of items and powerups packed into this game, and thats not even bringing up the most unique thing about this game: glitching the world!  That concept really enhances the game experience and presents a new set of challenges and strategies that your basic Metroid clone would lack.  It also is paced very well, starting you off nice and slow, but really pushing you come the end when you get more powerful.  Even on the easiest difficulty, playing careless will result in death.  Doubly true for bosses, which all present difficult but fair challenges.  However, a few bosses can be defeated using cheap tricks.  The story knows its place is on the backburner, because the thing that sells this game is the adventure and action.  So it is generally not intrusive.  And the backstory is revealed only through certain pickups.  But it does have some interesting ways of reintroducing itself, ways that you will definitely not see coming.  The story isnt anything special, but it was not lazily written by any means.  Overall, Axiom Verge is one of the best games I've played on Steam.  And thanks to item percentages, multiple endings, and even a speedrun mode for those who enjoy that challenge, there is replay value there. Whether you get it on sale or not, it is worth the price tag, without question.  This game is not just some Metroid clone, its takes that label and glitches it into oblivion.
Date 2016-02-11 Playtime 16h 35m Rec Positive Phenomenal sound design.  Really nice visuals. Great nod to classic metroidvanias, specifically Super Metroid (almost too good a nod to Super Metroid) Solid, unpredictable environmental obstacles.   Gets a little overly ambitious with it's controls, as late game environments become a little unweildy on the fingers. Still, nice that it is also mechanically challenging, not just figuring out where to go and what gun to use.
Date 2016-02-10 Playtime 14h 40m Rec Positive Axiom Verge es un juego que bebe mucho de la saga Metroid,hay infinidad de armas y gadgets además de muchos enemigos que nos pondrán entre la espada y la pared.8/10
Date 2016-02-10 Playtime 17h 15m Rec Positive Bon metroid-vania.
Date 2016-02-10 Playtime 22h 3m Rec Positive If you long for the return of classic 2D Metroid games, this game is a great fix for you. It has everything we love about the Samus Aran classics yet it has its very own identity. The only minor thing I disliked about this game is the soundtrack, a bit unnerving at times, but still does not affect how great of an experience this game is.
Date 2016-02-10 Playtime 4h 23m Rec Positive The game that has gotten me back into gaming

Date 2016-02-08 Playtime 17h 35m Rec Positive Instead of going the easy way and just rip off super metroid or any of the modern castlevanias, Axiom Verge tries to create new variants of the "old" gameplay mechanics and succeeds in giving you a new, interesting experience. Really tight controls and really fun gameplay, without getting much into it your character's mobility by the end of the game feels completely under control and -more important- fun. It's cool to go back to old parts of the map looking for new objects this way, although I sometimes missed a quick teleport setting. The pseudoretro feel (and definitely retro chiptunes soundtrack) was cool, the game feel and art was really good too. If anything I didn't care much about the story - but then again it didn't get too much in the way so it's ok. Really solid game, very recommended.
Date 2016-02-08 Playtime 1h 11m Rec Negative Being a huge fan of the Metroidvania genre, this one is probably the worst I've played. It looks and sounds terrible to begin with, I personally find the audio even worse than the graphics. The music is very unpleasant to listen to and the sound effects are way too obnoxious, especially enemy hits. It's ridiculously loud too. But even if you perservere through the graphics and sound, the game experience is not a pleasant one. I don't like the stage design, the enemies, or the weapons/powerups. There is little creativity in the maps and moving through it feels more like a chore than actual exploration. Most enemies are simply annoying, most of them move too fast and very hard to dodge, including their attacks. The drill upgrade is okay, but the combination of a drill and the address disruptor is a very weak design choice, as you'll end up drilling or disrupting everything in sight. That is not what I call good gameplay. Last but not least are a lot of weapons that are hard to use or sometimes even useless. Pushing the left analog stick, which happens in the heat of a fight, makes you switch between weapons where you usually don't want to do that.   I wouldn't even call Axiom Verge mediocre, it simply isn't fun. The longer you play, the more obvious it becomes how much thought went into the Metroid and Castlevania games, because Axiom Verge tries very hard to benefit from their innovations but does not get close.
Date 2016-02-08 Playtime 10h 54m Rec Positive Just finished this game. Very good. If you've ever played (S)NES Metroid, this game is where it's at. Played it on Xbox controller, controls were a little weird but got it down fairly quick (weapon swapping on pad wasn't my favorite). Double tapping on the pad was much easier than stick for me also. Advise using notes on the map to remind yourself where obstacles are that you want to revisit, spent many hours wandering around looking for them before I realized it was a feature.   Game: 9.5/10 Only gripe I had was the controls on Xbox Controller were awkward at times. Otherwise the game was very solid. Did feel like some of the weapons were kinda useless but that didn't take anything away from the experience for me.
Date 2016-02-08 Playtime 29h 50m Rec Positive I love this game. The soundtrack is fantastic. The atmosphere is unique. The gameplay is fun and challenging, but not so difficult as to make you want to rage quit. There are tons of upgrades to find. I highly reccomended. Wish there were more games like this.
Date 2016-02-07 Playtime 8h 5m Rec Positive Joguinho muito divertido. Gráficos nostálgicos dos tempos de snes.. O jogo lembra muito Super Metroid.  9/10  Recomendadíssimo.
Date 2016-02-07 Playtime 28h 57m Rec Positive I love this game so far. Enough to safely reccomend it. It takes me back to the NES days with modern touches that make this game oh so sweet. If you love Metroid this game is a 1000% must buy! Hopefully the DEV makes a follow-up and goes SNES looks and calls it Super Axiom Verge. ;D
Date 2016-02-07 Playtime 4h 21m Rec Positive A great 2D, side-scrolling, action-adventure, Metroidvania style game you shouldn't skip.
Date 2016-02-07 Playtime 38h 57m Rec Positive Unbelievably awesome game and fantastic music. Love 2D side scrollers.
Date 2016-02-07 Playtime 23h 35m Rec Positive [h1]Prefazione[/h1] In un periodo videoludico in cui le Remastered la fanno da padrone e le nuove generazioni fanno fatica a ingranare, Thomas Happ decide di irrompere sul mercato con il suo Axiom Verge. Uno sviluppo cominciato solo come hobby e poi trasformatosi in lavoro ha portato alla creazione di uno dei migliori MetroidVania sul mercato odierno.  [h1]Recensione[/h1] Non è di certo un segreto che lo sviluppatore cerca di nascondere; Axiom Verge trae profonda ispirazione dal grande classico [i]Nintendo[/i] e nonostante non porti proprio una ventata d'aria fresca, riesce a ravvivare il panorama del genere, portandoci una buona avventura a due dimensioni di cui ormai si sentiva la mancanza. Accompagnata questa da una colonna sonora perfettamente calzante con il genere, che non vi farà annoiare o venir voglia di coprire con dei vostri brani, anzi che [i]cosiglio di ascoltare anche a parte[/i] per poterne godere appieno.  La trama narra di Trace, uno scienziato che dopo un esperimento andato male, si ritrova catapultato su un altro mondo, Sudra, dal quale non solo dovrà cercare di fuggire, ma anche salvarlo da un virus lanciato da un certo Athetos, un altro uomo approdato sul pianeta prima di lui, che dilagando sta devitalizzando tutto l'ambiente. Trace sarà guidato e supportato per tutto il tempo da Elsenova, una guardiana del mondo che richiederà esplicitamente il suo aiuto, offrendo in cambio la possibilità di riportarlo a casa.  [b]Il mondo da esplorare è vasto[/b], vario e fantasioso; riuscirà a portare non poche memorie ai veterani dei primi capitoli di Metroid e insegnerà ai più giovani come immaginare un'altra dimensione senza il bisogno di vedere troppi pixel. Chiaramente basato sul progresso personale e il backtracking, l'esplorazione e la ricerca dei miglioramenti occuperanno gran parte del nostro viaggio e aggiungeranno una buona longevità a un titolo altrimenti troppo veloce.   Valorizzato da [b]una miriade di armi e gadget[/b], gli approcci al gameplay variano a seconda dei gusti del giocatore: si passa dal classico fucile a colpo singolo ad armi a raggi, da lanciagranate a missili a ricerca, passando per shotgun a colpi multipli e armi con proiettili rimbalzanti. Anche se una volta entrati in possesso delle armi più potenti sarà un'ardua scelta cambiarle.   L'oggetto che sicuramente caratterizza di più Axiom Verge è però l'[b]Address Disruptor[/b], un fucile in grado di distorcere la realtà e "[i]glitchare[/i]" letteralmente nemici e aree di gioco, questo porterà a variazioni di abilità e struttura dei nemici e alla scoperta di nuovi segreti stravolgendo totalmente il mondo circostante. Idea buona, innovativa e realizzata bene, che viene anche arricchita dai [i]power-up[/i] disponibili per l'arma stessa.  Divertenti gli scontri con i boss: nei quali non bisognerà limitarsi a ripetere sempre lo stesso [i]pattern[/i] di mosse per sconfiggerli, ma occorrerà utilizzare strategie dinamiche e avere dei buoni riflessi per evitare di morire. [b]Il livello di difficoltà ricorda i titoli di un tempo[/b] e le prime volte non sarà difficile ritrovarsi più volte a ripetere la stessa sezione di gioco, fortunatamente i checkpoint sono posizionati in modo intelligente e raggiungerli garantirà al giocatore di riavere la barra d'energia al massimo.  [b]Tirando le somme[/b] Axiom Verge si rivela essere una splendida avventura, per i nostalgici, per i giocatori [i]hard core[/i] e per chi vuole provare un gameplay diverso dai canoni moderni. Se non siete soliti esplorare un titolo al 100% però potreste rimanere delusi dalla scarsa longevità, mentre se oltre a spulciarne ogni più piccolo angolo vi piace gareggiare in classifiche mondiali: il gioco permette di giocare la storia in [b]modalità speed run[/b], eliminando filmati e testi e inserendo un timer inarrestabile nell'HUD.  Sarò di parte, ma secondo me merita molto. [b]VOTO 8.5/10[/b]  + Ottimo ritorno al passato + Tante armi e gadget + Modalità speedrun  - Difficoltà a volte frustrante - Scarsa longevità  [i]*Giocato in finestra, con joypad360[/i]   [i]Review by Croma, mod of AGI Group [url]http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AGIgroup[/url].

Date 2016-02-06 Playtime 43h 33m Rec Positive Lovely game. If you're not on the hype train you wont be dissapointed.
Date 2016-02-06 Playtime 46h 3m Rec Positive A huge throwback to Super Metroid in terms of art style and gameplay, I love everything the game offers.  The Orginal Soundtrack is phenomenal which had me fully immersed, The boss, enemy, and level designs are very unique to creating this Universe of it's own. This was my best game of 2015.......idk AAA-quailty games just don't seem to cut it anymore. Corporate standards for games nowadays just sucks. look at the new Star Wars Battlefront, it's severel lacking even with all the dlc.  Idie game devs rise and destroy EA and maaybe Ubisoft lol 
Date 2016-02-05 Playtime 19h 35m Rec Positive one of the best games I've played excellent
Date 2016-02-05 Playtime 4h 21m Rec Positive I have only played thirty minutes but so far its not a let down. Music is truly a warm sponge on the brain. Story seems interesting, weapons of mass destruction are good (oooo destroying the gel is sooo satisfying). Nice build up of enemies, maps offer flavor by exploration aspect, boss battles are great. Contra you were great but this is great too.
Date 2016-02-04 Playtime 12h 29m Rec Positive A really nice game that evoked my nostalgia from SNES' Super Metroid.  Awesome music, unexpected scenes and a nic old-school puzzle-like 2D action. Totally worth the price.
Date 2016-02-04 Playtime 29h 45m Rec Positive Great game! It definitely reminds me of my days playing Symphony of the Night. Lots of exploration, unique enemies, and a ton of different weapons to find. I loved the Alien/Giger influence on the art style of the game. Also, this is the first time in a while I've actually felt challenged playing a game. I even had to check on youtube to see how to complete areas and bosses. If you love metriod or castlevania, get this game.
Date 2016-02-03 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive Boy have I missed 2-D Metroid games.  This really filled the void! (Also, I'm always impressed by games that are made by a single person)
Date 2016-02-03 Playtime 12h 10m Rec Negative A fun experience throughout the game, soiled by what felt like a rushed final dungeon. Buggy enemies and poorly designed boss fights leaning too much on RNG makes for a terrible ending. Couldn't wait for it to end.
Date 2016-02-02 Playtime 11h 48m Rec Positive Simply the very best Metroidvania of this generation.
Date 2016-02-02 Playtime 14h 35m Rec Positive One of the best "Metroid" titles that I've played since Zero Mission. It's not all that common nowadays to find a game that both intends for you to explore and rewards you for it. From weapon and and health upgrades that will make your journey easier to a variety of secrets and tidbits of lore that help you understand Trace's predicament as well as how the world you're exploring came to be. Guided along by its retro-styled aesthetic and its haunting score you'll find that it's easy to lose yourself in this game.  Though the game can be tackled in speed run style (and even has a mode dedicated to it) I put almost six hours into it on my initial run (And almost ten hours total on my 100% completion follow up), so there's no lack of content for your buck. As a matter of fact the secret levels that you can discover and the treasures they hold change with each and every playthrough.  So, if you've got time to spare and feel the nostalgic yearning for an experience reminiscent of old-school action adventures give Axiom Verge a shot. I couldn't recommend it more.
Date 2016-02-01 Playtime 7h 51m Rec Negative Being a huge fan of the Metroid series, this game was fun for the first few hours but the exploration quickly became repetitive while game's difficulty seemed to spike so unneccisarily high that the repetitive exploration became not worth the frustration anymore. Relatively simple enemy AI cranked up with way too much health makes many deaths feel cheap and undeserved. I finally hung it up deciding that completing this game would be more of a hassle than an enjoyable challenge.
Date 2016-01-31 Playtime 39h 17m Rec Positive This game is not a metroidvania. It is a metroid-style game, based on exploring and unlocking content that will help you progress. There are no RPG elements, thus why it isn't a metroidvania. There are tons of secrets. Most of them give you different weapons and upgrades to your stuff.  This game is also rather optimised for speedrunning. Fantastic on that aspect -- it was featured in AGDQ 2016, with Tom being there when the game was played. Dedication.  The story is quite interesting, and fits well with the thematic. Definitely worth a solid playthrough, even if you miss a few things, then to get ALL THE THINGS, and uncover ALL THE MAP. Replayability is solid.  The controls are a little flunky at first but once you get used to them you're gold. You can also remap the controls. This doesn't affect my decision but it's nice to point out.  Overall, well worth the money. Allow maybe 6 hours for full initial absorption. You'll be impressed, too.
Date 2016-01-31 Playtime 25h 40m Rec Positive Love Axiom Verge, I think it blows the original Metroid out of the water... Also plays perfectly with any usb joypad, also runs native on Manjaro Linux and Linux Light natively... A must buy for any Linux gamer looking for a tough but fun Metroidvania with a pulethera of weapon upgrades as you progress through the game.  Soundtrack and in game sounds are great to, along with its glitchy art style.
Date 2016-01-31 Playtime 16h 30m Rec Positive Great game, gameplay, story, and mechanics - would have like the story to continue a bit further, and fast travel!  This game has some great elements.  It's basically a metroid clone but with all the changes and improvements in gameplay that have come with multiple iterations both in Metroid and Castlevania, but then with nuances all it's own which other games would do well to emulate.  The platforming, puzzles, and progression are really solid, and if you want a challenge I would recommend it.  I didn't die THAT much, so don't let the difficulty put you off.  Also, I am not a huge fan of back tracking, I would've liked a fast travel option very much.  In addition, the graphics are excellent given their limitations.  They do a great job emulating NES graphics, and I will say the effects that they have that don't appear to look like NES graphics, do a good job of sort of jarring you with their 'wrongness.'  Overall, this game does a very good job of making you feel uncomfortable.  The world it builds is very strange and alien, something I don't think Metroid did as good a job at.  It really makes you wonder, what has happened here, what is going on, who am I, what am I?  Nothing feels safe, no one feels trustworthy.  It's actually almost Lovecraftian - you feel like you are an ant even if you are a powerful ant, in a hostile, alien world, ruled by alien powers you don't understand, that could easily destroy you.    All that is excellent.  I will say that the story feels like they could've done more and gone further, they had built something very complex with it.  They use diary entries to push the story a little further than in-game dialogue allows, and that can help you fill in some blanks.  However, I would have liked to see the game itself push its concept a bit further, and for the overall story to continue beyond the final battle.   Guess we will have to look forward to the sequel.
Date 2016-01-31 Playtime 8h 47m Rec Positive It's like Super Metroid but with a dude and a really weird/interesting plot. In other words, it's like Super Metroid, so get it.
Date 2016-01-30 Playtime 21h 56m Rec Positive This game feels like Metroid (the NES one) took a whole different direction of evolution instead of Super Metroid, and I love it for that. Different powerups than you usually see in the genre, slightly-randomized world for some powerups, a metric buttload of weapons to play with no matter what you like*, and art aesthetics and a soundtrack to die for. I'm on board for whatever this fella wants to do next if it's all polished like this.  * If you explore, that is. I think you're only guaranteed a few on the 'main' path.
Date 2016-01-29 Playtime 20h 37m Rec Positive If you like Metroid or Castlevania, you'll love this game. Great mechanics, a cool story, and excellent world, and really solid design. I can't say too much more than that.
Date 2016-01-29 Playtime 49h 8m Rec Positive If you grew up playing Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night, buy this game. Even if you didn't but still enjoy 2D side scrolling action platformers, buy this game. The retro look is reminiscent of the 16-bit era, in a good way.
Date 2016-01-29 Playtime 30h 43m Rec Positive The story is compelling and the gameplay is phenomenal!  A fantastic offering in the hallowed metroidvania tradition.   
Date 2016-01-29 Playtime 11h 44m Rec Positive un vrai métroidvania des musiques grandioses un bon scénario et un mécanisme génial (il y a des armes un peu usless)
Date 2016-01-28 Playtime 17h 12m Rec Positive Just finished this game and it took me about 17 hours at a leisurely pace and loved every minute of it.  Retro pixel style graphics will appeal to some players, and hopefully those who don't enjoy that style can look past them into the gameplay.  Tons of weapons, upgrades, powerups, secrets to keep you coming back for more.  Tight controls make the action portion of the gameplay a joy, but I highly recommend a controller.  Axiom Verge is a solid "MetroidVania" style game in every aspect.
Date 2016-01-28 Playtime 6h 48m Rec Positive Big crunchy mindfucky metroidy game. 200/200 missiles.
Date 2016-01-27 Playtime 15h 51m Rec Positive Erinnert sehr an Metroid, hat aber dennoch genug eigene Qualitäten um originell zu sein
Date 2016-01-27 Playtime 4h 25m Rec Negative Je ne recommande pas ce jeu, pourtant j'étais un fan de métroid sur nes et snes. Les graphismes sont pourris, ils pêtent aux yeux et ça fait mal. Une bouillie de pixels de carrés... Le jeu est longiligne et les boss n'ont pas de barre de vie. On s'y ennuie très vite. Les salles se ressemblent toutes même si les monstres changent de couleur. Désolé mais c'est une pâle copie de metroid et ça le restera. Je désinstalle ce jeu, il ne plaira qu'aux enfants qu'il enchantera avec ses boums et ces squikkks. Si j'avais su même à 1 euro je l'aurais pas pris.
Date 2016-01-27 Playtime 4h 33m Rec Positive It's the closest your going to get to Metroid until Nintendo get's their head out of their ass and gives us one.  Pick it up.
Date 2016-01-27 Playtime 19h 19m Rec Positive Possibly my favourite game of 2015.  One of my favourite games of all time; I wish it were longer.
Date 2016-01-26 Playtime 19h 29m Rec Positive The best game of 2015 for me! Amazing!
Date 2016-01-26 Playtime 0h 58m Rec Positive Dieses Spiel hat ein unglaublichen geilen Soundtrack. Auch der Style des Spieles unglaublich ich lieber Retro kramm dazu kommt das es Metroid sehr ähnelt was ich auch unglaublich liebe!  Im ganzen grenzt es an Perfekt!!!!!!!!!!!!
Date 2016-01-26 Playtime 5h 26m Rec Positive 1. gameplay experience is awesome. 2. game storyline is quite confusing (for me anyway).  3. challenging: the hidden items are very2 hard to find  overall, this game is good.
Date 2016-01-25 Playtime 33h 0m Rec Positive Lost protagonist? Check. Huge maze-like world? Check. Lots of tools and weapons to traverse and defeat enemies with? Check and check. Metroidvania here we come.  Axiom Verge is another shooty action-adventure game swimming in the vast sea of such titles you can get on steam. It has everything you expect- tight controls, a decent narrative to immerse the player, a fair challenge, and rich artwork. When you first boot up the game, this all become apparent. But Axiom Verge goes a little deeper in the mechanics and scope- “glitching” the game is one of its key features. Its a neat building point that harkens back to 80's and 90's where players can tease the game into letting the character walk through wall, corrupt enemies, and use passwords to gain more access to the world. Its unique and certainly plays with the idea of what boundaries are in a game. Of course, its all programmed in there, but it just feels like your cheating the game. It makes you grin.   Furthermore, you get a lot of stuff to play with. All of these tools help a player to be as perceptive as possible. All of the game's areas are peppered with secret passages and hidden doorways. Does a passage seem to end early? Take out the drill and check the wall. See some odd flickering? Give it a pass with the Address Disruptor. Found a small passage? Take the drone out for a spin. Found some odd letters? Jot them down. Maybe you can crack the code later. Axiom Verge is a game that rewards players being perceptive and hounding leads. The vast majority of the game's weapons are found snooping around the environment- though only the first three weapons you gain are actually needed. The rest are for funsies.   The narrative deserves a special note. While it is mainly delivered via cut scene and text boxes, its best used is when the game shows, not tells. Unfortunately, this wavers though out the game. The beginning if chock full of these little tells, images, and sequences that envelope the player into the world. But then it stops for a while. Here and there you're treated to a text box interaction, but nothing that grabs you during play. Until you hit certain area later in the game- then the game just envelopes you. I wanted more experiences like that, but the game mostly tones back down to text boxes. Overall, the story is mysterious with some great sci-fi concepts and a few twists.  Axiom Verge is on the easy side- even on hard mode. Hard mode just makes weapons deal less damage, enemies deal more, and health drops are less frequent. This really isn't a challenge since death is mostly inconsequential- you just port back to the last save. You even keep any power-ups obtained and exploration done if you didn't save beforehand! (which is great, I hate re-doing sections) With the glut of weapons you can deal with any problem and the tools and power-ups make escape a breeze if things go sour.   The bosses, while really impressive looking, are mostly ham-fisted encounters with easy patterns. Some can be defeated by simply standing(or crouching) and shooting. Others shoot so wildly and unpredictably that standing and shooting is THE strategy. Trying to dodge will likely get you killed and it's better to get as berserk as the boss and fill it with bio-mechanical plasma. The bosses are certainly a glaring weakness of the game.  When the grappling hook tool is gained it is quickly phased out with other, more versatile tools. Its only apparent function is to obtain a more versatile tool in the next area. Makes me wonder why its in the game at all. There are also a few weapons that are just there to be collected and add little to the game due to their extremely weak power, poor versatility, niche use, or all three.  If your looking for an impressive maze adventure in the same vein as the 2D Metroid titles, Guacamelee, Cave Story, and Symphony of the Night, Axiom Verge is well worth its price tag. If you especially enjoy 100% a game, finding secrets, and decrypting cyphers, than Axiom Verge gives you even more. It you like speed running, Axiom Verge helps you with a specific speed running mode. If you like messing with game data, again, Axiom Verge can scratch that itch with its diverse Passcode Tool. But if you're looking for a fast-pace game to challenge your reflexes and make you think how to overcome a boss or enemy, Axiom Verge will let you down. This is a pure action-adventure title and it bathes in that quality.  One more note, this game was made by one guy in about five years- Tom Happ. He did the art, the music, the narrative, the design, and the distribution. Wow. If Tom Happ ever reads this, thanks for showing us what one person can do. I really enjoyed the game.
Date 2016-01-25 Playtime 17h 31m Rec Positive If you're longing to relive the nostalgiac joy of Metroid / Super Metroid you've found the right game.  The graphics, the music, the boss battles...  It's all there
Date 2016-01-24 Playtime 24h 13m Rec Positive Life. Afterlife. Real. Virtual. Dream. Nightmare. It's a thin line.
Date 2016-01-24 Playtime 16h 15m Rec Positive Excellent game, every metroidvania fan should try it.
Date 2016-01-24 Playtime 20h 39m Rec Positive Super Awesome.  Didn't have much replay value.  And the end bosses were not very hard.  And there are a lot of junk guns.  Still great though.  Great soundtrack.
Date 2016-01-23 Playtime 10h 48m Rec Positive I very much reccomend this game. It's very story/exploration driven just like metroid and all the bosses are really unique. You don't have to collect all the items that they say are in the game to be successful at it. Honestly this is the first game I've been from beginning to end in a very long time.
Date 2016-01-22 Playtime 13h 17m Rec Positive メトロイドや悪魔城ドラキュラ(探索タイプ)が好きな人には特にオススメしたいゲームです。 難易度もほどよく操作のレスポンスも良好でストレスはありません。 生物と機械が融合したような独特で不思議な世界と心に響くサウンド・・・ あっという間にこの世界に浸れると思います。 ファミコン、スーファミ世代の人にはどこか懐かしさを感じさせ、 若い世代の人には新鮮に感じる何かがあると思います。  そして朗報ですが、最近のアップデートで日本語に対応しました。 これでストーリも把握できます。  ちなみに私は英語が苦手なので訳がわからないまま後半まできてしまっていたのでやり直す予定です・・・(>_<)
Date 2016-01-22 Playtime 9h 58m Rec Positive 刚玩2天，第一眼就被风格给吸引了，联想到银河战士的肯定不止我一个人… 目前还在攻略中，解谜和探索的感觉非常有趣，让人很期待遇到下一个场景和物品。总体风格也比较诡异，非常满足各种猎奇探求的欲望（喘粗气）。 地图设计的蛮巧妙的，每个地图风格迥异，并且配有符合其背景的BGM，代入感十足。 由于还在攻略中写的文章，所以不敢说太多了，总之喜欢2D动作解谜，而且对这个风格有兴趣的人，一定要尝试一下，真的满足好奇欲的游戏。 - - - - - 初步通关，写点补充。 从头到尾都，整个世界观的气氛都非常浓郁，那种奇怪又压抑的世界观我个人非常着迷。 游戏里有丰富的武器，不过其实大部分都是玩具性质，流程下来大部分都没什么机会用到。 虽然通关了，明显很多东西还没收集到，结局似乎也只是普通结尾，感觉想要完全解锁要素还得花上不少时间。收集要素很多，解谜要素虽然不难但是都挺有创意的，不过相比之下BOSS战有点简单，也许因为我只是普通难度吧。 流程长度还不错，初次攻略为了解谜会跑来跑去花很多时间，是需要时间去慢慢体验的一款作品。  另： 操作手感整体上不错，个人推荐用手柄玩，键盘达人可以无视......
Date 2016-01-22 Playtime 19h 47m Rec Positive If you're a fan of Metroidvania and Platformers, Axiom Verge is sure to impress. Great visuals, fun game play and a nice story all bundled together makes one of the best platformers I've played.
Date 2016-01-22 Playtime 17h 52m Rec Positive One of the best games I've ever played
Date 2016-01-22 Playtime 29h 27m Rec Positive Wonderful game. Starting second playthrough soon to get more exploration in.  Two years after my initial review I wanted to come back and say that I still really enjoy this game!  Anyone looking for some Metroid-like game play should check it out.  The retro music is really great and fits the game perfectly.
Date 2016-01-22 Playtime 56h 46m Rec Positive Buy it and play it. It'll change your life by making you want to suicide because it makes you remember how games used to be made with a vision and pride.
Date 2016-01-21 Playtime 25h 27m Rec Positive You made a lot of updates to this game and where is information about changes?

Date 2016-01-20 Playtime 16h 53m Rec Positive 메트로이드의 재림.  고전 메트로이드 느낌을 아주 잘 살려낸 게임이다. 게임의 배경은 뭔가 세기말 스러운 SF 분위기에, 그래픽은 딱 슈퍼패미콤 느낌이고, 음악은 매우 준수하다. 과장 좀 보태서 말하면 그냥 번외편 메트로이드 하는 느낌마저 들 정도. 물론 그만큼 무지무지 재밌다는 이야기이다. 메트로배니아류 게임 좋아하는 게이머라면 정말정말 재밌게 할 수 있을 게임이다.  기본적인 게임 흐름 이외에 맵 밝히기, 추가 무기와 도구 및 각종 강화 아이템들 찾기 등도 준비되어 있다. 사실상 모든 도구를 갖춘 게임 후반부에는 다양한 루트와 다양한 방법으로 맵을 이동하고 다닐 수 있게 된다. 메트로배니아류의 정석을 아주 잘 갖췄다.  재밌는 건 대부분의 몬스터들을 '해킹'할 수 있다는 것이다. '어드레스 디스럽터'라는 도구를 통해 각 몬스터들의 데이터를 교란시킬 수 있는데(쉽게 말하면 그냥 몬스터를 바꿔버리는 것이다.), 이를 통해 몬스터의 생김새도 달라지고 몬스터 자체도 조금 약화되어 잡기도 편해진다. 일부 몬스터들은 실제 게임에서 글리치가 일어난 듯한 괴상한 모양새를 띄기도 한다. 관련 도전과제도 있으니 이리저리 해킹하고 다녀보자. 이게 은근히 재밌다.  난이도는 노멀/하드가 준비되어 있다. 어느 정도 아이템을 획득해가며 진행할 경우 노멀은 절대 어렵지 않고, 하드도 나름 할만하다. 세이브 포인트도 지도상에 많이 널려있으니 꾸준히 세이브하고 다니면 죽었을 때의 멘붕도 적은 편이다. 또한 모든 이벤트와 대사가 빠진 채 오로지 클리어타임에만 집중하는 스피드런 모드도 준비되어 있다. 메트로배니아 게임 좋아하는 코어 게이머들의 니즈를 제대로 살린 부분이라 보인다.  다만 고전 메트로이드류 게임들의 단점들까지 빼다박은 점들이 문제가 된다. 일단 넉백으로 인한 어려움은 여전하다. 보스들의 패턴 역시 꽤나 단조롭게 느껴진다. 또한 고전 느낌의 게임이다보니 360도 회전이 가능한 아날로그 패드로는 오히려 조작이 조금 까다롭게 느껴진다. 마지막으로 각 세이브포인트끼리 워프가 안 된다는 것도 개인적으론 아쉬웠다.(이건 스피드런 때문인 듯 하지만) 옛날 게임들의 단점까지 그대로 가져오는 걸 별로 좋아하지 않는 본인으로써는 게임에 대한 평가를 조금 낮출 수 밖에 없는 요소들이다.  이 게임이 몇 년 전에 나왔더라면 주저없이 '최고의 게임!!'이라고 칭해줬겠지만, 시대가 시대다보니 눈감고 추천해주기는 조금 어려운 게임이다. 호불호가 어느 정도는 갈릴 게임이라는 이야기다. 그래도 여전히 메트로배니아 스타일의 인디 게임 중에선 단연 몇 손가락 안에 꼽을 수 있을 게임이다.  http://blog.naver.com/kitpage/220605730298
Date 2016-01-20 Playtime 19h 52m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a ton of fun.  The gameplay and music are solid and conjure up memories of the 16 bit days.
Date 2016-01-19 Playtime 14h 3m Rec Positive A genuinely enjoyable metroid clone with varied weapons and traversal mechanics. The art is the main draw. The 16-bit art would stand on its own as the levels are impossibly detailed and varied - obviously a labor of love. The game also makes great use of digital effects that wouldn't be possible in a strictly 16-bit game but add to the retro feel of the game. There's more backstory than story, but the small amount of text and dialogue does a good job enhacing the atmosphere of the game.
Date 2016-01-19 Playtime 22h 57m Rec Positive This game threw me back to memories of playing both the Metroid and Castlevania series. Its style of story with broad interpretation and its gameplay were very appealing to me. I think any fan of science fiction and this kind of game will love it. If you like a challenge and a great in-depth story, I couldn't recommend this game more!
Date 2016-01-19 Playtime 12h 40m Rec Negative This is one of those cases where I wish steam had a "meh" option because for a game like this, it's sorely needed. Okay. I don't usually do this but I'm just going to break down everything separately.  First off: I will quite frequently bring up this game's contemporary Environmental Station Alpha multiple times, since a comparison to this game is how I found ESA originally, and then what brought me back to this game was a comparison of this game to ESA, and since the games came out in the same month both heavily aping Metroid, the comparisons are almost begging to happen.  Story: It's pretty good, actually. I wouldn't say it's a huge factor in the game, but the story and the collectible lore are pretty intriguing, leaving just enough ambiguous to keep you guessing. I wouldn't say the story is the main draw of the game, but I definitely can't hold it against the game.  Graphics: Hmm. This is tricky to rate. On one hand, the pixel art is gorgeous to look at. On the other hand... it's a bit of a sensory overload sometimes, since there are so many bright colors all the time. It doesn't help that the only really noticeable graphically difference in most areas is the color. The game doesn't have very well defined "enivironments" like ESA, and though this technically has better "art" than that game, I dunno, I feel ESA just has a better aesthetic than this game. I wouldn't say the graphics are bad by any means but it's amazing how bland I find them for how well they're done.  Music: It's alright at first, it's very game-y music, but by the end of the game I was utterly sick of it. I dunno, it's way too blaring and in-your-face most of the time. Metroid had more atmospheric music, ESA has more atmospheric music, it added to the mood instead of overpowering it. I wouldn't say it's bad music, you'll probably enjoy it your first time through the game, but not for much longer.  And now... here's where things are really gonna fall apart. Gameplay: Uuugh. I should love this so much more than I do. But. Okay, here's the key problem: This game is stubbornly rooted in Super Metroid, in almost every aspect. A lot of its mechanics are quite similar, for one, just "modernized", and for what it's worth, a lot of the "modernized" mechanics are good. The grappling hook is an utter travesty though, worse than any in Metroid and an absolute trainwreck compared to the fantastic grappling of ESA. It's just... thank god this thing barely sees any use because it's utter trash.   But that aside... the game design itself apes Super Metroid far too heavily, especially when it comes to collectibles. I did not enjoy hunting for secrets in Super Metroid and never bothered to get 100%, but I wanted to here because achievements etc. I did not get past like 75% without consulting a guide because there are just so many obnoxiously hidden secrets in the game... Some of the passwords in particular are total "how would you ever figure that out on your own" moments, and. Okay, maybe this just annoys me in particular, but sometimes... secret locations are shown to you on the map via the wall of the room not being finished. But other secrets aren't. There's no consistency for stuff otherwise hidden in the exact same way, it's just really strange. You have a fair share of pure fake walls that you can't find until you're touching them, and there's a ton of things you need to drill, a few strange glitched enemies you need to take advantage of, and absolute no item-finding tool to assist you, unlike Super Metroid. There is, amazingly, both indication of 100% map completion and 100% item completion for each specific area, but you'd never know until it showed up for you the first time, and even then you probably wouldn't know what it means.  I will be the first to admit that, yes, ESA did have a lot of the same stuff to it. But here's the thing. The way that game's map is designed turned an annoyance into sheer brilliance, because the map was 100% tightly packed. You could figure out where secret rooms are 9 times out of 10, because the entire map is solid as a rock. There was also a hidden map item that mapped out most of the main secret areas, too. And even with the secrets on the outside of the station, you did have a fairly limited scope of things to search. Stuff was hidden, but it made sense. In Axiom Verge, it just doesn't make sense. Add to that the fact that there's no "secrets" necessary to just complete the game, no fake walls, no maps lying to you, and you'd never know there were supposed to be secrets like that until you accidentally stumbled upon one, or noticed how low your item % was at the end of the game.   I've rambled on about this one element enough but this is legitimately the biggest deal I could ever have with a metroidvania: Exploring isn't fun. Any metroidvania that fails this is fundamentally doing something wrong, no exceptions. I loved exploring in games like ESA, Guacamelee, La-Mulana, Knytt Underground, heck, even games like Dust and Ori where exploration is stupidly easy. Here though, it just ain't fun.   Onto the rest. Sigh. The platforming is generally alright. I actually dig most of the movement mechanics in this game. The coats constantly upgrade your ability to move through walls, and by the third one you have this cool dash attack that speeds up movement considerably, and it's just really fun to use. The drone is far, far superior to the Metroid morph ball, being much more flexible and once you have the drone swap allowing for a lot of cool movement options. I'm legitimately excited to watch the run of this game at AGDQ as soon as I finish watching this review, because while movement in this game is a bit stiff at first, as it tends to be in most metroidvanias, it gets really fun later on. There's no real tough platforming challenges in the game, though, a few instances of grappling hook shenanigans but they're rare, and everything else isn't any harder than completing the first world of Super Meat Boy. Heck, probably even easier than that.  I have mixed feelings on the combat, though. For one, there are too freaking many weapons, and so few of them saw much use. Especially once you get one of the god-tier weapons that basically invalidates all the other weapons before it. The lightning gun feels like cheating, almost. Basic enemies start out pretty manageable, but by the end of the game they are waaaayyy too strong and waaayyy too durable, and possibly even waaayyy too prevalent. I guess, the game wouldn't have any challenge at all with the higher-tier weapons unless the enemies are this way, but it reeks of fake difficulty. The bosses fare a little better, though they're also fairly unmemorable. There aren't very many of them, they're all very standard in design, no clever tricks, just shooting and dodging stuff. Snore. The final boss is atrocious, by the way, being basically an RNG boss unless you're a god at dodging tons of projectiles and three huge hitboxes while also trying to hit one specific section of the ceiling. Seriously, who the hell thought that was a decent idea for a boss. It doesn't even feel rewarding to win, it just feels like "Oh, I got lucky with the health drops this time so I won. Okay." And it's just really anticlimactic. Though honestly the entire game feels really anticlimactic. The story itself is fine but never seems to go anywhere. I didn't realize I was approaching the end until the game was like "Oh hey by the way you're approaching the end". Ehh. Some of the guns are fun to use though. For a primarily combat-driven game though I really feel like this could've been better. Granted, I've never really liked combat in Metroid games either, and the bosses in Metroid games are even worse than the ones here in my humble opinion, but whatever.  [Character limit hit, continuing in comments.]
Date 2016-01-19 Playtime 35h 51m Rec Positive a definite great game, really pays a great compliment to the 2d platform of metroid series, story plays out very intresstingly, worth the playthru.
Date 2016-01-19 Playtime 14h 20m Rec Positive Very well-crafted Metroidvania with eerie environments, good music, and creative gameplay elements. It also has a surprisingly interesting story, especially compared to other Metroidvanias.
Date 2016-01-19 Playtime 18h 12m Rec Positive A solid  METROIDvania  9/10
Date 2016-01-18 Playtime 15h 34m Rec Positive Fantastic game, been playing for hours and enjoying every minute.
Date 2016-01-18 Playtime 16h 44m Rec Positive What an excellent game.  Well the best comparison would be the 2d Metroid games but Axiom Verge does enough to differentiate itself from the forementioned franchise.  Awesome gameplay and tons of secrets to find will scratch the itch for anybody looking for some old school 2d gaming.  It's pretty amazing that the game was created by 1 person.  Wonderful job Tom Happ.  Here's hoping for a sequel.    If you are a fan of NES or Metroid type games, this should be right up your alley.  Highly recommended.
Date 2016-01-18 Playtime 6h 52m Rec Positive Fantastic 16-bit rendition of a Metroidvania. The environment and storyline is super interesting and incredibly alien. It makes me feel like I'm playing a platformer version of Half-Life. Highly recommended.
Date 2016-01-18 Playtime 11h 1m Rec Positive Extremadamente disfrutable, un metroidvania en su mejor expresion. Aplica cosas ya conocidas asi como elementos novedosos (armar, habilidades, enemigos) que realmente hacen de Axiom Verge un juego interesante, con claras referencias a otros juegos pero refrescantemente innovador.  10/10
Date 2016-01-18 Playtime 22h 22m Rec Positive The story is weird and kind of confusing, but it doesn't matter because the gameplay is GREAT.
Date 2016-01-18 Playtime 15h 32m Rec Positive [h1] [b]Axiom ou Vérité ? 	[/b]	[/h1]  Il n'est pas rare dans le milieux du jeu vidéo indépendant  que des développeurs s'inspire d'une licence forte  pour ce faire la main, ce qui donne malheureusement des résultats très variable, selon les productions.  Ici en l'occurrence, c'est le jeu "Metroid", qui a servi d'inspiration  à Tom Happ créateur du soft.  Contrairement aux cacahuètes de votre bar favori,  aucune trace d'urine n'a été déceler dans ce que l'on pourrait appeler un hommage bien senti à une série de légende.  Car oui,  Axiom Verge, livre une copie proche du titre originale, tant dans son resenties action-plateforme  et exploration, que dans  ses contrôles où sa thématique SF claustrophobique.  Ce qui ne l'empêchera pas toutefois, d'imposer son univers, soutenue par son background, sa musique et ses items originaux.   On retrouvera évidemment une carte détaillée pour le backtracking, des upgrades pour le personnage disséminer ici et là dans les niveaux, des salles de sauvegarde avant des moments un peut chaud ainsi que des boss imposants et cool à pratiquer.   De par ces qualités, le titre est une réussite et ce fera sentir comme à la maison, les fans de Metroid 2D.
Date 2016-01-18 Playtime 9h 27m Rec Positive i give this game my Sergally Seal of approval 10/10
Date 2016-01-17 Playtime 32h 51m Rec Positive Incredibly deep game, lots of weapons, powerups, and interesting skill techniques to learn and master (though there's one I'll never personally get because I don't have reflexes that run on microseconds....you'll know it when you see it), this game has great replayability, much as those games it simulates do. The more times you play, the better you'll get.  I sincerely hope there's an Axiom Verge 2 on the way, since there are details in the story I feel are deliberately left open even in the best ending, and I'd love for it to be a series.
Date 2016-01-17 Playtime 14h 22m Rec Positive It's really good. If you want a game like the metroid games (which I definitely do), this is that game.
Date 2016-01-17 Playtime 28h 4m Rec Positive Amazing game, I recomment to anyone who loves Metroid kind of games. Retro graphics with a modern touch, the music sounds very other wordly, there are a ton of different weapons. I'm really hoping they'll make a 2nd one.
Date 2016-01-17 Playtime 15h 19m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is almost a clone of the GameBoyAdvance-Metroid series. but a good one, to be honest. later in the game its getting very unique and you are satisfied in every way! let me assure you: this one is great!
Date 2016-01-17 Playtime 88h 14m Rec Positive The best Metroid clone out there. I had a blast getting every achievement there is in this game, and that included the speed run which I absolutely dread while playing other games.    There are tons of weapons and cool skills you gain throughout the game that allow you to explore every nook and cranny of the game.   The controls are fantastic, though it was a tad bit difficult (for me) to play this game using keyboard but that gave me a reason to get the Steam Controller and it worked great.   I'd say the only problem I had was something minor... The music was kind of meh in my opinion. It's enjoyable at first but it got annoying. Then again, I was going at a snails pace trying to find everything so it tended to drone on and on.  It was solved easily though, because I just muted it and put on some other music or listened to a podcast.  Final rating: 9/10 will be buying sequel if and when it comes out.
Date 2016-01-16 Playtime 11h 9m Rec Positive good game cool good job man i rate it a 10/10
Date 2016-01-16 Playtime 28h 37m Rec Positive A lovingly crafted Metroidvania indie game from a single developer that takes me right back to the days of sneaking in thirty minutes of playtime in Metroid 1-3, before catching the schoolbus in the morning. Recaptures the "Wow, cool!" moments of poking around the environment and finding secrets of the early Metroid titles. Has a surprisingly good, and well-suited soundtrack. It's not simply a Metroid ripoff either, developer Tom Happ brings his own spin to the genre with a unique story, compelling pixel art, and quirky items.
Date 2016-01-16 Playtime 12h 36m Rec Positive Among the best games I've played of the metroidvania genre.
Date 2016-01-16 Playtime 29h 44m Rec Positive [code]Я был полон решимости добраться до самой сути. Ведь это все, что у меня осталось.  --Трейс[/code]  Зимняя распродажа. 2015 год. Я шарился по прилавками Стима в поисках годноты и наткнулся на эту игрушку. Уже по превьюшке я увидел что в игре имеется шикарная пиксельная графика. Особых надежд по поводу игры я не испытывал, и даже не подозревал что игра окажется самым лучшим платформером из всех мною сыгранных... Как оказалось позже, игру делал всего один человек, в течении пяти лет, и очевидно он вдохноволялся Метроидом.  [h1]Сюжет.[/h1] Начинается игра со стилизованного под старые игры, видео-ролика в котором рассказывается о лаборатории в Нью-Мексико и о команде ученых в ней. В ходе какого-то эксперимента случается катастрофа и в лаборатории происходит взрыв. Главный герой - один из ученых, по имени Трейс, просыпается в неизвестном месте. Целый и невредимый. Что это за место? Как он туда попал? Все это предстоит разузнать игроку. С первых минут игра цепляет своей атмосферой. Повсюду мрак, загадочные и враждебные существа ползают тут и там... Но я отвлекся. Ах, да пробуждение... Так вот. В одном из помещений мы находим таинственное существо, которое называет себя "русалкой", которая просит помочь ей, избавить это место это от таинственного врага Атетоса - сверхразума который завладел здешними местами с помощью вируса. По ходу игры мы узнаем что есть несколько таких русалок, диалоги с которыми будут постепенно раскрывать предысторию произошедшего. Остальную информацию нам придется собирать по крупицам находя записки разбросанные в труднодоступных местах. Сюжет в итоге получился довольно неплохим, и с неожиданными поворотами.  [h1]Геймплей.[/h1] А вот здесь самый смак. 25 видов различого оружия, которые придется поискать, огромное разнообразие врагов на локациях и каждый со своим подходом, 8 пукановыносящих боссов, из-за которых можно разбить не один геймпад, а так же различные приспособления и гаджеты которые помогут преодолевать препятствия.   [quote][b]Плюсы:[/b] + Шикарная пиксельная графика + Олдскульный хардкор + Отличная музыка + Разнообразный геймплей + Атмосфера[/quote] [quote]Минусы: Не заметил минусов.[/quote]  [i]Итог: Настоящий олдскульный платформер. Советую всем любителям платформеров, и особенно поклонникам серии Metroid.[/i]  [b]10 русалок из 10[/b]
Date 2016-01-16 Playtime 16h 23m Rec Positive I can't add anything that hasn't already been said.  This game is amazing!  If you like Super Metroid then you owe it to yourself to play Axiom Verge.  It is worth every penny!
Date 2016-01-15 Playtime 30h 3m Rec Positive メトロイド　オモロイド
Date 2016-01-15 Playtime 10h 45m Rec Positive Très bon Metroid-like, dans la pure lignée de ce Super Metroid. Le jeu est parfaitement réalisé à tous les niveaux :    [*]style graphique cohérent et très réussi si on adhère   [*]level design très bien fichu : on ne reste jamais bloqué très longtemps malgré les nombreuses ramifications de la map, ce qui est un petit exploit en soi  [*]jouabilité au poil malgré les nombreuses capacités utilisables. Petit bémol toutefois sur les capacités de téléportation, que j'ai activé TRES souvent sans le vouloir, heureusement sans grande conséquence   [*]des armes et capacités dans tous les sens avec de bonnes idées   [*]assez long, avec beaucoup de renouvellement grâce au point précédent   [*]des secrets partout, et pour la plupart cachés de manière cohérente (mais je n'ai pas tout trouvé, donc il y en a peut être qui sont cachés à des endroits totalement improbables...)  Sans avoir été subjugué, je n'ai pas grand chose à reprocher au jeu et j'ai passé un excellent moment sur celui-ci.
Date 2016-01-15 Playtime 14h 50m Rec Positive Great game, probably one of the best metroidvania games in a long time!  Obviously very much inspired by Super Metroid and co, it still brings some very interesting twists to the gameplay like the address disruptor (glitch gun) and the lab coat, which alter the gameplay in very cool ways. The sense of exploration is very much on par with that offered by Super Metroid and you can get really lost in these nicely designed alien environments.  If you consider that everything, design, coding, art, sound and music, was done by a single developer, this game is really quite an accomplishment.
Date 2016-01-15 Playtime 34h 2m Rec Positive Excellent game.  Very nostalgic feel.  8/10.
Date 2016-01-14 Playtime 34h 49m Rec Positive *re-edited this review  I put in around 25 hours into a game that apparently takes around 10 hours to complete and still haven't finished collecting everything. Yes Axiom Verge is a huge game full of sharp shooting, platforming and discovery much in the spirit of games like Metroid and Castlevania. It also reminded me of a little known classic called Wolf Child.   At times Axiom Verge feels almost imposible to uncover as it is so vast and choc-full of secrets to uncover some of which require a sharp eye, others a sharp mind. Unfortunatley not all the time I put into the game was pleasent however. This was due mostly to some momentary design flaws. For example there is a particular section of the game that took me hours to figure out and it was due to a puzzle that had no particular set up. The next moment came with the seventh boss who in a sharp turn from other bosses felt like more of grind than a battle of skill. These moments set me back hours grinding what is otherwise a smooth experience to a halt.  The dificulty level also takes a sharp spike towards the end of the game which isn't especially surprising (duh) but I felt the game doesn't balance your newly acquired abilities as well as earlier in the game resulting again in battles of health grinding or even worse dreaded retreads as you replay one area over and over and OVER... sorry.  Moving on. With much of the bad stuff out the way the game truly shines in pretty much all of it Metroidvania inspired glory. For the vast majority of the game exploration is incredibly fun, there are tons of fantastic enemies to face along the way and it all revolves around a intruiging story that is reminicent of sci-fi films like the Matrix. For the most part the controls are very tight however I did run into problems playing with my 360 pad (mostly cuz the D-Pad sucks). Also I really didn't like the implementation of the dash and double jump.   I absolutley loved the breadth of power ups, weapons and abilities. This for me was the most rewarding aspect of the game I squeeled like a school girl upon finally getting the infamous flame thrower! Also the drone is amazing and in conjunction with the field disruptor lead to some awesome puzzle solving. After stumbling awarkardly through the games jagged world for hours you will eventually move through it like a 16bit God!   Over all Axiom Verge is an incrediably fun if slightly flawed platformer. It's one of the best games I have played for some time and certainly the best platformer since Shovel Knight. To think this is the work of one man blows my mind. Hats off sir, hats off.
Date 2016-01-14 Playtime 0h 54m Rec Positive Very Interesting style of gameplay. Reminiscent of the old Metroid games, but with the new concept of "haking" the game and using the glitches to your advantage. Would recommend for casual gamers.
Date 2016-01-14 Playtime 2h 3m Rec Positive 분위기가 좋다
Date 2016-01-14 Playtime 8h 29m Rec Positive A Metroidvana that has a bit of a twist on the genre. Axiom Verge takes a lot of your expectations on this style of game, but often has you getting the neccessary results you would in other games (such as reaching a higher location), but has you achieving these through a non-standard means. The story is definitely interesting, there are tons of different items, collectibles, and secret areas to keep you searching, and many of the boss designs are very fun. A great action platformer!
Date 2016-01-14 Playtime 18h 43m Rec Positive I owned super metroid as a kid and still have the same copy.  I've never accepted any of the metroid games that followed to be worth playing through to the end.  Axiom Verge was worth every second i put into it.   The only feature it took me some time to get used to was using the button to lock my position so i could aim without running.  Prefered metroids hold an extra key to aim up or down.  If u like this genre, buy this game.
Date 2016-01-13 Playtime 18h 25m Rec Positive Un titolo veramente notevole, consigliatissimo a tutti i fan di Super Metroid!
Date 2016-01-13 Playtime 11h 49m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a excellent loveletter to Metroid and probably one of the finest example of this genre. If you buy Axiom Verge what you'll find is:  - A Excellent, atmospheric soundtrack - A BIG variety of weapons - Lots of secrets and power-ups. Some of them optional -  nice looking artwork, with very nice spritework, especially the bosses. - About 10-15 hours of gameplay with tight controls and excellent gameplay.  Well, what didn't I like? - The soundeffects got some HORRIBLE noises. prepare to turn down your headphones. - With a few exceptions, the backgrounds are kind of generic. -It can be easy to get lost, especially since the in-game marker system is bad as it only allows you to have 2 markers on the map simultaniously. If you're serious about 100% without a guide, be prepared to use notes. - While a big arsenal of weapons is good, that many of them quickly becomes obsolete is not good.  Ultimatley I'd say that any fan of the genre owe it to themselves to check out the game. It might not be the most innovative Metroidvania game out there but it might be one of the most solid examples of the genre I've played,

Date 2016-01-13 Playtime 13h 57m Rec Positive Wonderful game, great controls, amazing soundtrack. Reminded me of the glorious old days playing Super Metroid, Turrican II, Shadow of the Beast and other masterpieces. Worth every penny and, please, do a sequel.
Date 2016-01-12 Playtime 16h 31m Rec Positive This game is dank, 420/420
Date 2016-01-12 Playtime 35h 46m Rec Positive Очень интересная игра. Большой открытый мир, много секреток. Сюжет имеет некоторую интригу. Управление отзывчивое, персонаж чувствуется хорошо. Я проходил с клавиатуры - играть было удобно. Сложность в игре на трудном уровне сложности - приемлемая. Наибольший интерес тут именно в исследовании мира, поиска путей для открывания закрытых зон. Моё время прохождения ~20 часов, но я не смог открыть все секретки. В общем то, я очень рекомендую эту игру, если вам нравится процесс иследования и игры бродилки.
Date 2016-01-12 Playtime 15h 39m Rec Positive Considering everything in this game was crafted by one person, I'm entirely blown away at the end result. I would have thought this is the product of an entire studio with multiple developers. Masterclass game design in every facet of Axiom Verge, if you have even a pang of interest in retro gaming (forget the genre), you need to play this.
Date 2016-01-11 Playtime 22h 12m Rec Positive I can't recommend this game enough. It draws heavy inspiration from Metroid, but it goes in its own direction with unique upgrades and weapons that give the game its own personality. The story is interesting and unpredictable, but it was a tad hard to follow for me. The thing I loved is that the guns are all different and you use them all in different ways, but a gun is still a gun and there's no "this is the only gun to kill this specific boss" restriction.  I could go on and on, but the bottom line is if you enjoy Metroidvania games AT ALL, buy this immediately. This game is a solid 9.5/10. I couldn't stop playing and I was genuinely sad when it was over.
Date 2016-01-11 Playtime 10h 21m Rec Positive One of the first games to truly be as good or better as Super Metroid. It's a MetroidVania. It's good. One dude made it? Insane. Highly recommended. It's the kind of game that is so good that when you finish it, you wish it was longer, but also long enough that you are satisfied with the end result, as well.
Date 2016-01-11 Playtime 16h 7m Rec Positive Si te gustan los arcade y plataforma, esta pequeña referencia de metroid es para ti. Aunque no es un juego bastante largo su fuerte radica en su  trama profunda que sin duda te dejara pensando y con ganas de un poco mas. No entiendo mucho el sentido de una modalidad speed runner y como todo juego de plataforma despues de un tiempo se torna repetitivo, pero si eres de aquellos que gustan de conseguir el 100% de los logros del juego sin duda te mantendras entretenido. Diria que lo unico que me desagrado es su mecanica de "descubrir" la totalidad de los secretos que basicamente se basa en ir de pared en pared con la esperanza de que en alguna de ellas encuentres algun objetivo.
Date 2016-01-10 Playtime 7h 57m Rec Positive I just beat this game a few minutes ago and all I have to say that this game is awesome to play. If you are a Metroid fan you will extremely enjoy this game as much as I have because you get to explore an alien world for powerups and items to get to new areas. This game is challenging though and you will die alot, but this game is extremely hard to put down once you start playing it. So if you like playing Metroid or Metroid like games...then this is the game for you. Also if there is ever a 2nd game for Axiom Verge in the works..I look forward to playing it as well.
Date 2016-01-10 Playtime 15h 32m Rec Positive A fantastic game that harken back to the Metroidvania games.  As a huge fan of the Metroid franchise, expecially the 2D iterations, this game definitely captures the feel and atmosphere.  If you're looking for great gameplay, music, art style, and a decent challenge, I can't recommend Axion Verge enough.  Tom Happ.....don't stop making games.
Date 2016-01-10 Playtime 27h 29m Rec Positive Ich bin ein großer Fan der Metroid Reihe. So groß, dass Metroid die einzige Reihe ist, von der ich alle Titel besitze. So groß, dass ich mir erst Prime 3 und dann danach die Konsole zum spielen zugelegt habe. So groß, dass ich eine große Auswahl an selfmade Games aus der Fanbase durchgespielt habe und mich selbst daran versucht habe solch ein Spiel zu entwickeln.  Ich habe es aufgegeben, nicht so allerdings der Entwickler von Axiom Verge, Tom Happ. Er hat es, als alleiniger Entwickler, geschafft, ein Spiel zu entwickeln, dass sich mit Metroid messen kann. Zu Anfang fühlt es sich an wie Metroid. Ähnliche Grafiken, Ähnliche Gegner, Ähnliche Umgebung. Doch immer mehr offenbart Axiom Verge seine eigene, surreale, zerbrochene Welt. Auf den ersten Blick erkennt man Hürden, die man in einem Metroid durch Raketen oder den Morph Ball überwinden könnte. Doch trotz dass Axiom Verge sich mit seiner Welt, den Gegnern und der anfänglichen Spielmechanik von Metroid kaum unterscheidet, entwickelt dieses Spiel sehr schnell eine überraschend faszinierende Eigendynamik.  Wenn der Bohrer die Raketen ersetzt und eine Drone statt dem Morphball eingesetzt wird, dann ist das Axiom Verge. Doch Axiom Verge hat einige Besonderheiten zu bieten, die dieses Spiel selbst gegen den Meilenstein Metroid gewinnen lässt. Zuerst einmal die Story. Zwar ist die Story nicht Hauptteil des Spiels sondern nur sehr dezent verbaut, jedoch lässt sie mitfühlen und hilft sich in die surreale Welt einzufinden. Sie gibt dem Aufenthalt einen Grund und macht das Ziel des Spiels, Athetos aufzuhalten, deutlich. Man versucht nicht einfach nur weiter zu kommen, man versucht Athetos das Handwerk zu legen! Weiterhin bietet Axiom Verge in Zusammenhang mit der Story eine überraschende Spielmechanik, die ich so noch nicht gesehen habe. Hacking und Glitching. Monster hacken um ihre Hitboxen zu vergrößern oder sie harmlos zu machen, Glitches in der Welt hacken um Plattformen herzuzaubern, oder sich durch Wände glitchen um verborgene Orte zu erreichen. Das ist in Axiom Verge Alltag. Mit einer Waffe auf Monster zielen und sie dadurch hacken zu können ist in diesem Genre wirklich ein außergewöhnliches und vorallem auch interessantes Feature. Und wo ich schon bei Waffen bin: Axiom Verge ist voll davon. Ob die einfache Kanone, den Wärmesucher, die Feuerwand, die Blitz- oder die Laserwaffe, alle Waffen in Axiom Verge sind einzigartig gut gelungen. Noch interessanter wird es dadurch, dass jede Waffe für einen anderen Verwendungszweck gut ist. So gibt es Rätsel, die man nur durch die Benutzung der richtigen Waffe lösen kann. Insgesamt gibt es 24 verschiedene einzigartige Waffen. Doch nicht all diese Waffen lassen sich in der normalen Welt von Axiom Verge finden. Denn es gibt geheime Welten. Jeder Metroidfan wird jetzt an die vielen Geheimgänge in zahlreichen Metroid-Titeln denken, doch Axiom Verge geht noch einen Schritt weiter: neben den zahlreich versteckten Items und Wegen in Axiom Verge sind Geheimwelten eine eigene Art von Versteck. Man erkennt durch einen Röhreneffekt auf dem Bildschirm, dass man nah an einer geheimen Welt ist. Die Stellen mit solch einem Effekt zu finden ist schon schwer, jedoch in diese Welt hineinzugelangen oft noch mehr. In manchen Fällen geht das nur durch volle Ausrüstung und ordentliches herumgeglitche. Einfach im Internet nachsehen, wie das funktioniert? Denkste! Denn die Positionen der geheimen Welten sind quasi zufällig und deswegen bei jedem Spieler anders.  Neben der liebevoll gestalteten Welt und den vielen ausgeklügelten Game-Mechanics muss man vorallem auch den Soundtrack loben, da dieser wirklich Laune macht und selbst in Dauerschleife nicht langweilig wird. Ich empfehle, gerade für Chippunk-Fans, deswegen die Version mit Soundtrack. Es lohnt sich!  Das einzige, was ich bemängeln könnte ist, dass in den meisten Metroid Teilen etwas mehr Geheimverstecke sind in denen Man Powerups findet. Die Vielseitigkeit der Rätsel zu diesen Geheimverstecken fehlt mir ein bisschen.  Insgesamt ist Axiom Verge für mich wie ein Geschwister von Metroid, dass gelernt hat seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen ohne dabei seiner Familie untreu zu werden. Es fühlt sich anfangs an wie Metroid, doch es wird, meiner Meinung nach, immer besser, bis es, zumindest einige Metroid Teilie, im letzten Drittel knapp überholen kann. Es ist schon traurig, dass eine Person es schafft ein Spiel zu entwickeln, dass an die Qualität von Super Metroid anknüpfen kann, während das Original sich durch "Federation Force" in eine derart kindliche Umgebung begibt, dass man sich als Fan der Serie darüber schämen muss. Andererseits ist es erfreulich, dass ein Entwickler versteht, was die Fans des Genres wollen und es schafft eine bessere Qualität als das Original abzuliefern. Vielen Dank Tom Happ!
Date 2016-01-10 Playtime 32h 9m Rec Positive if you grew up playing on an NES or an SNES, then this game will be a glimpse into the past for you. eloquently capturing so many elements form so many classic games, and making it into one seamless playthough. i highly recommend this game.
Date 2016-01-10 Playtime 22h 9m Rec Positive i wish I was dead please kill me in real life
Date 2016-01-10 Playtime 1h 27m Rec Positive Fairly competent Super Metroid rip-off, with the story premise from Another World, but not as good. It's OK...  All of the artwork and mechanics are solid, but it's nothing new. It all comes across as painfully mediocre, despite the talent, time and effort that obviously went into the game. The inclusion of NES-style memory corruption is a nice touch. The music doesn't loop though and that is an unforgivable offence.  If you want a game that's a lot like Super Metroid, then I would recommend Axiom Verge, but buy it on sale.
Date 2016-01-10 Playtime 47h 36m Rec Positive The story themes, game-play, level design, visuals and sound all come together masterfully.  This is not another 'run of the mill' entry in the genre; this game certainly scratches a familiar itch for some, but it is an amazing work that can easily stand on its own.
Date 2016-01-10 Playtime 4h 4m Rec Positive No hagais caso a las horas, en desconectado no las cuenta. Otro MetroidVania, pero este, sin embargo, es más Metroid que Vania, siendo directamente el sucesor espiritual de los primeros Metroids. Con una estética retro de títulos como Metroid Fusion de Gba, es perfecto para las personas con nostalgia del plataformeo retro. Juego que además, juega con Bugs y Glitches a posta, haciendo que estos sean una mecánica más del juego. Sin duda, un juego que se puede completar en menos de 13 horas y que os propondrá un reto. Incluso tiene una opción de Speedrun para los más valientes.
Date 2016-01-10 Playtime 7h 24m Rec Positive Fun game. Its like somewhere between metroid and super metroid in terms of gameplay and art style.  Story is ok, suffers from some sci-fi nonsensical tropes like timelines and dimensions etc.  Items in the game are fairly interesting, from guns that can alter the landscape, to armor that lets you teleport.  I do think they have way to many guns however. There are like 10 variations of the standard blaster, but only like 2-3 of them I ever found useful or felt required for certain bosses. I feel like the weapon selection is very convoluted.
Date 2016-01-10 Playtime 9h 54m Rec Positive So this game is pretty good. Lots of secrets, LOTS of weapons (holy crap there's like 20 of them) and items, a good metroid style game if i ever saw one. And man, metroid has needed some good games lately. Anywho, I got it on sale for around $14 bucks- i'd say the game is good enough to merit that price. It's very good indeed- though it's rather short... you could easily beat it in a day if you really tried (took me a few hours each of 3 days of very casual play to beat it). Only thing that it needs (imo) is something akin to space jump- because the method of getting up into high places (jump up, teleport up, fire drone, quickly deploy drone, swap places with drone) eventually started to get on my nerves. Indeed, there is so much stuff in this game that it's rather easy to mix up your fingers trying to do various manuevers.   It's still a good game though :)
Date 2016-01-10 Playtime 24h 13m Rec Positive [h1]Preamble[/h1] I always quite liked the 2D Metroid games for what they were trying to do, namely isolate the player character in a completely alien environment with a focus on non-linear exploration-oriented progression. But while I admired the franchise from a distance, a number of factors kept me from putting too much time into any of the games in person. The Metroid games always seemed far too cartoonishly colorful for me to get, for lack of a better word, immersed. The narrative, while compartmentalized, was always part of a bigger story; Super Metroid for the SNES started with a lengthy exposition dump that made me feel as though I'd missed out on a great adventure before booting up the game. By this point Samus Aran has built up some considerable baggage. Axiom Verge appeals to me because, for one thing, it's a stand-alone one-shot title that I can enjoy without worrying about previous installments. But that's far from its only appeal.  [h1]Art Direction[/h1] Axiom Verge, perhaps in homage to the classic NES titles it was inspired by, has a lot more black in its color palette. The environments feel darker, less vibrant than those in Super Metroid or Fusion, or the latest polygonal entries in the franchise. The H. R. Geiger factor is turned way up, both in regards to environments and boss design. Even with the darker color palette, the environments are quite varied and are complimented by their music. It felt like a genuine triumph when I finally left the claustraphobic cave system in Kur and saw the alien horizon of Sudra for the first time with the 'Cellular Skies' track playing in the background. The enemy design is similar to Metroid, with the exception of the bosses, which boast their own distinct personality.   [h1]Story[/h1] The story is initially told in a fairly minimalistic fashion: Trace is a scientist who ends up in an alien world due to an unforeseen accident during a lab experiment in his isolated mountainside facility.  Upon awakening, Trace is guided by an alien voice whose English is suspiciously reminiscent of badly translated game localizations of yore. Upon completing the tasks the voice demands of him, Trace is treated to some token exposition and the game continues. It's at around the halfway mark that there's a substantial paradigm-shifting plot twist. It's no exaggeration to say that I went from merely liking the minimalistic narrative to relishing it, becoming invested.   [h1]Gameplay[/h1] This is a solid Metroid-like, with player abilities that are similar, but at the same time quite different. No morph-ball? No problem, just fire off a headcrab-esque drone to investigate narrow crevices and interact with whatever's beyond. No space-jump? Some canny improvisation with the double jump, the grappling hook, the blink-coat and the drone will let you fill in unexplored areas of the map efficiently enough. The glitching mechanic allows you to alter enemy behaviors or get into otherwise inaccessible areas of the map. There's even an in-game code entry tool that lets you translate story documents, or enter secret areas using character sequences you find in the game, as well as to cheat, if you're so inclined. The player will quickly start recognizing enemies over time, and approach them in a way that best capitalizes on the behaviors and weaknesses of the adversary in question. It's best to unload on some enemies and kill them before they reach you; it's best to glitch others out so that they'll slow down, or spit health particles to refill your waning supplies. And so on. There are a fair number of secrets hidden all over the world that might give the player an edge. Most can be found with some reasoning, or with an eye out for inconsistencies in tile patterns. Others are more devious. One or two may require a guide.   All that said, there are some minor flaws to be found here. Oftentimes the game feels more responsive with the keyboard, especially in regards to using blink abilities, which is a shame since I much prefer using the controller for platformers like this. The grappling hook, while cool in concept, feels rather stiff and inconsistent in regards to jumping off a swing. I have an affinity for grappling hooks, but this one feels like it's obsolescent inside an hour after the player finds it.  There are more than twenty projectile weapons to be found all over Sudra. The vast majority of these are so over-specialized and situational that I'm hard-pressed to say I used them more than once. It feels like for most of the game Trace's best method of dealing with enemies is the Disruptor, which is the basic starting blaster, or the Kilver, which is a close-range, high-damage AOE weapon that can hit things through walls. They're simple, but they're reliable. It's a little disappointing that the rest of the weapons don't have as much utility.   [h1]Verdict[/h1] Despite the occasional shortcoming, I still consider Axiom Verge to be among my favorite indie games released in the past couple of years. This game has my hearty recommendation to any fan of 2D platformers.
Date 2016-01-10 Playtime 7h 57m Rec Positive It's like a pack of Metroid games had some children with a few issues of BLAME! Just play it.
Date 2016-01-09 Playtime 13h 55m Rec Positive Excellent Game, Everyone says Metroid-esque, but I sensed a little dash of NES Rygar in there. inspired me to ressurect my own side-projects.
Date 2016-01-09 Playtime 1h 58m Rec Negative i have like 6 hrs into the game  over priced and over rated boring,ugly game.AV could look cool if it had better resolution and better animations/effets. for me it was too slow paced and uninteresting to play and the minimap sux
Date 2016-01-09 Playtime 21h 24m Rec Positive I'm in love with this game. Its a work of art, both visualy and musically. The game play is smooth, crisp, responsive. The story line is intellectual and complete, and yet, there are enough missing breadcrumbs to leave the story open to interpretation.   While I'm a fan of Metroidvania games, I also was reminded strongly of the art direction from the Metal Slug franchise. The 2D animations of the bosses, especially, reminds me of that series.  Its perfect (although I do wish it was longer).
Date 2016-01-09 Playtime 14h 43m Rec Positive Axiom Verge - это игра в духе классики Metroid, но всем поклоникам данного жанра я ее рекомендовать не могу. Невыразительная даже на фоне других «пиксельных» работ графика и своеобразное музыкальное сопровождение являются наименее спорными составляющими проекта. Здесь необходимо обшаривать каждый закуток в надежде наткнуться на верный путь или апгрейд, а пара боссов вынуждает действовать с точностью до десятых долей миллиметра.  Все это представленно в качестве обязательного занятия и занимает немалую часть 15 часовой кампании.  Из хорошого присутсвует замечательная основа с разнообразными устройствами и стабильным пополнением их списка, прыжками, увлекательными сражениями и схватками с огромными созданиями. Итог:  + Интересная история с элементами научной фантастики Много разнообразных приспособлений Грамотное сочетание всех важных для жанра составляющих Масса секретов Напряженные битвы с боссами, пускай и с перегибами в финальной части - Невзрачные декорации (даже по меркам «пиксельных» проектов) и смехотворный внешний вид некоторых врагов Игра периодически оборачивается утомительным поиском единственно верного маршрута Резкий скачок сложности в завершающей части кампании  Мой вердикт 8 из 10 .
Date 2016-01-09 Playtime 13h 12m Rec Positive They weren't lying when they said this was like Metroid.  It's probably the most "Metroid'ish" of any Metroidvania games I've played, and it's pretty cool in that regard, wasn't too sure what to expect but it is/was pretty awesome gameplay wise, not to mention the soundtrack was pretty great as well.
Date 2016-01-09 Playtime 37h 3m Rec Positive Es ist eben ein 2D Spiel im Metroidvaniastil. Man kann eine große Sammlung an Waffen und Werkzeugen finden, die alle mehr oder weniger effektiv sind. Die Geschichte hinter dem Spiel ist nicht bemerkenswert tief aber hat mich doch in den Bann gezogen und einen überraschenden Twist am Ende erfahren.  Die Bosse sind nicht zu schwer und für meinen Geschmack sogar ein bisschen zu einfach. Sie haben alle ein gewisses Pattern dem sie folgen, wobei man bei manchen ziemlich reaktiv sein muss und bei anderen es einfach reicht sich in eine Ecke zu setzen und Dauerfeuer zu geben.  Es gibt einen Hardmode und sogar ein Speedrunmodus. Beide werden noch gespielt. Alles in allem ein Spiel, dass ich sehr genossen habe zu spielen. 8/10 
Date 2016-01-08 Playtime 17h 11m Rec Positive Hay un rayo que dispara uñas giratorias que después de recorrer un pequeño tramo en la dirección de disparo vuelven hacia atrás. Es lo mejor que he jugado en años/10
Date 2016-01-08 Playtime 26h 1m Rec Positive Do you like the 2D Metroid games? Are you absolutely starved for more?  Then look no further then Axiom Verge, the best non-Metroid Metroid game is right here.
Date 2016-01-08 Playtime 22h 43m Rec Positive It might not be the most technically impressive release of last year (although it's stupidly amazing and well realised) but it's possibly the most fun I had playing games last year. A+ BUY.
Date 2016-01-08 Playtime 12h 17m Rec Positive Excellent Metroid-like, si ce n'est un des meilleurs disponible actuellement.  Je ne vais pas répeter les poins posififs qui ont été cités par les différents test (musique, gameplay...), mais le jeu vaut vraiment le coup. L'ambiance est géniale, le scénario, bien que discret est intéressant, beaucoup de secrets à découvrir et une excellente durée de vie (minimum 10 heures de jeu sur la première run).  Le seul défaut selon moi est le dernier boss de jeu qui est complétement raté, ne demande aucune stratégie pour être battu si ce n'est du bourrinage intensif, et qui gâche un peu le bilan général très positif.  A acheter les yeux fermés.
Date 2016-01-08 Playtime 20h 38m Rec Positive [i]WARNING: Make sure you have a Xinput gamepad or a Dualshock 4 before buying.[/i]  [b]Great game.[/b] Rips off Super Metroid shamelessly, but is not as tight design-wise, which, in the end, makes Axiom Verge it's own thing. Still, it's the closer any game has ever got to Super Metroid. Metroid Fusion is less Super-like than Axiom Verge. (I'll confess I can't compare with Zero Mission, because it's been too long since I last played it.) A clone with it's own thing - yes, it's kinda paradoxical. It's like a fan-made spiritual successor, albeit the fan is a professional programmer/designer/artist/composer/nerd-god-among-us and Axiom Verge is his  spare time project, or so I heard.  [h1]Pros:[/h1] * The closer you'll get to Super Metroid, my favorite game ever. * Design: cool retro aesthetics, sometimes going even to monocromatic or CGA-like palette. HR Giger and Cronenberg-inspired biomechanical design. Also, glitch art relating to reality bending mechanics. * Some huge bosses. The screen zooms out so you can see the whole monster and his room! * You can use a PS4 controller right of the bat it you want. I don't have one, but if you do, good for you. A 360 one will do too. * Huge array of weapons. Most of them have a clear trade-off. The ones that cover wider area are weaker. Some have very specific uses. Most of the time, I used an electric bolt more akin to a melee weapon than a projectile, very strong albeit very short ranged, but hits across walls and floors. Another cool weapon is an electric beam that homes into the enemy, but it's not effective with some enemies. * Very cool mobility mechanics! See those narrow tunnels? Think you'll get a morph ball upgrade?  No, you'll control a spider drone to explore and gather itens! Later on, you'll be able to teleport into the drone's position. You'll also be able to teleport to the other side of walls and later on, you'll have a multidirectional teleporting dash! So maybe you want to reach a distant platform? How about jumping, teleporting up at the apex, then blasting the drone's egg, hatch the egg, teleport into the drone's position, teleport dash again and voilá: there is your platform! Maybe you're a grappling hook person? You're covered too! Go as Cronenberg-Bionic Commando as you like, Rick!  * Glitch your enemies away! Adress disruptor will turn your enemies into those things that used to appear on your screen when you banged your cartridge while your system was on. Their AI will change too in different ways. Some will become slower, others will alter their motion, some will turn against other enemies, some will turn into platforms and a specific kind will even become controllable via player input. There may be trade-offs, as enemies may become slower, but gain a special attack. Some walls and platforms can also be glitched-deglitched so to allow your way. * Great music! Very sci-fi-like electronica. Chiptune square sound waves mixed with traditional trance-like sounds. Listen to Famicom/NES's square wave being modulated into distortion! * Although I've seen a reviewer claiming he got stuck for 2 or 3 hours, I've breezed through the entire game in far less than a week. Granted, sometimes I didn't know what I was supposed to do, but I did it anyway (It's a Metroid clone - you go everywhere you can and look for anything you can. What's the secret?). No guides used. Only clue I got from somewhere else was a spoiler in that said video review - thanks Super Bunnyhop... Good thing it was nothing major, not getting that would not hinder my game. Also, I cannot understand why some people complain about difficulty. This game, at least in normal mode, is not hard at all! I'm impressed how quick I've beaten it. * Although the design is not as supertight as Super Metroid's, this gives Axiom Verge it's own twists. As you'll not be as efficient as Samus doging a barrage of bullets, you'll find yourself hiding a lot and exploiting enemie's AI's inefficiencies, like when it traps itself in a corner. But that exploit adds to the sense of strategy. Knowing how enemies behave is essential to come up with ways to defeat them or at least to run away from them. * Fun.  [h1]Cons:[/h1] * Shameless Super Metroid rip-off. Wait - wasn't this one a pro? Oh yeah, right. Next one, please. * Although it says "Full controller support", it's limited to 360 and PS4. Got a PS2 one and plan to use X360ce on this game? Too bad, it won't happen! You gotta have a Xinput controller or a Dualshock 4. SCPToolkit (Windows only) will do the trick for Dualshock 3. Google it and give it a try if you need it, it's worth it. * The story is very difficult to grasp! While Super Metroid told its tale through game mechanics, Axiom Verge will explain the backstory of everything through dialogue and notes. Not a bad thing per se and Metroid Fusion already got that approach before, so it's not new either. But this one is made from the start to twist your brain! If you have the patience, by the end you'll make sense of all the nonsense, but it's too convoluted to be for everyone. It's nothing you'd not have seen in Moffat-era Doctor Who before, but that alone says something. * Although weapons variety is cool, most of them will not be used. I was surprised to realize how many times the best approach was to use the default weapon. * Although bosses' visual designs are cool, some of them have uninteresting AI. There is one in particular which I killed just by mashing fire as I realized all I had to do was beating his fire frequency (gunfight until one of us dies first). * Sometimes you gain access to a new part of the map, dig your way into a hole, only to realize your reward was not an upgrade, but a backstory note. And sometimes you won't even be able to translate the alien language. Said backstory notes should be located only in areas you have to traverse anyway, not in detours where your sole purpose is the note. * I sometimes wished the combat was tighter and being a bullet-sponge was less of a successful strategy - maybe you should try hard mode if that's your concern too, but beware: the said bullet-sponge strategy becomes a legit strategy on two or three later bosses - the last boss, specifically, is all about how much damage you can take and how much you can recover before depleting your health. Health is no rare commodity in normal mode but, in hard mode, that changes. Bullet count goes the other way around, so choose wiselly when to soak yourself in bullets. * I wish it was longer, but I can't have everything I want, can I? As a one-man-made game, you would expect a lot less.  Summarizing, a great game, not a perfect one, but no game is. It's a Metroid ripoff and knows it well, and yet it presents cool new ideas. Just make sure you have the right type of gamepad or you don't mind using your keyboard.  10/10 - Would Cronenberg it again.
Date 2016-01-08 Playtime 12h 5m Rec Positive Felt like the days I would play on my Gameboy Color or Gameboy Advance playing Metroid games. We need more games like this.
Date 2016-01-07 Playtime 0h 8m Rec Positive Old memories of Super Metroid came instantly and it felt great!
Date 2016-01-07 Playtime 6h 17m Rec Positive Yep. It's a Metroidvania. This really reminds me of Super Metroid in a lot of ways, and that's not a bad thing. I really don't have much more to add at this point.
Date 2016-01-07 Playtime 53h 32m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is probably one of the most refreshing retro style games I have played in a long time.
Date 2016-01-07 Playtime 10h 20m Rec Positive Another great metroidvania style indie platformer. The fantastic retro visuals build a lovely and eerie sci-fi world that is very H.R. Giger. The story, for what's there, is interesting, but you won't be playing Axiom Verge for it. What you will find is tight controls, cool weapons, awesome looking (though easy on normal difficulty) bosses, and level design that will push you to find each and every secret and crevice in the map.
Date 2016-01-07 Playtime 12h 38m Rec Positive Good metroidvania. It has some issues with the upgrades: you find too many and you use only few often. The artyle is amazing, really fits the classic metroid with some metallic-Gigerish touch, it doesn't really vary too much though. Level design wise it's good, with some zones better than others, bare in mind there's no fast travel, you will find some other way to move fast through zones but it will not be instant. The music and the atmosphere are great, the combat and platforming are pretty solid.
Date 2016-01-07 Playtime 50h 41m Rec Positive This game is an obvious tribute to the sidescrolling Metroid games that many of us grew up with and anyone who's a Metroid fan will absolutely love it. A lot of indie games try to invoke nostalgia and fail pretty hard but this one gets it.  By the way, if you're a completionist be prepared for a LOT of backtracking.
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 19h 39m Rec Positive Playing this game gives me flashbacks to the excellent Turrican games for the Amiga and the Metroid games. Excellent playability, interesting story, perfect balance and an insane amount of weapons and power-ups makes for hours of fun.
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 40h 56m Rec Positive good movement, good bosses, a tiny bit of thumb torture, dope story and cheeky hidden stuff!
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 39h 46m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a well done Metroidvania experience, granting you access to a large variety of weapons, powerups, and collectibles.  The game's story is rather interesting, you have to piece together the bits and pieces of why you woke up in this strange place.  Overall the experience is solid, though I had a few issues that mainly plague Metroidvania games, such as some collectibles being so well hidden that you will never find them unless you rub your butt against every wall you find.   The biggest flaw I would have to say is the map, it's very minimal and often lacks important information.  Such as where you saw a powerup at.  You have to manually place reminders that you cannot define.  So say you find a place that you need to jump really high to.  Then you have an area where you have to squeeze through.  Both reminders take the same form in the form of a number.  This means you cannot really tell what the reminder is for until you go back and remember again, which can lead to a lot of pointless backtracking when you get a new powerup and find it's the wrong one.  Doors are not clearly defined either, so in certain areas that have an interface screw angle it can be hard to read your minimap because you can't distinguish the white from the slightly whiter white.  Also to deal with backtracking is that there is no way to "reveal" breakable blocks or hidden walls without rubbing your aforementioned but on them.  You later on get bomb weapons, but they are not only unable to break the blocks, but unlike the Metroid games do not reveal the block type.   Aside from the pixel hunt angle, it's a good game.  If you're not the kind of person who strives for 100% completion without relying on guides then I'd recommend this game for you.
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 20h 46m Rec Positive Super awesome.  Lots of fun and cool secrets.
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 18h 17m Rec Positive An amazing Metroid clone with the right balance of exploration, combat, interesting upgrades, and story.
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 32h 8m Rec Positive Отличный представитель своего жанра. С первого взглдяда все выглядет шикарно: графика, антураж, геймплей. Но заблуждение проходит после втогого часа игры, начинаешь один за другим находить косяки и недодумки в разработке. Для начала в глаза бросается не самый оригинальный дизайн уровней, местами абсолютно однотипный. Один из самых жутких недостатков- это карта, и ее функционал. Все столь минималистично и лаконично, что порой приходится подолгу думать- в какой из участков уровня тебе надо, двери открываемые разными способами помечены одинаково. Но самое жуткое, что нет возможности быстрого перемещения в точках сохранения, и открыв очередную плюшку ты несешься через три локации дабы ее опробовать. Борьба с боссами сводится к поиску тактики уничтожения, т.е. никакого реального челенжа они не предоставляют, а скорее напоминают обычные головоломки  в стиле RE. НО ворох этих косяков уравновешивает этот жутковатый сеттинг, местами пугающая музыка, и то, что зовется атмосферой- оно здесь присутствует однозначно. Стоит отметить оригинальность сей задумки с биомеханическим миром, оружием и т.д. В лучшем духе Contra: Hard Corps. Советую!
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 12h 49m Rec Positive best ever. buy it
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 8h 50m Rec Positive What if Metroid was a boy?
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 9h 39m Rec Positive This game will consume many hours of my life. I love this old school Metroid feel to it, and the game doesn't give you hints gotta figure it out yourself
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 16h 52m Rec Positive A love letter to the classic Metroid games. Huge map with 8 zones, and a handful of secret mini-zones. Lots of art inspiration from H.R. Geiger and H.P. Lovecraft, and as a result will give you flashbacks to Metroid. Tons of weapons and items, too.   Is it quite as good as the original Metroid games? Maybe not necessarily, but it's still a great game, with brilliant design. Especially for a game entirely by ONE person. ONE! Took the developer 5 years. To his credit, I think this was one of the top 5 games of 2015.  Great game, I highly recommend it.
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 2h 15m Rec Positive Dont let the graphics turn you.  This game is awesome, and so much more than I hoped it would be.
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 12h 13m Rec Positive Boss fights are poorly done. The last two bosses can litterally be beaten by standing in one spot jumping up and down and spaming your attack key. First two bosses glitched out for me and were as a result way too easy. The only difficult boss is the hornet boss but on one of my attempts of him he someone got one shot and the game autosaved so I had no way of having a real attempt at him. Despite the awful boss fights if you liked super metriod then you'll like this game. Lots of exploring and the map itself is like one giant puzzle. At the end of the day 7/10.
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 18h 55m Rec Positive As an avid fan of the Metroid series, I instantly fell in love with Axiom Verge. The game feels classic with all the material inspired by the Metroid series, yet it has its own creative twists. Several of the weapons and abilities (including the ability to glitch through walls) are incredibly fun and creative gameplay mechanics. The game certainly is not forgiving, but oh so fun. And the soundtrack is awesome
Date 2016-01-06 Playtime 20h 47m Rec Positive This game is worth the buy. Feels a lot like Super Metroid for the SNES, but it has its very own uniqueness to the game. Great game so far, a lot of running around, and this game doesn't babysit you throughout the whole game. It makes you have to run around aimlessly trying to find your next boss or power up. Congrats devs, you've won my appreciation to what I would call "An Indie Game".   10/10 for days.
Date 2016-01-05 Playtime 23h 21m Rec Positive I was initially quite hesitant to buy this game due to the pricetag, and the fact that it rarely went on sale, and when it did, it was not very heavily discounted, but I love the heck out of the Metroidvania style of game play. I was a fool to have waited so long.  This game is top notch. It's definitely more toward the Metroid end of the spectrum than Castlevania, and that's just fine. It's probably obvious from the screenshots, but I figured I'd clarify. And what a Metroid it is; this game looks, feels, and plays just like a console Metroid made in a huge studio with all kinds of money behind it, such that it's hard to believe that it's an indie game from just one guy.  Everything about it is excellent; sound, music, gameplay, controls, level design, bosses, enemies, etc. Everything. It has the 8-bit aestheitc nailed to the point where it looks like a late-period NES title, but it has tight controls, and feels more like Super Metroid, or perhaps Metroid Fusion.  Playing it feels just like Metroid, with massive maps to explore, riddled with secrets, and passages that interconnect each level at various points. The game has a built in mapping system very reminiscent of Super Metroid, with the handy addition of being able to set reminder points (two per zone), which is very super handy. I love that feature.  Bosses are screen-filling monstrosities that all have a "trick" to defeating them that can be approached in several ways, though it usually appears that there is a "correct" way to do it, and everything else is for low-completion challenge. Another thing I like is that there always seems to be a save point directly near the boss rooms, so you don't have to redo any large sections before retrying the boss fights, and the boss rooms themselves always have a room right before them with a very obvious and unique background so you don't accidentally stumble into it without saving.   Regular enemies are quite varied and all have their own fun tricks to use against the player, though most of the smaller ones all seem a little generic. There are enough weapons to pick from that there is often one that works best in any given situation, so dealing with them becomes more a matter of Megamanesque choosing the right tool for the job. Thankfully the weapon selection via right analog stick makes that a breeze.  Sound effects are good, and fit the 8-bit theme well, though I think I'd have preferred something more SNES-sounding. The music sets a completely different tone than the Metroid series as well; less moody, you-are-alone-against-an-entire-planet-of-things-out-to-kill-you, and more high-tech, bio-mechanical computers, and alternate dimensions.  I'm not finished the game yet, but I'm 9 hours in and I don't want to put it down. I recommend this game to anyone who likes the genre with no reservations at all. Least of all the cost.  Also: nominating for the Steam Awards "Whoa, duuuuude" award, because, whoa, duuuuuude.
Date 2016-01-05 Playtime 24h 4m Rec Positive Axiom brings back a lot of pleasant times spent with Metroid II and Super Metroid.
Date 2016-01-05 Playtime 24h 54m Rec Positive Fait par une seule personne un Metroidvania qui n'a rien a envier a ses inspiration. Très bien réalisé, supreant et immersif le coté "story mod" de ce jeu est intelligent. Très beau pourvu qu'on apprécie cette esthétique (ce qui est totallement mon cas). Propose ne bonne durée de vie entre 10 et 15 heures (voire 20 pour certains), ce jeu saura vous divertir et il le fait bien. Du challenge somme toute bien ballancé et un open world bien pensé. Laissez vous séduire il en vaut le coup!  Je recommande ce jeu. (d'urgence)
Date 2016-01-05 Playtime 4h 48m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a 16-bit style shooter/platformer game from another universe where Sega created a game to compete with Nintendo's Super Metroid: Similar in the general gameplay sense, yet with enough unique spins in all the right places to make this title feel like a fresh and fun game in this genre. Moves at a brisker pace than your typical metroid-vania, and features a wide array of unlockable powers for your signature gun that allows new ways to defend yourself from the sci-fi monstrosities that lurk in every room. Bosses are visually interesting and challenging, and the pace never slows down as you discover new areas at a steady clip. Not a revolution in the genre, but a great iteration that deserves attention.   
Date 2016-01-05 Playtime 14h 21m Rec Positive Two hours in, I already feel like Nintendo should wish they made this game.  It almost looks as though it would fit into the Metroid universe, but then they take away all of the mechanics you're anticpating as if they're expecting you at every turn. It may look like a game from 1992, yet it takes full advantage of modern control schema. Every pixel is placed with intent, and It is absolutely not stuck in the past.  Believe the hype. This is the sidescroller you're looking for.
Date 2016-01-05 Playtime 12h 2m Rec Positive A well designed Metroidvania with a kicking soundtrack.
Date 2016-01-05 Playtime 4h 24m Rec Positive Now you can pretend Other M never existed
Date 2016-01-05 Playtime 19h 5m Rec Positive Obra maestra sin mas.  1000000/10
Date 2016-01-04 Playtime 86h 4m Rec Positive Ever play Metroid?  This is basically the original Metroid (in style) with mostly 8-bit graphics (except for backgrounds) except:  -No morph ball or spinny jump (the game has many neat original weapons and items, which some cater to your own playstyle) -Cooler music than Metroid, (which rivals some modern styled games.) -You are a dude who is a scientist -The game is longer and more challenging -TONS more weapons (when I beat the game I did not even have them all, but I still had a ton) -TONS more secrets (some are hard to find, but isnt that the point of this kind of game) -More story (Metroid while awesome only had an introduction and an ending)  About the only gripe I have is that the Xbox 360 controller would think I pressed down twice in menus for some reason. It was not a game breaker, but in menus it was annoying.  If you like Metroid this game is a must have. Just starting out the muslic and everything feels like Metroid, even though it is still a totally different game.  I hope whoever made this game has a sequel in mind or another awesome game planned!
Date 2016-01-04 Playtime 13h 54m Rec Positive Начнём пожалуй. Axiom Verge. Без лишних слов я назову её шедевральной. Почему? Ну... давайте распишем некоторые плюсы. + Геймплей. Метроидвания, что это такое? Довольно специфичный жанр, не правда ли? С чем можно сравнить? Ну с основоположником данного термина, вселенной "Metroid", а именно Super Metroid. Игра хочет ровняться на неё. И у неё это получается. Это дейстительно "тот самый" Метроид (но конечно немного другой), где множество комнат и лабиринтов в твоём распоряжении. Всё зависит от тебя и путь выбираешь ты. Некоторые двери закрыты, но это лишь вопрос времени. Пополняя арсенал Трейса (нашего ГГ) игра постепенно откроет те места, где ты не мог раньше побывать. А он дейстительно большой. Начиная от дрели, заканчивая управляемым дроном. + Сюжет. Он довольно интересен. Не хочу, да и не буду спойлерить, просто скажу, что он хорош. + Атмосфера. И это его жирный плюс. Мне кажется именно атмосферой игра мне нереально доставила. Чуствется некоторая мрачность, обречённость этого мира... просто слов нет. Это сложно описать, надо почувствовать. + Музыка. И без того прекрасная атмосфера насыщается отличной музыкальной составляющей. Это просто космос. Чего только стоят "Vital Tide" и "Cellular Skies", которые идеально подходят под общую картину. Думаю, это только основные моменты. Мелочи сдесь можно перечислять довольно долго. А где-же минусы, спросите вы? Я ни разу не словил бага и не заскучал. Может быть слишком простая? Может быть чего-то не завезли? Ну хоть что-то? Нет. Игра настолько поглощает, что минусов я не увидел.  Так что-же такое Axiom Verge? Это шикарнейшая атмосферная игра, саундтреки которой я ещё буду слушать довольно долго, а геймплей и сюжет вспоминать не один раз. Игра вышла на русском!
Date 2016-01-04 Playtime 21h 42m Rec Positive Très bon metroid-like et bonne rejouabilité.
Date 2016-01-04 Playtime 57h 45m Rec Positive メトロイドの新作が出るのを長く待っているのに、リリースされるのはFPSだったり、ピンボールだったり、挙句の果てにサッカー（笑）だったりと絶望に打ちひしがれている私を救ってくれたのがこの作品。 アイテム入手ごとに広がる探索エリア、自由な攻略ルートに豊富な隠し通路とメトロイドの楽しさをしっかりと押さえていながら、敵やフィールドをハッキングして書き換ええていくオリジナルティ要素等もあり、ただのクローン作品で終わっていない。 タイムアタックモードも、クリア時間、アイテム100%収集時間、アイテム低取得数でクリアと3種類のモードがあるので、クリア後のやり込みにも熱が入る。 このアイテムを先に取得すれば、このアイテムは取らなくてもいいなとか攻略ルートを構築していくのが楽しい。初回プレイはクリアまで10時間以上かかってたのに今では40分台でクリアできるまでやり込んだ。方眼紙は偉大だ。  不満点を挙げるとすれば、アイテム取得時に独特のメロディーが無いｗ、使い道のない武器が多い、難易度ハードでも敵の攻撃パターンは同じというところ。 マップが広いわりにエリア移動手段が無いのが不満とレビューで挙げてる人が多いけど、私はタイムアタックをやりはじめると、ルート取りが重要になってくるので手軽にワープできないこの不便さがいいかなと思うようになったのであえて不満点としては挙げない。  また、特筆すべきはTom Happ氏が音楽やアートも含め、5年かけてたった一人で作り上げた点。その心意気だけで買い。
Date 2016-01-04 Playtime 14h 21m Rec Positive This is the best Metroidvania game I've ever played.
Date 2016-01-04 Playtime 6h 33m Rec Positive If you are looking for one of the best Metroidvania games on Steam, look no further.  Axiom Verge is a masterpiece.  While not without flaws, it is something special and amazing.  The two areas the game excels most at would be graphics and gameplay.  The graphics are different from your usual Metroidvania fair.  The world the game is set in looks distinctly alien and gives off an uneasy, almost nightmarish vibe.  Couple this with a very strong aesthetic.  The entire world looks like something out of H.R. Giger's nightmares and adds to the unsettling feel, while being both beautiful and impressive at the same time.  The game also does some amazing things with the graphical style, not only having Ninja Gaiden style cut scenes, but also some truly inspired moments of horror.  Gameplay wise, it uses some underutilized tools of exploration, ranging from telportation, drones, and drilling to altering the world itself and glitching or unglitching parts of it.  Other than that, the weapons, while not all useful, all have a distinct feel to them and are different from what we usually get, such as an electro mace, a volt shotgun, and a blast which explodes remotely.  Exploration is pretty cool all around.  Music wise, the music isn't memorable or ear wormy, but fits the dreary environment, adding to the otherworldly feel.  Now, the game does have a few problems.  There isn't a great way to fast travel and the back tracking can become tiresome.  Many of the weapons are unfeasible to actually fight bosses with so will go unused.  Secrets...the game has a huge number of secrets and doesn't always help you find them.  For example, I tried to find my way into a hidden passage, but the blocks you can enter look the same as the rest of the blocks.  It can get frustrating, though this does give it replayability as you can try and find everything or get help for a second playthrough.  Story is both a strong and a weak part of this game.  There is a story and it's pretty good, utilizing the game's engine and design to create some suitably effective and horrific moments, however a large portion of the story goes unexplained and overall, it is up to a large amount of speculation.  The game obfuscates story elements as well, leaving notes in other languages which need translation...it can get tiresome.  Despite the flaws, however, Axiom Verge is a master class work in Metroidvania with an aesthetic and design which is unique from its contemporaries and makes it stand as one of the best of the best.  Give it a playthrough...or three.
Date 2016-01-04 Playtime 20h 2m Rec Positive Was totally blown away by the reveal that Trance was...                    a man.
Date 2016-01-03 Playtime 2h 16m Rec Positive Axiom Verge est un excellent metroidvania. Un level design, une bande son et une ambiance de haute volée. Clairement l'un des meilleur jeu dans le genre depuis bien longtemps. Aussi bon que Super Metroid à pu l'être en son temps, bien qu'un peu moins difficile que ce dernier néanmoins
Date 2016-01-03 Playtime 20h 28m Rec Positive I dont need to say anything about this gae. Just get it and enjoy.
Date 2016-01-03 Playtime 16h 5m Rec Positive This is the most solid metroidvania game I've played in a long time. Great atmosphere, super solid controls, excellent action. Cannot recommend it highly enough.
Date 2016-01-03 Playtime 7h 19m Rec Negative Not bad, but definitely does not live up to the games it gets its inspiration from.  Inconsistent difficulty, boring powerups (except for one), the fast movement option is tedious to use (ain't no speed booster or morph ball), are just some of the issues that mar this title.  The entire game felt like I was no making little to no progress as far as gaining power.  The soundtrack became grating after about 2-3 hours in.  I feel this should be a $10 game.
Date 2016-01-03 Playtime 31h 7m Rec Positive One of the best games I played in 2015. Highly recommended.
Date 2016-01-03 Playtime 5h 49m Rec Positive Just two words - Epic & Marvelous. And fantastic OST. Waited for such game for years.
Date 2016-01-03 Playtime 2h 14m Rec Positive Very well done, good gameplay nice music excellent game.
Date 2016-01-03 Playtime 9h 0m Rec Positive 
Date 2016-01-03 Playtime 1h 24m Rec Positive I've only sunk an hour or so into the game, but I can already tell it's an amazing game.  If you're a Metroidvania fan, do yourself a favor and pick this up.  Tight controls, great retro graphics and sound effects, interesting array of weapons and power-ups, and sountrack/music to which I enjoy listening (normally I turn off the music for the majority of games I play, not this one though.)  I give it a perfect 5 out of 7.
Date 2016-01-03 Playtime 18h 0m Rec Positive Tom Happ does what Nintendon't.
Date 2016-01-03 Playtime 13h 11m Rec Positive I had so much fun with this game and will def be a replay for me! The fact was made by only one person music and all makes me love it even more. Brought back some old school type memories with alittle bit of unique things about it. Story mixed with the music had me intuned and couldnt stop playing till it was finished. Metroidvania type must have imo. Thank you Tom Happ your game is awesome!
Date 2016-01-03 Playtime 10h 49m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a great trip down the nostalgia lane for all ye metroidvania fans.  PROS:  + huge world to explore + game-altering tools and skills you acquire throughout the game + the mind-blowing, indirectly told, story + music(a double edged sword that one)  CONS:  - if you happen to get stuck in one of the areas, the muic might become a torture - easy to get lost and walk in circles - colour palettes in some arease will make your eyes bleed  This game proves that the metroidvania 8-bit subgenre is alive and kicking! Although personally I found AV to be an oustanding title, I think it's not for everyone. Strongly recommended for hardcore platformer fans and gamers with a weak spot for pixelated graphics, 8-bit soundtracks and a little touch of H. R. Giger's art.  "DEMON, ATHETOS SAY, KILL."
Date 2016-01-03 Playtime 13h 24m Rec Positive Note: Hours of playtime is inaccurate due to time played offline.  A friend got this for me as a holiday gift after it spent a long time on my wishlist. I'm really happy I own it, but wow should I have nabbed it sooner! The aesthetic is very Giger, lovingly depicted with some truly amazing art. The sound design in each area is haunting, yet also uplifting. It makes you want to see what's around the next corner, what next powerup you will get.  The map lets you mark two places of interest per "zone", so you can know to come back once you get powerups. As for the powerups...  They're AMAZING. You have a few standard ones, and your first gun is pretty standard, but there are over 10 guns, all of them giving you more options instead of simply being raw power. While Super Metroid's beam modes were neat and all, this enables smarter, more personalized, creative play. Like playing close ranged? That's there. Like standing back, using obstacles, etc? Adapt to the situation with more and more tools to deal with each situation!  The lore is also very interesting, showing you glimpses of an amazing culture, a ruined world, and hints of who and what you are. I don't want to spoil anything except to say that I was as curious to find more lore as I was to get more powerups and kick more booty.  If you like metroidvanias, especially if you enjoy the brand that is less rpg elements and more item based (and not for stat ups, though those exist!), this is for you.
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 13h 14m Rec Positive A pretty decent Metroid game that still manages to be different. Certainly worth what I paid for it. I still think I missed a lot on my first run though. Maybe I'll play it again soon.  [spoiler]I was sure the Rusalki would be the final bosses though. Maybe we'll get that in the sequel.[/spoiler]  
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 2h 39m Rec Positive É como se um grupo, fã da série Metroid (especialmente o Super Metroid), combinasse elementos desta com outros de Contra: Alien Wars e Contra: Hard Cops. Use um controle para voltar na época do Super Nintendo e mergulhar no que poderia ter sido a sequência definitiva da série Metroid! Ênfase para o excelente trabalho com a trilha sonora!
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 15h 3m Rec Positive As good as, if not better than, Super Metroid. I can give no higher praise.
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 1h 45m Rec Positive TL;DR - Probably the best MetroidVania game to come out in the last decade. I'll leave detailled descriptions of what the genre entails to other, wordier reviews, and will instead focus on what makes this game stand out among the crowd.  The artwork, music and atmosphere are sinister and fitting. This is a metroidvania that feels like HR Giger was on the design team, but all the more sexual elements of his designs were removed. Biomechanical structures, grating noises, reality becoming undone at the seams.   The story thus far has been enjoyable. The game mechanics are tight and slick, with an enjoyable "glitching reality" theme. This is not to say the game itself is glitchy - your abilities have the appearance of glitches but are carefully controlled in what can effect what. Under the hood, you are still obtaining an increasing arsenal of weapons and abilities to move around a map in pursuit of plot-nuggets and story-critical thingammijigs.  I don't see much point in numerical scores, but this was very good.
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 12h 44m Rec Positive This game is fantastic. Plays great, controls great and sounds beautifuly. I'd like to be able to zoom in on the map more, and have the map automatically mark spaces which are currently inaccessible (once I reach them), but other than that I can't find any things to complain. Marvelous.
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 10h 5m Rec Positive I've not had this much fun, since I was a kid playing metroid for the first time on the NES.  This game is invocking the same feelings when I played the original metroid.  Awe and wonder as you explore deeper into the world.  Feeling like a bigger bad ass with every upgrade and weapon you collect.  Having the odd but blissful soundtrack ringing in your head and knowing each stage by it's music.  I recommend going through this without knowing a thing about it.  It makes each milestone you do even more rewarding.  So far I'm a few hours in and loving it.  I'll update once finished.  But the weapons are bad ass and almost feels like cheating to be using such power.  The original puzzle mechanics are quite refreshing for a metroidvania game.  Also if you're lucky to find a hidden stage, the old monitor effect is quite neat too.  The weapon ideas are pretty new and awesome.  Along with the "tools" used in various ways, you can tell a lot of thought went into this.  Nintendo needs to throw this team some money and the green light to make us the 2D metroid we want and not this 3D garbage they have been putting out.
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 8h 14m Rec Negative I loved every part of Axiom Verge, but left unchanged and unsatisfied. The graphics are amazing, the music is great (along with the near death sound integration), the gameplay is good for what it is, and the story is surprisingly unique despite me thinking I knew exactly how it was going to play out. However, throughout playing I just felt this sense of generic-ness, this feeling I had done it all before. Yes, obviously this is a metroid spin off, but even above that, I just felt like there was nothing new for me to discover. Sure there are secret weapons, hidden worlds, life and damage powerups for you to find in every nook and cranny- but I am talking about the life behind the game's eyes, it just felt like there was no originality or drive there for me to continue playing. Furthermore, I found the enemy design annoying at best, most of the weapons useless but novel (I think I only used 3 for more than 5 seconds despite collecting 8 or 9), the backtracking tedious, and the price too high for what I got. In short, I had fun while playing but left disappointed and just overall very static on how I felt while playing the game.  Maybe I am looking for the wrong game out of this? To compare with another metroid clone released recently, I loved Environmental Station Alpha. But ESA is even more of a carbon copy clone of metroid, with much less interesting weapon and powerup progression. But the secrets were more engaging, the bosses harder, and overall it just felt like more of an immersive experience. Axiom Verge is constructed ten times better than ESA in almost every department however it just feels lifeless in comparison to me. I was not nearly as hooked or addicted, although I did beat the game in 2 sittings (but mostly because the game was pretty short and I'm a binge gamer).  I'm sure if you're looking for a new metroid game and have been waiting for a good spiritual successor for a long time, you will be satisfied and enjoy Axiom Verge. I'm also sure that if you just love any metroid/vania that is out there as long as it has a decent production value, you'll also enjoy Axiom Verge. I guess I just went into it expecting to be blown away, and left with a mostly forgettable experience besides the art and music. Based on personal experience alone, I do not recommend this game at it's asking price.  EDIT: Reading other's reviews, I immediately realized what I was trying to say but couldn't put it into words: The exploration was just not fun. I felt like I was going through the motions despite the game going "Look, you can explore all this stuff over here!" and never felt "smart" or "engaged" whenever I found a secret. The one secret world I found was drilling randomly into a wall, and the multiple pickups I found were just mainly backtracking to previous areas that had a non-hidden powerup behind a progress locked (literal key or powerup you get later in the game) gate to get a 1/6 heart piece that requires you to get 5 other pieces to get your health up a pip. The weapons you get are worthless usually as previously stated, so other than cool animations or some ridiculously niche usage, there is really no point to explore past some lore you might be interested in.
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 13h 23m Rec Positive Awesome game. Good gameplay, cool maps, lots of weapons, and polished to a tee. If you like Metroidvania at all, you will like this.
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 10h 42m Rec Positive THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS GAME IS THAT IT NEEDS A PREQUEL!!!
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 10h 56m Rec Positive A good little game that is very clearly inspired by Super metroid but does enough of its own thing to stand on it's own. It has very intersting weapons and enviroments, a great sound track, and a merely servicable story. Beat it in about 11 hours in one sitting, and happy with the time and money I spent on it.
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 17h 49m Rec Positive Super Metroid 2015. Real good.
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 13h 47m Rec Positive A better Metroid than any of the actual Metroids.
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 10h 51m Rec Positive Good game with alot of replay ability if you're the sort that likes to find secrets. worth a shot if your looking to play a metorid like game.
Date 2016-01-02 Playtime 1h 17m Rec Positive Ich weiß gar nicht, welcher Depp dieses Spiel mit Metroid verglichen hat! Das geht gar nicht! Es IST Metroid. FÜR PC! Also kauft euch das, damit ihr ein Stück Videospielgeschichte erlebt!  Und nun zum Rest des Tages: Die Grafik präsentier sich ine inem wunderschön gezeichneten Pixellook, welche untermalt wird von biepiegen "irgendwas"-Bit Melodien. DIese sehr passenden Tönen, ziehen von den Boxen in das Ohr hinauf und hinterlassen dort einen Beat, welcher Eindruck hinterlässt. Zwischenzeitlich ist mit Kombinationsaufgaben sowie Wegfindungen zu rechnen. Vor allem letzteres wird aber gut unterstützt durch die vorhandene Karte, welche einem schön zeigt, wo noch Durchgänge sind. Kombinationsaufgaben beschränken sich auf den richtigen Einsatz von erworbenen Fähigkeiten, was aber für ein 100% nicht zu unterschätzen ist.  Einzig die Karte lässt eine Anzeige von vorhandenen Upgrades in einem Raum vermissen. Aber man will es ja nicht zu einfach haben.  Alles in allem ist die Aussicht auf einen unterhaltsamen Spaß für einige Stunden hiermit gegeben. Wir bedanken uns und wünschen ihnen noch einen Schönen Tag.
Date 2016-01-01 Playtime 9h 10m Rec Positive Wenn man ein Fan der alten 2D-Abenteuer von Samus Aran aus der Metroid-Reihe ist, wird man mit Axiom Verge sehr viel Spaß haben. Denn nicht nur die klaustrophobische, isolierte Atmosphäre von Axiom Verge kann man mit dieser Reihe vergleichen, auch das Gameplay erinnert sehr stark an Metroid. Allerdings bietet Axiom Verge auch sehr viele Elemente, die es zu einem eigenständiges Spiel und nicht zu einer einfallslosen Kopie machen. Denn gerade die Geschichte von Axiom Verge ist sehr gut gelungen und bietet auch ein paar überraschende Wendungen. Auch die Steuerung ist sowohl mit Maus und Tastatur, als auch mit Gamepad sehr responsive und genau. Allerdings ist die Fähigkeit, die an den Grapple-Beam von Super Metroid angelehnt ist, etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig und erfordert etwas Zeit, um sie zu meistern. Dieses Spiel ist sowohl für Fans der Metroid-Spiele, als auch für diejenigen geeignet, welche besagte Spiele bis jetzt verpasst haben.
Date 2016-01-01 Playtime 15h 17m Rec Positive A fantastic game that not only strokes your nostalgia, but also works toward the meta-narrative of your nostalgia - co-opting more of the sentiment of 80s gaming than merely using beautiful pixel art. Excellent score, a solid back story and interesting visual homages to many of the things that actually inspired 80s gaming wrapped around satisfying Metroidvania action. A production that, for me, is not only a source of nostalgia but something I will be yearning for a sequel to for years and feeling nostalgia toward a decade from now on its own satisfying merits.
Date 2016-01-01 Playtime 22h 5m Rec Positive The game is good. Don't get me wrong, I actualy came home from work and wanted to play it. But it's not worth $20.00 or more. It's basically Metroid, but the 2015 version. Built by a single guy, it's tremendously well done. Audio, character movement, controls and concept are well done.   I finished the game in 17 hourswith 67% item completion. There are other weapons but searching the map for them would have been annoying. I enjoyed the boss battles. Really wish there had been more to it though. A little RPG element, or a longer end-game.   Felt like there was story missing. But hey, for the work put in, I'm happy to support the dev and I'd buy a sequel on sale.
Date 2016-01-01 Playtime 25h 21m Rec Positive Hmmm i was trying to find anything in this game that i would like to add... found nothing except that i would love to play more and more and more ... waiting for part 2 ... 10/10 just totally worth the money
Date 2016-01-01 Playtime 16h 27m Rec Positive Buy it.
Date 2016-01-01 Playtime 33h 55m Rec Positive One man project?!? WTF This has the be the best game I've played since Super Metroid, and I'm 19 so screw nostalgia.  GET IT QUICK
Date 2016-01-01 Playtime 11h 52m Rec Positive It's like Makoto Kano, H.R. Geiger and Harlan Ellison got together and made a world, then gave it to an indie dev while simultaneously saying "show it some love!"  Axiom Verge is simple in concept, but the execution is masterful. The art is gorgeous, the music is extremely good (Kur's theme blows me away and creeps me out at the same time), and the gameplay is tight. Jumping and shooting feel slick, and the motion of the game just flows nicely.  Come for the gameplay and music, but stay for the strange, machine world and the giant robot head!
Date 2016-01-01 Playtime 10h 42m Rec Positive Absolutely terrific.
Date 2016-01-01 Playtime 2h 26m Rec Positive Prefer over Metroid
Date 2016-01-01 Playtime 44h 33m Rec Positive I've enjoyed it.
Date 2015-12-31 Playtime 2h 43m Rec Positive 9.5/10 Why This Rating? Because If I Give It A 10/10 Then There's No Room From Improvement..   But Nvm That..  This Game Is Awesome Reminds me of the old school days of Super metroid and castlevania sotn.. playing this game will give you a taste of what a metroidvania is... it just might make you go back and try Castlevania SOTN and Super Metroid.. and maybe many more..  I Could Go On And Explain My Thoughts On Other Parts Of The Game... But Why Spoil It... Go Experince Axiom Verge Your Self And Make Your Own Call...
Date 2015-12-31 Playtime 48h 31m Rec Positive Well, it took me 19 hours, but I 100% the game. 100% weapons, items, and the map... If you feel like playing a fun game, with alot to offer, you cant go wrong with Axiom Verge. I would recommend playing with a controller, playing on a keyboard can be fiddly at times.
Date 2015-12-31 Playtime 16h 46m Rec Positive 9/10 for me, peroid! This game plays great in many ways, tight controls, nice 16bit era gfx, simply amazing atmosphere and seriously one of the best soundtracks! Fans of Metroidvania games: Get this!  PS: Just one dude made this game.. ?
Date 2015-12-31 Playtime 7h 20m Rec Positive Reasonably high quality take on the Metroidvania genre. Not the best example of it, though. If you need a fix, you can't go wrong, but maybe you could go back and play Super Metroid too?  Tight gameplay, feels very natural with a controller in hand, though teleport-dash input is a glaring issue. It -really- needs to be bound to a button and not directional double-tap.   The corruption/glitch aesthetic is a nice twist and spices up the regular gameplay, changing enemies with your glitch ray and whatnot, but outside from that application it is dreadfully underutilized and never explored in any meaningful way other than to provide roadblocks and ability requirements.  Large but inconsistent weapon variety (some obviously strong, some nearly useless, many in between that are outshined by the more useful ones), visually impressive but weakly designed boss encounters, somewhat forgettable music. Graphics seem to be hit or miss on people, I found them a little lacking; aside from color there's few strong, consistent, eye-catching features of a given zone and everything is a bit bland and lacking flavor. But the outdoor environments were a little more pleasing.  Plot is, without question, completely overrated by the majority of reviews I've seen. It's adequate, but there is little build-up and almost no sense of drama or weight to the events. The ending -- even the true ending -- is a little disappointing, and feels like there was supposed to be more gameplay to follow it up and conclude things better.  I'm harshing on the game a bit here when the truth is that I enjoyed the time I put into it. It doesn't hold your hand or tell you where to go, letting you get immersed into exploring each zone at your leisure. The exploration and puzzles are done well and hit all the right buttons, though it has a habit of throwing a lot of branching paths at you that result in dead ends, forcing you to backtrack because you don't have a given ability. But that's an issue about the genre itself, isn't it?  I would like to give this game a negative rating, just to balance out the average a little and make it more representitive of the quality of the game, but... I get the feeling that's like yelling into a windstorm so nuts to it.  (I personally think the teleport dash is kickin' rad, more games need teleport dashes)
Date 2015-12-31 Playtime 15h 56m Rec Positive I'm a big fan of the Metroidvania type games.  While this game is definetly great in terms of powerup variety, I got somewhat tired of the game after awhile.  Mind, I definetly recommend this game if you are a fan games like Super Metroid or Metroid Prime, but in the end I was just happy to have completed the game.  I'd say buy it and play it at least once.
Date 2015-12-31 Playtime 19h 41m Rec Positive Metroid baby!
Date 2015-12-31 Playtime 24h 54m Rec Positive One of the best games I played in 2015, this is a solid Metroidvania whose only real problem is that there isn't a sequel. Great soundtrack, interesting weapon mechanics, a story if you're looking for it, and all of the map features a trace-your-steps simulator could ask for.
Date 2015-12-31 Playtime 24h 43m Rec Positive Muy buen juego inspirado en Metroid. Tiene un excelente diseño de arte, historia interesante, buena música (aunque hay en algunos momentos que llega a hartar); además de que tiene todo lo que uno esperaría encontrar, gran variedad de armas, habilidades, áreas secretas y un mapa bastante amplio por explorar, aunque tiene un problema que es el estar regresando a las mismas zonas a explorar cuando hayamos conseguido nuevas habilidades lo que puede llegar a resultar tedioso, pero esto es algo que presenta cualquier metroidvania.  Lo recomiendo ampliamente.   Mi calificación: 8/10
Date 2015-12-30 Playtime 8h 10m Rec Positive Now I loved Metroid Fusion and Zero Mission on the GBA. I've never had the chance to play Super Metroid (though I loved the Prime series (1st one is in my top 5 games of all time)) but I still have a grasp of why the Metroidvania games are so engrossing.  This is basically more GBA Metroid but with a new character, setting and super pretty magical HD effects to go with it.  Axiom Verge uses a fragmented narrative. You're not going to get much explained to you and even less if you don't find a way to actually decode the bits you do find. There is a real depth to it and the atmosphere is suitably creepy as it should be.  Now this game kicked my arse pretty hard. I got ruined by some of the later bosses and it wasn't until the ending screen told me why: I had missed over 60% of the weapons and powerups available to me by the end of the game. There is so much to explore and there are a ton of different weapon types that aren't even close to necessary but are still tons of fun to use because of the super solid feel of the game. If this game wasn't as tight as it is mechanically, I'd have likely given up about 3/4 of the way through because it would have stopped being fun.  This game was made by one dude which is what makes it all the more impressive. I'm definitely coming back to this at some point.
Date 2015-12-30 Playtime 15h 6m Rec Positive To me, metroidvanias present no nostalgic value, as in my childhood i played much more straightforward platformers. In fact, i've never actually played Metroid or Castlevania back then, so i've been introduced to the concept much later. I guess that proves that you don't have to be a hardcore Metroid fan to enjoy Axiom Verge.  There are three things that i loved about this game. Initially i've been lured in by its visual style, and it did not disappoint me. The colossal Giger-esque Rusalki are simply gorgeous, and overall, Axiom Verge looks just right for a dark sci-fi adventure. The second thing is level design - you can really feel all the effort put into it. Every labirynth on Sudra is polished to the limit, which makes for a relly satisfying exprerience. Finally, there's challenge. On Hard difficulty setting it's just enough to keep you going on and on, trying to find a perfect strategy to defeat another boss, or to finally gain access to that secret area you've encountered earlier.   My only minor complaint is that some of the weapons in the game are practically useless, since there's a lot of alternatives that are simply better. Other than that, it' really great. Go play it now.
Date 2015-12-30 Playtime 4h 24m Rec Positive This game is an incredible Metroidvania.  Somehow, it keeps you feeling weak and like an "ant crawling along the once great ruins" throughout the entire game. And also the powerups made this game feel "weird", in a way that sparked my curiosity as I played. Its an incredible game, and should be in the library of anyone who even remotely enjoys exploration.
Date 2015-12-30 Playtime 37h 9m Rec Positive The most sincere love letter to Metroid I've ever seen.  Highly recommended.
Date 2015-12-30 Playtime 28h 21m Rec Positive This game is pretty good a throw back to the old nes days
Date 2015-12-30 Playtime 4h 27m Rec Positive This game makes the near-death beeping sound sync up with the music and actually sound good.  10/10 that's all I really ever wanted.
Date 2015-12-30 Playtime 22h 26m Rec Positive On par with Super Metroid.
Date 2015-12-30 Playtime 0h 47m Rec Negative Too much NES Metroid, not enough Super Metroid. Going through hall after hall that all look the same with the same generic music without any fun new upgrades (the guns really aren't upgrades, just keys/side grades) just isn't enough to keep me motivated to play.
Date 2015-12-30 Playtime 24h 5m Rec Positive Where the fuck am I supposed to be going now?!: The video game.  If you're directionally challenged and have a poor memory like me you'll end up checking every corner of the map twice before you find where to advance the plot because this game doesn't do a good job of indicating where anything is. Hell, I think i spent more time scouring the map looking for the breadcrumbs of unexplored cooridoors than I did actually playing the game.
Date 2015-12-30 Playtime 19h 4m Rec Positive A must have metroid-vania
Date 2015-12-30 Playtime 36h 57m Rec Positive This is a super fun game! I recommend starting it on hard, as easy is simply too easy. It's a fun sidescroller that improved upon the classic NES metroid style. Highly recommended!
Date 2015-12-30 Playtime 33h 3m Rec Positive Awesome, one of the best games I've played in 2015 (subjectively the best because I'm a huge fan of metroidvania games). + The pace of the game is really good, you never feel like a powerup is useless like some other games that you use your new power just once.  +The level design and overall progression of the game is really good, you always feel like there's something new to be found around the corner. + I really dig the art style.  + Also, the mechanics are really tight and well done and the game is "juicy".  + Oh, the story/lore is actually pretty good too. I didn't really get the game for the story so I was surprised about it. Nothing groundbreaking that'll make you cry a river or something like that but it's good enough that you'll want to find the lore pieces and learn about it. The game just feels very cool and fun.  - My only complaint is with the soundtrack. It's good, don't get me wrong, but sometimes it can get a bit repetitive if you're like me and like to explore every corner. Also, I wish there was some kind of fast travel (I know there's that "thing" that helps you move through the areas but you still have to backtrack a lot so a waypoint system or something like that would be good) but that's just a personal thing, I guess, because I always explored the whole map as soon as I got a new upgrade and got bored of having to walk all the way.  Really I'm not very good writing reviews but to sum it up:  this is probably the best metroidvania on steam, no doubt.
Date 2015-12-30 Playtime 17h 39m Rec Positive If you love Super Metroid for SNES, you will love this game too.  
Date 2015-12-29 Playtime 96h 28m Rec Positive BELIEVE. THE. HYPE.  This dev should IMMEDIATELY be put in charge of the Metroid Franchise...  ELEVENTY MOTHERFUCKING BILLION/10  Also, The WII U Version Kicks ASS!
Date 2015-12-29 Playtime 51h 13m Rec Positive I used the Password "Justin Bailey" and got a naked Man. 11/10   ps. i like the reference :D
Date 2015-12-29 Playtime 14h 31m Rec Positive One of the best Metroidvania experiences you can get outside the Big N. Gorgeous art, outstanding music, solid gameplay, and a decent story... All by one person, no less...
Date 2015-12-29 Playtime 15h 8m Rec Positive Great Metroid-like game.   Pros:  + runs super smooth + controls are tight and have a very good feeling to it + fantastic OST + many many unique weapons and upgrades + pretty lenghty game at ca. 14 hours playtime + challenging gameplay and bossfights  Cons:  - I thought the story was uninteresting and bland - collectible documents are absolutley worthless - asking price is a little bit too much - pathfinding can be a little bit frustrating  I highly recommend this game if its lower in price. But for every Metroid fan this is a very cool game to enjoy from beginning to end.
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 13h 32m Rec Positive Old-school metroidvania, in essence. It's got an intrigueing story, although a lot of it is left to interpretation. Besides the main story line, there's plenty of notes hidden around the world that give additional insight to what is actually going on. The graphics are based on old NES style games and vary quite a lot in quality, with the Rusalki taking the prize. Concidering the self-imposed limitations they're absolutely stunning. The music has some really high quality tunes, though some are just plain annoying to listen to, and since it's a metroidvania game you'll be hearing each region's music quite a lot.   The mechanics are fairly straight-forward for the most part of the game. You run, jump and shoot. It gets old fast, but once you've gotten a fair chunk in to the game it starts to losen up with additional move sets, and nearing the end the flexibility in movement is quite fun. It never gets to Super Metroid levels of variety, but they've got some fun ideas that work well. As far as the weapons go (there's a lot of them), most of them range anywhere from highly situational to useless. The first few are more or less glorified keys to open locked doors.  The world is large, but it's deceptively linear. You can go to a lot of places, roaming around looking for secrets and whatnot, but the actual progression though the game is more or less straight. There are plenty of optional weapons and upgrades you can pick up whenever, but each essential item is required to get the next at every point.  It's a good game and I had fun roaming the world of Sudra. Wether it's a game for you depends mostly on if you like the old metroidvania games, since it's just that. There's some new ideas and angles, some of which work. Others not so much. Still worth a try if it's your cup of tea.
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 22h 22m Rec Positive Launched the game expected to play 10min then it was 2h later. The best inde metroidvania I played.
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 24h 36m Rec Positive Purchase this.  Be sure to get some nice, quality headphones or speakers, a good game pad, a comfortable chair and a few of your favorite snacks, because this game is going to take you on a journey.  I'm not being metaphorical.  This game will fill your ears with other-worldly sounds and your eyes with dancing colors, but most of all, your mind with a tale so engrossing, you will forget where you are and become lost in it for hours.  I'm going to be 38 soon.  I've played many a game in my day.  I own a ton of games spanning many platforms from many generations.   It takes a lot to hold my attention anymore.  I've probably invested thousands of hours into games like D1, 2 & 3.  Starcraft, Dune, Warcraft, C&C, Sim City ect.   Even though I grew up playing them, I don't play a lot of platformers anymore.  I lean towards rpg's, rts's and games like Bioshock.  However, Axiom Verge had a Sci-Fi look that appealed to me.  So I bought it without expecting to ever really finish it.  I just wanted a nice distraction.  Well I got much, much more out of this game than I ever expected.  Axiom Verge is a labor of love, and it shows in every facet of the game.  From gameplay mechanics, to the detailed sprite artwork to the absolutely incredible soundtrack throughout the game, it just feels so damned polished, it's a fantastic journey into the imagination.   It's mind blowing to think, one guy developed this title by himself over the course of five years.    There's just so much I could say about this games polish and presentation, but it's been said before.  So I'll just say this:  This is one of those games that will draw you in, and you will litterally miss it when it's over.  Just get it.
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 52h 25m Rec Positive Very satisfying Metroid-like. The action is exciting in the moment, and the discovery of the secrets hidden throughout kept dragging me in for more.
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 14h 12m Rec Positive A ver te cuento: A primera vista puede parecer una copia del Super Metroid , el cual se parece, pero no como muchos dicen. En Super Metroid abanzabas por un mapeado que te permitía supuestamente investigar, conforme ibas consiguiendo más items y powerups el personaje podía seguir abanzando así todoel juego, lo cual se traduce en un juego lineal camuflado en uno de exploración, Axiom Verge va por los mismos derroteros? Si y NO -SI se consiguen items, con dichos items abanzas y consigues otros y acedes a nuevas areas. -NO , ciertas zonas no serán obligatorias para la historia, dando la posivilidad al jugador de explorar y consguir muchas de las armas que hay en el juego (aqui algo negativo-->muchas no las utilizarás por inutilidad), fracmentos de la historia y hablando de la historia...  La HISTORIA, algo muy particular e interesante a partes iguales, cuenta la historia de un cientifico llamado Travis que por circunstancias que no mencionaré se ve en un planeta inospito , a partir de ahí se desenvuelve una historia sobre quien es el y el por que el esta allí, os aseguro que atrapa, teniendo algunas partes algo largas, pero el sprin final es sobresaliente.  Con respecto al apartado MUSICAL, casa muy bien con lo que cuenta, con algunos momentos verdaderamente inmersivos, es correcta, pero no sobresaliente.  La SENSACION DE JUEGO (kinestetica)  es muy  buena, es uno de sus mejores aparados, cada acción tiene gran sensacón de contacto lo cual lo hace mas inmersivo,  lo cual es un OKx2  Recomiendo? SI y TAL VEZ SI-> Has jugado a algún metroid , La-Mulana etc ? es buena elección  TAL VEZ-> No has jugado nunca a un Metroidvania? pues comenzad por el Metroid prime primero, asi os familiarizais un poco y descubrís un juego fantastico de paso ;]
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 19h 51m Rec Positive It's Great
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 12h 6m Rec Positive To be precisely, Axiom Verge is not a metroidvania game which usually adds the RPG elements(such as level-up system, skill-tree, etc.) and dilutes the enviornment puzzle solving. Axiom Verge IS the spiritual successor of Metroid.  + Focus on the exploration and puzzle solving  + Create its own puzzle solving formula which is not directly copied from Metroid series + Intense bosses battle + Tons of weapons that provide choices to fight enemies + One dev who finished all parts of this game  - Level art is not as pretty enough as other parts - An annoying double tap skill (Right now it can't be remapped to other button)  9/10
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 25h 34m Rec Positive Игра хорошая, музыка отличная, классная графика, здоровые боссы и фантастический сеттинг. Показалась правда местами несколько затянутой что ли. Карта не маленькая и во время ее обследования попадаются места, в которые пока невозможно попасть, потому как нет оружия/оборудования нужного. Проблема в том, что таких мест много и все их не запомнишь (поставить меток на карте можно всего то ли две, то ли четыре, не помню уже, проходил несколько месяцев назад). И вот наступает момент, когда просто не знаешь куда идти. И непонятно, то ли задумано так, то ли у тебя чего-то нехватает.
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 17h 5m Rec Positive Pretty good Super Metroid-like game.
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 16h 47m Rec Positive I believe that this game is second on my list of favorite games that I have played this year behind Fallout 4 (One of my favorite franchises).  I bought this game when it first came out and played 20 minutes of it.  About 6 months later for some reason I found myself starting a new game and playing it.  I am now 11 hours into the story and I am completely blown away.  I am huge on games stories.  Not only does this remind me of my childhood playing SNES but this game is so awesome.  The bosses are like none I have ever seen and just when you think you have the story figured out something else happens.  I have not beat the game yet (I believe I am about 65% done) but I will be playing it until I beat it!  Gameplay 10/10...gets really challenging especially if you did not find all of the weapons, although you can back track to get them. Story 10/10 Soundtrack 10/10  WOW  I hope the story leaves room for sequels!!
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 18h 42m Rec Positive OMG. This game is beyond rad.   I'm using a modified SNES controller on PC for this game. I'd recommend rebinding the directional keys for this game and using a program like JoyToKey in order to bind the gamepad to keyboard strokes. Since this game was made with an anolog stick controller in mind a normal 8way directional gamepad may not necessarily register the directional pad correctly at first.   The game is very atmospheric like Super Metroid. I don't think it is a clone I'd say it takes a winning gameplay mechanic of powerups and new weapons in order to open new areas. It's an action/adventure metroidvania platformer game with solid music as well. Another thing I like about this game is the reminder system for the map. That was a genius way of rewarding players for early exloration and terrain pounding with the drill :D.  -Tyler
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 85h 13m Rec Positive Best 13 bucks I have ever spent. Reminds me of metroid the old NES one...yea am that old :)  Anyway extremely happy with this game running on Manjaro 64 bit.
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 42h 9m Rec Positive 直说一下感受吧！ 非常容易卡关，而且全程几乎没有任何剧情上的提示。作为一个Metroidvania（类银河战士恶魔城）来讲，这种难度已经算相当繁琐了。如果你没弄明白游戏中一个【地图标记功能】的话，基本上每拿到一个道具就要重新跑一遍整个地图，才能保证尽量不漏拿某些道具。游戏有没有中文根本没关系，反正开发者都把剧情忘了（IGN说的）。文字和关卡基本上没联系，反正剧情对话又没有任何提示，无关痛痒。 所以买之前最好先思考自己是否真正有耐心去玩这类游戏，而不是到时候因为卡关带来的挫败感而白花冤枉钱。说实话，这游戏真的硬核。 如果说之前的《ORI》是杀死手残，《Axiom Verge》就是连脑细胞带手一起杀。这游戏真的太考验耐心了，即便你是一个恶魔城银河战士老手。 好吧，说了这么多缺点，也该从正面评价一下它了。  初次进入游戏的时候，就被这种非常浓的科幻风吸引住了。其实这还不是像银河战士那样的科技科幻，其实更像是赛博朋克的末世科技风格。故事也是从这之中开启的。游戏中场景也会让人内心产生很强孤独感。背景音乐也很迷幻，有一段音乐开场是一个女声在怪叫，中间还夹杂着不知是哪国语言的歌词，长时间听有点被洗脑的感觉，不过气氛渲染的非常棒。  然后就是操作了，相对于银河战士来讲，Axiom Verge的操作更灵活一些，因为分辨率的关系，每个房间的面积也更大，活动空间也更广阔。但同样的，也更容易在关卡中制造谜题和陷阱。  再说一下道具，枪械道具大多不影响关卡（除了第二把需要隔山打牛的枪），而能力道具才是重中之重。但能力道具又不像银河战士那么多，基本上每个道具都有它独一无二的作用，最最关键的是，你必须懂得组合使用这些道具。比如跳起向上释放【无人机】就是一个很关键的操作。中期我因为这个卡关好久。  【能力道具】 1.挖掘机：钻开可摧毁的墙壁。 2.扫描仪（乱翻译）：让某些组块像素化，可消除某些乱码的墙壁。可对抗敌人，初始是蓝色的，后期可升级为红色。有一个成就就是用这个干掉全部敌人。 3.冲锋衣：基础功能是穿过一格的墙，可以升级2次。第一次升级允许跳起来穿墙或向下穿墙，第二次升级后，可以穿透4格墙壁。这个算是后期跑酷主要道具了。 4.高跳：这个能力是在比较前期获得的，可以尽量跳过比较高的障碍。 5.无人机：放出一个无人机以穿越一些只有一格高度的地形。无人机的攻击可以击穿墙壁。无人机可以进行两次升级。第一次升级，你的无人机可以投放到更高、更远的地方。第二次升级，你可以再次按下无人机键来传送到自己的无人机处。后期通过这个、高跳和三级冲锋衣几乎能到达任何地方。 6：钩爪：可以吊在上方的墙上来回摆动，以到达一些无法过去的地方。需要注意的是，钩爪的运用需要练习，开始可能会非常不适应。 7：炸弹：应该算是比较后期的道具了，可以储存3发。用于炸开成片的乱码阻挡的区域。也可以将一屏幕的敌人都变形。  写的这么详细，只是想让准备玩或者正在查攻略的朋友能够大致了解游戏中的这些道具。当然我对于剧透的部分深表歉意。 总的来说，游戏流程很长，初次很难做到100%道具收集。总之先通关再说吧！  如果你对于玩此类游戏非常有信心并且还有足够耐心的话，非常推荐尝试。 
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 19h 7m Rec Positive This game is a solid Metroidvania. Tight controls, decent story and lots of fun movement abilities, weapons and secrets.  If you enjoy Metroidvanias then you should buy this game.
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 14h 2m Rec Negative Axiom Verge is another game for which I wish Steam had a neutral ranking.  I'd call the game "tentatively recommended...with many caveats".  Lacking such a rating category, I'll have to lean on the side of not recommending it.  My number one complaint about the game is that the secrets, of which there are many, are handled in far, far too archaic a manner.  Basically there are tons of blocks which appear solid but can be passed in one way or another; some are telegraphed visually, but many are not.  This makes upgrade/secret hunting an excruciatingly tedious process of trying your several wall bypassing abilities on nearly every wall in the game.  This isn't fun.  Upgrade hunting in Metroidvanias is rewarding when there's some hint or indication that you can come back and get something later - and you remember it and do so.  Stumbling into a hidden room because you exhaustively tried every ability on every wall in the adjoining area doesn't make you feel clever, it makes you feel like your time is being wasted by a developer who has no concept of fairness.  I finished the game with barely half of its available weapon arsenal, which I only realized upon consulting a guide after the fact.  Some were hidden so fiendishly that I'm surprised a developer would go so far out of their way to discourage the average player from getting to experience some of the more entertaining weapons that said developer surely put good effort into creating.  Even if you do find some of them, most can only be obtained so late in the game that you never really have much time to play with them anyway, which is a shame because they are all pretty interesting and fun to use.  Many details of game's story are similarly buried in hard to find journal entries, and from what I gather it seems like the developer is a bit too enamored with his grand designs there as well.  It's overly complex and too obfuscated for the passive manner in which its delivered and I once again can't understand the logic of putting all that effort into it, only to then hide it except from the most obsessive of players.  Now that being said -  you can ignore the secrets, ignore the story, play the game in a straightforward manner - and it manages to be a decent Metroidvania, although even then not without foibles. Primary among them is a type of dash ability obtained roughly half-way through the game.  This is activated by double tapping a movement direction which, when playing with an analog stick (an absolutely fine input method before that point) is often accidentally activated when you don't want it to, and annoying to pull off with appropriate timing when you do want to use it.  A button dedicated to the dash would have been preferable.  The tile based graphics are also a little too slavishly retro for my taste, to the extent that I'd even call the game ugly in parts, and on several occasions I had trouble distinguishing between foreground and background tiles.  In my defense, this is because there are places the sames tiles are actually used for both - which is another of the misleading methods by which paths to items are hidden.  The difficulty can range from infuriating to a breeze, completely dependent on what weapons you've found.  While the ease with which some bosses can be dispatched with optional weapons would be a good reason to encourage exploration - as a new player experiencing the game for the first time, you have no idea that these weapons are out there to be found.  Ultimately, I had some fun with the core game, but took no joy in the exploration and backtracking because of how things were hidden and that's pretty damning for a Metroidvania.  There are far better examples of the genre in recent memory.
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 10h 3m Rec Positive JUSTIN-BAILEY code for spandex Trace costume Pretty solid metroidvania, a bit short on the story but still great on its own right.
Date 2015-12-28 Playtime 16h 32m Rec Positive Very solid metroidvania, with some unique and nifty mechanics.  Took me about 16 hours to do a full playthrough on Normal.  Some deaths, but not punishingly hard.  Enjoyed it quite a bit.
Date 2015-12-27 Playtime 11h 35m Rec Positive Great game! Gets a lot of influence from the Metroid series without actually being Metroid. This is not a clone. You run, jump, shoot, backtrack, find upgrades, but apart from that, it is very different. The upgrades and guns you'll find are very interesting and creative. It sort of recreates that Metroidish feeling of “I can’t get to that area yet, but I bet there’s an item that’ll help me,” but it is not an item that you’d think it’d be. There’s no morph ball, no space jump, no missiles. You instead get a creative tool or ability you wouldn’t expect and because of that, it really captures that first sense of wonder when playing Metroid for the first time.   The story is average. The premise is the common, “There is a bad guy, and you are the only one who can help us” with a plot twist or two. The setting is very interesting and unique, but being a unique and complex world, it can be confusing without finding and collecting the in-game notes about it.  Axiom Verge was made by one person, and I gotta say I am very well damned impressed this guy created all this. Kudos to you Thomas Happ! This game satisfied my Metroid fix. I wouldn’t say it is better, less than, or equal to Super Metroid, because it is a different, but enjoyable experience. I had lots of fun playing it. 
Date 2015-12-27 Playtime 14h 51m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvanias out there.  Very close to super metroid with some really novel power ups.
Date 2015-12-27 Playtime 30h 36m Rec Positive Никогда не играл в Метроид. Но эта игра ве-ли-ко-леп-на. Сюжет серьезный и запутанный. Геймлпей - просто сказка, чем дальше тем больше у тебя интересных способностей, которые используются в не менее интересных игровых головоломках и охоте за секретами. Саундтрек - я могу слушать это сутками. Боссы - ультраэпик. Сколько бы ни играл, не нашел ни одной причины придраться к этой игре. Она идеальна.

Увидев Axiom Verge, меня пленила ностальгия, и я не задумываясь приобрел эту игру, о чем не пожалел. Я погрузился во времена, когда днями напролет играл в Денди и Сегу. Кстати, игра чем-то напоминает Контру на Денди.  Плюсы: [list] [*]Потрясающий и атмосферный саундтрек; [*]Очень разнообразная и атмосферная графика; [*]Способность героя приобретать новые навыки; [*]Разнообразие и усовершенствование монстров по ходу игры; [*]Различная сложность уровней. [/list]  Минусы: [list] [*]Большое число надоедливых диалогов и кат-сцен; [*]Слишком запутанные и протяженные уровни; [/list]  Поклонникам ретро-игр настоятельно рекомендую поиграть.  10 пикселей из 10
Date 2015-12-27 Playtime 10h 7m Rec Positive It's the best Metroid we've gotten since Metroid suddenly turned to shit and went AWOL. ...Which isn't saying much, so I'll say it's definitely up there with the best Metroid games. Also apparently made pretty much entirely by one dude. Impressive and worthwhile.
Date 2015-12-27 Playtime 13h 44m Rec Positive Ah man this got me good. I rarely finish games.. This one I had to finish though.. just to know how it ended.. (and cause its super fun to play) The reviews saying its pretty much Super Metroid are more or less accurate. Very similar in many regards, but different in all the right ways. I'd give it a 9.5/10
Date 2015-12-27 Playtime 26h 33m Rec Positive This was a really fun game. I played it on hard, and it took me about 13 hours to beat. The controls are responsive, the soundtrack is excellent, and the story is pretty decent with a cool twist at the end. The art design is really cool, and the sound effects are spot on. Overall, the game feels really good. Definitely worth picking up.  If you're looking for a game to compare this to, Super Metroid is a good one.  10/10.
Date 2015-12-27 Playtime 27h 26m Rec Positive BRINGS BACK A LOT OF GREAT MEMORIES WITH ITS OWN TWIST.  A COMBINATION OF METROID / CASTLEVANIA / FAXANADU / BIONIC COMMANDO TWISTED INTO ONE CREATIVE AND BEAUTIFUL DELICIOUS CASEROLE OF BUTTON PRESSING LOVELYNESS THAT SHOULDN'T EVER BE OVERLOOKED.     I HOPE THE AUTHOR KNOWS THAT HE DID A FANTASTIC JOB MAKING THIS GAME.  THANK YOU FOR IT. 
Date 2015-12-27 Playtime 18h 37m Rec Positive This game is a great classic metroid style game. After a short intro it drops you right into a sprawling alien environment and leaves you to explore and figure things out. Story is conveyed through short dialogs interspersed throughout and journal pages to find.  Music and artstyle build a great atmosphere of solitude.  10/10
Date 2015-12-26 Playtime 12h 9m Rec Positive More people need to play this
Date 2015-12-26 Playtime 18h 49m Rec Positive So good. If you're looking for a metroidvania that's ON PAR with Super Metroid (and stylistically heavily influenced by it), this is the game for you. I got it through IndieBox, a great monthly indie game subscription service, which is also amazing.  Seriously though, this may be the best metroidvania on steam, if not one of the best games period.
Date 2015-12-26 Playtime 31h 42m Rec Positive Pretty much a blatant rip-off of Metroid but it's different enough to have its own unique charm. I've only played it for a bit but the controls are smooth, the story is enjoyable and the music is top-notch.
Date 2015-12-26 Playtime 11h 20m Rec Positive Hard, but noice.
Date 2015-12-26 Playtime 39h 16m Rec Positive This game is great. it's a postmodern homage to many of the platformers that I've loved in the past, with a solid story and more than enough novelty to make it an original. The last quarter of the game got a little heavy on the backtracking (it would have been great if it were possible to warp between savepoints), but this is a relatively minor gripe and hardly out of keeping for the genre :)
Date 2015-12-26 Playtime 10h 58m Rec Positive great game if you like metroid
Date 2015-12-26 Playtime 12h 31m Rec Positive Great game, worst grappling hook I've ever used in a video game.
Date 2015-12-26 Playtime 10h 0m Rec Positive This is a very, very similar experience to Super Metroid (SNES). That is a good thing and perhaps it's selling point. Except it is not confined to the Metroid gameplay, and thus can expand the genre into various directions while staying true to the general formula. Which is the hook and sinker. The result is a brilliant and convincing game that will keep you up at night for more.   The soundtrack is very nicely done as well.   Well worth the price tag, and then some.
Date 2015-12-26 Playtime 6h 11m Rec Positive What a special game this is. Axiom Verge is a 2-D sidescrolling action adventure platformer. If you have played games like the classic Metriod games, or classic Castlevania games then you will have an idea of what Axiom Verge is like from a gameplay standpoint. It channels the best of what is now known as the "Metroidvainia" sub-genre, that being said, knowing this does not take away from the game's originality when it comes to story and setting. What makes this particular game so special, it that it was painstakingly designed by ONE man over five years! The man's name is Tom Happ and he has taken what so many people love from the "Metroidvania" sub-genre and made his own fine tuned, well designed experience. The main character is Trace, a scientist from Earth, and an accident in the lab leads Trace to coming to a scientific epiphany. I won't spoil the story of the game, but lets just say that Trace does't make the best decisions and ends up becoming a powerful villian who ends up almost wiping out an entire race of aliens called the Sudrans.  In response, Trace is cloned from an imprint of the real Trace taken before he went mad. It is believed that this clone of Trace may be able to stop the power mad, original version of himself. You play the clone of Trace.  The graphics are done in a style that looks very much like an NES game made at the end of that particular console's lifespan, looking as though it uses every ounce of 8-bit processing power the system had available. Of course, there are other graphcal effects that do much more than the NES ever could, but the look and feel of the game very much feels like a great NES game of that era. As for gameplay, the controls are very responsive (I play with a USB Xbox 360 controller) and work very well with a controller. (NOTE: I did not play with the keyboard controls, so I can't speak to how well the game plays in that regard, I suggest playing with a controller, as this game runs amazingly well while using one.) As with any "Metroidvania" style game, you are dropped into the world and are able to go where you please, but many areas will be unaccessible to you until you find the right weapon/sub-weapon/powerup. This forces one to explore the very well designed world in order to find the items necessary to progress to other regions of the game.  There are a large variety of unique enemies to battle against, and every new region of the world has enemies that are native to that region, keeping the enemy threat interesting and their differing ways of attack keeping the player on their toes.  The weapons and powerups you gather along the way help to give you an edge against your enemies in varying ways, and they also serve some sort of function within the world. No weapon or powerup is pointless, all of your weapons can give you an edge in specific situations or against certain enemies and they make fighting the bad guys intuitive and fun.  Boss fights are an event, and each boss is different from other bosses in the game, and each presents a different challenge to the player.  Like most games in this sub-genre, there are save points littered throughout the game, the save points completely heal your character, and act as a checkpoint if you happen to die. As for the design of the game, it is simply beautiful. The world our hero is dumped into is a strange, alien world filled with weird and dangerous creatures. The environments in many areas look as if they are alive, those that have played games like Metroid, Metroid II: Return of Samus, and Super Metroid will feel the sting of nostalgia, as many of the environments seem to echo the planet Zebes or SR 388.  The music and sound design is another high water mark; the music can be moody, and at times creepy and ominous, it gives the game a unique atmosphere that gives Axiom Verge an identity of mystery and discovery. The sounds within the game are fantastic, the sounds of your various weapons make them sound lethal, and the sounds that some of the alien monsters can be unsettling and well...Alien! Personally, I think this is one of the best indy games I have ever played. I am a big fan of games like Metroid, Metroid II: Return of Samus, Super Metroid, Castlevania 1-3, Super Castlevania 4, Symphony of the Night, Rondo of Blood, Bloodlines, and all of the Gameboy Advance Castlevanias (Circle of the Moon, Harmony of Dissonance, Aria of Sorrow). If you are a fan of any of those games, you will absolutely LOVE Axiom Verge.  Unique Story, beautiful retro 8-bit inspired graphics, amazing soundtrack and atmosphere, lots of weapons and powerups, and a large intriguing world to explore. Axiom Verge is one of the best games I have played this year, and I look forward to the developer's future projects.  My final score for Axiom Verge is a full 10/10. I admit that maybe my fondness for the sub-genre and my nostalgia for the graphical style, and gameplay probably influenced my score. This game is not for everyone, but it is a game that I firmly believe that anyone can enjoy. Since the game is so cheap when it comes to price, I say it is completely worth a purchase. 
Date 2015-12-25 Playtime 11h 33m Rec Positive First review ever. In my life on anything. Like ever, not even spoken reviews.  I got into the game using a keyboard....hated it.  Plugged in my xbox controller and literally cried into my hands tears of excitement and joy as Samus and Alucard were standing over me like force ghosts, whipering into my ear "Another room!....Another room!" That total 6 hours was all at once and im not done, not even close.  I don't like the 'invicible' sounds, but i love the the sound and visual effects of the lab coat...like reality cant take it, my absolute fave. Yeah, stop reading and get this shit already!
Date 2015-12-25 Playtime 23h 28m Rec Positive The music in this game is phenomenal. Game play is challenging yet rewarding. There are tons of power ups, interesting puzzles to figure out how to get those power ups. You guys remember the story of goldie locks? Of course you do, The pourage is just right with the amount of storyline this game has, not too much, not too little. If you're looking for a game you can slap your snes controller onto (with some configuring in joy2key) and have a nostyalgic pow wow in your brain, then this game is for you. 
Date 2015-12-25 Playtime 53h 42m Rec Positive Esse jogo é magnífico. Você não vai se arrepender. Ainda acrescento ele se parece muito com Super Metroid
Date 2015-12-25 Playtime 42h 25m Rec Positive Incredbile game. Beautiful graphics and music. Compelling story and writing. Best game I played in 2015.
Date 2015-12-25 Playtime 34h 6m Rec Positive Let's assume that you already know that this is a metroid clone. Exploration, upgrades, weapons, etc. The question, is what differentiates Axiom Verge from its best competitors in the genre? Metroid-style games are common, and there are plenty of great examples that populate the modern PC game library. Ori and the Blind Forest, Guacamelee, Shadow Complex, and Mystik Belle are all good games that fall in the category.  On the surface, Axiom Verge looks and feels like the classic NES Metroid. Deep down, it STILL feels like the classic NES Metroid, except it has tighter controls and a few neat tricks (like phasing through walls and corrupting enemies with a glitch-gun).  What TRULY makes Axiom Verge stand above its competitors, is its ability to captivate the player by allowing them to get lost in an alien world. While all of the above-mentioned metroidvania games guide the player's exploration by bombarding them with "Go here next" hints, objective markers, and compasses, Axiom Verge stands alone by refusing to hold your hand and tell you where to go next. The main design aspect that seperated Metroid & Super Metroid from Metroid Fusion, was that the first two never held your hand. Instead they allowed you to, again, get lost in a mysterious alien world.  So... Is Axiom Verge innovative? No, but it does what it set out to do so well that you might even recapture the same feelings you felt when you popped a Super Metroid cart into your SNES for the first time. Axiom Verge is a captivating game with much to see and do.  The plot is mysterious and full of twists. Trace, the oddly-named main character, is a hapless victim of an accident that throws him deep inside of an unknown world, alone and unguided. The level design is engaging and packed with tons optional upgrades and weapons. Speaking of which, there are over 20 unique weapons, and a lot of them are just plain crazy. I can't forget to mention that there are plenty of ways to traverse the labyrinthine world of Axiom Verge, from ceiling-hook swinging Bionic Commando-style, to airdashing, to teleporting through thin walls, to remotely controlling small drones.  You might be thinking "This is kind of expensive for such an old-looking game." But I assure you that Axiom Verge is one of the finest games in its genre. It isn't short either. Of 48 players polled, it took over 11 hours on average to complete the game.
Date 2015-12-25 Playtime 17h 33m Rec Positive Congratulations, you have just found thebest metroid-like metroidvania available on a PC, and one of the very few that are good. Buy it and savor every moment of it, You won't find a better metroid-like.
Date 2015-12-24 Playtime 1h 11m Rec Positive I own Axiom Verge on both PC and PS4 and its simply a fantastic game. I earned the platinum trophy on ps4 and cant wait to do it again on PC!!
Date 2015-12-24 Playtime 13h 11m Rec Positive On the surface, Axiom Verge is your standart Metroidvania (heavy on the metroid, light on the vania): you platform around beating bosses and unlocking new capablites to get to new areas, repeat.  What makes Axiom Verge stand out is several things:  1. a very creating and interesting world (not going into details to avoid spoilers) 2. great feeling controls: smooth jumping, not hitbox shenanigans, and fairly easy aiming 3. OPTIONS!  So much of the game is optional, it really rewards exploration. To expound on point 3, it is common in games of this genre for the player to spend a lot of time retracing their steps trying to find the way to progress the story forwards.  Axiom Verge is no exception here but it is less irrirating because you will frequently stumble across a new weapon, health upgrade, or extra story element.  Axiom Verge is an outstanding example that future games of this genre will be compared against.  My playthrough here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5JEFvVpx9qJGzqh6vlbQfvdIs-SlO5W
Date 2015-12-24 Playtime 50h 43m Rec Positive Ive been playing for about an hour and this game is great. Music is great, controls great, graphics are perfect. If you like metriodvania games do your self a favor and download this game.
Date 2015-12-24 Playtime 1h 21m Rec Positive Pflichtkauf für jeden der auch nur Ansatzweise was mit Oldscool Jump and Run, Metroid Prime oder ähnliches am Hut hat. Genialer Soundtrack, geniale Kulisse, perfektes Couch - Gamepad Spiel.
Date 2015-12-24 Playtime 13h 16m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a great trip, it's something I'll be sure to trace my steps through again and again. The music soundtrack is great, the aesthetic is a total love letter to the Metroidvania genre, and the storyline is fresh and new. Definitely a game worth checking out!
Date 2015-12-24 Playtime 14h 47m Rec Positive Mitt val för året spel 2015.   Ett fantastiskt kärleksbrev till Metroidvania genren, speciellt just Metroid serien. Underbar atmosfär, inte så lite pga ett soundtrack som ackompanjerar varje del av världen perfekt och ger varje del sin egen karaktär. Grafiken är av klar retro-design, någon slags mellanting från NES och SNES eran i känsla, med en tydlig estetik som syr ihop hela paketet.  Spelets story, vilket aldrig varit någon större fokus för min del i denna typ av spel, lämnar faktiskt ett intryck, och överraskade mig, vilket var både trevligt och välkommet.  Spelet har en uppsjö utav föremål/förmågor och vapen att hitta, utöver ett stort galleri med fiender som oftast har ett optimalt sätt att hanteras på. Vad som kan först verka som en surt jobbig fiende, kan med rätt kombination av förmågor och vapen hanskas med utan några problem.  Detta är ett spel som rekommenderas till alla som gillar action/äventyrsspel med fokus på utforskning, med lite lätt problemlösning inslängt. Har ni aldrig spelat Metroid eller Castlevania serien (efter Symphony of the Night), så har ni här ett primärt exempel på vad genren är och kan erbjuda, och kommer förhoppningsvis ge ert ett sug att testa även dessa spel. Och tillhör ovanstående spel till er egen topplista utav spel, så har ni i mina ögon inget val än att köpa detta spel, och njut utav att vi i år får ett nytt genre mästerverk och en framtida klassiker.  Om du tvekar nu, köp det. Eller har du det redan?  Köp det till någon i julklapp och förgyll deras jul.
Date 2015-12-23 Playtime 23h 57m Rec Positive Here's the deal, you're reading this review because this looks like it'll play like Super Metroid and you want to know if it'll give you the same awesome gameplay experience.  The answer is yes.  Now buy it and be prepared to lose a weekend.
Date 2015-12-23 Playtime 14h 49m Rec Positive Excellent Metroidvania with great exploration (9 huge maps, 23 weapons to collect and tons of other stuff), conflict, mystery and a wonderful story.
Date 2015-12-23 Playtime 15h 56m Rec Positive What a fantastic adventure. I went in expecting an average metroidvania but the world and feeling of "oh man what happened here? What is this place?" made me feel 14 again. Outstanding art direction, catchy music, great mechanics, great feeling of exploration.  A few minutes in, you think you have the game figured out, that you know basically how this will go. And honestly that was fine with me -- but then the game adds a really interesting twist that adds an entirely new dimension to the game, making it feel fresh. And then you discover a Secret Level using said mechanics and it's amazing.  It's really fantastic and the work of a single dude. You can really feel the love that guy poured into this game over the years.   If you'd like a really good metroidvania with the Actual Quality of the classics, and an amazing twist, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.
Date 2015-12-23 Playtime 11h 26m Rec Positive Ce jeu est un chef d'oeuvre! La musique, les graphismes, le game-play et le scénario générent une ambiance sci-fi malsaine  vraiment particulière.
Date 2015-12-23 Playtime 26h 53m Rec Positive Do you like Metroid or Castlevania?  Do yourself a favor and get this game now!  Never played either series but you like exploring, collecting power ups, and you like old school platformers?  It might be up your alley.  Pros: Awesome soundtrack Great metroidvania exploration Huge variety of powerups/weapons Boss fights are fun and actually encourage you to switch weapons based on their patterns.  Cons: Some weapons are clearly superior to others.  I felt like once I got the lightning gun nothing else compared.   I have played every metroid and castlevania game and found this very enjoyable.
Date 2015-12-23 Playtime 14h 1m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a throwback to classic gaming. It takes influences from the best such as metroid, castlevania, and master blaster. Each component of this game just works. The sound design is retro bliss. The game design allthough familiar is still very unique and surprised me quite a bit. Yes this game is difficult but that just makes progression feel earned and respected. I did get stuck quite a few times at various parts of the game, and did have to look to others for help to move forward. All in all this game was exactly the game I felt was missing in my library. And the most impressive part?? It was made entirely by one man!!!!! Incredible!!   9.2 out of 10
Date 2015-12-23 Playtime 15h 24m Rec Positive You remember the good old days of Metroid. Ah, the 2D games, like Fusion and Super Metroid. Now Nintendo stop making such classics, and are giving us 3D FPS Metroids. They are still quite fun, but do not give us the "high" the old ones did.   Axiom Verge brings back that high, with backtracking, a lot of experimenting on guns, not to mention, over 10 different weapons to use. While this does not have the attention it deserves, unlike Undertale, which was recommended to me because I dearly enjoyed earthbound (I still do not see a similarity). This game has a great story, and has been in the works for 5 years, and was made by 1 person only. It was heavily inspired by the classic Metroid and has the retro graphics that make you feel like you are playing a SNES game. It has the amazing throwback music, no singing. Hell, it even has secret glitch rooms inspired by the negative levels in the original mario bros. This game is basically a very late SNES game. I sincerely hope Thomas Happ decides to make many more games like this in the future. One of the best games of 2015.
Date 2015-12-23 Playtime 26h 41m Rec Positive Thomas Happ made a cool game.
Date 2015-12-23 Playtime 23h 48m Rec Positive A fresh and very original homage to the original Metroid game. I instantly recognized the motifs of the classic game, the tiles, the sounds, but was surprised how it build over it and elevate the concepts of Metroidvania genre making them its own.
Date 2015-12-21 Playtime 4h 22m Rec Positive Great gameplay, reminds me of the early Metroid games, but it has some of the ideas and concepts from later games in the genre, and plenty of original ideas as well and the art and music are also fantastic.
Date 2015-12-21 Playtime 7h 40m Rec Positive Man, this game is so rad. Nintendo need to get it together - other people are doing metroid better!
Date 2015-12-20 Playtime 15h 7m Rec Positive Amazing game! Lots of variety and many secrets/collectables for completionists. I played on keyboard, but highly reccommend using a controller. Just suits the gameplay better :). Good fun and easy to just pick up and play!
Date 2015-12-20 Playtime 22h 50m Rec Positive Um dos melhores metroidvanias que eu já joguei. História envolvente, fases inspiradas, trilha sonora soberba, enfim, todos os componentes de um grande jogo.  One of the best metroidvanias I have ever played. Involving history, inspired stages, soberb music; in the end all components of a great game.
Date 2015-12-20 Playtime 13h 21m Rec Positive Отличный платформер. Поначалу даже немного раздражал, но постепенно, находя все больше предметов для взаимодействия с здешним миром, игра становилась для меня все интереснее и интереснее. В итоге затянуло так, что не отпустило до самого финального босса. :)  Если вам нравятся игры подобного типа, то обязательно попробуйте Axiom Verge, она определенно стоит вашего внимания!
Date 2015-12-20 Playtime 21h 22m Rec Positive Are you a man? A machine? Are you a clone, or your original self? Is this reality? Is it a dream? The afterlife? Do any of these questions actually matter to the universe, if the universe does, indeed, exist?  These are the things that I thought about while I played through this Metroidvania. I had fun with it, enjoyed the story, finished it, and moved on. Couldn't have asked for more.
Date 2015-12-18 Playtime 13h 59m Rec Positive      I really enjoyed this game. It certainly feels like Super Metroid, but is also different enough to feel like it's own game. There really are no instructions on where to go next, but I was able to explore and figure it out without feeling too lost. Maybe three times during the game I was really stumped, but nothing I didn't eventually get. The upgrades and power ups are everywhere, making you feel more powerful fairly consistently, yet never leaving you feeling overpowered. Best part of the entire game is the atmosphere. The game is dark and gritty, which I love. The soundtack however puts this game over the top. While I love soundtracks from other games, this is truly the first one I've ever wanted to have on my phone. From the title screen on, the music is flat out amazing. Incredible job.       Overall, Axiom Verge is an amazing game in the spirit of Super Metroid. While the two games share some similarities, Axiom's music, story, and constant discovery make it game all its own. Not only do I recommend this game, but I also recommend Mr. Happ make sequel, if only for the music alone. 9.2/10
Date 2015-12-17 Playtime 21h 35m Rec Negative Я не рекомендую эту игру к покупке т.к. игра заканчивается уже в середине. Дальше у авторов, просто, иссякла фантазия, все интересные моменты игры продемонстрированы в рекламном ролике. Под конец игры становиться непросто скучно, к игре начинается отвращение.
Date 2015-12-17 Playtime 92h 21m Rec Positive Metroid fan? Cave Story? This is just as unique and amazing as those. Worth the Money.
Date 2015-12-16 Playtime 24h 16m Rec Positive Totally worth it. It would be nice to have a sequel of this. It's been years since I played a game like this. 10/10 on story, duration, and general gameplay.
Date 2015-12-16 Playtime 27h 45m Rec Positive Очень хорошая игра, которая должна придтись по вкусу любителям игр в стиле «метройда», т.к. ей и является :-)  Графика кажется доброй старой, но когда начинаешь играть, то быстро понимаешь, что графическая составляющая и эффекты на хорошем уровне!  Короче, всячески рекомендую!!!
Date 2015-12-16 Playtime 13h 7m Rec Negative Bunch of garbage about hacking other dimensions to kill your clones or some bullshit. Has all the classic metroidvania problems that make them shit.  Still though this game is off the fucking chain you better get it when it's on sale, LOSER!  10/10 that remote drone is the most kawaii neko little motherfucker ever
Date 2015-12-15 Playtime 35h 40m Rec Positive Absolutely worths its price. If you like cavestory, you will like this.
Date 2015-12-14 Playtime 45h 17m Rec Positive Masterpiece.  9.5/10
Date 2015-12-14 Playtime 9h 22m Rec Positive This game is awesome. It definitely brings me back to my childhood Super Metroid days. I may have seen the gameplay before but to me that just makes it familiar. Also there are a few new twists to keep things interesting. Finally the artwork and music tie everything together nicely.   Some are saying its overpriced. I got this as part of The Indie Box and I think with the box and everything that came with it this is a great deal.
Date 2015-12-14 Playtime 11h 37m Rec Negative I am a fan of Metroid since I was a little boy, super metroid especially is one of my all time favs. I was really looking forward to this game, and eveything was good and dendy, well, at the beginning that is.  The game appears to look like metroid, this changes over time. The textures are very rough and sterile, they have no flavour, no distinct, striking pattern. It's simply a cheap and loveless surrounding - all the time. You are not immersed in the environment, you don't feel like you wanna be a part of it. The music sadly supports this strongly, cheap 8-bit-like noises instead of soundtracks. I simply never felt welcome or intrigued by new environments, speaking of which: They appear way too often. The map, which is really small over all, is neatly divided into sectors, but within those you have like 5 different environments as well. Sometimes it feels like one environment is 3 screens wide. It changes too fast for you to develope an emotional connection.   The bossfights are cheap as fuck, and there is no end boss fight. wtf? There are like 12 beams, why? You literally play with one long range and one short range, period. You cannot combine them or anything, they are simply useless.  Safe rooms are 2 tall, not that I care, but WHY? It is utterly random. Tools. You don't need them or they get replaced. The drill is annoying as fuck but for the most part your only tool to detect secrets.  The story is the nail in the coffin. It started out really good and I felt compelled to uncover the truth, well, the game ends before you even know what's going on. No kidding. You struggle the entire time with little bits, playing puzzling in your head until the end, and then there is no real surprise or anything. The concept is amazing, but it played out SO badly..  Still, there ARE some good things about this game, some gimmicks are innovative and fun to play with. The story is a let down in the end, but keeps you driven most of the time.  All in all, no real recommendation for people who would like to see super metroid reborn. It's pathetic, really, that people in 2015 are unable to come close to a game that is like 20years old.   Get it for 3 bucks or so
Date 2015-12-14 Playtime 10h 30m Rec Positive My only regret is being banished from the world before I could enact revenge on those who wronged me...
Date 2015-12-13 Playtime 7h 12m Rec Positive Great game reminds me on Metroid. The retro graphic is between NES and PC Engine Great Sience Fiction Story, Animation and Game Soundtrack.
Date 2015-12-12 Playtime 30h 3m Rec Positive Lamens review:  If you're a fan of metroidvania retro games; this one won't let you down!   It feels very similar, yet different from the Metroid and SOTN style games in that you never really become THAT godly towards the end. For me that feels a bit dull. The controls aren't quite as fun as, say, Super Metroid, but there are some kind of fun tricks you can do with the right upgrades (has to do with the drone you get). Exploration feels creepy and seclusive. The story is interesting. All in all, it's a good game, but its controls could be more fun (like more clever combat vs metroid 1 style combat and better grappling) and backtracking gets a bit too tedious for me to 100% complete this game. I lose interest in getting everything because almost no weapon makes that big of a difference, and you don't need your life, strength, range, or anything else maxed out to beat the game.  I'd say 8/10 for the category of game this is. Not as good as the pioneers of this genre, but it scratches the itch well enough.   
Date 2015-12-12 Playtime 9h 9m Rec Positive gud gejm
Date 2015-12-11 Playtime 30h 56m Rec Positive Simplemente una obra de arte.  Es una compra obligatoria para todo amante de los juegos tipo metroid.  En cuanto a la exploracion quiza en momentos es algo desesperante, pero es parte de la magia. Es largo y se hace corto. Me ha gustado mucho la variedad de armas y power ups que hay.  Desde luego que volveria a comprarlo!
Date 2015-12-11 Playtime 38h 35m Rec Positive I bought this game through indiebox, instead of renting it through Steam.  Now this is how you do gaming!  The exporing in this game is first rate. You want to search every corner of this world and fear that you may stumble across a boss before being able to save. You want to remember the places you've been so that you can come back and beat them when you're properly equiped.  The weapons are varied and imaginative, making bosses a joy to beat. They are challenging, but never to the point that they feel cheap.   It's so sad that big developers can't make games this good anymore (as a rule). I'm not a huge fan of the indie scene, but lately there are some real gems coming out of it and Axiom Verge is one of them.   The "Contemporary Man in Technical World" plot doesn't really do anything for me. It builds some intrique, but hasn't given me any extra incentive to go forward. The only good thing about the story is that there is no voice acting. Who plays a game for the story anyway?  Also, changing weapons is more of a chore than it should be. Why not just cycle through them? It breaks the flow and is just clunky. However, with the rest of it being so good, it's more of a nitpick, but should be mentioned.  The terrible Steam controller doesn't work with this game (what does it work with?), so if that's all you have, I'd suggest using a keyboard instead or getting a Logicool controller, they seem to work with everything and, unlike the Steam controller, feel good in the hand.
Date 2015-12-11 Playtime 16h 27m Rec Positive Great Shooter. Large and complex, music is pushing forward, stages are hidden and diffcult to enter and find. You will need some hours to finish it and many more to get 100% of the sometimes ridiculously crazy hidden items.   Most of it is Metroid like, you get a Facehugger from Half Life as companion, great shiny laser weapons, challenging enemies and a nice mass of collectabels.  It´s worth the money if you like Metroid, Castlevania and games like that.
Date 2015-12-11 Playtime 13h 38m Rec Positive Axiom Verge was something I have been wanting for a long time, a proper 2d metroid game. This game was a huge nostalgia trip for me, being a huge metroid fan, but it was still very unique in its own way. The gameplay is very fun and enjoyable, the multitude of guns allows anyone to use their own playstyle, and the upgrades are all fairly unique and fun to play around with. The story is also not that bad in my opinion, using the normal story and logs scattered throughout the world. All in all, it is a very fun metroid styled game, and I would highly suggest it to anyone who has or hasn't played metroid before.
Date 2015-12-10 Playtime 25h 44m Rec Positive Not as good as Super Metroid, but the fact that this is even a game that can be compared to it should tell you all you need to know about its quality.
Date 2015-12-10 Playtime 30h 48m Rec Positive This is an excellent Metroid game (no 'vania here), possibly the best since Super Metroid.    Exploration is the big winner here (as it should be in a Metroid-like).  The map is a large, sprawling affair, which makes for a huge game with lots of secrets.  For the most part, Axiom Verge defies the concept that collectibles need to be boring incremental boosts.  Gone are the missile packs littered around which expand your supply of already-more-than-you-need missiles.  Collectibles trend towards new weapons, new powers, or lore pick-ups, all of which add more life and variety to the game than just another ammo pack.  Obviously, there are still health and damage upgrades which are useful, albeit less inspiring, but the majority of items feel like they are expanding your toolbox or your immersion in the universe rather than just giving you more of the same thing.    On the topic of powerups, you can't talk about Axiom Verge without talking about the late game mobility powerups.  Of course, you ACTUALLY CAN'T talk about the late game mobility powers, because spoilers...  Half the fun is unlocking the new powers, and realizing OH MY GOD, THAT JUST HAPPENED?  I'll just say that they are stupendously satisfying, and they are wonderfully subversive compared to what you think they are going to be.  Let it be known that Axiom Verge has the best not-a-morph-ball EVER.    Of course, with all that exploration, sometimes things can get TOO sprawling.  Get ready to backtrack.  A form of fast travel exists, but is unavailable for about the first half of the game and has a limited number of destinations.  The bigger complaint is that the exploration at times feels slightly aimless, as the new places opened up by acquiring a new powerup aren't obvious without good memory (or good notes) or some old fashioned wandering.  Finding the "right path" that progresses towards the end is occasionally confusing, and the story is light on explicit directional clues, favoring vague (sometimes barely stated) objectives like "find the repair drones," etc.  To many people this reads like exactly what you want from a Metroid-like, though others may find the meandering slightly irritating.    The story is sufficiently strange, and doesn't detract from the exploration, platforming, and combat.  Dialogue is infrequent, with details and extra mysteries revealing themselves with lore item secrets.  There is enough narrative depth to heighten the overall mood of the game, making it more weird and alien, but it generally steps aside to let the action and exploration elements take center stage (which is high praise for a Metroid-like).     The game keeps up an old-school exterior in terms of sound design and graphics, and while that means Axiom Verge isn't always "pretty," the game embraces these as features rather than limitations.  The "glitchiness" aspects certainly wouldn't work as effectively with a more modern look.  By adhering to these old school limitations for most of the time, the occassions where is does break from this orthodoxy become especially exciting.  When the screen zooms out to show a giant boss sprite, when you get distortion effects from using late-game mobility powers, and when you shoot the (extremely satisfying) Voranj weapon for the first time, there is a rush of surprised joy which wouldn't be as much of a high with a more modern look.    While the environment tilesets may be occasionally bland, the sprites (especially the bosses) and the giant-robot-as-tileset Rusalki are awe-inspiring.  The music serves as an effective mood setter for the game, creating a creepy and oppressive atmosphere.  This place really feels like an unfamiliar, hostile, alien world.  There are the little things, too, which show so much thought and care in the construction.  For example, the "low-health beeps" keep tempo with the background music to make them noticable but not irritating.  The weapon ring UI is the best use of a right analog stick that a 2D platformer could ask for, and ought to be copied by all and sundry.  (You listening, Mega Man?)  These things are nice little touches, and it shows that the creator (a one man team) paid attention to the details.    For those of us raised on (raised by?) the NES and SNES, this is the best kind of trip down nostalgia lane.  For those whom these consoles of yore were before your time, consider this your point of entry.  Whole-heartedly recommended.
Date 2015-12-10 Playtime 21h 22m Rec Positive Ok ok ok. It's 20$. I wasn't sure if I was willing to shell out that kinda cash... Not sure why it was sucha struggle though when it's common place to spend 60$+ on games these days. But I heard good things about it and went ahead and handed over my wallet. I finished the final boss today after 20 hours of play. *napoleon dynamite voice* That's like 1$ an hour! I still have plenty of stuff to go back and collect, plus replay value is definately there. The story is ok, not really anything spectactular in my opinion, but still solid. Like all of the other reviews say, if you enjoy metroid in the slightest, you'll love AV.
Date 2015-12-10 Playtime 1h 1m Rec Positive Dis very good game
Date 2015-12-10 Playtime 10h 40m Rec Positive Excelente juego, lo recomiendo. Mis felicitaciones al creador de esta genialidad!
Date 2015-12-09 Playtime 11h 3m Rec Positive I f**KN hate this game...      ... and by hate i mean i love this game.    
Date 2015-12-09 Playtime 27h 4m Rec Positive This game was so damn awesome! The story, the gameplay, the twist towards the end, I was completely blown away by this game. I would pay full price again and again for this one. If you like the old Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion on GBA, you will for sure love this game.
Date 2015-12-08 Playtime 49h 56m Rec Positive Wer (Super) Metroid kennt und mag, wird dieses Spiel lieben! Unglaublich, dass es nur einen Entwickler gibt: komplexe Geschichte, logisch aufgebaut, ziemlich große Welten und schier unendlich viele Waffen und Erweiterungen. Durch und durch empfehlenswert.  Ach ja: der Soundtrack ist phantastisch.
Date 2015-12-08 Playtime 25h 20m Rec Positive The best Metroid in years. Tom Happ is a genius.
Date 2015-12-08 Playtime 1h 55m Rec Positive This is by far the toughest Metroid ever.
Date 2015-12-08 Playtime 14h 24m Rec Positive =================== UPDATE 1 ================== 最近年休假，终于在捡完垃圾4后将其爆机了，于是上来更新一下，将内容完善一下： 首先，后期需要多种技能组合使用，才能打开通路，开始还抱着传统“银河战士恶魔城”的观点，以为会找到新道具然后用道具打开新区域——其实这种思维是错误的！害得我满地图跑来跑去毫无所获，最后只好上网翻攻略。然后悲剧的是发现这游戏中文攻略找不到，只有全地图！只好啃全地图看看自己哪些地方没去过，然后逐个跑遍，才发现并不是我没找到新道具，而是压根就没有啊！然后站在新区域门口思考了一阵，发现，妈蛋啊，原来是这样！跳跃、上冲刺、无人机……  后期日常的战斗难度很大，有种只能垂直位置打中心，两边都防弹的怪，要么炸弹要么跑路，因为没啥好处，只能跑路免战了。最后BOSS那里应该是没办法无伤过的，多重火力没法躲，怎么办你们自己想。  相比之下，银河战士几乎就是个线性的，关卡是一个阶段一个阶段的过，所以很少有回到从前去的情况，相对好打很多，这游戏有传送通道的设定，可以快速在若干区域之间移动，如果陷入传统的思路，后期可能会迷惑，而且这游戏隐藏地点不少，我建议卡关的时候还是找个全地图看看，不然你真的只能逐个地图扫了，每次得到一个新能力就要扫一遍蛮辛苦，除非你有画地图做笔记的习惯。  总体来说非常满意，较大的战斗难度，足够多甚至超出我预期的隐秘比较能满足我的渴望，遗憾的是没有二周目，存档最低只能在Final BOSS战前面，续作早点降临啊！  =================== 初评 ================== 因为还在废土捡垃圾，所以只匆匆体验了4个多小时，但给我留下了极其深刻的影像！ 首先我说说缺点，美工一般，大概算SFC复刻FC版《银河战士》那种级别，图像绘制确实不行，敌人都怪怪的，音乐比较单调，主角的形象——一个大叔拿着不美型怪怪的GUN，身后还时不时会出来两只触手这个你们接受吗？  下面是优点，因为太多了，单独开一段。首先，我觉得银河战士+恶魔城类型中，最好玩的《超级银河战士》也是有所不及此作的！银河战士最核心的要素是什么？探索！这游戏将画面中的隐藏地发挥到了历史上从未有过的高度！数量非常多，安排上也做得很到位，很多地方都有暗示，只要稍微细心点你就会有惊喜。另外地图上你用各种道具千辛万苦达到的地方，十有八九会有所回报，仔细观察，大胆前进吧！其次，给我深刻印象的反而是丑陋画质和有点怪腔怪调带来的神秘感，这种感觉在SFC版《超级银河战士》和《月下夜想曲》中也有上佳的表现，前者是孤寂神秘的外星球，后者是哥特式的恶魔古堡。而公理边缘中你同样会感受到类似的风格，这种感觉更像《超银》一些，但并不完全相同，有它自己的特色，而且莫名的敌方设计，偶尔有点怪腔怪调阴森的BGM，和屏幕上各种闪烁、不规则色块，反而融合在一起衬托出这个古怪的世界，很棒，作者是不是连自己的缺点都算计进去了？！  最后是剧情，目前看官方WIKI没明说，似乎有多种解释，涉及到多重宇宙、轮回什么的，游戏中其实也能体现出来，剧情的转折点做得很棒！但是涉及剧透请自行体会。  剩下的都不重要了，例如武器设计啥子的，作者本来说要做100种武器，缩了好多才剩下这么些，武器特色还是很鲜明，不过基本没啥必须的，只是有些武器的特点打某些怪会舒服一点。战斗强度其实不低，有些地方很难回血，怪又是回来就重生，战斗有些地区很多，而且很耐打，还好游戏操作手感很棒，我对手感很棒的游戏一向不容易腻味，所以还算过得去，但手残的玩家我觉得……你们会有遇上难题哦
Date 2015-12-08 Playtime 16h 28m Rec Positive Do you like Metroid?  If so, buy this.  You won't regret it.  It's the best homage to oldschool Metroidvania I've ever played.  The world is huge.  There's always something to discover and back tracking is a pleasure since there is always something new to find along the way.  Best game I've played in 2015 for sure.
Date 2015-12-07 Playtime 23h 10m Rec Positive This game is like metroid, and it is very good and has great music.
Date 2015-12-07 Playtime 2h 12m Rec Positive If you like Super Metroid, play this game. If you haven't played Super Metroid, play this game. If you like this game, play Super Metroid.
Date 2015-12-07 Playtime 18h 59m Rec Positive Excellent retro style platform game that executes beautiful graphics/art with some good old fashioned exploration and big boss fights.  Metroid keeps getting thown around as a comparison but it reminded me more of castlevania aside from the sci-fi setting. I really liked the overall feel and tone of the narrative and how well everything seemed to tie together from the artwork, to the game mechanics, right on down to the narrative. Clearly the creator of this title had a stict vision for Axiom and belive it was realized quite well.  On the downside I have to say I was pretty disappointed with the boss fights. There are a few that I would consider fun and rewarding but they seem to get worse as the game drags on and many of them have a gimmick trick that can take them out in no time. The End Boss was especially lackluster and but overall I am still more than happy with this title.  8/10
Date 2015-12-06 Playtime 22h 36m Rec Positive Wow. What a great game.  A Metroidvania game that's not a simple clone. This game has a great, unique, and complex story (there's one easy twist, but it's still well, you'll see). Bosses were a bit too simple once you find the trick, but the wide assortment of weapons keeps you on your feet when it comes to taking out the normal enemies. Their AI is pretty dumb, I'll have to admit. The items in this game are diverse and really change up the gameplay in a way that doesn't just reproduce other Metroidvania items (well, except the grapple).  At nearly 11 hours, I completed the game with 75% items, 95% map revealed. I'm definitely going to hunt down the notes to fill in on the story elements I'm missing. I'll definitely give Hard Mode and the Speen Run a go, and I ususally don't play games once I've beaten them.
Date 2015-12-06 Playtime 17h 34m Rec Positive Definite yes. While it looks Metroid inspired, this game is in no way a clone or gimmick. The story is solid and kept me on edge wanting to know the truth about what happened on this planet and to know who is good or bad. I heard someone say about this game, "You think you know what is going on or what is going to happen but you don't" And I agree.   I felt more badass with each ability upgrade.  The graphics, art style, music, sound fx and gameplay are all a perfect fit in this game's universe. And what's even more impressive is it was all created by one person.  Stop reading this and play the dang game for yourself already.
Date 2015-12-06 Playtime 22h 28m Rec Positive Ну наконец-то, правильный платформер! Кто-то говорит "достойное продолжение Метроидвании", отчасти он прав. Но я считаю, что это БОЛЬШОЙ ВЗРЫВ в мире пиксельных платформеров. Атмосфера, музыка, сюжет, а самое главное - геймплей. Автор, буквально, заставил пройти игру от начала до конца затаив дыхание, исследуя подземелья, собирая бонусы и ища тайники с новыми пушками. Графика выглядит просто потрясающе, все мрачное, темное, враждебное. Все элементы визуальной составляющей выглядят гармонично и создают атмосферу кромешного пиздеца. Музыка напряженная и злая, биты сливают воедино мрачный сюжет и буйство красок, разворачивающихся на экране. Про геймплей говорить бессмысленно, это нужно попробовать своими руками. Управление мягкое, отзывчивое, количество возможностей амуниции главного героя просто зашкаливает. Отдельно хочу упомянуть об оружии. Их - тьма. Но самое главное то, что все они нужны. Вспоминаются любые другие игры, где самая последняя найденная пушка - лучшая. Здесь автор уделил (не знаю, намеренно ли) особое внимание разнообразию вооружения. Скажу кратко - все апгрейды нашего пулемета важны, в той или иной ситуации. Думаю каждый найдет для себя любимые тактики на всех этапах игры. Тем более, что переключение режимов огня занимает считанные секунды. В общем, говорить можно много, но это не имеет особого смысла. В Axiom Verge нужно играть. Играть, и наслаждаться всем разнообразием геймплея. Автору (который потратил на игру 5 лет) огромный респект и уважение на районе. Мой вердикт - 10 ИЗ 10!!!! О, БОЖЕ, 10 ИЗ 10!
Date 2015-12-06 Playtime 19h 22m Rec Negative Axiom Verge ist eines dieser Spiele für die man sich eine "neutrale Bewertung" auf Steam wünschen würde. Persönlich muss ich sagen, dass mich der Titel enttäuscht hat, da ich doch etwas mehr Action erwartet habe. Allerdings kann das je nach Erwartung und Anspruch des Spielers auch anders ausfallen. Da es ja nur die Möglichkeit von "empfehlen"/"nicht empfehlen" gibt, muss ich Letzteres wählen.  [b]Positiv:[/b] - sehr gute [i]Atmosphäre[/i] - schöner Ingame-[i]Grafik[/i] Stil - tolle [i]Ideen[/i] (sowohl Waffen und Gadgets)  [b]Neutral:[/b] - [i]Story[/i], naja, wer hat sich schon "damals" je bei einem Jump'n'Shoot für die Story interessiert? ;-) - [i]Bosse[/i]; ingesamt etwas komisch ausbalanciert; finde es generell nicht verwerflich, dass man Bosse "überlisten" kann (gab's in Turrican 1/2 damals auch schon), blöd finde ich hier eher manche Rücksetzpunkte im späteren Spielverlauf.  - die [i]Steuerung[/i] ist ein bisschen "over-the-top"; auf der einen Seite schön so viele Gadgets zu haben, auf der anderen Seite wird das Ganze häufig zu einer nervigen Fingerübung; mit etwas Übung kriegt man jedoch eigentlich alles soweit hin.  [b]Negativ:[/b] - viel extrem nerviges [i]Backtracking[/i]; leider eben nicht nur als Bonus für Entdeckungsfreudige, sondern häufig vom Spiel aufgezwungen um weiter kommen zu können - durchweg [i]lahmes Tempo[/i]; ganz nervig ist, dass man auch mit fortgeschrittenem Equipment in vielen Arealen an jedem einzelnen Gegner "hängen bleibt" und sich zu 90% per "stop & go" durch die Level bewegt; die einzige Waffe, die etwas "Erlösung" dahingehend brachte war der Flammenwerfer, den ich aber nur mit Hilfe von einem Walkthrough im Internet gefunden habe - [i]Soundtrack[/i]; ich bin großer Fan von Musik im "Chiptune Style", aber hier gibt es zum großen Teil nur beliebiges Rumgedudel; und der eine Track in KUR ist an Grausamkeit kaum zu überbieten ;-) - vermeintliche "dead-ends"; leider hängt man an mehreren Stellen im Spiel und muss extrem viel rumprobieren, rumlaufen etc... um herauszufinden, wie es weiter geht; manche "Secrets" sind offensichtlicher zu finden als die nächsten Wege der "Hauptmission". - "[i]enemy respawning[/i]"; mag jeder halten wie er will: ich mag es einfach nicht; vor allem dann nicht, wenn es darum geht in bereits bekannten Arealen Secrets zu finden.  Naja, Axiom Verge ist kein total schlechtes Spiel. Für eine One-Man-Show ist es eine respektable Leistung, aber man sollte sich vorher überlegen, was man vom Spiel erwartet. Wer - wie ich - ein schönes Actiongeladenes Jump'n'Shoot erwartet, wird vermutlich eher enttäuscht. Wer total drauf steht alle Level vor und rückwärts nach Geheimnissen abzusuchen und mehr den Action-Adventure Aspekt mag, hat vielleicht seine Freude daran.   Was mir zum "Daumen hoch" fehlt: "Hauptmission" etwas linearer, dafür bessere "Belohnungen" beim Backtracking/bei Secrets, kein "enemy respawning" innerhalb einer "Welt"/eines Levels, Rücksetzpunkte bei *allen* Bossfights direkt vor dem Kampf. Und diejenigen, die meinen solche Designmängel als dem "Retro"-Stil geschuldet abzutun, möchten vielleicht nochmal Turrican I/II (C64/Amiga) anspielen :-)
Date 2015-12-06 Playtime 22h 40m Rec Positive Really great game. If you enjoyed any of the metriod 2D games you will probably enjoy this
Date 2015-12-06 Playtime 11h 0m Rec Positive Metroid. This is a modern Metroid with retro graphics. Gooood. Also, it has minimalistic yet rather facinating storyline - something you won't find in the old Metroids.   Haha, thats all that really needs to be said! Good game!
Date 2015-12-06 Playtime 29h 25m Rec Positive Extremely tight controls, genius construction, fascinating story, grow-as-you-go playstyle that doesn't get boring the second time around, retro graphics that actually play into the mechanics ... Cave Story wishes it were this good.  The game even has a place for player character death, that's not something I see frequently.
Date 2015-12-05 Playtime 10h 43m Rec Positive Axiom Verge n'est pas uniquement un Metroid indé, il apporte beaucoup notamment sur le plan du move pool. Alors qu'on s'attend à obtenir des capacités communes que l'on trouve dans la plupart des Metroidvania, cet Axiom Verge prend toujours le contre-pied et le fait bien. La réalisation (chiptunes, pixel art façon 8-bits) est dans l'ensemble franchement réussie. Quand on sait qu'une seule personne est derrière ce jeu, c'est assez fou parce qu'il est en plus extrêmement riche : 10H environ en ligne droite en ce qui me concerne pour 91% de map et 66% d'objets collectés.
Date 2015-12-05 Playtime 0h 43m Rec Negative Давно хотел поиграть, наконец сподобился и купил.  ОТВРАТИТЕЛЬНО. Самое чудовищное управление в моей жизни, элементарно не работает навигация в меню, переназначить клавиши по сути можно, но зайти в это меню и назначить их невозможно.

Date 2015-12-05 Playtime 18h 47m Rec Positive Looking for an old-school experience akin to Super Metroid and Castelvania? Then you should definitely check this game out! I absolutely love it!
Date 2015-12-05 Playtime 3h 12m Rec Negative Metroid's special ed cousin
Date 2015-12-04 Playtime 13h 38m Rec Positive If you're a huge fan of the Metroid platformers like me, then this game is the best thing you'll play in years.
Date 2015-12-04 Playtime 12h 36m Rec Positive That a game this big could be developed by only one guy is something really incredible. The game is great, build in a retro-style that remind us games like Metroid or Alien. The game tells a sciencie fiction story that it goes really good with the environment and art. There a lot of collectibles and upgrades that you can do, so it has a lot of replay value. If you like games like Castlevania Symphony of the Night or Metroid, this game won't dissappoint you.  10/10
Date 2015-12-04 Playtime 24h 51m Rec Positive A fantastic metroidvania game (emphasis on the metroid) that manages to do the genre justice while expanding upon the formula with a few new features. The art is beautiful, and the soundtrack is always spot on. My only complaint is the map is unnecessarily large in some places. Still, it's worth the 20 bucks.
Date 2015-12-04 Playtime 18h 23m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an incredible game.  It's heavily inspired by Metroid, so if you are a fan of the Metroid series, get the game now.  Although the influence of Metroid is heavy, the game is completely unique:  the story, characters, art, and music are all excellent.  I think the biggest surprise for me was the story.  The story in this game is strong and compelling, whereas the early Metroid games featured little to no story.  Aside from a few rough spots, I feel the difficulty of the game was fair.  You can expect to get 10 - 15 hours of playtime out of your first run.  Enemies in the later areas are more annoying than I would like:  they are hard to hit and drain your health quickly.  Do expect to get stuck on bosses until you learn their patterns (or watch the helpful boss guide on Steam).  There were parts where I got quite lost, and I feel that was more of a problem here than it was in any Metroid game, but it's a fairly minor complaint.  Overall, I'd give Axiom Verge a 9.5/10.  There are some frustrating bits, but it's easily the best game I've played in ages.
Date 2015-12-03 Playtime 21h 8m Rec Positive Most excellent metroid style game! and made by one dude ! impressive!!  
Date 2015-12-03 Playtime 20h 18m Rec Positive best game for the value  you have tons to do in this game and the story is awesom.  definitly buy this one !!!!
Date 2015-12-03 Playtime 1h 3m Rec Positive Отличная метройдо подобная бродилка, приятное управление и сюжет хороший.
Date 2015-12-03 Playtime 14h 16m Rec Positive Du Metroidvania sans le Vania.
Date 2015-12-02 Playtime 21h 43m Rec Positive Great game all around.  It was like reliving the first time I played Metroid, only its own take on the genre.  Love the gameplay, controls, music, art style, story, etc...  Seems very H.R. Geiger inspired, (Well Metroid was as well since it was somewhat inspired by Aliens) only this is a darker toned game.  I spent a huge chunk of my Thanksgiving weekend on this game and finding as many secrets as I could and it was worth every second.
Date 2015-12-01 Playtime 28h 57m Rec Positive I put aside Destiny and Halo 5 for this game
Date 2015-12-01 Playtime 23h 27m Rec Positive Did you like Super Metroid? You'll probably like this.
Date 2015-12-01 Playtime 15h 2m Rec Positive Quick breakdown of Axiom Verge.  It's a Metroidvania game. Heavier on the Metroid and less on the 'Vania. It has some pretty great gameplay quirks which helps separate itself from Metroid, though.  Oh. I guess if you're addicted to bishie leads from the 'Vania, you won't find that here. This guy looks like Rick Moranis and Adrian Brody had a lovechild who fell into a world inspired by Metroid and Lifeforce.  Stellar game. Recommend it 100%.
Date 2015-11-30 Playtime 17h 8m Rec Positive Axiom verge est l'un de mes GOTY de 2015. Le jeu bénéficie d'une grande direction artistique et d'une bande-son tout aussi exceptionnelle. J'ai trouvé l'écriture honnête (peut-être un peu plus mature qu'un Metroid) et permets de nous garder captivés tout au long de l'avancée.  Le level design ainsi que le gameplay ne révolutionnent en rien les metroidvania, mais que c'est bien fait ! Je trouve qu'il y a peut-être un petit peu trop de mod d'arme (qui sont pour la plupart inutiles) Le boss design est intéressant même si j'ai été un peu déçu par le boss final.  Le jeu n'est pas extrêmement long (il m'a fallu 16 heures pour le finir et 1 heure de plus pour trouver tous les items) Bref si vous aimez les metroidvania (même si on est plus proche d'un Metroid je trouve) vous devez essayer ce jeu exceptionnel créer d'A à Z par un seul homme !
Date 2015-11-30 Playtime 18h 56m Rec Positive 虽然感觉略贵，但真的很好玩啊，OST也一起入了，好好听！T—T Worth Buying!!!  那些说没剧情的估计是看的速通，SpeedRun模式是没有剧情的  再说了，像恶魔城，实际剧情很多吗？不一样是跑来跑去拿到道具终于能进某个地方了然后推进了剧情
Date 2015-11-30 Playtime 15h 6m Rec Positive best game i've played in years. tom happ is a genius.
Date 2015-11-30 Playtime 13h 34m Rec Positive Only 20 minutes in and can tell I'm going to love this game. Feels like playing Super Metroid again for the first time. Absolutely love it.  UPDATE: Just beat the game a few days ago and initial impressions held up. It's a great metroidvania title. Cool weapons, fun exploration, surprising powers, secrets galore, etc, etc. This is a real gem and anyone interested in the genre is doing themselves a disservice to skip this excellent title!
Date 2015-11-29 Playtime 10h 57m Rec Positive I was looking for game similar to Super Metroid. This game did not dissapoint!  I didn't quite know what to expect going in as I tried not to read too much up on the game as to not spoil it.  Visually the game is great. The visual cues are amazing and catch you by surprise the first time you play. Controls feel fairly solid. Double tapping in a direction is finicky with a thumbstick but works fine on d-pad. First playthrough took me just over 10 hours with 90% completion and it will be well worth going through and playing again.  I would overall give this game a 9/10 and would recommend to anyone who loves pure metroidvania games!  PS the storyline is quite nice too, its subtle and fits in well without taking over the gameplay.
Date 2015-11-29 Playtime 13h 54m Rec Positive For metroidvania lovers please heed my warning. Once you start this game you won't want to stop. Extremely rewarding gameplay for those of us who have followed the games it nods at respectfully (mainly metroid but castlevania too). The feeling of immersive environment aided by a brilliant soundtrack is reason to purchase alone. Probably my game of the year so far.
Date 2015-11-29 Playtime 15h 37m Rec Positive 这游戏有毒
Date 2015-11-29 Playtime 29h 18m Rec Positive Para guem jogou Super Metroid e curtiu, então este é um [i]must-have[/i]. Possui exatamente o mesmo conceito, mas não é um clone, o jogo possui uma história bastante cativamente e coerente. Jogabilidade fluida, mundo bastante extenso e uma fantástica trilha sonora. A tradução do jogo para Portugues também está muito boa!  Prós: - "Super Metroid" para PC - Jogabilidade ao melhor estilo 8/16 bits - Trilha sonora  Contras: - A ferramenta de garra poderia ser melhor - Não gostei do conceito de framento de power-ups
Date 2015-11-29 Playtime 5h 16m Rec Positive The similarities to Metroid are apparent very early on, but while it does play very much like classic Metroid, it still does enough to make itself stand out as well.
Date 2015-11-28 Playtime 10h 59m Rec Positive Metroid, but...not.
Date 2015-11-28 Playtime 9h 10m Rec Negative I've been very enthralled with this game. It felt so much like Metroid, the controls were solid, the puzzles where on point. One thing I like about old-school games was their reliance on being a good observer, figuring things out for yourself, using skill and repeat play to master a game.   So why am I not recommending Axiom Verge? Trolling  I'm very near the end of the game and now, suddenly, the game is not about skill or observation anymore. It's about placing enemies in spots that will compromise and kill you without notice. Super-turbocharged ghouls exploding out of the floor in places that aren't marked. Divebombing nats that attack you from off screen and take out 1/4 of your health per hit. The games no longer a challenge or fun. Now I'm being trolled by the developer and I don't like it. They took a wonderful game and ruined it by making the last level no fun to play.
Date 2015-11-28 Playtime 10h 42m Rec Positive Fantastic game that feels like a new Metroid game. Very fresh and good array of unique powerups and an interesting story. If you're a fan of Metroid or Metroidvania games, this game is one you cannot afford to miss. Took me about 10 hours on a fairly thorough first playthrough.
Date 2015-11-27 Playtime 11h 58m Rec Positive Metroid like gameplay, an interesting story, excellent old school graphics and music. Except for the final boss, that can be nearly impossible if you haven't got a good ammount of power ups (not so hard, but most of them are very well hidden, and some well... I couldn't find them), the difficulty is well balanced.  If you like metroid-vania games, this one is a must.
Date 2015-11-27 Playtime 12h 22m Rec Positive JUSTIN BAILEY works in this game. That's all you need to know if this is the kind of game that would appeal to you.
Date 2015-11-27 Playtime 35h 33m Rec Positive Однозначно, одна из лучших игр, что мне доводилось играть.  Не без недостатков, конечно, в виде изнурительных поисков секретов, но сюжет и исполнение Axiom Verge, пожалуй вносят ее в золотой пантеон. Буду рад продолжению.
Date 2015-11-26 Playtime 0h 26m Rec Negative Люблю платформеры, но это не понравилось. Да, метроидвания. И по механике неплохая... Но уж очень не понравился лабиринт. И то, что надо постоянно возвращаться, натыкаться на тупики, идти назад, потом находить новую пушку и исследовать лабиринт повторно в поисках мест, которые стали открыты с помощью нового итема...  Возможно, я из этого просто вырос, но мне не понравилось. Рефанжу.
Date 2015-11-26 Playtime 24h 33m Rec Positive Excellent game, lots of fun and lots to explore. 10 hours and I still didnt get 100% items!
Date 2015-11-26 Playtime 9h 44m Rec Positive Hautement inspiré de Metroid, disons qu Axiom verge a beaucoup de similarité avec cette série en ce qui concerne le gameplay et l atmosphère. Un des meilleurs metroidvania que j ai eu la chance de jouer. Comble un vide en attendant le retour de Samus
Date 2015-11-26 Playtime 14h 38m Rec Negative (Don't downvote just because I'm not a fan.)  Axiom Verge is an indie pixel art Metroid-vania. That means you'll be slowly amassing an aresenal of power-ups and weapons to beef up your player character, and using lateral thinking and exploration to unlock and discover new parts of it's mysterious and seemingly massive map. In Axiom Verge, by the end of the game, you'll likely have a massive weapon wheel, all with their own little quirks and benefits. You'll think about areas in a totally different way by the end of the game, as your movement options will increase exponentially. You'll chip away at the Map screen until all those squares are filled in. It's a classic, satisfying formula, and it works here. The level design matches the mechanics quite well, and the exploration feels very natural.  I adore Metroid. I remember I went on a total binge of purchasing Metroid-vanias when it became moderately clear to me that Nintendo is currently kind of neglecting the franchise. ANYWAY. Axiom Verge is a love song to Super Metroid. It's the Interstellar to 2001, in a way. It's a hard game to live up to; most consider Super Metroid to be a masterpiece. And you can tell it's likely that Thomas Happ, the creator of Axiom Verge, probably does too.   And therein lies one of the issues with the game. While there are many Metroid-vanias coming out nowadays which innovate the genre, Axiom Verge itterates does very little to distinguish itself in any truly meaningful way. Looking back, I can remember very little memorable or particularly excellent. Nothing truly bad, but nothing that had me enraptured. I thought the "Rusalka" were really cool, I remember some really neat puzzles, and the soundtrack having quite a few killer tracks, those stick out, I'll admit. But I don't really remember any unique level design. I don't really remember the name or feel of any areas (other than an area that takes place above ground). I don't really remember developing any engagement or attachment while running through its glitchpunk corridors.  But I DO remember the clearly Geiger-inspired visuals not being my cup of tea (this is ENTIRELY SUBJECTIVE, however (obviously)). I remember boss battles which were so poorly designed they seemed like jokes. I remember combat that often felt finnicky and imprecise. I remember monotonous crawls through combat areas. I remember maybe a dozen weapons I never touched after acquiring them. I remember a plot so convoluted, silly, and engrossed in itself it just came across as pretentious. But most importantly, I remember a moment in the game where a necessary item was hidden in a giant mass of breakable blocks, inside a soulless random tile. At that point, I thought to myself, "Something about this game isn't working."  Hey. Axiom Verge is by NO means a bad game. It's actually pretty good. Mechanically, the game is solid, with a few neat inventions here and there. If you're looking for a fix of Metroid like I was, this is a fine way to go. However, I would never introduce someone to the genre this way, and I find myself having trouble remembering anything I found truly notable or excellent about the game. Which I suppose isn't a bad thing. But it's not a good thing, either.   So, I guess Axiom Verge is a thing, that isn't necessarily bad, but isn't necessarily good either. Axiom Verge is a game. It's definitely a game.
Date 2015-11-26 Playtime 24h 5m Rec Positive This is exactely how I felt when playing Super Metroid as a kid. Axiom Verge scratched an itch I never thought I reach.
Date 2015-11-26 Playtime 32h 15m Rec Positive We all make mind worlds, Tom Happ entrances us inside his.
Date 2015-11-25 Playtime 14h 55m Rec Positive Simply put, Axiom Verge is the first real 2D Metroid game to come out since the SNES.
Date 2015-11-25 Playtime 19h 53m Rec Positive Solid metroidvania platformer.  Moving and shooting feels good.  Retro aesthetic, creative movement powers (no doublejump : how about glitching through walls until you fly?), and amusing dialogue.  I liked the part where something that had killed me apologized for it, and then immediately tried to suggest a third party was untrustworthy.  The story is decent, doesn't overstay its welcome, and leaves you some room to debate fine details with friends.
Date 2015-11-24 Playtime 14h 43m Rec Positive It's basically Metroid V. Buy it if you like that sort of thing.
Date 2015-11-24 Playtime 33h 0m Rec Positive Beautiful, fun, inspired game with great music. It's strange, immersive and addicting. So worth it. I have 30 hours in to it so far. Enjoyed every second.   Definitely invokes nostalgia for early 1990's console games, while having modern touches and fresh ideas. You can tell that a lot of love went in to making this game. Definitely one of my top 3 favorite games that came out in 2015.
Date 2015-11-24 Playtime 7h 17m Rec Positive Like the first Metroid but good
Date 2015-11-23 Playtime 17h 45m Rec Positive this is the best thing indie gaming has given us so far,
Date 2015-11-22 Playtime 24h 3m Rec Positive A very satisfying experience. Well worth the $20.
Date 2015-11-22 Playtime 70h 9m Rec Positive A great 2D 8 bit platformer that isn't just some variation of Metroid.  The weapons and abilities are quite creative.  The graphics are proper 8 bit style. I.e.: the environments are well detailed with a limited framework, not minimalistic blocks that many indie devs use to hide their lack of effort.
Date 2015-11-22 Playtime 9h 26m Rec Positive One of the best modern examples of a classic-style metroidvania that I've played in a long time.  Nice responsive controls. Balanced difficulty curve. Huge map to explore that rewards exploration and revisiting old areas. Cool and appropriate soundtrack. Beautiful yet creepy art style that fits in perfectly with the themes and storyline.
Date 2015-11-22 Playtime 10h 44m Rec Positive This is everything I ever wanted in a metroidvania game. I can't believe I didnt know this game existed.  It reminded me so much of Super Metroid, which is one of my favorite games.
Date 2015-11-22 Playtime 10h 31m Rec Positive This game was a great throw back to my days of super metroid. I find the story very compelling and every detail very well thought out. The game encourages exploration by placing hidden items but the developers have left cues to where items are hidden so I don't feel like I need to be lucky or consult a walk through. The controls are very tight and the weapon upgrades actually feel like worth getting. My only comment on the weapons would be that I have found the primary blaster the only weapon strong enough for most bosses and common enemies. Each of the upgrades are good for the unique angle  you can get on enemies but unless you can attack from cover I found myself only using the primary weapon. The soundtrack is amazing, game play is amazing and I would recommend this for anyone who used to love the old metroid series.
Date 2015-11-21 Playtime 23h 23m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is basically a Metroid clone and a great one at that. Thomas Happ did an excellent job in creating not just a metroidvania game, but the classic 2D Metroid game.  Just one look at Axiom Verge and you'll immediately get that Metroid feel. From the overall look & feel and level design to enemy types, weapons and play mechanics, Axiom Verge draws heavily from Nintendo's cult classic. And that is certainly a good thing in my book. This game is basically the original Metroid on steroids, made with modern tech and little to none of the annoying old limitations.  Yet, despite drawing so much from Metroid, one shouldn't dismiss just how original Axiom Verge actually is — Thomas Happ has created a unique world with interesting characters and story. Nor should anyone doubt the high quality of this game: the graphics and overall visual design are gorgeous, music and sound effects are atmospheric and fit the game perfectly, controls are spot on and everything is pretty much just right.  Just as any Metroid game should, Axiom Verge features an extensive map, which is made up from different zones, all of which feature their own design and style. As you play you will slowly uncover more and more parts of the map, with some of them becoming available to you only after you'll get new upgrades and abilities. As you would expect, there is quite a lot of platforming in this game, with some of it being rather challenging, but none of it's really unfair — if some of it may seem that way, then you probably don't have the necessary equipment yet. Unlike most metroidvania games, which almost exclusively take place in rather small enclosed areas, Axiom Verge features some broad open areas, which nicely break up the the regular flow and add some additional variety to the game.  The boss fights in Axiom Verge are exciting, with bosses being interesting and huge, in fact some of them are so huge that the screen zooms out to be able to show them completely. As with most things in this game, some bosses are better fought with particular weapons that you may not have when first encountering them, so it may be a better option to keep exploring than fighting at the first possibility. As with the bosses, enemies in this game are very interesting both in design and behaviour/attack types and patterns.  Among the more unique game mechanics in Axiom Verge is the glitch gun, which serves many different purposes (like opening up passages, traversing the map, etc), but also can modify the enemy units. Glitching the enemies causes them to change in one way or another, gaining new properties, which you can utilise for your own purposes.  All in all Axiom Verge is a great game which you definitely should play, even if you aren't a fan of the genre. It's a darn shame that almost nobody did — at the time of the review, SteamSpy estimates the sales at ~29K copies.  P.S.

Date 2015-11-21 Playtime 11h 19m Rec Positive This game is really damn good. With my only prior meteroidvania experience being Castlevania Symphony of the Night, I didn't know if I'd like a sci-fi one. The visuals in the game ALMOST look like they would belong on an NES, but just barely make it to the 16 bit look due to multiple layers of scrolling, and amounts of color on screen (would probably be on a turbografix 16/pc engine). I got this game through Indiebox, and I'm glad I did, because I got a bunch of stuff, including a map of the game, which helped out a lot. I only really have 3 issues with this game. The first one, is backtracking. This metroidvania doesn't really have a teleportation system, exept for the INDI area, which is a glorified version of a teleporter that takes longer than one. I didn't mind the backtracking too much, but it's something to keep in mind when buying this game. Second is the PC port. I think the PC port is fine for the most part, but I'm experiencing an issue where when I'm simply playing the game, my computer doesn't recognise my controller's input as an input to the computer, so it goes into sleep mode. This is really annoying, but it can be circumvented by using big picture mode (even though it's inconvinient). My third issue is the end. I'm not going to spoil anything here, but this isn't one of those game where you feel acomplished at the end for overcoming what you faced, at least not to the extent of a lot of other games. Other than those issues, I can reccomend this game. I'd personally wait untill it's on sale to get it, but if you like super metroid/metroid/metroidvania games, then you'll like this one.
Date 2015-11-21 Playtime 10h 45m Rec Positive Solid game, reminds a lot the old Metroid games with huge maps to explore, a lot of guns, monsters, secrets and bosses
Date 2015-11-20 Playtime 27h 10m Rec Positive tl;dr: Axiom Verge is an excellent Metroidvania, among the best of those not made by Nintendo or Konami. It isn't completely flawless, but if you're looking for something to scratch that itch, this is it.  More details: Axiom Verge is a great game, and basically none of the complaints I saw on the negative reviews here at steam seemed to be even factually correct by my own experience. It has contra-style aiming, there's a decent number of bosses, which are for the most part clever and interesting; the game has plenty of challenge to it and lots of things to discover. It's largely completionist-friendly: There is nothing missable; there are some bonus areas that appear in random locations but they don't count for the game's "official" 100%, which is good enough for me. Playing this game is fun and satisfying; there are puzzles everywhere, many of which have more than one intriguing solution.  There are a few complaints, mainly falling toward the end of a game, and none of them really make me not want to play it again.  The story ends in a somewhat unsatisfying way; I like the mystery of it, but it leaves too many questions completely unanswered, even after reading all of the notes. It tries to be a story people talk about and try to figure out, but it feels like it was written without even the author knowing the truth behind everything. I prefer stories with satisfying conclusions: The universe is saved, you win, that sort of thing; even leaving some hints that things aren't as they seem alongside something like that would be better. The final boss was a breeze, which should never be the case. To be clear, I had 100% of the items in the game, but that's no excuse. By comparison, the final bosses of Metroid Fusion and Zero Mission are so tough that unless you went out of your way to get more items than you normally run across or are just ridiculously good at it you'll probably get killed, and the latter is made even harder if the player has 100%. In this case, the section before the final boss was harder than the boss itself. After the challenge and cleverness of most of the earlier bosses, this was a bit of a let-down. There were some really clever puzzles with the game's "glitch gun" that alters the behavior of enemies it hits in the last section, and I really wish the game had more puzzles like that, possibly replacing some basic "gotcha" items in non-obvious walls.  Overall, though, it was fun. I never really had a complaint while I was playing the game, and what complaints I have come up with were on reflection rather than in the experience. You should buy it.
Date 2015-11-19 Playtime 20h 16m Rec Positive it's all clever in the way it does mechanics and the story is real good and the gameplay is super good and it is full of exploration and rewards you for doing the things you want to do anywayt
Date 2015-11-19 Playtime 10h 51m Rec Positive Mon coup de coeur de l'année ! Un jeu qui rappelle ce qu'on pouvait avoir dans les années 90. Bon level design, musique très bien réalisées, bonne maniabilité, armes et compétences sympa... Je le conseille fortement !!
Date 2015-11-19 Playtime 43h 47m Rec Positive Every time I keep thinking I've found everything, I'm handed a new toy to play with, and end up discovering somewhere new. Simply amazing levels of depth to this take on the classic 8-bit metroid/castlevania-like style, with a great story as an added bonus.   Everyone should try this game.  10/10
Date 2015-11-18 Playtime 15h 37m Rec Positive Sehr, sehr cooler Tribut an die Metroid-Reihe mit exzellentem Soundtrack. Wer die Reihe kennt oder/und sehr gerne auf Entdeckungstour geht, sollte UNBEDINGT reinschauen.  Andere, die durch solche Games nur fix durchrennen und dann weglegen, denen würde ich eher andere Spiele empfehlen. Weil in Sachen Story und Leveldesign isses prinzipiell nicht schlecht (Stichwort Secrets), es könnte aber an manchen Stellen noch etwas besser sein. Die Levels bieten oftmals wenig "Einzigartiges" in Sachen Plattforming.  Die Steuerung für eine gewisse Fähigkeit im späteren Spiel ist nicht ideal gelöst, da man zweimal hintereinander eine Pfeiltaste drücken muss. Mit dem Xbox 360-Pad hat es mich nicht gestört, kann aber durchaus Leute verstehen, die dann ungewollt den Skill einsetzen. Das sind die einzigen größeren Kritikpunkte, die ich an Axiom Verge auszusetzen hätte.  Dafür sind die Abschnitte atmosphärisch, schön abwechslungsreich und vom Gegnerdesign ziemlich gut umgesetzt. Mit dem Address Disruptor kann man Gegner ähnlich wie bei Grafikfehlern von frühen Konsolenspielen "glitchen", die sich dann ganz anders verhalten, z. B. Lebensenergie geben oder sich in benutzbare Plattformen verwandeln. Experimentieren lohnt sich! Es wird zudem für einige Geheimnisse benötigt.  Und der Soundtrack ist einfach fantastisch. Wer auch nur ansatzweise für Videospiel-Musik zu haben ist, dem brennt sich der OST sehr schnell ins Hirn. Sehr eingängigen Melodien, die wunderbar zu den Leveln passen. Dass die Lebensanzeige immer passend zum Rhtyhmus der Musik pulsiert, ist ein nettes kleines Detail.  Weiter positiv sind die wirklich vielen Waffen hervorzuheben, auch wenn man nicht alle von denen jemals benutzt. In manchen Situation kann es durchaus hilfreich sein, mal eine andere Wumme auszuprobieren, etwa bei den Bossen, die die Kämpfe teilweise spürbar einfacher machen. Generell ist das kein Hardcore-Roguelike und auch kein Dark Souls, die Speicherpunkte sind fair verteilt, dafür hält Tracer nicht allzuviele Treffer aus. Wenn man nicht blind vorprescht, ist ein Durchkommen absolut kein Problem, bis auf 1-2 Bosse, wo ich mehrere Versuche gebraucht hatte.  Vom Umfang brauchte ich knapp 11 Stunden inkl, letztem Boss und Suchen nach einigen Items, bis ich durch war. Und es fehlen noch 9% an Gegenständen sowie 3% der Karte, die ich unbedingt noch haben will. Wobei fairerweise auch Nintendo mit ihren Metroid-Spielen selten so viel mehr Umfang hat(te) und die Titel zum Vollpreis verkauft hat. Und dank Speedrun-Option und Hardmode in Axiom Verge plus dem Entdecken aller Items relativiert sich der Preis wieder.  Wen die Ecken und Kanten an dem Spiel nicht stören, kann bedenkenlos zugreifen. Sonst würde ich auf einen Sale warten. Auf jeden Fall hat es mir sehr gut gefallen. Unterm Strich ein klares "Daumen hoch".  Ich möchte ein Axiom Verge 2!
Date 2015-11-18 Playtime 12h 12m Rec Positive 玩着像银河战士，就是拿到了道具不知道什么情况用，卡了关到处跑不知道该去哪...（虽然银河战士我也有卡关但这个游戏真是...) 不过这游戏还是挺好玩的，boss战也需要找出弱点来打，玩银河战士那种慢慢探索地图搜集道具的乐趣完全可以再次体验。 比起恶魔城还是更像银河战士吧，嗯。 要说缺点的话就是没有手柄不好操作，强烈推荐弄个手柄玩这游戏！
Date 2015-11-18 Playtime 8h 44m Rec Positive having played many metroid games, and a few contra games i have to say Axiom verge is a perfect mix between the two. the difficulty isn't NES level hard, but its still keeps you on your toes. the best part about this game is the new elements it brings to metroidvania genre that i won't give away. the music is great, its a mix of NES-chiptune and Dark 80's synthesizer.  i have to admit i just bought the game and this is more like a first impression but i have to say i'm not disappointed so far, and i do recommend this game. especially if you grew up in the 90's and love: pixels, chiptune music, metroid games, and great classic gameplay with new elements!  
Date 2015-11-18 Playtime 3h 14m Rec Positive love the game heres my 2 cents on axiom verge... an overview of game settings and walkthrough to first boss no spoilers! enjoy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlRmm6-Wc0Y
Date 2015-11-18 Playtime 55h 4m Rec Positive 10/10 - shut up and give this game your money already. NES Metroid has a baby with an HR Giger painting... mix in a bit of surrealist Poe and even a bit of HPL-inspired character design, and you just might cry because it's such a beautiful thing.
Date 2015-11-17 Playtime 10h 28m Rec Positive The best metroidvania of indias what I ever played. The physics theme gives a curious and peculiar atmosphere to the game,its easy to involve in the axiom verge universe.
Date 2015-11-17 Playtime 13h 28m Rec Positive I never thought a metroid clone like this will give me genuine, intense chills.  Gameplay is always somewhere between good and at least passable (even though you still have to be into the rather "oldschool" platforming experience). The weakest part of gameplay are certainly the bosses, some almost ridiculously easy, some just frustrating to deal with. Plenty of opportunities for exploration and discovering secrets, yadda yadda, it's metroid, but imho, better.  The visuals are very nicely crafted, honest to the games they are clearly inspired by, yet still certainly without using it as an excuse to not to put effort where it's needed.  The amount of content is very reasonable for the price of the game, I managed a measly 60% weapon found/area discovered  playthrough in some odd 14 hours. In the age of $60 games with 5 hour total playthrough of a linear, transparent campaign, that's definitely a very good mileage.   But it's the atmosphere and ominous lore, secrets you discover (or don't discover and are forced to guess), that make the game truly shine. I have to admit, the game let far more ends loose than I wish it did, but maybe that's something others might appreciate. The themes are certainly thought provoking, and I would go as far as call the atmosphere somewhat similar to SOMA at times.  For the price it goes at, definitely a worthy pickup for anybody who can at least tolerate a metroid clone-like gameplay. And lets hope it will get a sequel as foreshadowed, both in the game and IRL by the developer himself.

Date 2015-11-17 Playtime 25h 7m Rec Positive Axiom Verge --- メトロイドヴァニアとしての高い完成度、ドット・チップチューンへの熱意、神秘的な世界観  始めにはっきり書かせていただくと、このゲームは非常に面白い。 ジャンルとしてはいわゆる「メトロイドヴァニア」だが、アクション部分の反応がよく、マップの造りや操作キャラクターに対する全体の広さも丁度よい。この辺りが複雑なためにプレイ感覚がよくない作品は少なくない（例えば、本家のコンチェルトとか…ゴホゴホ）。 しかしAxiomVergeでは、一度のプレイでひたすらさ迷ったり主人公の動かしづらさにイライラしたりすることは無いだろう。後半の自由度が増した局面で、どこに行けばいいか迷うことはあるかも知れないけれども（それはメトロイドヴァニアの楽しみの一つ）。  アクション面を気にする人へ。このゲームは最近流行の「コントローラーをガチャガチャして忍者のように動く」タイプのメトロイドヴァニアではない。どちらかというと、操作感を良くした初代メトロイド+少しだけ悪魔城ドラキュラX月下という感じ。超絶技巧を活かす場面は少ないけれど、堅実に動かしつつクリアするという古典的なアクションゲームの楽しさを思い出させてくれる。 私は携帯機の悪魔城のような、練習次第で物凄いグリッチも実践し放題というのも好きだが、AxiomVergeはそういう類のゲームではないことは注意しておく。  このゲームのレトロ感を魅力に感じた人へ。基本的なグラフィックはドットベースであり、かつその中に作者独自の世界観がふんだんに盛り込まれている。このドットワークに文句をつけられる人はなかなかいないのではないだろうか？ともかく、「ドットで動く可愛らしいアニメキャラがいなければダメ」という人以外になら魅力的な世界を提供してくれるはずだ。作中にRusalkiという「ドットで動く可愛げのあるSFキャラ」がいるから、そちらを堪能してほしい。 音楽については少し異なる。現在流行している、今風の音楽をチップチューンでブリブリ鳴らすというタイプのBGMはあまり多くない。その代わりに、作者の思い描くAxiomVergeの世界観を演出するオリエンタル風の音楽が多い。これを良いと感じるかどうかは人次第だと思うので、まずはプレイして、気に入ったらサウンドトラックを買う、という程度で良いだろう。  世界観に惹かれたという方へ。生物的、宗教的神秘を感じさせる登場人物や背景、宇宙的な不可思議を科学的なフレーバーと共に紡ぐストーリー、断片的にゲーム内に登場する異世界の文化。これらは古き良き「取扱説明書を読みつつ世界観を自分で作っていくRPG」を髣髴とさせる。ゲーム的な部分でケチがつくことはおそらく無いだろうし、この独特の味わいをまずは楽しんでみてはどうだろうか。 ただし、いわゆる色々あったけどみんな幸せになって終わり、といった単純明快な作品ではないことはここに注意しておく。 それと、このゲームは日本語に対応していないので、それほど難しい英語ではないもののその面では苦労するかもしれない。  やり込み要素が気になる方へ。これについては、標準的なレベルのやり込み要素があると言っておこう。ノーマルとハードの二つの難易度、一部分かりづらいアイテムの回収、タイムアタックモードなど一通りは揃っている。異なる主人公を操作するモードなどは無いが、このクラシカルなゲーム性を考えれば、主なやり込みはタイムアタックになるだろうか。  最後に、一つだけ不満点を書いておこう。このゲームには、シーケンスブレイクが無い（実はタイムアタック用に少しだけあるが）。 メトロイドヴァニアというと華の一つがシーケンスブレイクであり、ボスを逆順に倒したり途中を全て飛ばして最強装備から集めたりと色々できるものが楽しい場合が多いのだが、AxiomVergeにはそういった楽しみは無い。これはよくデバッグされていることの証拠でもあるので欠点としてあげるのは正しくない気もするが、褒めるだけだと胡散臭く見えるかもしれないのでこじつけておこう。
Date 2015-11-16 Playtime 18h 20m Rec Positive I'm not going to write a fully in depth review of this. There are plenty already and there is loads of footage on youtube for your viewing pleasure.  If you're reading this, you are probably somewhat interested by now. What I will say is that as a big fan of Metroidvanias ever since I played Super Metroid as a kid, this game delivers. I don't throw around Super Metroid lightly, that game is still one of the all time greats, not only in its genre, but amongst all games and I consider Axiom Verge to be in the same rank.  I have yet to complete the game, but my experience so far, exploring, collecting weapons and upgrades, trying out new powers in previously seen areas has been a joy. The story so far has me asking myself "WTF!?" and exclaiming "oooooh sheeeeeet!" and I expect there are more twists and turns to come. The graphics are lovely, a really nicely crafted pixel art style with some modern effects and I really like the glitch motif. The soundtrack has a nice moody sci-fi electro vibe (I bought the soundtrack and actually have to stop myself listening to it all the way through as to not spoil the aural aspect of the game). The weapons and upgrades are mostly unique and interesting, some are your standard fare (rapid fire, spread shot, high jump, etc.) others are rarely if ever seen in a game (I don't want to spoil anything). There are however a couple that don't seem to have anything much special over another already equipped weapon (out of the 8/9 weapons I have found, maybe 3 of them seem a little redundant).   All in all, I am really satisfied with Axiom Verge. If something goes horribly wrong between now and when I complete it, I will update this review, but I can't even imagine how big of a fuck up would be necessary to diminish the enjoyment I've had so far. If you're looking for a game that is not "just another Metroidvania" but actually a game that can stand next to Super Metroid, this is it.   Update: I have just completed the game (stats: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=559445841), and I can safely say that it didn't disappoint. Definitely going to replay on hard mode.

This is on my very first playthrough, total 13h run with 6 deaths on "normal"  This is my favorite style of game, if I could give it a rating I'd give it a 5/5.

Date 2015-11-16 Playtime 13h 45m Rec Positive This is probably the best game I've played in years.  I've got bad ADD and it's hard for me to stay focused on one game for more then a few hours  but this one kept me coming back for more!  You owe it to your self to play this if your into Super Metroid.  Yeah, it's pretty close to it on most levels but it's still different enough to be fresh.
Date 2015-11-15 Playtime 13h 36m Rec Positive This game is a love letter to Metroid games of the past, particularly Super Metroid. I adored this game to the very core. It has fantastic art design, an interesting story, and the music is top notch. Serious, I am considering getting the OST. Everything about this game is superb, and even accomodates speedrunner gamers with a Speedrun mode (not sure how it works, haven't tried it myself yet). I highly recommend this game.
Date 2015-11-15 Playtime 24h 24m Rec Positive At first glance, Axiom Verge looks to be a direct copy of Metroid. You start on a strange alien planet with nothing more than your wits. Progression comes by acquiring new abilities that give you access to new areas. The world eventually opens up, and there are lots of places to explore and secrets to uncover.  Very quickly, however, Axiom Verge subverts your expectations of a game of this sort, especially if you've played Metroid before. You'll see blocks and places and think "Oh, I'll use bombs here" or "I'll get a morph ball later". By the second ability you get, the game gives you a completely different way to progress past them. The methods of travel and manipulation tools you get crazier as you go on, and like any good entry in the genre, by the end you can zoom around and steamroll enemies with ease.  Getting there will be a long road, as the game puts up a decent challenge at its regular difficulty. The regular enemies start off simple enough, but later ones have attacks and abilities that will catch you off guard the first time you encounter them. While you can brute force your way through them, knowing your abilities and weapons will give you an easier time when dealing with them. The bosses don't evolve quite as much, but they mostly manage to be intense, fun encounters. If you love exploration and puzzles, this game has you covered as well, as some of the most difficult secrets will require you to know the game's mechanics and require you to pay careful attention to your surroundings to claim your rewards.  The exploration and fights are a pleasant experience since the presentation is excellent. The world of Axiom Verge looks very nice and retro, with a style that gives an appropriately otherworldly feel, and even manages to make graphical glitches significant. The music has an old-school feel, and like the graphics manages to evoke the feel of a wondrous,  unfamiliar place.  The high points Axiom Verge hits makes the low points all the more glaring. The coolness of the best items makes the ones that aren't as subversive or useful that much more disappointing. While each map looks great on its own, they don't connect together well, with one example being an area with a night sky connected to an area with a daytime sky. The story has potential, and looks like it might go in some interesting directions, but it drops plot points and world elements as quickly as it introduces them. In the end, most of the consequences of the game's events are waved away, although the ones that aren't leave things open for interpretation.  Even then, the flaws don't detract enough from the game's best moments. Axiom Verge is a great experience that looks like a straight tribute to Metroid, but eventually forges its own path, and largely succeeds at it. If you enjoy big exploration-based sci-fi adventures, this comes highly recommended.
Date 2015-11-15 Playtime 14h 20m Rec Positive Ive been waiting for a good 2D side scrolling Metroidvania game for years and Tom Happ delivered.  Axiom Verge is a fantastic game that oozes creativity.

Date 2015-11-15 Playtime 21h 57m Rec Positive i dont like metrovania games, and this is very good, very engaging with an almost immediate sense of progression.
Date 2015-11-15 Playtime 9h 2m Rec Positive Yo dawg, we heard you like Metroid!  Well this is metroid, but fresher. You think you're about to get a space jump but you instead get teleporting. You think you're gonna get the run ability and then you get a dope laser drill.  If I have to find a fault, I'd say there's a distinct lack of a secret boss. That said, there's tons of stuff to pick up, find, discover and play with.  So yeah, if you like Metroid, you're gonna have an awesome 10 hour field day with this one, especially if you're into speedrunning and completionining.
Date 2015-11-15 Playtime 8h 33m Rec Positive Metroidvania done right. This game is really pretty, and well made!
Date 2015-11-15 Playtime 18h 54m Rec Positive This game is great & I'm sure it will be compared with many other classics, but I will try to avoid that out of respect for the developer's originality. Of which you will find much.  Pros: -Interesting story -Creepy & isolated environment -Tight controls -Challenging  Cons: -I would like to decide my allegiance to determine the ending -Not enough starting abilities for sequence breakage -Too many useless weapons  The game gives you a variety of abilities to menuever the environment which keeps things interesting especially so for speedrunning. I just wish there were some hidden starting abilities.  While there is a lot of weapon variety many of them end up being useless. They don't rack up the kind of damage or range that either the lightning shotgun (the third weapon) and the starting weapon will do.  I was very dissipointed with the ending. I really wanted to have the main character change their mind or find some way to do it, but it appears there is only the one ending where I think the protagonist honestly acted quite foolish which goes against their supposed character of a critically thinking scientist.  But I can't say to not get this game. It has so much going for it. You will not be dissipointed if you like any similar games. The music at the very least is pretty good and as far as gameplay there are few that are as good in the genre. Get it now! Highly recommended.    I have a controller that works now, but that does not change the fact that I did originally leave a review that warranted my refund. I still must warn that this game will not work with a variety of Direct Input controllers. That's actually VERY helpful for a developer to know about this issue and yet I got 15 fanboys to say this review was "unhelpful".   All I have to say to you guys is... do you want to help make the game worse? Do you want less people to play? Really, get a hold of yourselves ya dweebs, complaints are a necessity to improvement & I hope the dev is actually able to see it this time without a brigade of overly defensive fanatics pretending the product is perfect.  Original review:  Sadly this game does not support my Mayflash converted Gamecube controller. Works fine in other games, but would not respond in this one. Until I can use my preferred controller I'll be keeping my money. It might be a good game, but I can't play it at all on keyboard so it effectively does not work.
Date 2015-11-15 Playtime 14h 57m Rec Positive Fan-f*cking-tastic.  This game hearkens back to the days of 8-bit/16-bit open-world, nonlinear adventure platformers that--  Okay, let's address the elephant in the room: it's f*cking Metroid, except modernized and frankly better in some respects.  It also has a unique and different and kind of mysterious story that I'm still in the process of uncovering.  I can't tell you if the payoff is worth it in that respect, but I'm definitely interested in what's happening in this world.  But seriously, it plays a LOT like oldschool 2D Metroid games, with its own unique flavor of abilities, weapons, techniques, secrets, and interesting mechanics.  Seriously this game is just very cool.  Secrets to find, previously-locked-out areas due to abilities you haven't found yet, well-hidden secrets that are well worth searching for, etc.  This is the quintessential adventure game, taking me back to a time when that term meant something that is almost a lost art today.  This is a really great game, and I highly recommend it on sale or otherwise to anyone who enjoyed SNES-era adventure/platformer kinda games.
Date 2015-11-15 Playtime 61h 41m Rec Positive wow, what an awesome game.  if you loved supermetroid and castlevania symphony of the night, GET THIS GAME!!!!!!  it looks kind of cheesy on the trailors but trust me (and other positive reviewers) this game is worth every penny.  i litterally cant put it down its so addicting.  theres tons of hidden secrets and powerups to find and the boss fights are really well done, they actually take some stratagy and some skill to beat.   graphics are old school, but it litterally is the closest thing you are gona get to a super metroid 2.      the sound is awesome, the music really gets you in the mood.   the storyline so far is really wierd and creepy, it keeps me glued to my seat the whole time.   the game litterally mapped all my controls for me somehow with my logitech gamepad, i was pretty happy with that, i love the controls, remind me alot of super metroids setup i didnt change a thing.  get this game, its awesome!!!  
Date 2015-11-14 Playtime 5h 5m Rec Positive Great game. If you like Metroid, you WILL like this game. It's a fresh take on the genre and comes with many new ideas. The music is great. The story is OK .. Actually the story is good, but the way it's presented kinda doesn't make sense.. but whatever the game is great and you should get it.  Play with a controller.
Date 2015-11-14 Playtime 5h 46m Rec Positive This is probably the greatest homage to Metroid Ive ever seen. Its just beautiful. Its a standard 2d Metroidvania with mazelike maps, areas you cant get to until you get certain powerups, backtracking, savepoints, many different interesting weapons and items. That all is pretty vanilla for the genre. The story is minimal (so far) but is interesting enough to make me want to keepo uncovering more of the plot. You are a scientist who was performing some kind of high-energy beam experiment when *dun dun dun* something went horribly wrong and the building you were in collapsed on your head. But instead of dying you got sucked into a world that looks like one of Geiger's fever dreams. You have no idea why you're here and you hear a voice in your head...   What makes it beyond awesome is the atmosphere and music. Creepy biomech monsters and pulsing slimy organic-looking masses in the background seem like something right out of Aliens or Metroid, and a driving electronic musical score that perfectly matches the creepy bio-alien feel. Its Metroid if Metroid was done by an indie studio in 2015. Its pixel art, but very very well made pixel art with modern depth and DPI. The controls are fluid and very well executed which is always an absolute requirement in a game like this, and the controller mapping is fully customizable. If you f'd a jump or got hit,  its your fault, not the fault of the controls. That is a breath of fresh air in and of itself.  Theres a whole other aspect of the game I haven't even experienced yet, something about "glitches". You encounter areas where the graphics are glitched out, and eventually you aquire a power that allows you to inteact with them. I cant wait to see what thats about!  This is hands down one of the best Metroidvanias (emphasis on the Metroid) I've ever seen. Screw all those FPS Wii Metroids, *this* is the true sequel.
Date 2015-11-14 Playtime 26h 50m Rec Positive Nothing short of excellent in almost every department.   You want meaningful exploration? Check  Excellent controls and tight combat? Check  Deeply atmospheric music and setting? Check.   If Metroidvania means something positive to you, buy this game.
Date 2015-11-14 Playtime 15h 8m Rec Positive Best game ever, but it crash every 10 minutes and I lose all my progress. If you can't make a game that does not crahs, at least give us a save-anywhere.
Date 2015-11-14 Playtime 51h 44m Rec Positive Ótima aventura vintage, recomendo!
Date 2015-11-13 Playtime 16h 28m Rec Negative I'd like to preface this by saying I did enjoy playing this game, but Steam asks if I would reccomend it.  I would not, read on to learn why.  Kind of saddens me to not reccomend this game to be honest, it's very well crafted but there's only so much bull shit a man can take.  Regular enemies that take way too much damage, frustrating bosses, a dash mechanic that would be awesome if it had a dedicated button rather than having to tap away on the d-pad, weapons that don't really add a whole lot to the game.  I love the Metroid series which this pays homage to in many regards but honestly I feel this game pales in comparison.   It's like the developer played Super Metroid and though it wasn't diffuicult enough.  This game is more like Metroid than super Metroid, it's progressive in terms of scope and variety of pick ups, but a complete step backwards in terms of approachability.  Filling your game with enemies with too much health and unavoidable attacks just saps all the fun out of it and the bosses later on are just awful.  I would even argue that the exploratory nature of the game is hamstrung at a certain point I wanted to go back to explore old areas and find items so I could get more health to help ease the pain of a boss fight, but I was trapped in one area until I beat said boss and collected a certain item.     The visual design is excellent but the music is so-so it loops quickly and repeats often so even the tracks I enjoyed I got sick of fairly quickly.  All things considered it's not a terrible game, but I can't reccomend it to my friends, it's frustrating, time consuming and can often seem unrewarding.  Die hard fans of the genre will probably still enjoy this game however.
Date 2015-11-13 Playtime 1h 0m Rec Negative As someone who's grown up with the original Contra, Metroid, and Megaman I understand your tastes toward fleshy alien atmospheres. A lot of the environments in the game are quite visually striking too, albeit a bit self-indulgent. Lately that's the only thing that kept me going through the game.   But even so, the design of these maps are painfully outdated. The original metroid could get away with endless vertical climbs and recycled enemies with boosted health because of hardware limitations. I hate to use this cliche', but it's 2015, level design must have meaning (I'm talking to the thoughless amount of dead ends through corridors in Axiom Verge) many of the places I jump to, have no meaning, no puzzle, it wastes the player's time.   What made metroidvania games so good in the past, was their incredibly fast pacing and constant gratification of finding secrets throughout the map. Some of those "metroidvania" traits exist here, but they are too far apart, or you're busy jumping to a place that leads to a dead end. It's a horrible paradox to make such bad mistakes in level design, then forcing the player to explore it.   This review is critical on purpose, because your style enticed me- "Megaman, Metroid and Contra all packed into one, this game was created by someone who appreciates videogames" or so I thought.   This game has the clunky shooting of the original Megaman (you can't run while shooting down, you must stand still everytime you want to shoot) and the painstaking backtracking of the original Metroid.   You obviously have a talent for creating spawling alien atmospheres, you're an artist, I appreciate your tastes. I see you made this thing all my yourself too but you must have input from other people, especially for map design.   Don't recommend.
Date 2015-11-13 Playtime 13h 48m Rec Positive Wow. Too few games can be this enjoyable.   I bought this game on sale like a loser, the developer deserves as much $ as you can spare. I was so engrossed with this game that I beat it within 2 days after purchase, and I am definitely one of those guys that leaves games unfinished for awhile just to savour them. No such chance with this game, it was that good.  I cannot emphasis how highly I recommend this game! :thumb: A must-buy for anyone that enjoys Metroidvanias
Date 2015-11-13 Playtime 12h 43m Rec Positive A lot of people seem to call this game a love letter to "metroidvania", and I can't fault them for that. This is one person's attempt to create a truly modern 2D Metroid-like game, using all the lessons learned from the best of the best in genre and adding new elements, that weren't tried in the genre before. This game has exciting exploration, varied locales, fantastic soundtrack, unique visuals that mix old-school 8bit and 16bit era art with subtle modern effects, surprisingly good challenge for the most part and a very interesting atmosphere that can probably be summarised as "sci-fi adventure as if Another World/Out of This World was designed by H.R. Giger".  It's not without flaws or questionable decisions. Challenge in the opening parts, before some upgrades, feels higher than you'd expect from a Metroid-like game, with action not being tight enough to justify that. Boss battles look great, but only 2 actually feel fun to play, with most others just being "shoot shoot shoot die already it's getting annoying shoot shoot" deals. Game features some random elements in the way of "Secret Worlds", which, in concept, are cool, but make the "exploration" part of the genre most loved for it, a bit less rewarding, because the areas are random and you have no chance of getting everything in one run. Some of the navigation moves just feel clunky to pull off, especially the very important one, that requires directional double-tap - most of the run-and-shoot actually plays better with an analogue stick, but these are very hard to pull off and are frustrating even on a d-pad, no matter what gamepad you use. And finally, the story and dialogue feel rather averagly written, which is sad simply because the setup and situations they show are actually very interesting. So, story, while often predictable, is exciting to experience and the world lore is out there to be found, but both are just told in a very mediocre way.  That said, the game is still fantastic, especially due to its innovation in treating death more like a... well, Souls game, I guess will be the most understandable comparison. That is - death does bring you back to the last save room you used, but you keep all the unlocked map squares, items and everything that is permanently done (like killing a boss or triggering a cutscene) stays done. This, along with the idea that enemies do not respawn immidiatelly after leaving the room and instead after you move two rooms away, makes exploration so much more fun, while not simplifying the rules to the point, where it gets boring.  One of the best recent games in genre which, while probably isn't as full of awesomeness as La-Mulana or Aquaria, still feels like a solid "proper full game" that you'd get full priced 15 years ago and love it. A real treat for anyone who wants to explore some amazing worlds in Metroid style.
Date 2015-11-13 Playtime 16h 22m Rec Positive Awsome game but i recomend that you check it out on indiebox eher you can get a physical copy of the game!!!!!
Date 2015-11-12 Playtime 28h 59m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is an absolute masterpiece. It is a love letter to the 8/16-bit metroidvania games, and in my opinion it is every bit as good as they are. The graphics, sound, music, and atmosphere are just perfect. I really can't say enough good about this game. It's easy to imagine an alternate history where this game was released on the Genesis as Sega's answer to Super Metroid. Play it!
Date 2015-11-12 Playtime 11h 9m Rec Positive When it comes to “Axiom Verge” there are two certainties, one it’s a complex and challenging experience, and two it’s down right addicting. Axiom Verge is game that pays homage to the Metroidvania genre, made famous in the 90’s by games like Super Metroid and Castlevania. If still unfamiliar with either of the titles the primary objective of the game is to explore an environment slowly acquiring new equipment in order to traverse other parts of the map. Axiom Verge excels at recreating what made those games so special.   the 2D side scrolling gameplay is a wonderful compliment to the vibrant colors in each of the different areas. As the player traverses the game’s many different environments a massive sense of nostalgia is bound to kick in as every sound and pixel is reminiscent of the past games. There is a real feeling of retro gaming, but like most modern games there is a wonderful twist.   Axiom Verge is a game that pays excellent homage to games of the past like Metroid and Castlevania while still doing it’s own thing. The map may be confusing at times, but Axiom Verge is still an amazingly addicting experience.
Date 2015-11-11 Playtime 5h 12m Rec Positive If you are looking for a new METRIOD with the feel of the original then this is a game should meet your expectations. I haven't played it much yet (beat first couple of bosses, been through several different areas), but it is off to a great start.  +Nice classic nes sci-fi soundtrack +Good metrovania graphics +Good save system +Soid controls +Cool upgrades Decent enemies so far Decent difficulty Decent searching/puzzles Reasonable price  -9/10 so far
Date 2015-11-11 Playtime 15h 13m Rec Positive Okay, so... To be perfectly clear, I'm thumbing up the game BARELY because the price is out of control. I got it on sale for $14 and that's a lot closer to what it's worth.  This is a metroidvania (clearly) and is more similar to the original metroid in aesthetic and exploration than most recent entries. Unfortunately some of the upgrades are very nice but others fall very flat. Specifically, the primary weapon is a bit ridiculous. There are serveral types of "beam" that you can pick up, but you can only have two equipped at once and toggle between them without going to the menu. Further, they're all really very boring weapons. I found myself relying mainly on the first gun until I got the other one that shoots straight for long distances, then my alt weapon was the one that could penetrate walls a little. Not very exciting. Another annoying design quirk is the "lock" button. In Metroid games you can lock your firing angle in various ways depending on which entry in the series you're playing, but in Axiom Verge you hold a button to lock your position instead, so the d-pad controls firing angle instead of movement. Look, the Metroid systems aren't perfect, but they allow for highly mobile combat and they feel natural. The position lock in this game is immersion breaking, even after having been used to it for a couple hours.  Some of the other items are quite nice though. Instead of a morph ball you get a remote drone that you can fire and then control. It can go just about anywhere so long as it's not blocked by high jumps or otherwise un-navigable terrain. You can even leave the area you left your body in and continue exploring. When the drone dies or self-destructs you return to your body. That's pretty neat, really.  The other main items are a disruptor and a laser drill. The laser drill is kind of a more convenient version of Metroid's bomb weapon - mainly intended to break holes in certain walls. The disruptor works to corrupt the reality of certain blocks or enemies and can make some interesting things happen when used in the right place. For example, there's one enemy that looks like a big coral and shoots out annoying projectiles that fly around in random directions. If you get the leve 2 disruptor you can corrupt it and it shoots out health instead.  The length of the game isn't too bad. I've been playing for a few hours and I'm at less than 20%. I'm smart enough to not use a guide/FAQ until after I've beat the game though, so YMMV if you spoil yourself.  Anyway, it's [i]certainly[/i] not worth $20. At this point I'd say that the $14 I paid for it is about right for a metroidvania fan.
Date 2015-11-11 Playtime 12h 48m Rec Positive メトロイド系。面白い。オススメ。曲が良い。レベルデザインも丁寧に作られている。  UIがちょっと不親切(Xboxのコントローラー使う事前提)なのが気になるが、JoyAdapterなどの変換ツールを使えばプレイ可能。探索重視よりはアクション寄り。難易度は易しめ。  少々グロテスクながら、雰囲気は抜群。ストーリーは少し謎めいている。良い!
Date 2015-11-11 Playtime 23h 16m Rec Positive This game scratches the niche itch of NES Nostalgia Metroidvania games. The game play is similar to older style NES/SNES 2D platforming and may not hold up to current 2022 Metroidvania's. (e.g. Hollow Knight, Metroid Dread etc). The enemies are not overly difficult and the tech progression is fun. I enjoyed it but it's not for everyone. Older style gameplay may be a turn off for those wanting more complex mechanics.
Date 2015-11-10 Playtime 31h 34m Rec Positive I am 25 years old, and I buy Luchables. I dont have children, so I buy the Lunchables for myself. I really enjoy the nacho ones, but I will sometimes have to eat some of the chips plain, because there is not enough cheese for all of the chips, and I dont like the salsa
Date 2015-11-10 Playtime 1h 33m Rec Positive This game is fantastic. If you have ever played and enjoyed the original Metroid this will tickle your fun bags. The feel is classic NES but the story is pretty cool. I highly reccomend this game.
Date 2015-11-10 Playtime 17h 51m Rec Positive I was having a nice time with Axiom Verge until I got the drill and then I had a great time.
Date 2015-11-10 Playtime 12h 59m Rec Positive TL;DR A loveletter to the Metroid series written in caligraphy on fine parchment.   Spoiling as little as possible, I highly recommend this game if you like Metroid style games. The asthetic and mechanics are very very heavily inspired by the Metroid series.   This is what Metroid would be if a classic Metroid was made with today's game design patterns.
Date 2015-11-09 Playtime 10h 11m Rec Positive This is not an easy game by all means, but if your heavy into Metroidvania (mainly the original Metroid.) I highly recommend this game if your looking for a tough as nails with a fair curve of diffulculty type of Metroid filled with talking ai, maze like environments, smooth gameplay, and best of all the many weapons you find throughout the world for your creative needs.
Date 2015-11-08 Playtime 17h 2m Rec Positive I have been waiting for this game since the mid 1990s. I grew up with a Super Nintendo controller in my hand. Super Metroid was my jam. It was great. I played it over and over. I hit 100% loot. I got faster. Beat the game 2hrs07min. Kept playing. Loved it.  Then Castlevania: Symphony of the Night dropped on the original Sony Playstation. YES. Fantastic. Grind. Play. Explore. I get the Crissegrim. I hit 195% on the map. I do it again.  ...And then I wait. FOR 17 YEARS. Why doesn't anybody make a decent Metroidvania? The tech is there. The talent is there. The demand is huge. What's the problem? Several handheld Metroids. A few castlevanias. They're alright. Kinda cool but not quite on the same level.  ..and then Axiom Verge.   10/10 would wait 17 years again.
Date 2015-11-07 Playtime 30h 57m Rec Positive Ich bin einfach nur begeistert von diesem Spiel ! Wer die Metroidspiele mochte, der wird dieses Spiel lieben. Ich habe sehr lange gebraucht, um es durchzuspielen und habe noch nicht alle Items gefunde.  Es lässt sich ausgezeichnet mit dem Controller steuern. Das Gameplay als auch die Story sind top. Für mich eines der besten Spiele seit Jahren.
Date 2015-11-07 Playtime 25h 31m Rec Positive Graphics and music are splendid. Gameplay is also really sweet. On the downside is the storyline and the game is a bit short. All in all it's worth playing.
Date 2015-11-05 Playtime 19h 46m Rec Positive Best Metroid game since Cave Story.
Date 2015-11-05 Playtime 7h 43m Rec Positive Hey! It's totally a metroid game, but that's OK because it is good.
Date 2015-11-05 Playtime 31h 4m Rec Positive Its a super solid Metroidvania that perfectly nails the feel of a Metroid game, where the upgrades you get along the way make you want to backtrack and explore and hunt for secrets.  Pretty lengthy, good variety,great soundtrack, incentive to replay. Has hard mode and speed run options.  We haven't had a proper 2D Metroid in a few years... this will absolutely scratch that itch. 
Date 2015-11-05 Playtime 14h 14m Rec Positive Pros: Metroidvania, great story, great aesthetic, solid controls.  Cons: Bosses a little easy, but I'm only 90 minutes in, so...  Highly recommend.  Especially if you grew up in the NES era.
Date 2015-11-04 Playtime 2h 44m Rec Positive I love old school games and thats what this feels like.  I love the old school looking graphics as well as the metroid style of playing.  I got this from Indybox as my first one and I am hooked.
Date 2015-11-03 Playtime 16h 8m Rec Positive tres bon métroid vania je le recomande un gameplay juste parfait de la difficulter progressive des boss maisdes vrai quoi je spool pas mais faut voire certain boss c est titanesque  est enfin l ambiance du jeu c juste un voyage ce jeu un melange d ambiance de metroid de the dig et d autre je spool pas tous  moi je vous le dis si vous aimez metroid n importe lequel vous aimerez Axiom et si les metroid c est pas votre truc tester quand meme ce n'est pas que ca
Date 2015-11-01 Playtime 15h 21m Rec Positive Extraordinaire!  C'est le premier jeu qui m'a donné envie de faire du 100% (100% items, map completion,...).  L'univers, l'ambiance, les armes ... Tout est fantastique. Certains y verront une repompe de Metroid, j'y vois plutôt un hommage.
Date 2015-10-31 Playtime 16h 42m Rec Negative 打通了过来写评测  +武器设计很棒。尽管大多数武器都没什么卵用，但是能设计出这么多种武器也是挺厉害的… +精细的贴图。 +剧情还不错，只打通了第一次，不知道有没有隐藏结局 +Adress Disruptor和bomb。应该说是整个游戏的创意核心所在，能够改变怪物非常有趣，还有变成口袋MissingNO的彩蛋 +移动和攻击的手感很流畅  -单调重复的boss战，所有的boss都只有一种形态和几种攻击方式，而且都是极其没有创意的子弹和炸弹，只是随着血量减少攻击频率加快，boss的血量还十分的厚，boss战完全成了耐力的活 -地图上没有可收集物的标志，只是在地区全探索后有个圆点提示，对我这种100%强迫症来说有点麻烦 -后期的闪烁能力手感很差，双击方向键让想要微量调节自己的位置时很容易失误，想要用闪烁到极限位置也比较难  总结，一个类银河战士的游戏，操作，主角能力，隐藏物品的方式都看得到银河战士的影子。但是关卡设计的水平不够高（只有偶尔有些地方需要与环境互动，其中还有一个把怪物变成漂浮砖块的会让你恶心死），远远比不上掌机时代的恶魔城和银河战士之类，谨慎购入。  准备全收集以后就删了。
Date 2015-10-31 Playtime 20h 4m Rec Positive This is a fantastic Metroid style game.  Interesting story.  Good, challenging gameplay. The music is superb.
Date 2015-10-31 Playtime 14h 47m Rec Positive A modern, superb Metroidvania-game. Does everything you expect from the genre and adds a few twists and turns I neither expected nor have seen before. I'd recommend this game any day.
Date 2015-10-29 Playtime 24h 49m Rec Positive Best Metroidvania game in ages.  OST is brilliant too
Date 2015-10-28 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive Très bonne surprise, je m'attendais un copié-collé de super metroid, mais en fait non, le jeu a sa personnalité propre et un scenario poussé. La jouabilité est simple mais efficace, les graphismes 8-16 bits sont reussis, les musiques superbes, il y a plein de secrets a debusquer. Le level design, ce qui est pour moi le plus important dans ce type de jeu, est tout simplement excellent. En prenant vraiment mon temps, j'ai fini le jeu en 15h a 70% Si vous aimez les metroidvania, vous devez absoluement posseder ce jeu ! 
Date 2015-10-28 Playtime 10h 5m Rec Positive TL;DR: Waited for a year until this game was released and instantly picked it up...... the week after it got released had that urge of exploration that i lost ever since i finished Metroid Prime 2  Axiom Verge, made by only 1 guy: Tom Happ and holy crap Tom, some serious kudos to you for this amazing piece of art,  before i go into the game itself here is a little backstory about myself: i LOVE the orignal 2D and 3D metroid and prime games, heck i even played a bucketload of Metroid Prime Hunters and i enjoyed playing Other M as well(sure it wasnt as good as Metroid Prime or Super Metroid but it its fair share of fun as well) my favorite being of course Super Metroid for its sense of exploration as well as Metroid Fusion for its amazing story and tension. i finished fusion so many times that i litterally broke the game, it wont save anymore. and the exploration is incredible as well as the amazing level design. but enough about Metroid, we are looking at Axiom Verge, while being similar is very different and takes a more original approach to its gameplay mechanics  you play as Trace, a scientist who during an explosion ended up in an unkown world in an egg-like incubator without any recollection of what happend after the explosion, you have to explore the caves and ruins of the planet Sudra,  the gameplay is simple yet incredibly engaging: it starts out like your standard metroid game, you need to explore the enviroment for new pieces of equipment to progress to other places, the first weapon you find is the Axiom Disruptor, the main mechanic that is mainly used in the game is the so called "Glitch Gun" a scan-like weapon were you can change  bits and parts of your enviroment so that you can glitch through walls, change enemies and sometimes even change the very fabric of reality.  the level design is one of the weaker points of the game, like the original metroid for the NES you travel to various locations where each of its levels has its own design, but as you move deeper in one area you notice that the assets for the levels feel copy-pasted together and it can become a bit of a bore to look at at times(i had that once when i was stuck in the second area of the game)  The Weapons are one of its strongest points together with the story, there is a HUGE amount of weapons that can be found and utilized in Sudra, and later in the game you see small corridors where trace is to big to walk to, so you think(when you played metroid a lot before) that there would be something like a morph ball, NOPE! instead you get a drone with its one health, damage and attack for small corridors or to scout ahead of areas which is not only very clever to make a safe route to your destination but is also pretty fun to attack with at times, but that is just an extra function for the Axiom Disruptor, the most broken weapon is the Flamethrower pretty much incinerating every-living-thing in your path.  the sound design is also well made, the songs fits the enviroments and gives you the feeling of isolation yet, determined to push ahead to the dangers to come.  but the most challening part of the games are the bosses, in metroid all the bosses are somewhat bigger to fit the levels they are made in, but they arent that huge, BUT in Axiom Verge the bosses are HUGE, and instead of just shooting what moves you actually have to plan carefully what you do agains them and where their weakpoints are and how you approach them.  if you need another reason why you need to play the game, check out plenty of other reviews.  have fun and game on! -AssaultPowerX
Date 2015-10-28 Playtime 9h 22m Rec Positive The game has functional combat, good exploration, interesting story and nice atmossphere and music. It is also over 8 hours long which is nice, however the last quarter of the game is really tedious. If you are a fan or metroidvanias the purchase is a no brainer for you, you probably already purchased it. For everyone else I recommend waiting for a small sale.
Date 2015-10-27 Playtime 28h 20m Rec Positive Офигенная игруля формата "Я вернулся в детство! О, круто, а тут ещё и сохранятся можно часто". Потратил уйму времени в пиратке, лицуху купил только рали того, что бы сказать спасибо разработчику. Настоятельно рекомендую любителям сложных платформеров-стрелялок
Date 2015-10-27 Playtime 17h 8m Rec Positive I haven't played metroid-vania games since back in the day, and this really re-ignited my love for the genre.  Amazingly detailed world, gameplay, and story.  This just kept me captivated for hours (i dont know why my hours on record is so low).
Date 2015-10-26 Playtime 13h 56m Rec Positive Story never resolves in any meaningful way, like the writing didn't know where to go. Ultimately it's still fun, though.
Date 2015-10-26 Playtime 0h 33m Rec Negative Пародия на Метроид, которая даже не рядом с оригиналом. Внешне вроде бы полный клон, включая даже виды врагов, но при этом геймдизайн отвратительный, левелдизайн глистовидный, а исследовать игровой мир совершенно неинтересно. Но ведь даже головы статуй скопировали! Карго-игра с 97% положительных отзывов, которую я вернул в гамазин.
Date 2015-10-25 Playtime 1h 49m Rec Positive Thank you for being the Metroid game we never got.
Date 2015-10-25 Playtime 63h 30m Rec Positive Played for six hours straight on first try. That hasn't happened in years. This is a perfect 10!
Date 2015-10-24 Playtime 15h 58m Rec Positive Dear. Lord. I love getting stuck in this game, because it gives me an excuse to look for more things. I have so many things! Notes, Journal pages, weapons, tools, upgrades, and all sorts of stuff. It's basically what Metroid could have become if they didnt waste thier time reinventing the goddamn wheel, and instead decided to make the existing wheel a bit nice with JUMPING THAT ACTULLY GODDAMN RESPONDS.  Don't be an asshole, don't whine about the price, it's easily worth twice as much. Maybe triple! If you like Metroid, you will like this. It's not metroidvania, because there is little to no "vania" to be found.
Date 2015-10-24 Playtime 25h 48m Rec Positive Action Adventure with style, good music, good story... you'll have to pay attention to get the story. Pay attention to everything, the "Pattern Mind" mentality will bring all sorts of secrets out of the game. Lots of fun. The Bosses arent too hard, but just difficult enough to take a try or two. Once you get to the end, the abilites are mind blowing for a game of this type. Very Inventive weapons and abilities. Really awesome.
Date 2015-10-23 Playtime 14h 9m Rec Positive Good video computer
Date 2015-10-21 Playtime 20h 31m Rec Positive This game has good game mechanics. It's about 13 hours of gameplay if you try to find secrets. I do not usually play games a second time over unless if their in my top favorites of all time(very few games make this) which this game is not but either way it is a good game. My favorite things about this game is the map design and artwork.
Date 2015-10-19 Playtime 39h 58m Rec Positive Friggin awesome!!!!!  A must have :)
Date 2015-10-17 Playtime 44h 36m Rec Positive One of the best games i ever played! It is the masterpiece of the metroidvania genre, it has a great story, a variety of weapons, intense boss fights.  Of course it has frustrating moments, especially if you're not familiarized with this type of game, you'll get stuck.   Oh! And you get to play as a boss in a very confusing situation...  10/10 Athethos say KILL!!!
Date 2015-10-17 Playtime 15h 34m Rec Positive Wer Ende der 80er und Anfang der 90er Sidescroller mochte sollte hier unbedingt zugreifen. Ich finde dieses Spiel bisher unheimlich durchdacht und spielbar. Ich spiele auf einem iMac 27" late 2011 und habe keine Problrm mit diesem Spiel. Gerade für Mac-User ist es sehr zu empfehlen. :-)
Date 2015-10-17 Playtime 23h 24m Rec Positive Its awesome, if you like Metroid or Metroidvanias you will love this!
Date 2015-10-16 Playtime 1h 55m Rec Positive After only playing a few hours I can see that this is a great Metroid inspired platformer. And it doesn't just copy the ideas that made the older games so great, it builds upon them introducing a lot of cool original mechanics and ideas into the mix.   Axiom Verge is a real treat for any Metroid fan and you should go play it, it's just that good. The level design is spot on, the controls are tight and the various little mechanics that you unlock along the way all feel unique and interesting. A lot of the unlocks also seem to fit into the theme and story very well. The story itself appears to be really interesting and cool. And finally the music is really good, although the sound effects themselves don't sit really well with me. They seem a bit too generic. It's easy to forgive that tho when everything else is so good.  The only gripe I really have with Axiom Verge is the poor english localisation - I wish the developers would ask someone proficient in english to go through the text and correct it. Ugh.
Date 2015-10-14 Playtime 45h 3m Rec Positive Обалденная игра 10 из 10 для любителей метроидвании + отличнейшие саундтреки
Date 2015-10-14 Playtime 29h 8m Rec Positive Great game, love the soundtrack. Definitely worth playing if you're a fan of Metroid.
Date 2015-10-13 Playtime 3h 50m Rec Positive This is easily one of the best Super Metroid tributes I have played. Fantastic 8-bit graphics, modern chip music, lots of power ups, and a variety of enemies. If I was going to be really picky, I'd day some of the powerups are a little mundane, and getting energy top ups is more random than in the Metroid games, but this is a must buy if you like SNES style platformers.
Date 2015-10-09 Playtime 13h 7m Rec Positive One of the best games of the year.
Date 2015-10-08 Playtime 17h 42m Rec Positive Le metroidVania par excelence . Beau , magnifique meme , une DA dantesque , des boss fights epique , des enigmes , une aventure unique et , pour moi , qui rentre direct au pantheon des MUST HAVE comme symphony of the night ou Super metroid ... et ce n'est que le travail d'un seul homme .   10/10   Fini en 15h avec +60% des objets ... et un autre run en prevision ... j'en veut plus ...   J'oubliais un point tres important , la musique est egalité avec Hotline miami en terme de qualité ... GREAT GAME , GO BUY IT !!!!
Date 2015-10-07 Playtime 13h 18m Rec Positive Graphics are awesome. Gameplay is awesome too. Music is also awesome. Quite frankly, this game is awesome.  P.S.  Did get lost in what to do a few times, but the game was awesome enough to compensate. 9/10
Date 2015-10-03 Playtime 11h 54m Rec Positive BEST metroidvania game for a LONG time! Buy it, play it, love it! Music is awesome as well - very immersive!  Cannot wait for Axiom Verge 2!  Good job, Mr. Happ!
Date 2015-09-27 Playtime 16h 25m Rec Positive It's a very faithful Metroid homage. There are tons of guns and abililities to find as you play. My one concern is it's a little to faithful and it's common that I would have to run back and forth through the map to get back to an area I couldn't progress through because I neede to find a certain power found later on.  This happens a lot and there is a lot of backtracking. If the save points could have been used as teleports or some fast travel system added in late game it wouldn't have been a problem but a lot of my time was eaten up slogging through areas I'd grown to powerful for so the enemies would no longer be any challange and just added to the tedium.   Overall it's a good game. It took what made Metroid fun and recreated it. It just could have done more to evolve the formula.
Date 2015-09-25 Playtime 30h 5m Rec Positive This game is quite good. It tries very hard to be Super Metroid, and [i]nearly[/i] succeeds, and that's pretty good.   Actually, it has this weird identity crisis where it can't decide whether it wants to be Super Metroid or not. Despite having a nearly identical atmosphere and basic gameplay structure, not one of the upgrades you get works the same way as any upgrade in any Metroid game, except for extreme basics like your first gun and health upgrades. Trace starts out controlling much the same as Samus does at the start of Super Metroid, but then the two diverge wildly in play style as they progress through their respective games. In that sense, it is refreshing, and that makes it feel less like a simple retread of Super Metroid.  The game has many guns, but very few of them are useful. The handful of guns you are required to get by the plot are sufficient for most of the game, as ALL of your guns get more powerful when you find weapon upgrades. There is one secret gun that is absurdly overpowered and shreds the game's otherwise nearly-impossible final boss.  The plot is entirely incomprehensible. If you just focus on Trace's character, and the way he copes with the bizarre situation he's in and matures, the story is all right. There's a very good scene in one area where Trace begins hallucinating, and the area becomes more nightmarish as you progress through it. But if you try to actually make sense of the game's backstory from the various scraps of documents you find, good ****ing luck. The game has two endings; neither is substantially different from the other, or makes any sense.
Date 2015-09-23 Playtime 11h 38m Rec Positive Very good game, I would recommend it for those who like this type of game.
Date 2015-09-22 Playtime 25h 23m Rec Positive If you played Metroid and/or Super Metroid and liked them, grab your controller and buy this game.  It's the perfect reincarnation of that old classic that kept me awake playing for countless hours.
Date 2015-09-22 Playtime 32h 24m Rec Positive 7/10  - Features a "very Metroid" panache - Competent gameplay - Can be difficult if you don't use weapons properly - LOTS and LOTS of backtracking - Has many secrets to discover - Most of the secrets are so well hidden that you'll need help
Date 2015-09-20 Playtime 0h 43m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a fantasttic game that will appeal to anyone who is a fan of retro adventure platformers such as Metroid or Castlevania. Everything about it is well executed, the controls are flawless, the soundtrack is stellar, and the graphics are excellent. A must play game!!!
Date 2015-09-19 Playtime 27h 22m Rec Positive If you like Metroidvanias this game is a great one. The music will be stuck in your head for weeks.
Date 2015-09-16 Playtime 20h 24m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a 2D, retro-styled metroidvania game, with a heavy emphasis on the Metroid part. Like most metroidvania games, you explore a large and connected world doing things like platforming, shooting enemies, getting powerups, and getting new abilities that will help you solve puzzles, beat bosses, and generally progress in the game. There are also a good amount of secrets and some interesting story bits thrown in. The overall story is confusing and mysterious, which helps add to the alienated vibe of the game as well as making the plot more interesting. Without spoiling anything, the basic plot is that you play as Trace, a brilliant scientist that gets caught in a lab explosion, loses consciousness, and winds up in an unknown place. It's up to you to figure where you are, what happened, and how to get home.   As mentioned, the gameplay is mainly platforming, shooting, exploring, and some mild puzzle solving. You can find a good variety of items if you look hard enough. You can get powerups to increase the damage, size, and range of your weapons, as well as expansions to your health. There are some passive powerups mixed in with tools that will give you new abilities, helping you progress through the game. There are some interesting notes you can find scattered throughout the world that will give you more bits and pieces to the mysterious story as well. However, the coolest part is that you can find a lot of cool weapons. A few are required to get through the game, but many of them are found by exploring. These weapons all have their own unique qualities. It's nice because they are well balanced and do not require extra ammo. They all have inifinite ammo, meaning you can play around with them all you like. So you can use certain weapons to effectively fight certain enemies, cycle through all your weapons to vary your gameplay, or just pick your weapon of choice and have a ball! It adds a layer of fun to the discovery of new weapons. Plus, the controls are tight and the control scheme is fairly comfortable.  The art is very colorful yet fitting to the world of unknown mystery and wonder. I also found myself really liking the soundtrack a lot. Sounds a bit John Carpenter-esque to me. It's crazy how Tom Happ has managed to do such a great job with the gameplay, the art, and the music basically all by himself. The package as a whole comes together beautifully. The dark, mysterious atmosphere and cool techno influences mixed with a bit of alien flair make for an engaging experience that sucks you into the game for hours.  As great as I think Axiom Verge is, there ARE some negative arguments to be had. It didn't run flawlessly on my computer, but my computer is a bit dated and worn out as well so I'm sure it was not a fault of the game... just thought I'd mention it slowed down in some of the larger, busier areas for me. Hardly worth complaining about. This game is clearly heavily inspired by the Metroid series, and while I love that... you could make the argument that it is borrowing from that inspiration a bit too heavily. I personally think it has enough differences and unique twists to make it work as an original game expanding on the genre, but I could understand some people not finding it distant enough from that source. It'd also be cool to have a bit more of a choice in some story elements, but ultimately it is a story that you have to follow and your character is Trace, not you, so I suppose it makes sense the way it is. My only real complaint with the game is that you get a dashing ability, but once you get it you cannot turn it off. This can be troublesome for precise movements because you dash by double tapping in a direction. So if you're trying to move forward and then stop to dodge something and move forward again too quickly... you'll dash instead of just moving. You can lock your position or turn all the way around on stopping to remedy it, but it is a touch adjustment and can still get you killed in some hectic situations while you move eradically. As far as replay value, it's probably not a game you'll start up again immediately after finishing it. There's hard mode, which seems to be about the same but harder, and speedrun mode for... well... speedrunning. So unless you want it to be more difficult, you want to speed through the game, or want to go hunting for achievements, then you probably will leave it alone after your playthrough. Though it DOES have good replay value in the sense that you'll definitely be coming back to it at some point to experience it all again, and the amount of playtime in your playthough is pretty good.  So there are a few bad points, but the good clearly outweighs the bad in this case. It's a decent length game with tons of things to find and a neat story. The music and art are very interesting as well. If you like Metroid, Super Metroid, or metroidvania games in general, then you'll definitely appreciate this game. Honestly, it's probably one of the best games I've played on Steam. So the question is... is it worth the price? And for this one, the answer is yes. 20 dollars for 15-20 hours of great gameplay is definitely worth your time and money. If you're on the fence about waiting for a sale or just getting it full price, get it. It's worth it and it's worth supporting with the purchase. I couldn't wait either and I certainly don't regret it one bit. Axiom Verge gets a 10 out of 10 for being one of the best metroidvania experiences I've ever had.  https://youtu.be/tz0VkZ-OJ8I
Date 2015-09-16 Playtime 7h 41m Rec Positive It's the best Metroid game I've played in years.
Date 2015-09-15 Playtime 11h 40m Rec Positive Satisfied my lack of 2D Metroid games to play. Challenging and innovative.
Date 2015-09-15 Playtime 7h 16m Rec Positive Axiom Verge   für mich ein Überraschungs Titel   Grafik super schön für 2D Pixelgrafik ;)  Soundtrack einer der besten den ich je gehört habe geht ins ohr und bleibt dort erhalten   Metroid lässt grüßen dieses Spiel ist ein Tribut  Kann ich nur jeden ans Herzlegen der Metroid oder auf jump and runs steht   Klare Kaufempfehlung
Date 2015-09-15 Playtime 12h 43m Rec Positive Full disclosure: Super Metroid is one of my all-time favorite games. If you're afflicted with a similar bias I can say with almost 100% certainty that you will love this game as much as I did.  This is a true 'metroid-vania' style action platformer and as such relies heavily on exploration and item-progression to advance the story. Warning: this isn't a game that will hold your hand and a lot of back tracking and trial and error will be necessary as you traverse the tunnels and corridors looking for a way forward. Thankfully, this isn't much of a chore as the gorgeous 16 bit world has been crafted with loving attention to detail and your entire journey plays out to one of the best video game soundtracks.. full-stop. The weapon system is a blast, combat is entertaining and the item-progression is rewarding and inventful. I love the ability to 'glitch' enemies and environments and found myself constantly experimenting as I progressed.  If I had to level a criticism it would be that the story falls absolutely flat, especially near the end as the intrigue and mystery so carefully cultvated in the beginning has all but dissapeared. But that's a small compaint to levie against what is otherwise such a superb game.  Bottom line: if you've been looking for a game that would re-kindle your love affair with this long neglected genre look no further. Axiom Verge is a beautifull and charming send up to a classic and stands on it's own one hell of a good time. 
Date 2015-09-14 Playtime 19h 25m Rec Positive Very reminiscent of Super Metroid but very different in fundamental ways to make this its own game.  I've beaten it several times and will again.   This game is excellent.
Date 2015-09-13 Playtime 8h 0m Rec Negative I really wanted to like this game, but it just falls short in so many respects. The exploration is just not fun, which is a big minus for a metroidvania. The enemies are more often than not very annoying to take out, and you'll be killing the same ones a lot due to the nature of these types of games. On top of that, the movement abilities are laughably hard to use. I can't fathom the logic that went into the way the grappling hook works, and the trenchcoat is far too easy to trigger by accident. I would often find myself climbing to a great height only to struggle with the grappling hook or accidentally teleport into thin air, forcing me to make the climb all over again. Even after several hours, I couldn't shake the feeling that the game was working against me.  The bosses, which were what drew me to this game in the first place, ended up being very grindy. You find a single weakness and you exploit it repetitively until the boss is dead. Not much going on there.  On the plus side, it has a really neat art style and an interesting story. The hacking aspect is pretty novel as well. But these don't save it in my opinion.
Date 2015-09-12 Playtime 40h 40m Rec Positive the best game i've played in years  and it just gets better the farther in you get. fantastic story, wonderful ending, i'm definately going to getthe seque when its finished
Date 2015-09-12 Playtime 30h 53m Rec Positive I recieved this game for my birthday, being a major fan of the metroidvania style.  This game leads much more to the Metroid side of that equation; in fact, one of the biggest criticisms I've seen of this game is that it feels like a Metroid clone.  To me, that's more a matter of personal taste - if you enjoy exploring alien worlds, finding powerups and secrets, but don't mind missing out on the Castlevania staples of leveling up and finding new equipment (with some exceptions), then you'll probably like this game.  On the aesthetic side, the game duplicates the retro NES style fairly well.  I don't think it sticks 100% to the NES' 4-color palette, but the illusion is there.  Something that bears mentioning is the glitch effects seen in game - as someone who owned and operated a NES for several years, I'm quite familiar with what happened if a cartridge was inserted crooked, or if the contacts were dirty.  Axiom Verge duplicates these with startling accuracy.  On the style side, this game isn't for the squeamish - if Metroid's environments were biomechanical, Axiom Verge is BIOmechanical.  Tentacles, fungal growths, pulsating organs, and some very Giger-esque imagery gives me the impression of walking around inside some huge creature, rather than an alien planet.  This is alleviated when you get to the surface areas, but I never liked the Monstro scenes in Pinnochio as a child, so this combined with the music (a pulsating, semi-atonal electronica selection) makes me feel uncomfortable.  I believe this is intentional, as someone suddenly ripped from their homeworld and plunged into a dying alien world would probably have a bit of culture shock.  Storywise, the game does very well.  I'll not spoil anything, but it kept me guessing, and it's very hard to figure out who to trust as the game goes on.  It's delivered through in-engine cutscenes and dialogue boxes, without voice acting - this is probably due to a combination of budget concerns and adhering to the NES style, but I do hope for a larger budget for Axiom Verge 2 (or whatever the studio's next project is).  On the technical side, the game is superb.  The controls are very tight (more like the original Metroid or Mega Man than the slightly floaty Super Metroid) - my only two complaints are the double-tap teleport command (would be better if it was assigned to a button) and the weapon quick-swap (it takes a bit to figure out how to assign weapons to the quick swap, and on my controller one of the quick buttons is R3, with the right stick being the normal weapon swap, which occasionally leads to accidentally opening the weapon ring).  Still, use a controller with this game, and you shan't be disappointed.  Additionally, the game has a built-in speedrun mode.  Speedrunning is a staple of metroidvania games, though I've always been bad at it.  Speedrun mode removes all cutscenes and adds an on-screen timer that automatically splits at every boss kill, which is wonderful if you're into that.  The achievements show that the developer knows the metroidvania audience; aside from the standard achievements (beat the game, beat it on hard, beat it without dying, and beat every boss), they included achievements for both 100% and low% collection, 100% map completion, and finding some very well hidden secrets.  Overall, if you played and enjoyed any modern Metroid game, you'll probably enjoy Axiom Verge.  If you like modern Castlevania games and aren't adverse to sci-fi, you'll probably also get a kick out of it.
Date 2015-09-12 Playtime 16h 52m Rec Positive Being a long-lasting fan of the NES/SNES/Sega/Portable sidescrolls, this game literally shoves all of what is good from all of them into one-solid-package. I can honestly say that since Super Metroid, the genre unfortunately kind of died for me. Yes, there was Metroid Fusion! I know there was Viewdiful Joe! They were... okay. But they lacked something savvy that the Sakamoto crew just seemed to really grasp that made the original Metroid, and its SNES follow-up so captivating. It was smart, each boss had a format to solve to defeat, the music was abysmal and ambient, and the atmosphere made you feel secluded and distantly alone from everything. It was just Samus, and no one else.   Thomas Happ simply nails it with this title; absolutely NAILS it. From the atmosphere, to the music, to the story that validates that distant seclusion (Breach, is about as distant as anyone can possibly get. Sorry, no Spoilers. Find out for yourself :)  Thank you for providing this game.  If there is indeed a sequel, as rumors online seem to indicate, I will absolutely be there to get it. I thirst for more from this obviously talented Developer.   PS: Just to inform, PC User here.  Just uh... keep that in mind for the next title, eh? ;}  Also, if you happen to make a new title-concept that happens to have the topographic format like the original Zelda, that would be super dope. Just a suggestion. [:
Date 2015-09-10 Playtime 11h 35m Rec Positive If you loved Metroid, you would be doing yourself a DEEP injustice by not playing this game.
Date 2015-09-09 Playtime 22h 59m Rec Positive I love Metroidvania style games, so I was pretty eager to sink my teeth into this one. For the most part, I enjoyed the experience. The music is enjoyable, and the graphics are pretty nice for the 8-bit NES style they were going for. Gameplay wise the game is fairly solid with only a couple of hiccups here and there.  The story consists of a scientist named Trace being transported to a strange world after an accident at work. He is tasked by a mysterious living machine to revive her fellow living machines, and find a way to stop the evil scientist who has put the  planet into disarray. There's a bit of a M. Night Shamalamadingdong twist in there along the way. The story is interesting, but at times can seem a little all over the place. You can flesh it out more via locating notes around the world, that give you further information that the "cut scenes" you encounter don't fully inform you of.  There are a ton of different weapons you can encounter during the game, as well as a decent assortment of enemies. There are a few palette swaps here and there but they usually at least ACT differently. Not all of the guns are useful, but there are a small handful that are very effective. Flamethrower comes to mind.  The game, however, is not without faults. The first fault is that the game is very vauge at times as far as where you're supposed to go, or what you're supposed to be doing. There is at least one bit which requires you to use your hacking device to solidify some lava so you can stand on it and jump higher. Simple, right? The issue is that no other lava in the game (that I can recall anyway) has the same effect of getting solid, so you really have nothing prompting you to try it. Another section involves you having to find an item you actually need to progress further in the game, via drilling into a wall in a room completely full of drillable walls.  Some items cannot be aquired without making use of an item that allows you to input a password. To find these passwords you have to translate a made up language (or, you know, just google it). The flamethrower is one of the items you need to do this for. One of them even forces you to translate the language by sight alone. It was an interesting concept, but comes off as more annoying than fun. Still, this is not THAT big of a negative as there are only a handful of instances that require you to do this.  Overall, in spite of the issues the game is a fun, and challenging Metroidvania. It's a little bit closer to the Metroid side, than the CastleVania side, so be aware of that. The game is quite clearly a massive love letter to Super Metroid in particular so go in expecting Super Metroid, not something like Symphony of the Night, or Dawn of Sorrow.  I'd personally recommend it if you're into the genre, just be prepared for a bit of a sequel bait if you get the true ending (you have to get most of the map, and items so that your percentages are displayed as green).
Date 2015-09-08 Playtime 7h 13m Rec Positive Aunque lo denominan Metroidvania, Axiom Verge tiene mucho de Metroid y casi nada de Vania.   Recorreremos diversos escenarios de un mundo alienígena enfrentándonos a todo tipo de monstruos, y obteniendo un montón de poderes y armas que aumentarán poco a poco nuestra capacidad de movernos por el mapa y abrir nuevos accesos, etc.   Estas mejoras de movilidad son de lo más variopinto, desde un taladro hasta un teletransporte a corta distancia o un gancho a lo Bionic Commando.  Creo que lo más notable para un juego de este estilo es que a pesar de lo complejo del mapa y la cantidad de caminos inaccesibles que vamos dejando según avanzamos, casi siempre sabremos cuál es la ruta correcta (aunque en una ocasión tuve que tirar de guía, lo reconozco), por lo que no se hace pesado y no estaremos pateándonos el mapa en busca de una abertura o un objeto que no habíamos detectado. Hay de esas cosas, pero casi todas son opcionales y simplemente son mejoras de salud o de daño (útiles, pero no imprescindibles).  En cuano a armamento, el juego tiene muchísimas armas diferentes (creo que unas 15), pero la verdad es que muchas de ellas resultan bastante inútiles y con 3 o 4 de ellas nos servirá para todas las situaciones.  Es de dificultad moderada, las nuevas zonas pueden presentar un reto hasta que obtengamos alguna mejora de daño o salud más, pero los puntos de guardado son frecuentes así que morir no penaliza demasiado.  Los jefes suelen presentar un pico de dificultad importante y pueden costar un poco más, pero creo que no es nada insalvable una vez se encuentra la estrategia para derrotarlos.  En resumen, un juego retro 8-bitero bien acabado y pulido, de duración adecuada. Parece mentira que esté hecho por una sola persona.
Date 2015-09-08 Playtime 11h 0m Rec Positive [h1]Story and Theme[/h1] Axiom Verge has a very simplistic but unique storyline, enhanced by the graphical style and music. It is obviously not the kind of game you play for a deep and thrilling story, but it's there nonetheless and it is not entirely trivial. The graphical exposition and music complement the story well, and specifically help in portraying how alien the game world is.  [h1]Gameplay and Controls[/h1] As a platformer in the 'metroidvania' style the game is well made. Other than a few unique weapons that help you progress into new areas the game doesn't innovate much. It offers a large variety of weapons, although you will likely ignore most as only a handful are really useful. Due to this the feeling of reward is diminished when you find new equipment, because it will not impact your gameplay in most cases. The most important part of a platformer is its controls, and in that department Axiom Verge is flawless.  [h1]Conclusion[/h1] [b]Positive[/b]: It is a well done and well-themed metroidvania-styled game with excellent graphics complementing the theme well. [b]Negative[/b]: It does not innovate upon the genre, and despite having a large variety of weapons to use, they don't feel that useful.
Date 2015-09-07 Playtime 12h 14m Rec Positive Cool retro metroidvania game with good music.  Only complaint would be some of the optional secrets are very non-obvious without a guide.  Also the bosses are a joke and not threatening at all.
Date 2015-09-07 Playtime 14h 23m Rec Positive If you love Metroid you have to get this one. Great music, fun weapons, big boss battles with an oddly familiar setting. Plots a mess but the guns, the guns!
Date 2015-09-06 Playtime 12h 2m Rec Positive i didint play it for long but the time i did play it it was fucking magical. reminds me so much of Metroid  9000/10
Date 2015-09-06 Playtime 12h 12m Rec Positive Exceptionally good!
Date 2015-09-04 Playtime 12h 45m Rec Positive A beautiful and unique Metroidvania game. Made by a single guy. Highly recommend this game if you're a fan of the 2D Metroid games.
Date 2015-09-04 Playtime 29h 3m Rec Positive Truly a great nostalgic experience. Axiom Verge is Bits back with a bite.
Date 2015-09-03 Playtime 24h 47m Rec Positive Really great game intance storyline really recomand it for all the indie janre lovers :)
Date 2015-09-02 Playtime 81h 5m Rec Positive Erste Sahne
Date 2015-09-01 Playtime 22h 43m Rec Positive enjoyed every moment. great game
Date 2015-08-31 Playtime 24h 9m Rec Positive Très bon Metroidvania. BEAUCOUP d'armes et de powerups différents, des boss qui ont tous des patern propre à chacun et des objets cachés qui n'ont rien a enviés à Metroid. Le seul point négatif selon moi est le scénario qui reste assez flou malgré les nombreuses notes (cachées) que l'ont peut trouver dans certains endroits.
Date 2015-08-30 Playtime 37h 53m Rec Positive Simply put, this is "THE" reboot of, and encapsulation of everything a MetroidVania should be.  It's just complete.  Don't worry about the price-tag.  The soundtrack in this game alone is set-the-controller down and listen worthy.  You'll be listening to the tracks on youtube months after you beat this game and each note carries you back to that perplexing puzzle you ultimately solved in order to better augment your character for that final battle.  - Great level design (never felt truly lost, yet always felt a sense of urgency and relevance in my travels throughout)  - Audio and Music are second to none (the enemies are unique in their audio even their reactions to being shot, Music will speak for itself as it's captivating and draws every atmosphere artistically.)  - Gameplay is spot on captures the MetroidVania mechanic to the T. (This game still remains to have it's own presence as far as control, you'll have to play it to understand it.)  - tl;dr Great game with great music, evenly paced with a strong sense of reward for full completion of the map.
Date 2015-08-29 Playtime 31h 39m Rec Positive A fun old school-style platform game with great artwork, soundtrack, and intriguing story. Definitely would recommend this to fans of games like Metroid or Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  Probably the feature that makes Axiom Verge sand out the most is the sheer number of weapons to collect (nearly 30), and just how creativily hidden some of the secrets are. Most of these are optional and you can complete the game finding only a fraction of its' secrets, but it definitely adds replay value.  Axiom Verge isn't without flaws however - probably its biggest flaw is the combat itself. Many types of enemies and bosses are cheaply placed or have attacks which are almost impossible to avoid . Enemies will sometimes also block the doors to rooms, causing you to hit them as soon as you re-enter said room. Forcing the player to take damage is poor design and hopefully the combat will be ironed out in subsequent patches or the sequel. The bosses are also a slight letdown, as for the most part they don't react to the player's presense at all, and simply cycle through scripted attack patterns. The final boss is probably the worst example of this poor enemy design, as its attacks are more or less impossible to avoid, and the battle boils down to simply mashing the attack button while hoping your health bar holds out, rather than requiring any actual skill.  The other major flaw is that the game makes little effort in telling you where to go next. Other than occasional "hints" in dialogue you're left to figure it out on your own. For example, after defeating a certain boss, your only hint is to take an elevator up. But it turns out that to continue onward you actually have to find a special item (which was never even mentioned) and then go underground to access a completely unrelated area. I admire games which don't just spell it out for the player, but there's no way a player is going to be able to figure this out without using a guide other than through pure trial and error, which isn't fun.  In spite of these annoying issues the core game is good, the world is intriquing and ominous, and trying out all of the weapons is fun in of itself. So I can easily overlook them and give this game a recommend. Fixing the poor enemy behavior should be top priority as it's the single biggest flaw in an otherwise great game.
Date 2015-08-27 Playtime 18h 34m Rec Positive Wer Klassiker wie Metroid geliebt hat, wird auch hier sein Vergnügen haben.
Date 2015-08-24 Playtime 32h 46m Rec Positive Very good Metroïd-like !
Date 2015-08-24 Playtime 25h 15m Rec Positive This is a great game.  What drew me in initially was the H.R. Giger style of the "cover art."  I adore dark alien imagery, and Axiom Verge is full of it.  The world the game takes place in just feels...wrong (in a good way); like a place that shouldn't ever exist in any part of the universe (a bit like the Far Realm in D&D).  This feeling is helped by the cyberpunk-style soundtrack constantly pulsing in the background as you explore the tendril-like labyrinthine environment.  I just have to say, the game nails atmosphere perfectly, and that's not even getting to gameplay and story.  The action feels tight here, and it's always satisfying to blast hostile aliens into pulpy goo.  There are also a ton of weapons to find and play with -- and believe me, there are *a lot* of them, each one with a different feel.  Some of them I'd say are objectively better than others, making the "lesser" weapons you find pretty much useless.  Not a huge deal, but it does kind of take the enjoyment out of exploration somewhat. There are also a ton of other optional items to find: everything from health powerups, damage powerups, range powerups , projectile size powerups and so-on.  That leads into one of coolest aspects of this game: just how much there is to explore.  I spent about 20 hours on my first playthrough and only managed to find like 70% of them total items in the game.  And believe me, I spent a long time exploring.  Although, to be fair, I'm pretty bad at metroidvania games.  I think the average time for a playthrough is 12-13 hours.  Still, for an indie game, that's pretty huge.  There are also some really fun mechanics introduced into the game, like being able to "glitch" enemies (which changes their appearance and how they behave).  It's always fun to figure out which enemies' "glitched" versions do what.  You also get the ability to teleport through walls with your labcoat, which is both weird and awesome.    The story is pretty good, too.  I won't spoil anything about it, but I was pretty impressed with it overall.  My primary issue with it was how it ended -- not necessarily what happened, but how it was executed.  The pacing sort of felt a little rushed in the final encounter.  Overall, this is a worthwhile experience.  The asking price is a little steep for your average indie game, but this game is *well* above average.  :)  I'd give it an 8/10 overall.
Date 2015-08-24 Playtime 13h 57m Rec Positive This game has a lasting artstyle and unsettling story and atmosphere. The world is vast and full of collectibles in the form of weapon types, so if you pay close attention, you will always have a new weapon to try out, though eventually you will probably settle for just one weapon type most of the game.   The soundtrack is lovingly crafted and the songs are all surprisingly long. I find myself forgetting about the game months later, but suddenly remembering the excellent 80's style chiptunes and being drawn to play the game again.
Date 2015-08-20 Playtime 22h 50m Rec Positive The ultimate tribute to Super Metroid. A sci-fi action platformer that is as filled with secrets as it is filled with nostalgia and charm. The story is great, the music is great, the level design is great, and the music is great.  The only real cons: -As with any Metroidvania, you will get lost. You will get lost to the point you feel hopeless. When this happens, you need to take a break and come back to the game with a fresh mind. Don't give up. I'm not a genius and I beat this game. -The controls are a bit weird. The grappling/swinging is pretty imprecise and the dashing is flat out horrible. Neither of these things are gamebreaking, but it's worth noting.  If you love sidescrolling games in the style of Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, you should absolutely pick this up. Even if you just want a retro sci-fi experience, this is worth full price. It's a no-brainer for me. Absolutely recommended.
Date 2015-08-19 Playtime 55h 16m Rec Positive As a long long dedicated Metroid fan, this one, Axiom Verge, goes on the top 10 list of most uber-exciting-outerworldy-games that I have ever enjoiyed!  Axiom Verge is one of the BEST platformers out there! And I have no other words to describe this... this GENIOUS game!!  You better have Axiom Verge 2 up your sleeve mister Tomas Happ ;)
Date 2015-08-19 Playtime 13h 2m Rec Negative 为这个游戏专门买了个ONE的手柄，没办法，PS2的手柄不能用，游戏的操作不错，各种动作都挺流畅的。 游戏的流程就是跑地图，拿到新的能力和武器，然后再去原来不能去的地方继续跑。比较烦的一点是，这个游戏没有传送点，你只能用腿跑，还必须记住原来的地方为啥不能过，估计下刚拿的能力能不能过，不然就白跑了。 我选的Normal, 感觉游戏前期难度一般，后期估计是快结束了，杂兵和BOSS的火力突然变的密集了，我都是用受伤后的无敌时间硬拼的，本来以为有啥技巧，结果YOUTUBE上一看，也是这么过的。 由于没有传送点，游戏探索起来感觉挺累的，所以也就没啥乐趣了。 游戏的穿墙技能，相当于洛克人的dash，但是需要按两下方向键，后期貌似躲子弹就靠这个了，按起来各种蛋疼，设成R多好。 游戏过程中会找到很多NOTE，有的是外星语写的，我都快通关了，还没能翻译，难道要等2周目？ 游戏的BOSS挺少的，其中还有2个是剧情帮过的，打完有印象的就一个BOSS，就是BANNER里面图3的BOSS。 总之和SFC的Metroid差距不小。
Date 2015-08-18 Playtime 20h 9m Rec Positive How did one guy make this?
Date 2015-08-17 Playtime 18h 16m Rec Positive beautiful, nostalgic and one INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACK. there is just something about indie games that keeps me so occupied and this is one of them, with unique boss battles, power ups and environments you will constantly find yourself exploring somewhat lost but also discovering new areas and items.  i definitely recommend this game and if you are able to purchase the soundtrack i recommend that as well.   i really hope this game has a sequal in the years to come
Date 2015-08-13 Playtime 38h 17m Rec Positive Quite possibly one of the best games I've ever played. A wonderful nod to the once-good Metroid franchise. Axiom Verge takes the retro style of classic Metroid, adds an awesome soundtrack, tons of weapons, and unique powers. This game gets everything right. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a game with good story, gameplay, and a nice retro feel.
Date 2015-08-13 Playtime 23h 12m Rec Positive Great stuff!
Date 2015-08-11 Playtime 13h 51m Rec Positive Did you like the 2D metroid games? Then buy this game. It plays like all of the metroid games but there are different items and weapons to use instead of just getting the gravity suit for the 50th time. I was skeptical it would be worth the $20 but it definitely has been.
Date 2015-08-11 Playtime 22h 42m Rec Positive I'm reviewing this before completing the game, because I've seen enough to know this is a true gem. It channels everything that makes Super Metroid great while adding a completely new story and motivation. All the abilities are familiar without being exact copies. On top of what you might expect, there are a decent number of surprises in terms of your abilities and how old game mechanics are being re-imagined.   The graphics are lovingly detailed, although fall short of emulating that lush Nintendo quality. The screenshots speak for themselves though, and you'll see it has it's own style that hits all the right notes.  The theming is excellent, with every new area having a noticable change in palette and temperment of music. It succeeds in bringing back that feeling of anticipation as you move into new or hidden areas. The dread of the boss antichamber room is real.  The love-it-or-hate-it staple of a Metroid game is here is spades. The game world feels vast and wants to be explored in full. Revisiting old areas to trunce forgotten nightmares and break new ground where you were once barred is still the name of the game.  The diversity of the creatures and restraint at reusing enviroment textures means every area feels unique and deserves to be revisited.   If you want to play an indie retro with some serious meat on it's bones, you've found your game.
Date 2015-08-10 Playtime 11h 2m Rec Positive 살면서 매트로배니아류 게임은 월하포함 이후의 2D악마성 시리즈가 최고라고 생각했다(매트로이드 시리즈는 거의 안해봤습니다).하지만 아니었다.  Axiom Verge는 그래픽적인 면에서 슈퍼패미콤이나 메가드라이브를 떠올리게 하며,분위기는 시종일관 기괴하고 섬뜩하며 다른 느낌의 공포스런 분위기를 연출한다. (개인적으로 생각하는 이 게임 최고의 모습은 게임 자체의 그림체이다.과하게 말해서 환상 회화에 가깝다고 생각될 정도이다.정말 만족스러웠다) 인트로 영상이나 중간중간 삽입된 영상들도 레트로 콘솔게임을 떠올리게 하여 상당히 맘에 들었다. 무기 종류는 10개+a로 있어 상황에 따라 다양하게 쓸 수 있다(라고 쓰고 1,4,얼음만 써서 깼다...). 레벨 개념은 없으며,대신 무기 데미지와 에너지 최대량을 늘려주는 누적형 패시브 아이템으로 캐릭터를 발전시켜야 한다. 이 시스템으로 인해 자연스럽게 매트로배니아 특유의 길 찾기를 하게 되며,특수능력으로 찾아야 되는 곳도 많다. 특수능력들 중에 절반이 게임버그 일어난 줄 오해할 법한 외관이다(하지만 다시보니 정말 좋은 연출이었다). 자세히는 모르겠지만 악마성보다는 매트로이드류에 훨씬 더 가까워보이며,특수능력 중 드론이 이를 뒷받침해준다.  간략하게 말해서 여태 인디 매트로배니아류 게임 중 최고라고 생각한다. (저는 고전 악마성만 알다가 월하로 매트로배니아류 입문했는데,솔직히 월하보다 이게 더 재밌었습니다/볼륨은 비교가 안되지만...)  그냥 최고. 돈이 전혀 안 아깝고 정말 만족스러운 플레이였다. 2D악마성 신작 기다리지 말고 이거 사시길 10/10
Date 2015-08-09 Playtime 22h 24m Rec Positive Having fun with this great game, flashback of Super Metroid from two decades ago.
Date 2015-08-09 Playtime 18h 36m Rec Positive WOW, what an awesome game! :O  This game is just giving me the same sensation I had when I played Metroid Fusion many many years ago.   You do yourself a favor and buy it!! ^^ It's got everything Metroid Fusion had or even more!  Hopefully this will get a sequel!!!!
Date 2015-08-08 Playtime 50h 33m Rec Positive This game is amazing!
Date 2015-08-08 Playtime 19h 20m Rec Positive TL;DR If you like Metroidvania type games buy this game  A solid Metroidvania game with tight controlls, well scratch the vania part this game is straight up Metroid.  Axim Verge captures the essence of the older 2D Metroid games very well.  You are alone on some godshaken planet in an underground maze and everyting wants to kill you, the only thing keeping you alive are you wits and your trusty shooting iron. As a big fan of the old Metroid games I found this one hard to put down, while I got stumped a couple, I found out where i needed to go by just looking were I hadn't explored on the map.  Great game get's a solid reomendation from me.
Date 2015-08-07 Playtime 2h 23m Rec Positive Beautiful artwork, interesting story and solid gameplay; all to be found within first few minutes.  That being said, I was hoping for a little more polish at the $20 price level. The UI is a little clunky, some sound effects don't fit the atmosphere and the music is a bit muddy or un-mastered.   When comparing to other retro games such as Shovel Knight, I'd say that $10-15 would be a more reasonable price point.  If you've already gobbled up all the other platformers that Steam has to offer, grab this one! If not, put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale.
Date 2015-08-07 Playtime 15h 17m Rec Positive Remember that little game called Shovel Knight and how it brought classic Mega Man inspired platforming to modern gaming?  Yeah, this game is the same thing but for Metroid. Step aside, Samus Aran. Axiom Verge is here to carry the genre now that Nintendo is set on killing your series.
Date 2015-08-06 Playtime 23h 18m Rec Positive Basically, this is the spiritual successor to the sidescrolling Metroid games. It's top business.
Date 2015-08-05 Playtime 21h 57m Rec Positive Waiting patiently for Axiom Verge 2.
Date 2015-08-04 Playtime 23h 53m Rec Positive This game was everything I was hoping it would be! It had that Metroid feel with a plethera of secrets to search around for. 1st play through for me was 15 hours and I think I will spend about 5 more searching for all of the items so I think the price is on point.
Date 2015-08-02 Playtime 5h 3m Rec Positive Metroid without Samus, great game, a little bit easy on normal, gigantic bosses, some are too easy, great level design. It only lacks a proper map, item location would be great.  A fantastic little game. Highly recommended.
Date 2015-08-01 Playtime 40h 53m Rec Positive Extremely good game with a story that will keep you guessing for a long time, even after the game is over. The music track is incredibly good and gives a very nice ambiance to the game.   It's a real blast to play if you enjoy old metroid styled game.
Date 2015-07-31 Playtime 20h 53m Rec Positive A beautiful homage to the Metroidvania genre and incredibly well made. Truly a blast that takes you back to the thrills of an older age of gaming. Even more incredible to know that only one dude put it all together.
Date 2015-07-30 Playtime 11h 24m Rec Positive Great game
Date 2015-07-29 Playtime 27h 15m Rec Positive Just finnished my first run after 10 hour and damn what a great game. No need for an in depth review on this because if you like games like Super Metroid  you seriously need to get this!  9/10
Date 2015-07-27 Playtime 19h 9m Rec Positive Did you enjoy Metroid games as a kid? I definitely did, and I LOVE Axiom Verge. Hell, even if you've never experienced a Metroid game (which, personally, I'd remedy some time in the near future), this game may yet be up your alley. This game contains colorful 16-bit visuals with the occasional stylish twist, catchy techno beats that I listen to even when I'm not playing the game, over a hundred collectibles hidden throughout nine worlds, over twenty unique weapons with special properties, a very interesting mechanic where you can "glitch" enemies to completely change how they behave (sometimes even turning them into your allies!), a drill to pierce the heavens with, the ability to warp through walls, a grappling hook (à la Super Metroid), and a cute little remote controlled drone that looks like a headcrab!  For $20, this game is a steal; at the time of this review's creation, I spent 19.2 hours in Axiom Verge, and I JUST NOW completed it for the first time. Also, there's a speedrun mode for those who are interested in feeling rewarded for knowing the game like the backs of their hands. If you wish to experience, or relive, gaming's glory days - when everything was shrouded in mystery and you felt like you discovered something awesome each time you unearthed a new upgrade or weapon - then PLAY this damn game! For an optimal experience, I suggest that you do not refer to a walkthrough unless absolutely necessary. And no, there is no fast travel, there are no objective arrows, and you won't be submitted to torturous tutorial dialogue.
Date 2015-07-27 Playtime 12h 23m Rec Positive The metroidvania genre is mostly a sea of mediocre games trying to emulate a handful of legendary classics.  Axiom Verge is not a new genre touchstone the way, say, La Mulana was.  But it's certainly miles ahead of the rest of the pretenders.  Axiom Verge has unusual items in its library of powerups that do well to reintroduce an element of surprise for people who've played too many of these and know what to look for.  The game also rewards exploration with inventive, purely optional weapons, which is a great improvement over a hundred missile expansions.  Unfortunately all weapons do roughly the same amount of damage, even ones that are awkward to aim, so many are not as good as the default gun.  Metroid was inspired by Alien, and Alien was inspired by H.R. Giger.  Axiom Verge looks back to Giger's works and often feels even more Metroidy than Metroid itself.  It's a great decision, and the game looks gorgeous.  The game doesn't do anything exciting to enable sequence breaking - some breaks are possible, but it doesn't do anything as bold as Super Metroid's walljump or Bunny Must Die's parrying.  This, and fairly stiff, accelerationless movement controls, probably curtail any hope of it becoming a great game for speedrunning.
Date 2015-07-26 Playtime 26h 52m Rec Positive Je suis d'une génération qui a connu les premiers jeux vidéo.  A l'époque ils étaient souvent fais par une seule personne. Puis, on nous a expliqué que dorenavant le jeu vidéo serait fais par des équipes.  Aujourd'hui, on a des production triple A faites par des équipes de centaine de personne.  Mais il n y a rien affaire, sauf exception, ces jeux, malgré une réalisation technique souvent impressionnante, ils m'endorment.  Et puis la scène indé apparait, et voila que des gars tout seul  ou en petite équipe arrivent à faire de VRAI jeu vidéo. BRAVO.
Date 2015-07-25 Playtime 11h 17m Rec Negative Frustrating Controls ruin otherwise great game.  Axiom Verge is a solid metroidvania for the most part, but makes a few infuriating control choices that kept me from being able to ever enjoy the game for more than 30min at a time. More than that and the controls would agitate me enough to just quit and walk away for a while.  The 2 biggest issues effectively pair together. The right thumbstick for gamepads is horridly used as a weapon select wheel, with the L/R thumbstick clicks cycling between preset weapons. A problem with this is it becomes far too easy to end up swapping weapons unintentionally in combat because of inevitable clicks while moving.   All of this could be fixed with a little more condensing on controls. Remove the drone from having a discrete button press and treat it as a quick-select weapon. Make the selection wheel a Press+Hold button action to activate thumb-stick selection on Y, the quick-select tap Y, and the drone a preset 4th weapon in the quick select.  Another issue is a frustrating dash that is unlocked and controlled by double-tap direction movements. It feels uncomfortable to use in any situation and completely breaks momentum on the character while exploring. It would be much better served if it had a dedicated button to control use. A good candiate to replace is the super-bomb, which somehow gets a dedicated trigger while having ~10 locations to ever really need to use it, compared to the heavy use of the dash when unlocked.  I wish the controls were better so I could enjoy the great story, cool weapon selections, nice environments, and tons of secret items. As is, I'd have no incentive to hunt down all the secrets or ever try for the more difficult achievements because of how painful the controls can be to tolerate.  7/10 from an objective standpoint, but 4/10 from a personal view because of how outright bad the control feel compared to other recent and classic metroidvania games.
Date 2015-07-24 Playtime 4h 24m Rec Positive Mega cool!   Wer nur ein bisschen Fan von 2D Action Adventures im Stiel von Metroid ist, muss sich das Spiel umbedingt kaufen.  Die Steuerung ist ein Traum -> umbedingt ein Gamepad benutzen!
Date 2015-07-22 Playtime 25h 13m Rec Positive Pretty hard to explain how Fuq'ing epic this game is. Just buy it and enjoy the epicness.
Date 2015-07-22 Playtime 12h 21m Rec Positive After beating Axiom Verge in just under 12 hours for the first time, I must say this title just blew me away.  I have always enjoyed the Action Platformer type genre since I can remember. Many offerings in the past have come close to emulating the perfection achieved by the benchmark Metroid games. Axiom Verge I am pleased to say goes above and beyond. The story is intriguing and the setting completely engaging. As you progress the reality of the situation slowly pieces together and even though I've completed it, I still haven't 100% collected everything. So the finite details of the story are still out there to be found and pieced together.  Soundtrack was deliciously retro and completely unique, I've never heard anything like it.   The levels are superbly designed and there is plenty of exploration and back-tracking as you collect more and more gear and become capable of navigating the terrain. It is dark, organic, and mechanical all at the same time. A unique flavor all its own.  Highly Recommended
Date 2015-07-22 Playtime 11h 22m Rec Positive If you loved Metroid or Super Metroid, if you live for 8-bit/16-bit console gaming, if you enjoy side scrollers the way they used to be, this game is pure digital sex for the senses.  Awesome.
Date 2015-07-22 Playtime 32h 45m Rec Positive This game is amazing, probably in my top 5 favorite games. It's a HUGE game, with so much to do. The gameplay is great, and there are plenty of secrets to find. At first, the sense of exploration made me keep playing, finding out how to do certain things, finding new areas to explore, etc. But after about half way through the game, the main thing I wanted to do was find out what happened next in the story, and i'm not really a big story guy. I wont say anything about it specifically in order to keep this review spoiler-free, but you can look up the trailer to get started.  Gameplay: 9/10 The gameplay is great. It's a sidescroller, but by the end of the game there is so many maneuvers to do that it gets quite challenging. Another great thing about the gameplay is that I didn't find myself getting stuck anywhere to the point I had to look something up. Sure, you might have to think about it for a while, and the game is really challenging at times, but there is something so rewarding about figuring something out on your own, it's fantastic. The only problem with the gameplay was that some of the weapons seemed completely inferior to the base gun, which isn't really a downside but doesn't add much to the game.  Music/SFX: 7/10 The music was pretty good, it was fitting. Nothing that stood out too much, but also nothing that I really despised either. The sound effects were for the most part good, except for the drill hitting something that couldn't be drilled sounded similar to scratching finger nails against a chalkboard (which makes sense actually... but couldve chosen something less aggressive)  Story: 10/10 Like I said before, I don't want to spoil anything, but the story is simply fascinating. It what motivates you to keep exploring.  Controls: 9/10 The controls were really solid on the xbox-360 controller. I'm not sure how the keyboard support is, but judging by the movements you have to do it would seem to be pretty hard. This is really just a personal preference.  Graphics: 11/10 HOLY COW the graphics are amazing in this game. I don't really have anything else to say but WOW.  There is also a "hard" mode, and a "speedrun" mode, as well as completionist achievements for those who want to play even more. For the speedrun mode there are even leaderboards, which is great. Overall this game was well worth $20, maybe even $25.
Date 2015-07-22 Playtime 13h 57m Rec Positive Estamos PLAGADOS de metroidvanias. Es decir, estos juegos 2d de plataformas con exploración y elementos rpg, entre los que se incluyen Guacamelee, Dust: An Elysian Tail, Abyss Odyssey, Ori and the Blind Forest, Unepic, etc...  Bueno, Axiom Verge en realidad tiende más a reproducir el clásico Metroid, y esto es debido a que no subes estadísticas o niveles pero sí encuentras power-ups y armas distintas, además de estar en un mundo alienígena que recuerda a Alien (en el cual admite el creador de Metroid que se ha basado) pero sin la misma sensación de soledad que en la aventura de Samus Aran, puesto que al poco te encuentras un ente aliado llamado Elsenova que te dice cosas.  En un afán de homenajear las consolas de 8-bits han introducido una extravagancia con la cual rompes la 4ta pared, y es que llegas a conseguir un arma que "glitchea" enemigos y cosas, cambiandp por completo la "realidad", estropeando visualmente lo que afectas (de esto que encuentras a un robot y lo conviertes en una mesa de colorines inestable sobre la que apoyarte, wtf?! o cuando a un enemigo que expulsa exporas lo rompes en cuadrículas con esto y expulsa vida en su lugar).  ¿Historia? Interesante. Cuenta con final secreto bastante impactante así que os recomiendo esforzaros recolectando cosa. Encuentras cachos de lore en forma de notitas que te dan pistas sobre lo que ha pasado por aquí.  ¿Jugabilidad? Bueno, bueno. Es entretenido, pero no es muy difícil: Lo he acabado en Normal y en Difícil y si eres capaz de pasarte el Guacamelee muriendo poco te digo que este juego es un paseo. En el caso de las armas, hay muchas y son estupendas, pero sólo unas pocas son obligatorias para avanzar, otras tantas las he visto inútiles y hay una en concreto que es sensacional para matar a un boss, lo cual es malo porque, otra vez, hace que el combate sea muy fácil.  ¿Sonido? La P*lla de Goya. Suelo irme a dormir tatareando las melodías, y creo que encajan de p*ta madre con cada entorno en el que te encuentras.  ¿El precio? Yo creo que se percibe caro para ser un juego de este estilo. Si eres completista te durará 8 horas. Si a lo mejor te sientes "solidario", y tienes en cuenta el esfuerzo del creador en hacer él sólo los gráficos, componer la música, la programación, etc... Te recomendaría comprarlo, dicho esto.   En resumidas cuentas, si estás RABIOSO por encontrar un juego para SADOMASOQUISTAS, este no es lo tuyo pero yo creo que es un paseo audiovisual agradable, por su música, una historia que interesa y que tiene sus interpretaciones.  
Date 2015-07-21 Playtime 19h 33m Rec Positive Since Super Metroid, only two 2D Metroid games have come out: Zero Mission and Fusion.   Fusion was a really spectacular and different take on the Metroid 'verse, but some thought it was too linear, and had too much dialogue.   Zero Mission improved on Fusion's mechanics and is a better aging version of Metroid 1, but the rehashing of areas, while certainly nostalgic, did not bring much new to the series.   Super Metroid itself, while not my favorite Metroid game, is the best 2D game ever and had a lot that was completely original as well as all those little nostalgic areas while still managing to keep things fresh every step of the way.  Axiom Verge is a worthy successor.  You start off extremely confused in a giant mechanical egg. All you remember is there being an explosion in the laser lab you were working in. A mysterious voice tells you that there is a gun in the next room. The way to the right is blocked by Norfair bubbles, so you go left. You grab the gun,  then everything lights up like Super Metroid and you're blasting your way through bubbles and zoomers all over again. You could mistake this game for the next Metroid if your  wasn't wearing a t-shirt.  So you blast your way along and eventually find yourself in a room with a flying Mother Brain that calls YOU a demon.  Later, you see what appear to be texture glitches.  Everything begins to make sense eventually, don't get me wrong, but I won't spoil any more.  Overall this game is spectacular. A new and innovative Metroidvania that has unusual solutions to problems, a new and sometimes surreal world, good combat, tight controls, and a decent plot.  I am honestly giving this game a 10/10 because there is nothing wrong with it.  It is a perfect and fresh Metroidvania.  Now stop reading this and go buy it.
Date 2015-07-21 Playtime 24h 13m Rec Positive Main inspiration from Super Metroid since Nintendo doesn't give us what we want anymore after announcement of Metroid Prime Federation Force.  Overall this game is exactly what a Metroidvania is, tons of areas to explore, collectible items, unlocking abilities to access other areas, and awesome boss battles
Date 2015-07-21 Playtime 23h 44m Rec Positive Axiom verge is a good loooking, good sounding and fun game. THe overall room design wuth the enemies often makes it hard to just run through, and often gives a change to use the weapons you collect. The music is great for setting the alien feel to the game. Graphics look somewhere between disturbing and beautiful, which fits the overall tone of the game perfectly. There are times you may get lost, but its nothing you cant fix with a quick google search. Finally, the bosses for the most part are amazing. They each feel and play uique and offer quite a challenge. The only downsides to the game are the endgame is a massive drop in quality, as the final boss dosent even take skill, just spamming and ducking. Also exploring sometimes only rewards u with a health node, not very rewarding. If u dont mind these flaws, the rest of the game is amazing. Even with the problems it is definatly worth the money and time to play.
Date 2015-07-20 Playtime 5h 22m Rec Positive Reminds m of the good old days of super metroid and symphony of the night.  It brings its own feel and is much darker though.  I love it.
Date 2015-07-20 Playtime 16h 7m Rec Positive This is one of my top indie games and side scroller of all time. Its well made, has an amazing atmosephere, and has a pretty cool story. Its almost hard to believe one guy did all of this.
Date 2015-07-19 Playtime 23h 36m Rec Positive Als erstes denkt man sich wenn man ein bisschen weiter in dem Spiel ist ok jetzt fängt es an verpixelt zu werden. Stimmt nicht, desto weiter man im Spiel kommt desto mehr erklärt sich alles und desto interessanter wird es. Leider gibt es einige Probleme mit dem Schusswerkzeug und der Bewegung man kann nähmlich nicht nach rechts oben oder unten sowie unten links schießen oder laufen was die Sache kompliziert. Storymäßig ist das Game richtig geil nur das mit den Tafeln und den verschiedenen Sprachen ist leicht nervig. Es ist schwiergig zu meistern was mir sehr gut gefällt. Bin deswegen schon mehr ausgerastet als bei CoD. Grapisch gesehen erinnert es mich an Metroid von Nintendo was ich sehr anspruchsvoll fand. Ich kann das Spiel nur entpfehlen Leute. Bei mir bekommt das Spiel 8/10 Punkten.
Date 2015-07-19 Playtime 20h 23m Rec Positive great game
Date 2015-07-18 Playtime 16h 20m Rec Positive Contraninjametroidvaina.
Date 2015-07-18 Playtime 8h 35m Rec Positive For a one man team game, this looks amazing.  Heavily inspired by Metroid and from an esthetics PoV, HR Gieger's work. If you haven't played metoird, it's an exploration/adventure game where by collecting power ups you can expand your areas of exploration. Discovering new power ups along the way.   Music is very nicely composed, providing a sense of the unknown, uncertain of what's to unfold or what is up ahead.  Story is told through diaolg(text boxes) and lore about the location and what happened is unconvered via logs, which are scattered around the world.  But the best part about this is the address disruptor, I may have gotten the name wrong so pardon me if I did, but this weapon allows you to bend reality. Enemies will change their properties, speed and attack strategies if they are exposed to the ray long enough. This opens up new areas and its crucial to use if you want to get 100% in this game.  Bringing the old exploration/adventure game back in a good way, providing good music and excellent gameplay. Axiom Verge is well worht the 15$ asking price.
Date 2015-07-17 Playtime 13h 44m Rec Positive It's probably one of the most fluid Metroidvanias you'll ever play. Not to mention this game has original weapons and abilities, which is crazy for a genre that has been quite saturated the past couple of years. Also the main character has a lab coat which is always a plus. Definitely buy this if you enjoy hard exploration and platformer games. The soundtrack is also a beautiful asset. First playthrough is not all that long, probably six or seven hours if you're known with the genre, but again there's lots of things to get 100% of after you're done.
Date 2015-07-16 Playtime 16h 40m Rec Positive One dude made this. Graphics, music, gameplay - everything. And it felt like playing Super Metroid for the first time again. That's amazing to me. And Super Metroid took a team of 15 to make. Granted, the tools are better today and the retro inspirations are obvious. But, there's enough originality here to make it a love letter to Metroid, rather than a boring clone. TL;DR: Totally worth your time & money.
Date 2015-07-15 Playtime 17h 3m Rec Positive This is actually one of the best games I've ever played in my life.    In my opinion, it's better than any of the metriod games.  It's hard for me to say that, with the love and nostaliga I have for metroid, but this game just mechanically is superior.  Additionally, this game has a better soundtrack and a far, far better story.  Seriously, the story and aesthetic in this game is probably its biggest strongpoint.
Date 2015-07-14 Playtime 13h 36m Rec Positive Considering this game was made by one guy, it's a masterpiece. If I imagine a whole team of developers making this game; still a masterpiece. Some parts are stealon shamelessly from Super Metroid, but on the other hand so many things are original.  Graphically, musically, presentation wise and handling of the story is all fantastic.  All I want is a sequel that continues the story. 
Date 2015-07-14 Playtime 4h 34m Rec Positive ............OK, good and bad.  Good: It's like Metroid  Bad: It's like Metroid.  To explain, this game seems to have all the sins and virtues of the Metroidvania genre in one convenient package. The game, unlike some others of its ilk (Shovel Knight, for instance) focuses a lot more heavily on the METROID aspect, involving the level design, futuristic world, etc.   Problem is, it's a little too similar for its own good. Those long vertical shafts where everything looks the same? Yep.  Enemies that are very similar to their Metroid counterparts? We got Rinkas, we got Sidehoppers, we got Shriekbats...yeah, this base is covered.  The corruption gun is sorta a unique mechanic...  I recommend this game, but just know when I say it's like Metroid in every way, that includes the sins of the genre as well.
Date 2015-07-12 Playtime 23h 19m Rec Positive I highly recommend this title to 1. anyone who enjoyed classic platformers 2. anyone who would like to see how a well made classic platformer looks like.  This game combines superb, athmospheric art and music reminiscent of the 8-bit era with most of the best gameplay mechanics and design choices of the platformer genre.  If you enjoyed this game, go and grab EXILE.
Date 2015-07-11 Playtime 9h 35m Rec Positive I have played all Metroidvania out there (Afaik) and this is the absolute best game of this genre that i have ever played. It's SO damn perfect, the balance of puzzles, bosses, weapons, abilities and story is breathtaking. Plus, this is the first time i couldn't guess the end of the story.
Date 2015-07-10 Playtime 8h 47m Rec Positive For anyone who wants a great Metroidvania type of game, this is a great choice.  Borrowing from past 8-bit and 16-bit conceptualizations is only half of the formula.  The graphic design inspirations borrow heavily from HR Giger, and the music has a wordly enough variation to allow the overall attitude of the game to be within the definitions of modern-day video games.  The only weakness that is obvious is the fact that there is not a Boss Rush mode or a Survival Mode.  However, there is a Speed Run component, and the game has a Passcode function allowing for costume variations, among other ideas and concepts.  Seeing that this title has only been out for about 3 months, it may seem premature to claim that Axiom Verge will become a classic.  But, anyone who has a chance to experience its many beauties will discover retroactive reminiscences of a game worthy to be in any old school gamer's library.
Date 2015-07-10 Playtime 41h 0m Rec Positive This game is a great Metroidvania with interesting game mechanics. It's a solid title even if you don't know it was made by one guy. There haven't really been many pure Metroid style games recently- most similar try to blend the Metroidvania genre with other gameplay types. That's well and good, but this goes closer to the roots, and, in my opinion, is stronger for it.  However, there are a few minor issues.  First off, sometimes your progress is completely halted because of a detail you couldn't realistically find out on your own without a guide, unless you either get lucky or experiment more than should be necessary. (1 specific room and 1 specific boss.)  Second, the aiming controls could use some work- although they're usually fine, sometimes they force you to move in a specific direction to shoot the way you want to. There is a button that's supposed to help with aiming, but it locks MOVEMENT rather than aiming, which I found strange, because being stationary is usually a bad idea. Simply changing the movement lock to aim lock would be very helpful in this regard.  Third, the "glitches" don't ever really feel like you're actually messing with the game. Here are the things they do, based on my memory: Make enemies bigger/smaller Make enemies shoot slower Make enemies shoot with less spread Turn enemies into a different type of enemy Make enemies, or their attacks, destroy some specific walls Make enemies, or their attacks, create Kill enemies prematurely Make enemies slower Make enemies stop moving Make things solid/disappear/turn into blocks you can destroy Go through walls  These are used to good effect for unique gameplay that revolves around finding out how to best use these changes, but the "glitches" never really feel like glitches, other than the aesthetics. Going through walls is the closest it ever gets. For someone who's actually glitch-hunted in games (notably Super Metroid) this isn't like HUNTING for glitches, because you're given a gun and told "Use this to make things work differently." It's more like solving a combat puzzle in Megaman, or switching between worlds in Guacamelee. The glitch aesthetic is really just that, an aesthetic. It typically works well, but I was a bit disappointed it wasn't a bit more like actually finding glitches for yourself. There are also secret worlds that appear at random, but these felt more like random secrets than glitches to me from my limited experience with one.  Finally, an issue that was more of an annoyance than any of the other things on the list. The enemies all tend to be damage tanks. This is meant to be a catalyst for players that use strategy over simply running and gunning. However, what it tends to do is make fights drag even after you've found out the best strategy to use against an enemy.   One more thing: I think the game is actually TOO well-designed- the creator knew all the limits of the player at any given time, and prevented sequence breaking. I like sequence breaking, so this makes me sad.   Overall the game is very enjoyable (I finished the game, which I only ever do when I think it's worth playing all the way through.) However, go into it with the knowledge that the game is more about combat puzzles than realistic glitches.
Date 2015-07-10 Playtime 53h 23m Rec Positive TL:DR at bottom-  I love Super Metroid. I love Super Metroid so much that I searched out fan made ROMhacks of the game. One of the best I have found is Super Metroid: Redesign by Drewseph. He changes everything: the physics, the weapons, and game mechanics. It is completely different, but it is still fundamentally Super Metroid.  Axiom Verge is very similar in the regard. The gameplay is different, the physics are different, the weapons are different, the story is different...but it is still fundamentally Super Metroid. Rather, it takes what I love about Super Metroid and distills it into the amazing experience that is Axiom Verge. I cannot recommend this game enough.   If you like the classic 2D Metroid games, Castlevania games, or even run and gun games like Contra, this game is for you. If you like classic 2D platformers like Mario or Sonic, this game is also for you. If you don't like either of these game types, then this game might not be for you, but I would recommend getting it anyway for one simple reason: Steam offers refunds on games now.  You have literally nothing to lose if you get the game and immediately dislike it. You can use the refund option. However, I have a feeling that if you get Axiom Verge, you will want to keep it.  The music is very well written, and one of my favorite things about it is the prevalence of a heavy bass kick in most of the tunes. To me, this is Trace's heartbeat. It increases during boss battles, it decreases during calm areas. Another cool thing is the low health beep. Anyone who has played Zelda of Metroid is familiar with this; it is an annoying, jarring way of telling you that you might die if you don't get health soon. Axiom Verge uses this mechanic, but instead of overriding the music, the low health beep is implemented into whatever song you are listening to. It slows down or speeds up depending on the BPM of the song. The first time I heard it, I was amazed that I hadn't seen that used in any other game I have played as it is such a good way to let you know that you have low health.  The environments have some areas where the backgrounds have pulsating objects that move to the beat of the music. I am a huge fan of how this is added. It helps to suck me into the game, and make me feel more connected since the music is an integral part of the experience.  The jumping physics are top notch, and able to offer precise movement control. Some of the upgrades you get are very cool, but I won't go into them since finding them and figuring out what they do is a fun part of the game. There is only one part of the map I am less than impressed with, but that is just because there are a lot of small, white creatures that sort of blend in with the background and can disrupt your jumping if they hit you.   The difficulty of this game comes in normal mode and hard mode. I finished normal mode in about 10 hours, with something like 80% of the map revealed and 75% of the items found. There is a lot to find, and doing it is fun. There are an amazing amount of weapons that do various things, making some boss fights easier with certain weapons.  Overall, this is an amazingly well made game, which is made even more incredible by the fact that it was made completely by just one man: Thomas Happ. He designed the game, composed the music, and created the story. This game is a huge win for independant developers, as it shows that good things can come to those who work for them.  Get this game. Just...get it. As much as I love Super Metroid - the lonely atmosphere, taking down large boss enemies because Samus is awesomely powerful, the music, the exploration and cycle breaking...I am conflicted to say that this game may even be better than Super Metroid. They are very similar in game type, and this game does so many thing right. Super Metroid and Axiom Verge may have to live in my mind as co-favorite games.  TL:DR Get this game. If you hate it, Steam will refund you. Trust me, you won't hate it.
Date 2015-07-10 Playtime 3h 54m Rec Positive THE SHIT! Great inde game lots of fun.
Date 2015-07-10 Playtime 12h 19m Rec Positive I really enjoyed this game, awesome work for only one man development, art and music, sincerely nice job there.  If you are wondering why is that a "high" price, this game totally worth it, just give it a chace. It's like Super Metroid All over again with other history, wich im stil trying to fully understand, it will give you a lot of fun.
Date 2015-07-06 Playtime 17h 12m Rec Positive Hands down one of my favorite games ever since completing it. The gameplay is solid and feels good with a lot of the same challenge and reward as the NES era of video games.  The story is intriguing and interesting. It is told partially through interaction with other characters in the game, partially through the levels and surroundings as you explore, and partically through notes you find laying around. It was interesting enough that more often then not I would spend quite a bit of time just trying to find the next hidden note with more story, I wanted to know what else was going on in the world around me.  The gameplay and combat mechanics feel VERY strongly like 2d era Metroid. Its very satisfying with a large array of weapons that work better against different enemies under different situations. The enemies are varied and interesting. You have the ability fairly early on to "glitch" enemies which causes their behavoir to change, and this can be both helpful and hindering depending on level circumstances. The bosses all feel very well done and are often challenging trying to learn the patterns and proper method for attacking them.  The different items in the game all grant some level of improved mobility through the game, from grappling hooks to teleporting, and the mechanics are not always straight forward which in this case actually adds to the puzzle and challenge in a good way.  And the soundtrack... The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and I could double the length of this review just praising the music. So rather than do that, just trust me, if you like Chiptunes and old video game era music, this games soundtrack will blow your mind.  I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys classic metroidvania style games. This one gets passing marks on all aspects and should go right along side the classics.
Date 2015-07-05 Playtime 46h 40m Rec Positive It's like the metroid game that Nintendo will not give us. Maybe someday, until then, there is this awesome piece of work. Definitely recommend getting the soundtrack too.
Date 2015-07-05 Playtime 13h 23m Rec Positive Well crafted art, music, and gameplay with a story that leaves you thinking about the game long after finishing it.
Date 2015-07-05 Playtime 16h 42m Rec Positive At some point it becomes annoying when one guy makes a game that some consider to be on par with the classic Metroid games and a whole team at Nintendo comes up with Federation Force.  -Good atmosphere -Rewarding exploration/combat -Great music -Improves on a few old Metroid gameplay elements (Hub world, map reminder system, LOW HEALTH BEEPING THAT SYNCS UP WITH THE MUSIC)  -Dissapointing bosses -Laughable story -The grappling hook is bad -Sideburns (???)  8/10
Date 2015-07-05 Playtime 22h 51m Rec Positive Easily one of the best Indie games I have played.  Fantastic job.  Axiom Verge 2?????!?!?!?!? PLEASE!!!!
Date 2015-07-04 Playtime 20h 14m Rec Positive Axiom verge公理边缘是一款类《银河战士》的游戏。你可以从中找到许多银河战士的影子。一代阿萨姆泳装梗，场景搜索HP上限，不同的武器，变成球（召唤无人机）。陌生的星球，然后是一个似乎有原始神明遗迹的地方都有银河战士的影子。 这游戏地图很大，故事有些晦涩，但是非常有趣，缺点是有时候对话长爆。 地图探索上尽可能的做到有趣，但个人觉得和银河战士原版比起来，稍显有些乏力。除此外作者画的地图有时候有点偷懒但鉴于大地图超大，而且几个地域之间主体画风还是很赞，整体而言瑕不掩瑜。  总之玩得很愉快。8/10星推荐。银河战士粉必备。
Date 2015-07-04 Playtime 50h 45m Rec Positive Un jeu indé d'une qualité rare, qui a su restituer les éléments clés d'un Metroidvania tout en apportant de nouvelles idées (notamment le système de glitch qui est vraiment fun et intéressant). Blindé de secrets, le jeu occupe des dizaines d'heures bien qu'avec de la pratique, une run peut se boucler en 1h/1h30.  Les + :  - L'ambiance - Grande variété d'armes et d'outils - Des idées de gameplay originales - La musique - Le pixel art - Un bon équilibre hommage/identité - Taillé pour le speedrun - Replay Value satisfaisante  Les - : - Difficulté inégale
Date 2015-07-03 Playtime 14h 53m Rec Positive классная игра, после того как мне наскучили всякоразные витчеры в тёмном соусе, я просто садился за комп и грустно смотрел в монитор, и вот в один прекрасный день я обнаружил эту славную игрушку. не хочу ни с чем ее сравнивать, игра замечательная. прям играю в нее и вспоминаю восьмибитку из детства )))
Date 2015-07-03 Playtime 14h 30m Rec Positive Finally a Metroidvania where the "metroid" -part actually matters.
Date 2015-07-03 Playtime 20h 25m Rec Positive いわゆるメトロイドヴァニアと呼ばれるゲームだが、予想以上にメトロイドクローンで驚いた。もちろん随所にアレンジはされているが、ベースはメトロイドそのものであり、本家からの続編が期待出来ない以上、このようなタイトルが発表されることは貴重なことだと思う。価格がやや高く感じられるかもしれないが、購入に迷っているメトロイドファンなら買って損はしないはず。サウンドトラックも素晴らしい出来。※2016/2追記、日本語に対応しました！
Date 2015-07-03 Playtime 12h 37m Rec Positive Metroid... who?
Date 2015-07-02 Playtime 21h 31m Rec Positive  A worthy and fantastic homage to the 8 and (in particular) 16 bit Metroid games. Im four days out from finishing this game and the songs are still playing in my head.  In 30-some odd years of gaming I have never before felt the urge to listen to a game soundtrack outside of its game. I'm delighted to see it's for sale, and I'm truly disappointed to see it costs much as it does.
Date 2015-07-02 Playtime 27h 33m Rec Positive A game that I thought would be good, but turned out to be even better. At the halfway point of 2015, Axiom Verge is the lead runner for my personal Game of the Year.  (Really, though, AV's worth every cent and every second of your time.)
Date 2015-07-02 Playtime 22h 3m Rec Positive Very few games can match this level of polish and mastery. The soundtrack is some of the best I've heard, the controls are super tight, the bosses are interesting, and the exploration feels like a true Metroidvania. This is easily one of the best games I have ever played, period.
Date 2015-07-01 Playtime 48h 16m Rec Positive Disclaimer:  I grew up on the Metroid and Castlevania games.  The original Metroid is probably one of my top 5 favorite gaming experiences of my life.  So this game was basically made for people like me.  Somebody on Metacritic described it best:  This game is 'Retro Gaming Ecstasy'.  Challenging gameplay, with no real hand-holding and a large focus on exploration.  You'll do a lot of backtracking - as you'll find rooms where you will encounter insurmountable obstacles, only to later find an item which allows you to explore it - a classic feature of the 'Metroidvania' genre which I love.  Really fluid, tight controls - those who grew up on NES/SNES platformers will feel right at home here.  Diverse weapon selection and there are very few parts of the game that force you to use one weapon over another - you can choose which is best for your playstyle.  As you get deeper into the game (without spoiiling too much) there are a bevy of movement options at your disposal which adds to the experience greatly.  There are also a number of large,classic 16-bit style boss fights in the game.  The early ones are fairly trivial - the ones in the latter half of the game are fairly challenging and you will feel accomplished when you defeat them.   (Note this was only on Normal - I did not play on Hard - yet)  The only real frustration I had with my playthrough was going off to explore another area, forgetting to find a save location, dying, and then being reset to my last location, which might have been a long way away.  This only happened a couple of times, and I learned quickly to find a save spot while exploring!    Now that I am done, I am motivated to go back and see if I can do it faster, via the game's built in 'speedrun mode', which disables the story popups and slowdowns.  Very cool feature and a nice nod to the speedrunning community.  Highly recommended.  It's well worth $20.
Date 2015-07-01 Playtime 15h 16m Rec Positive Has all the trappings of a classic Metroidvania from the outset. A very well designed and built one, too. Doesn't reach the echelons of Super Metroid/Prime and Castlevania SOTN, but a very worthy contender.  But that's just from the outset. As you continue through the game, you'll find it subverts a lot of what you'd usually expect. Small Morph-Ball sized gaps? You don't fit though those. You send a remote drone to explore in your place. And the glitches... well, this game replicates glitches you might have seen on some poorly built NES games, but these are gameplay mechanics. An annoying exploding enemy can be glitched to make every other enemy explode when you shoot it. Buggy terrain can be swept away or made into existence to create passage.   Surprising story, too. Creepy collectable notes, Prime log style, that cast things you've encountered in a different light. A far more intricate plotline than any Metroid or Castlevania game, told through dialogue and a few cutscenes. There's a speedrun option that tracks your time and skips every single talky bit, if you don't care for that.  Especially impressed that this was made by one person alone, over the course of 4-5 years. The time invested shows.
Date 2015-07-01 Playtime 16h 14m Rec Positive It's rare these days finding a game with this much going on. Even more rare for an indie game to have this much substance. Yet even more impressive is the fact that such a game can exist under the creative eye of a Single Person. All coding, artwork, music handled by a single person with more creative talent than should be possible.  I grew up in the NES days and put my time into Batman, Megaman, Bionic Commando, Ninja Gaiden, etc. etc., and this game just Does It Right. Sooo right, down to the 8-bit cinematic sequences, sound effects and difficulty. The art here is Giger-like, bio-mechanical monstrosities with a minimal colour palette for each area. Not NES minimal, but nostalgic nevertheless. Every sound fits so well and is incredibly authentic, without being a knock-off. The stereo digital static that surfaces in certain spots just makes the hair on my neck stand up. Speaking of which, the music isn't anything to scoff at either; it's a beautiful hommage to classic games, but incredibly modern/apocalyptic dark electro. This makes revisiting areas a pleasure, just to hear the amazing songs play again. Trust me, you'll be revisiting places often.  There's the obvious Metroid comparisons, albeit with an integrated map system, but it feels completely natural. Hidden areas requiring your newly-found skill power-up begs for exploration of every section of the map. Items and Nodes appear in plain sight, seemingly unobtainable, until you advance enough in the game to wander back and pick it up. The list of weaponry is Huge as well, breaking up any monotony and providing a depth of strategy to the R-Type-esque bosses, and overall use of different weapons vs. different enemies. I highly suggest using a gamepad, it's really fluid and organic, although remembering the weapon icons is a little tough.  Bottom line is that Axiom Verge is well worth your time, even if you get 'stuck': you can always come back and dig a little deeper. There will always be that corner of the map not filled in, taunting you to run 'n gun your way over to it to see what's up. There are images and moments in this game that are absolutely classic experiences. You won't regret it.
Date 2015-06-30 Playtime 23h 37m Rec Positive Last time we got a 2D metriod game was 2004, BOUT DAMN TIME WE GOT ANOTHER, ONLY BEEN 11 YEARS!
Date 2015-06-30 Playtime 21h 5m Rec Positive Amazing, and just keeps getting better.
Date 2015-06-30 Playtime 20h 46m Rec Positive So I finally completed Axiom Verge for the first time, after just under 20 hours, and only when the end credits rolled did I find out a very important bit of information.  Turns out, the entire game was made by one man, Thomas Happ.  Tom, you did a fantastic job!  If you like metroidvania games, you will like this a lot.  I got a bit lost twice, and the last two bosses are tough as nails.  Aside from that the difficulty ramps up gradually as you go, and there is loads of places to explore and things to find.  The soundtrack is awesome as is the artwork.  The controls are fairly solid, with the only real gripe I have being that I kept switching weapons while doing another move because it was tied to the analogue stick buttons and I kept clicking them by accident.  I'm really glad I took a chance on this one, and I really look forward to seeing what he makes next.  It is well worth the £15 asking price.
Date 2015-06-30 Playtime 23h 56m Rec Negative It's like Metroid, except your weapons are useless and bosses are grindy instead of fun.  The exploration and items are fine, but having to worry about every single enemy is not, especially when you have to pour bullets into anything to kill it.    One can't avoid comparisons to Super Metroid.  It's got everything you like from Super Metroid except the flow.
Date 2015-06-30 Playtime 30h 25m Rec Positive A great "Metroidvania" style of game. The story can be a bit confusing, but the gameplay, level designed, graphic presentation, and overall challege is all top notch.
Date 2015-06-30 Playtime 36h 3m Rec Positive If you liked super metroid and the like you will enjoy this.  The game is a little short (~10 hours) which left me a little disapointed given the overall quality of the content.  It's hard to believe this game was developped by a single person.  Things that I liked: - Wicked arsenal of weapons - Hunting for items and new leads - The wicked graphics, animation and music - The dark/mysterious sci-fi storyline  Things that I didn't like: - The tedious walking from here to there when you're stuck.  Some speed traveling would be nice.  This is a short but great game.  Tom Happ has already confirmed an Axiom Verge 2 and I will definetly check it out when the time commes (in a couple of years I guess...).  No regrets.
Date 2015-06-28 Playtime 53h 22m Rec Positive Do you love the old metroid?  Ok, the new ones too?  Well this is a good game to pick up and play for 20 bucks, probably cheaper than most 60 dollar titles and the latest metroid games, you know the ones.  My only gripe is their isent a fast travel system, which really kind of slows the game pace down and makes it feel like a slog to get from place to place.  But the ammount of guns you get is nuts.  Flamethrowers, shotguns, pulse rifle, GLITCH BOMBS!  Also the final boss is pritty fun, not epic, but it was fun to fight and quite the challange.  However dont play speedrun mode unless you are religiously playing this game as you will probably die alot.
Date 2015-06-28 Playtime 27h 0m Rec Positive Ein sehr gutes Spiel das einen mehrere Stunden an den PC fesseln kann.
Date 2015-06-28 Playtime 17h 27m Rec Positive A love letter to pre-1995 2D exporation games and a blast to play though. It's easy to dismiss Axiom Verge as a clone, but the game has enough unique twists that could give any bounty hunter a run for their money. Axiom's main feature is a throwback to dusty catridge games where the graphics would get scrabled or players could force themselves into places the game wasn't programmed for them to go. The game actually incorporates these glitches into the gameplay; the hero has the ability to zip through walls, make tiles appear and disappear and scramble enemies into other forms. You may even find randomly placed secret areas unique to your save file that are a blast to seek out and discover. Aside from a few late-game issues (the map doesn't keep track of where you found items, just whether you've found everything or not) Axiom Verge is a solid game start to finish!
Date 2015-06-27 Playtime 28h 6m Rec Positive Excellent design, controls & gameplay with extreme attention to details.  A very well done Metroidvania type game. 
Date 2015-06-27 Playtime 26h 40m Rec Positive Without doubt one of the best Metroidvanias that I've played so far. An indie game as great as Cave Story, and a "Metroid based game" best than Super Metroid itself
Date 2015-06-27 Playtime 12h 4m Rec Positive You like Super Metroid? This game is your freind. You dont' like Super Metroid? Fuck you then this game is great.
Date 2015-06-25 Playtime 11h 12m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a very polished and well-made game. It draws inspiration from the Metroid series but does enough different to keep itself interesting. I highly recommend it!  [b]Pros:[/b] [list]     [*]The art, audio, and gameplay are all excellent.     [*]Lots of different weapons with unique functions.     [*]Good length (took me about 11 hours to complete), not including speedrun options [/list]  [b]Cons:[/b] [list]     [*]Secret areas can feel too hidden at times, forcing you to drill on every wall tile looking for breakable blocks.      [*]The weapons feel optional and like they're placed in random locations; obtaining one doesn't feel like a special event.     [*]The teleporting controls can be annoying. Slightly moving the joystick sometimes sends you in unintended directions. [/list]
Date 2015-06-24 Playtime 21h 46m Rec Positive Why can't axiom verge crawl?
Date 2015-06-24 Playtime 16h 24m Rec Positive This game is quite simply phenomenal. I've just completed it and I feel buzzed. On first impressions it might seem like another Metroid clone. However, the more you play, the more you realise that it has a unique character and personality of its own. I'd say the words spiritual successor would be most appropriate. It utilises all of the strengths of the Metroid franchise and virtually none of the weaknesses.  The game is challenging, but none of that challenge was unfair. It was obvious the developer could see the game through the player's eyes when designing it, like having save rooms spaced apart at perfect intervals (and there's always one before boss fights), the levels being designed really well, the controls being slick and smooth, and you're never forced to do silly wall jumping manoeuvres that Metroid had you do.  The visuals worked well. Most of them were just dungeons really, but everything was consistent. And the music was a whole new level of awesome, ranging from gripping atmospheric tracks to adrenaline-pumping boss battle tracks.   The game throws a variety of challenges your way, there are tonnes of weapons and unique accessories to collect that help you get stronger, plenty of secrets to find, but my favourite aspect were probably the boss fights. They were all challenging to some degree, especially the ones in the second half of the game, but each and every one of them could be beaten with the right strategy. The trick is to simply figure out that strategy and to optimize it. I kind of wish there were more of them in fact. From what I recall, the game only has 7 boss fights in total.   Since this is mostly a dungeon crawler, the story was in the background most of the time, but it had some cool and unique concepts, and the backstory cutscenes were always interesting, as they always revealed something new.  I can't really find anything major to criticise about the game, aside from the fact that it's not for everyone. If you've ever liked any of the Metroid games, or any other games with similar gameplay, you wouldn't want to miss Axiom Verge. It's slick, fun, and rewarding, exactly as games should be.
Date 2015-06-24 Playtime 11h 37m Rec Positive Loved the crap out of it!
Date 2015-06-24 Playtime 16h 8m Rec Positive I have never played a Metroid game in my life, but if I did, I would say Axiom Verge plays like a Metroid game.  It also takes the concept of data corruption and implements it in a way that's... just perfect. Even when I saw something that I thought shouldn't behave a certain way, it felt justified by the overall game mechanics.  [spoiler]And personally, Ukhu was the hardest boss. I beat Athetos on my first try, yet died at least 7 times to that oversized mosquito.[/spoiler]
Date 2015-06-24 Playtime 18h 50m Rec Positive Highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of the Classic 2D Metroid games, with no REAL metroid games on the horizon this is a fantastic game to fill that void.  With strong influence (assuming that is) from the Metroid series, there's plenty of weapons, abilities and power ups to keep the gameplay fresh during the entire playthrough.  Explore a crazy alien planet riddled with a ton of secrets to find with some kick ass tunes and strange enemies.   I thoroughly enjoyed my playthough (about 12 hours) and plan to do more, again if you're an old school metroid fan this game will have you feeling right at home while still being unique and fresh.
Date 2015-06-24 Playtime 24h 45m Rec Positive Do you like Super Metroid?  Then you'll like this.
Date 2015-06-23 Playtime 12h 36m Rec Negative I'm sorry but this game costs $19.99 in America and £14.99  in England! £14.99 comes to about $23.59  And $19.99 comes to about £12.71 Why on earth does it comes more over here! It's not importanting because this is a digital! I'm worry but the person who made this game is charging fair for an indie game. £14.99 is too much for an indie game anyway, I wish I hadn't paid that much in the first place. Go by a game like Cave Story+ it's more worth you money then this game!
Date 2015-06-23 Playtime 18h 45m Rec Positive 这是一个 玩起来像是恶魔城或者银河战士但是其实是个密! 室! 逃! 脱!的游戏 比起任地狱的绿帽子毁屏达传说那种拿到新道具排上大用场的剧情 这货简直就是丧心病狂!你拿到了新道具后本地区可能完全不需要这个道具,你跌跌撞撞迷路一样跑到很久之前的地图突然豁然开朗卧槽这就是世外桃源么!卧槽我可以继续进行下去了  想到什么写什么系列 建议年龄:16岁以上,否则你真的不会去仔细思考如果过关,你信不信. 中期我写了几页的地图信息..否则哪里有道具暂时拿不到一会就忘记了. 游戏地图略微混乱,有时候差点把我骗了. 密道简直丧心病狂,有的地方甚至有俩密道,无人机拆砖头时候仔细一看上方还有个同色砖块,过去一看居然也能拆. 这简直就是矿工科学家(我已变成一个拿着矿枪的疯子一路挖过去了,吃我一记洛阳铲啦!) 难度挺微妙的,普通难度简直就是意思意思的难度,最终boss站撸系列(当然没找到弱点你就悲剧了,除了弱点boss无敌)  武器花里胡哨的有用的都是穿墙武器猥琐打法..  无人机看着好抱歉但是作用杠杠的,好想养一只..  抓钩我熟悉操作花了15min你说我手残呢还是手残呢  键盘打起来斜方向瞬移不好操作..  游戏给我印象最深的东西  glitchgun这个地址破坏者还是啥的,也就是个hack枪,非常有趣,清扫道路修改怪物属性能力使其弱化什么的游戏的灵魂武器之一.  奇妙(葩)的剧情,只言片语全靠脑补  3件衣服,穿墙 瞬移 强力瞬移,根据剧情进度获得,拿到后满眼泪花QAQ翻出纸去看哪些道具终于能把他收入囊中了  游戏自带一套或者说两套语言,不过比起fez来这里只是意思一下,只有一句密码你需要自己翻译其他都有密码工具代劳  最最重要的是这个游戏是一个人写出来的,碉堡了,和某方project一样的存在,虽然这边的bgm我并不喜欢..  20刀感觉买的挺值得的,吃了我20小时才只是全地图探索..   
Date 2015-06-23 Playtime 14h 42m Rec Positive Plutôt qu'attendre un hypothétique nouveau Metroid par Nintendo, achetez Axiom Verge.
Date 2015-06-22 Playtime 27h 19m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is quite simply one of the best metroidvania games I have ever played, including all of the original Metroid games and several of the Castlevania games. The exploration and backtracking, powerups, and same-design-but-different-color-so-they-must-be-stronger monsters are all highly reminiscent of the genre's early days (before it was even a genre). But that's not where Axiom Verge ends as a game.  The gameplay quickly becomes far more advanced than any metroidvania I have played, and the twists in both plot and abilities are unique, inspiring, and flat-out amazing. While it can be infuriating at times, trying to beat a particularly hard boss or fill out that one hard-to-reach square of map to reach 100% for an area, I have found it almost impossible to put this game down to do anything else.  The controls can be difficult to get used to at first, but that quickly fades as you continue gameplay. The weapon selection is easy to understand and memorize, and there are enough save points throughout the game.  Overall, this game is heavily reminiscent of the games that created the metroidvania genre, but with so much unique additions to that idea that you cannot call yourself a fan or player of metroidvanias if you haven't played this game.
Date 2015-06-22 Playtime 8h 8m Rec Positive I have never bothered writing a gme review before, but felt this game derserved it. Besides the fact that it was made by 1 man alone, this game is so well crafted! One of the best gaming experiences ive had to date, reminds me of how good gameplay is what gaming is really abou. The 8bit graphics and music is so incredibly well done it makes you want to teleport into this world and live in it!  Masterpiece i say. Only downfall, and i mean only downfall is the backtracking and killing the same enemies multiple times..but im nitpicking..this game is an incredibel experience. Get it now!
Date 2015-06-22 Playtime 15h 13m Rec Positive Metroid inspired, but totally of it's own calibre and style. Best game of the genre in years.
Date 2015-06-22 Playtime 2h 51m Rec Positive One of the best metroidvanias I've played
Date 2015-06-21 Playtime 37h 45m Rec Positive One of the best Metroidvania games I've ever played. The story is good, bosses are well designed and there's a lot to explore. The graphics are a really cool mix of 16-bit era pixel graphics and modern effect. The music is also excellent. Very hard not to recommend, unless you absolutely hate action platformers, you should definitely play Axiom Verge.  There's also a ton of optional pick-ups and a very well done speedrun-mode.
Date 2015-06-21 Playtime 32h 30m Rec Positive 16ビット時代風味の重厚なドットで描かれる、謎の異世界を舞台にした 横スクロールのアクションアドベンチャー。いわゆるメトロイドヴァニア。 独特のSF的世界観に基づいたストーリーはなかなか引きつけられるものがあり、 それと密接に関連した道具が色々登場するのも面白いところ。 世界や敵の存在そのものを書き換えてバグらせたり、壁をすり抜けたりと、 他のゲームではあまり見られないような演出が色々と用意されています。  メトロイドヴァニアとしては、非常に探索要素を重視した作り。 ストーリー上の次の行き先がマップ上に表示されることは一切ないので、 手持ちのアクションで行けるところを探しながら進めていく必要があります。 また隠されているアイテムの数も非常に多くて、 怪しいところを調べると大体何かが出てくるという充実っぷり。 最終段階まで進んでも、どの部屋にアイテムがあるかということは明らかにならず、 ショット等では無反応な壁をすり抜けられる場所も多いので、 アイテム収集率100％はかなりやりがいのある目標となります。 ちょっとした画面表示の変化に気がつかないと駄目だったり、 すごく分かりにくい敵の習性を利用しないと駄目だったり、 反則スレスレの謎解きもあるのが嬉しいところ。  逆に、アクション的な難易度はかなり低め。 プラットフォーマー／ジャンプアクションとしての難しさは皆無で、 即死するような穴やトゲは一切なし。ボス戦の難易度も全体的に低く、 前半は遠くからちょっと弾を避けながら撃ってれば終わる程度。 後半に至っては、パワーアップさえきちんと回収していれば 回避すらせずゴリ押ししてるだけでＯＫと、ちょっと物足りなさが漂うほど。 一応、アイテム低回収率プレイをすると、後半のボスは歯応えが出てくるんですが、 その辺にはあまり期待しない方がよいです。  難点を挙げるならば、ものすごい沢山の種類のメインショットがあるにも関わらず、 その大半は存在意義が分からないゴミの山であることでしょうか。 その労力はもうちょっと別の所につぎ込めなかったものか。 あとワープ移動の類いが一切存在しないので、終盤のアイテム探索段階に入ると、 非常に移動が面倒くさくなります。ただこれは、タイムアタックをする場合は 面白い要素になるので、欠点とばかりは言えないところですが。 会話やイベントを消去して、区間ごとのタイマーカウンターを表示する 公式RTAモードもついていて、かなりタイムアタックを重視した作りでもあるようです。  全体として、メトロイドヴァニアの探索成分が好きな方ならば 無条件でお勧めできます。1周のプレイ時間はは10～15時間程度が目安でしょうか。 ただ、歯応えのある横スクロールアクションゲームを求めてるという方は 避けた方が無難かもしれません。
Date 2015-06-21 Playtime 20h 17m Rec Positive An Impressive work of one man.
Date 2015-06-21 Playtime 23h 26m Rec Positive This game is really fun and i love playing it so much
Date 2015-06-20 Playtime 2h 49m Rec Positive MUST PLAY for every Metroid fan, who also like a taste of cyberpunk, glitch/noise, retro and an awesome soundtrack. One can't really argue about this game. Everything just matches. A real loveletter to the "original" one.
Date 2015-06-20 Playtime 5h 4m Rec Positive It's like Mario Kart but better.
Date 2015-06-20 Playtime 49h 18m Rec Positive Other positive reviews say what I want to say, so I'll just add that this game is a steal at $20, its full price. A STEAL. Don't hesitate to grab this one.  The soundtrack is for sale, so I'll add a bit: if a soundtrack is amazing, I'll usually grab it (like Terraria, or Monaco, or Super Metroid), but I wasn't a huge fan of this one.
Date 2015-06-20 Playtime 36h 24m Rec Positive An excellent action paltformer; tight controls and a great soundtrack.  Axiom Verge has a retro asthetic with modern day conviniences.
Date 2015-06-19 Playtime 8h 7m Rec Positive Excelente!! Si te gusta metroid este juego es 100% seguro que te guste
Date 2015-06-18 Playtime 17h 25m Rec Positive Just great fun for 80 KIDS :)
Date 2015-06-18 Playtime 26h 53m Rec Positive Я потратил на Axiom Verge где-то 25 часов, прошел её, так сказать, на одном дыхании. Axiom Verge, хоть и относится к искусственному жанру «метроидвании», но сравнивать её с истинным Метроидом ни в коем случае нельзя (т.к. любая игра проиграет Метроиду :p ).   [h1]Что это за игра?[/h1] [b]Axiom Verge[/b] – обычный олдскул платформер, типа «прыгай и стреляй во врагов», но тут есть две составляющие, которые никак не отпускают от игры: это мир игры (сеттинг) и сюжет, построенный на нём. Собственно, ради сюжета и играешь в игру до конца, хочется узнать, что же тут, черт возьми, происходит. А сюжет нагородили (правильно - нагородил, т.к. игру полностью делал один человек) такой, что интерстеллар, матрица и терминатор нервно покуривают в стороне. Механика игры реализована по большей части на исследовании мира, поэтому много сюжетного повествования приходится узнавать из находимых записок. А находить будем не только записки, но и power-up’ы, оружие, примочки, типа дрели или искажающего устройства. И тут нам Метроид передает пламенный привет, т.к. многие вещи запрятаны так, что ветераны [b]Metroid, Super Metroid и Metroid Fusion[/b] будут усиленно вспоминать былые навыки.  Без фирменных фишек Axiom Verge не обходится. Тут есть и плащ, позволяющий проходить сквозь стены, и Искажающее устройство, которое начинает заглючивать врагов и т.д. Этим glitch’ингом пронизана вся механика игры, что делает геймплей Axiom Verge гораздо интереснее, т.к. полностью меняются свойства искажаемых объектов.  [h1]Понравилась ли игра?[/h1]  [b]Что мне понравилось:[/b] + Сюжет, основная часть игры получилась шикарной! Жалко, что усилиями одного человека не удалось раскрыть сюжет максимально полно, а записки необязательны к собиранию.  + Музыка. Музыка шикарна с первых нот, но опять же, вроде в игре 16 уникальных треков, но разнообразия не ощущается.  + Геймплей платформера разбавлен glitch’ингом.  [b]Нейтрально:[/b] # Графический стиль обыденный, но на мой вкус, можно было сделать чуть более детализированней. Хотя спецэффекты и задники смотрятся прекрасно.  # Оружия в игре около 20 видов. Но вы будете пользоваться двумя-тремя постоянно, в особых случаях еще двумя-тремя.  # Записки, записки. Игру можно пробежать за 2 часа, если знаешь куда бежать. Если хочешь проникнуться игрой, то придётся искать записки, предметы. Для ветеранов Метроида это ерунда, но будет ли это интересно другим игрокам?  [b]Что мне не понравилось:[/b] - Сложность. От подобной игры ожидаешь немного испытаний, но тут всё совсем просто. В игре две сложности: Нормальная и Тяжелая. Я хардкорности не хотел, выбрал нормальную и попал в детский сад. За 25 часов я проиграл всего 10, КАРЛ, десять раз! Пару раз в самом начале по неосторожности, еще пару раз специально искал тайники в лаве и сгорел, остальное – на боссах. По многим отзывам видно, что Тяжелый режим не далеко ушел по сложности.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=463919660  - Боссы. Как вы уже поняли боссы убиваются за 1-2 подхода. Все. На режиме Hard, может и за 3 подхода, не знаю. Боссы односхемные, т.к. не меняют свою тактику от уровня жизни. Только чутка ускоряются. Против них тактика простая– забился в угол карты, где босс тебя не достает, и стреляешь, или просто прыгаешь от пуль и стреляешь.  Т.е. по большей части у меня претензии к балансу игры, если его подправить, то будет ОК! Игра стоит своих денег (400 руб), «метроидвания’вским» ветеранам играть обязательно. Остальным – не знаю…  [h1]Оценка игры:[/h1] 7 метроидов из 10, но, как я уже сказал, это не Метроид и не пытается им быть! Поэтому: [b]10 аксиом из 10![/b]
Date 2015-06-18 Playtime 15h 21m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is one of the most impressive Metroidvanias I've ever played. Everything about the game is nearly perfect. I liked this one even a little bit more then Ori. Graphics, Sound, Gameplay and Story are all on another Level. I still can't believe this was done by one guy...  Thank you Tom Happ! You are a god! Five out of Five!!!
Date 2015-06-18 Playtime 23h 31m Rec Positive This game rules. It's as good as it looks; very Super Metroid, very David Cronenberg.
Date 2015-06-17 Playtime 31h 30m Rec Positive Pros  - Solid gameplay with plenty of items/wrapons   - Plenty of exploration, and rewards  - Good story  - Good background music/sounds very similar to Metroid  - Amazing atmosphere Cons  - I don't say this often, but way too many weapons.  20+ weapons is just too much to handle. Most of the time, I generally cycled between 2-3 weapons. Some of the weapons also felt so similar to others, I really didn't bother using them most of the time. Reducing the number of weapons, and increasing their unique interactions with the environment would have added a lot of flexibility in the game (see metroid prime games, fewer weapons, but I felt more attached to the weapons)  - Some of the enemies and areas feel like there's a cheap shot. By the end, I made a habbit of running my drone through each room before I walked through to keep from getting sneak attacked by the burrowed   - Most of the bosses were too easy. The only bosses I had a hard time with were Uruku (for some reason, I couldn't get it through my head to shoot the mouth after clearing the other parts) and Ukhu. Giving the bosses more varied attack patters and behaviors would have made them much more engaging for the whole fight, rather than the first half where the patterns were memorized.  Summary Don't take the cons as a "don't play." These are just things I felt the game could have done a little better. Overall, I thought  this was a fantastic game beginning to end, and I am excited for axiom verge. The gameplay, music, and art style were all so reminiscent of the old days exploring dungeons in Metroid. Not only does it capture the styles of the old game, but it builds upon it with even more interesting zones. The story is very well paced, leaving me always looking forward to getting to the next area and seeing how things progressed.   Overall Very solid indie title that was incredibly fun to play
Date 2015-06-17 Playtime 13h 21m Rec Positive This is the best metroidvania since Super Metroid. You owe it to yourself to play it. Though inspired by Metroid, the game is entirely its own and lifts nothing from the Metroid series.
Date 2015-06-17 Playtime 11h 44m Rec Positive Holy mother of cow. I do take some big breaks, but when I get back to playing holy crap. It's insane! Wish I knew how to write reviews better, but definitely a game to grab on sale. If you're a big enough Metroid fan, and disappointed in E3 and need a dose of new Metroid ASAP, this is your game. More than likely worth the $20.
Date 2015-06-17 Playtime 26h 32m Rec Positive For someone who had a PC during the primetime of Metroid games and never played any of them, Axiom Verge is the game which helps you travel back in time and enjoy this genre at its best in the modern days. It's obviously not aimed for players who are looking for graphics and super new detailed effects, but from my own experience this always comes at the cost of gameplay and fun. And this is where Axiom Verge excels.   Took me 15 hours to beat the game with 97 deaths, 71 % map revealed and 60 % items. Yes I am kinda new to this genre and I am lame :-) This being said, I had a great time and fun. BUT the backtravelling and countless hours of just looking where you might go, what you have missed might be frustrating for someone. Some places where so unintuitive, that after a few hours I just used a guide at some parts because I value my time more than the joy of the moment when you find out where to go. Oooooh , so this is iiit .... umm okay ?   The sound and the music is another superb aspect of the game which I enjoyed very much, but the thing is that during my 2nd gameplay I found it kinda repetetive and maybe even annoying. Not every song is good, so I ended up using my own music in the background.  Played on a keyboaard since my old Gamepad is not supporter because of the lack of the circular buttons. I have only the D-pad. Steam big picture mode doesnt let you save your controller settings which btw carries over to the game, unless you bind every button.  Is this game good ? Yes it is, definitely. Is this game perfect ? No, it isn't. It has it's flaws like everything in this world. I am yet to play a perfect game or meet a perfect human :-) Is this game worth it ? Yes it is, but probably not at full price. I bought it here on steam for 17.99. I cant say I regret it, I just cant recommend it for this amount of money.  But know also this... the replayability in this game is huge if you like speedrunning. For the rest, one or two playthroughs will be enough.
Date 2015-06-16 Playtime 30h 18m Rec Positive The first metroidvania I've consciously played, and for me, it's brilliant. Just kept drawing me back in. The only drawbacks I'd highlight are repeated backtracking, sometimes for hours, though this is part of the charm of the metroidvania; and that one point in the game where everyone in the universe has gotten stuck, which is unsporting and counterintuitive but simple to solve once you know how. I'd conjecture you'd need to be a fan of at least some action-exploration 8 and/or 16 bit games to enjoy it, and you need patience, memory, a small amount of creativity and a smattering of the twitch-gamer about you, though not in crisis situations. Boss fights are fair and balanced. Amazing work for a single developer. Best indie title I've purchased in an age, and I buy a good few. Looking forward to replaying it in a few months once my memories of the best routes through have faded. Recommended.
Date 2015-06-16 Playtime 13h 22m Rec Positive If you are a fan of Metroid this game was made with your desires in mind.
Date 2015-06-16 Playtime 44h 11m Rec Positive You've probably already heard all the "Metroid-clone" comments in regards to this game, but to be honest I really didn't feel like I was playing a Metroid game. It honestly felt a bit more like what Half Life would be as a side-scroll adventure. There's a LOT to discover in this game, and quite a bit of it can be tricky without using Google (at least, it was for me). The story, environments, and creatures are all very bizarre, but in a way I found interesting. A lot of it is told through notes that are hidden around the game's world, and some of it could possibly be a bit of a challenge to grasp. There was more than once I would read a note I had found, and then say "So... science and shit."  Pros: Good, tight controls (mostly, see cons) Music is fantastic Gorgeous pixel art, if you're into that sort of thing (which I am) Interesting, thought-provoking story (mostly, see cons) Lots of neat weapons and tools Lots of hidden things to find Boss fights were fun (mostly, see cons)  Cons: One particular tool obtained later in the game tends to activate by accident very easily Some of the guns lost their usefulness later in the game. Others never seemed to have any. Story is inconclusive and barely explains itself Final boss was a bit disappointing compared to the others  Personally the cons do little to keep me from loving this game. If you like what you see and hear in the videos, then you'll probably like it.   
Date 2015-06-15 Playtime 13h 53m Rec Positive Its feel a lot like super metroid with less boss and a more active story.  I wish there would be more boss, but the game is still very good.
Date 2015-06-14 Playtime 32h 38m Rec Positive 내가 메트로배니아를 재밌게 했다 싶은 사람은 그냥 사라 무조건 사라.  3D 게임이 넘쳐나는 요즘 이런 높은 퀄리티의 2D 던전 탐색형 어드벤쳐 게임은 너무나 반갑다.
Date 2015-06-14 Playtime 10h 25m Rec Positive If you love Super Metroid, you will love this.  - Tight controls - Smooth gameplay - Loads of upgrades (some are optional, which is a good thing) - Nice progression - Maps are okay - Awesome soundtrack  Didn't give two sh*ts about the story, but that was my choice. There story is there but it's not very compelling. Some anoying dialouges ruined it for me.  I spent about 10 hours completing the game with aprox 78% items collected. If you are a fan of metroidvanias you need this in your collection.  9/10 With a thumbs up!
Date 2015-06-14 Playtime 16h 39m Rec Positive If you've ever played and enjoyed a 2d Metroid or Castlevania game, try Axiom Verge!
Date 2015-06-14 Playtime 16h 53m Rec Positive It's familiar, and yet it's not - and this works incredibly well to its advantage.  Taking the basics of the formula established by the Metroid series, it goes and builds upon it in a variety of ways. From the large assortment of weapons and equipment, to the glitches and how they allow for advanced traversal in the world.  Then there's the art style, ranging from simple 8-bit, to introducing more and more colour as you explore the world.  Plus, the soundtrack - ranging between unnerving, dischordant, and pulsing, which works incredibly well with the tone, and nature of the world.  All up, it feels, provides an good challenge - between the exploration, the bosses, and the exploration which you need to put in to be able to get to the end. Though, it has to be said, there are a few design choices I'm not the biggest of fans of - primarily the requirement to teleport by double tapping the thumbstick or d-pad - I felt it far too fiddly, and really only used it to get through environmental hazards as a result.  It's not a game you'll be putting down in a hurry though, and if you're in the mood for a platformer like this, then you'll absolutely love it.
Date 2015-06-13 Playtime 15h 14m Rec Positive It's so much like Metroid that I was convinced the entirety of my play through that I was playing a genuine NES/SNES Metroid. I'd go as far as say it's even better than Metroid. It has a clever way of copying stuff from Metroid while keeping the dynamics new and fresh. For example, instead of morph balling through narrow cracks, you drive a remote drone and later on in the game you get an ability to teleport where your drone is. This allows you to navigate to places that the drone couldnt reach, inside areas where you could not get in without the drone in the first place.. If you fuckers know how Metroids play like at all, you know what I'm talking about. Just play it damnit and enjoy the eerie music.
Date 2015-06-13 Playtime 35h 55m Rec Positive An enjoyable metroidvania, what I really love about this game is the world it immerses you in. The aesthetic is a glorious effulgence of transhumanism, biopunk and simulationism. While I am hooked on the story, and I did feel compeled to suck every piece of information I could out of the text logs, it's been left rather open to interpretation by the time the credits roll. Questions remain unanswered. It's always very hard to know with these things, whether the answers the series will eventually provide in its sequels(And there better be sequels!) are going to be satisfying.
Date 2015-06-13 Playtime 34h 58m Rec Positive As a big fan of the Metroid series, I had a good amount of hype going into this game. I'm happy to say it lived up to it and more. The gameplay is a lot of fun and the difficulty curve was just right for me.
Date 2015-06-13 Playtime 11h 3m Rec Positive It seems a little expensive for a retro metroidvania platformer, but once you see just how good it looks, sounds and plays in person you'll understand how incredibly worth it this game is.  I'm still pretty early in the game but I can't recommend it enough so far.
Date 2015-06-12 Playtime 26h 6m Rec Positive ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I followed this game for a year or two. And it was totally worth the wait. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves sidescrolling classic 16bit games.
Date 2015-06-12 Playtime 18h 59m Rec Positive This game is good. Enemies have a little too much life in general and the final boss is kind of annoying but it has a pretty good variety of spaces and nails the Metroid feel. Getting weapons is neato though a lot are pretty useless. All in all very good Metroid style game with some weird style and cool things to look at.
Date 2015-06-11 Playtime 15h 55m Rec Positive I personally like this game, good job for Thomas Happ. The novelity of items and weapons (like red coat and drone teleport, etc.) shows that this game is more than a typical old school game (good example of what I mean here will be Megaman 9&10) and it is worth trying. However I'd say the map is way too complicated for a newbee who had no experience playing Metroid-like games. Although hardcore Metroid fans may disagree, more hints on where to go might be a good idea to avoid players, like myself, losing confidence while wandering around hopelessly.
Date 2015-06-11 Playtime 12h 29m Rec Positive Well, that was a good game.
Date 2015-06-10 Playtime 17h 15m Rec Positive one of the best game i've ever played
Date 2015-06-09 Playtime 11h 49m Rec Positive When you spend like five plus years on one game, this is the kind of shit you get. It still doesn't have the atmosphere or world-feel of Super Metroid or the sheer depth and sensation of endlessness from Symphony of the Night, but be damned if it ain't rad as hell.
Date 2015-06-09 Playtime 28h 9m Rec Positive i like this game. it's fun and was made very well. i only played about 3 hours and i had a dream about it lol xD if you like metroid prime type games GET THIS!!!
Date 2015-06-09 Playtime 14h 2m Rec Positive This game is freaking awesome.  At first you'll think it's not only a metroidvania-genre game, but a complete and wholesale rip-off of the Metroid games - it's clearly unabashedly derivative.  But it adds some very novel items and game mechanics of its own, and a compelling story. It was nothing but fun to play (well, okay, one or two of the bosses became more frustrating than fun, but nothing was impossible).  Great game!
Date 2015-06-09 Playtime 19h 17m Rec Positive Достойный последователь серии metroid нашего времени! Игра заставит изучить всю карту. Приятный саундтрек скрасит поиск единственно верного и порой не всегда однозначного маршрута. Местами будет хардкорно, но не при встречах с боссами. По мере прохождения игры откроется множество всевозможный приспособлений, оружия и апгрейдов. Любители ретро графики и платформеров должны остаться довольны игрой!
Date 2015-06-08 Playtime 9h 17m Rec Positive I came into Axiom Verge ready to love it and while I did enjoy it I can't categorically recommend it. If you are into old school platformers and challenging combat scenarios, then you'll probably get a lot out of this game. Personally I really enjoyed the exploration aspects, but I found the controls and the combat too clunky. Normally I would be able to look past this, but I found the game frustratingly difficult, especially some of the boss battles, on the Normal difficulty. Unless you are really looking for a challenge, I would recommend going for an easier setting and then hopefully you might get a more enjoyable experience out of the exploration.  On the plus side, the art is great and nails the retro style of the Super Metroid era. The music and sound design is also pretty good and meshes well with the visuals.  Overall I enjoyed the game, but after beating the end, I was happy to be done with it and had no real drive to 100% the game.
Date 2015-06-08 Playtime 12h 54m Rec Positive Un excellent jeux indépendant en pixel art qui a beaucoup a offrir. La durée de vie est très correct (8-10H pour le finir une première fois et facilement quelques heures en plus pour le 100%) Des graphismes et des sprites sublimes pour peu qu'on aime le côté résolument rétro. Le jeux peut être assez difficile car il est avare en information mais on ne reste jamais bloqué bien longtemps et certains boss peuvent être retord. De TRES nombreux secrets (Armes, bonus de vie, améliorations, etc....) Seul point "noir", le prix du jeux peut être un peu excessif.  Bref je ne peut que recommandé ce jeux a tout fan de Metroid-like. Le jeux non seulement de proposer des mécaniques assez similaire a son modèle a une identité bien propre. 
Date 2015-06-08 Playtime 295h 22m Rec Positive In short, this game is fantastic and well worth playing.  It's impressive enough that Axiom Verge was designed and created by a single person. What's even more impressive is just how professionally crafted it is. The level design is superb, the items are unique and well thought out, and the massive array of weapons are varied and useful in their own particular ways.  Even more importantly, the controls are spot-on (I played on a PS2 controller run through a USB converter). This is especially apparent when using the Tethered Charge weapon. With the full collection of items, there's some crazy acrobatics you can accomplish.   The story is told primarily through text boxes and SNES-esque cutscenes, and never felt overdone or particularly obnoxious. It's also pretty compelling, and I was curious to see how it'd play out. Furthermore, playing on Speedrun mode removes all the story elements completely, for a pure run-through.  My only real complaint was the lack of difficulty on most of the bosses. With the exception of the later few, bosses were complete pushovers (even on Hard difficulty). Considering how impressive and intimidating they are, it was odd how most enemies posed more of a threat.   That aside, Axiom Verge was an absolute blast to play, and having just finished my first play-through, I'm already starting on a second!
Date 2015-06-08 Playtime 32h 11m Rec Positive Потрясающая игра! Геймплей продуман буквально до мелочей. Совершенно необычный геймплейный элемент как возможность "глючить" врагов и некоторое пространство смотрится весьма свежо и необычно. Уйма секретов с оружием и поверапами, добрую половину которых можно просто не найти за первое прохождение. Отсюда реиграбельность. Для любителей хардкора и соревнований есть спидран режим на время. А какой тут шикарный OST! Треки давно уже в плейлисте. Однозначно GOTY 2015 среди 2D платформеров! Настоятельно рекомендую фанатам 2д олдскула и не рекомендую всем остальным. Просто не поймёте.   ps: Русалки завораживают. Настолько они ужасны и прекрасны одновременно!
Date 2015-06-08 Playtime 12h 36m Rec Positive Axiom Verge: Retro Metroid-like Gameplay, Amazing Soundtrack, and Dancing Plants. 10/10
Date 2015-06-08 Playtime 10h 21m Rec Positive One man has created the greatest 2d Metroid styled game since Super Metroid.  Step it up other developers. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Date 2015-06-08 Playtime 5h 57m Rec Positive This is the metroid game I have longed for quite a while now...  Amazing!  Thank you.
Date 2015-06-08 Playtime 17h 29m Rec Positive Whew. I had a lot of fun with this.  Axiom Verge is a challenging game, with tight controls, solid level and boss fight design, gorgeous art and music, and an intriguing--if scattered--story. If you like metroidvania games, get in here.
Date 2015-06-07 Playtime 14h 48m Rec Positive Metroid on psychedelic drugs, this game has not only good mechanics and gameplay, but captivating story also 8.5/10
Date 2015-06-07 Playtime 24h 48m Rec Positive After 40+ hours with the PS4 version and 18+ hours with the PC release, I can already say without a doubt that this is my pick for Game of the Year.  The tight controls, the pixel art, the gorgeous music, the immense world, and the crafted story all come together in one amazing package.  Don't be afraid to get lost in Axiom Verge, and don't be in a hurry to be found.
Date 2015-06-07 Playtime 18h 3m Rec Positive If you love Super Metroid you'll love this.
Date 2015-06-07 Playtime 11h 42m Rec Positive Okay, so I was in such a rush to just up and buy this game that I didn't quite do my homework on it. So I was playing it thinking it was developed by a talented team of indie devs who clearly know what they're doing.   Then I found out that it was developed by ONE MAN who clearly knows what he's doing.  I'm honestly speechless. Nice work, Tom.
Date 2015-06-07 Playtime 33h 32m Rec Positive Stays true to the Metroidvania formula, more so on the Super Metroid side, especially with the identical room transition styles. Axiom Verge has multiple themes, ranging from strange, mysterious, creepy, and deep. Music is also wonderful, and definitely wasn't an afterthought. The story keeps you engaged throughout, and keeps you guessing for what will happen next.  Axiom Verge is not getting the attention it deserves. You need to play this if you are a fan of the Metroidvania sub-genre.
Date 2015-06-06 Playtime 41h 3m Rec Positive A true sidescroller in the vain of Metroid and Castlevainia. It should be remembered that this is NOT an rpg or a multiplayer game - if youve played a metroid game for the GBA then you get the picture... Depending on your prefferences a complete campaig lasts 6 - 20 hours, including exploring and collecting the decent number of upgrades and powerups. The upgrades themselves are interesting and intuitive, most being fairly usefull while not being crazy - a remote drone, a grapplehook and so on.  Aside from this their are also a BUNCH of weapons, some of which you almost have to pick up, but a lot of which are hidden and require some attention to find. These are mostly varied and unique, tho there are several which are barely useful.   The the campaign is story driven, and although you are mostly left to play the game yourself when a cutscene appears it does not break the flow and proves to be both interesting from a story point of view and effective in terms of creating atmosphere (which this game has in buckets and more) and directing your attention in game to the next objective. On top of this, you can collect notes and notices to pad out the world and all its glory.  Long story short, a game well worth playing for anyone who enjoyed the early sidescroller/exploration games, or for those looking for an engaging scifi experience.
Date 2015-06-06 Playtime 6h 22m Rec Positive I was waiting for game like this one. ..must have..  <3
Date 2015-06-06 Playtime 34h 53m Rec Positive This game was a blast. If you loved Super Metroid, you will love this too, for sure! I must admit, that I was very sceptical about the art style at first, but as further the game progresses it does more and more match the rest of the game. That's because a central element of the game are the glitches which mimic very well the way glitches were back then, this works perfectly with that kind of art style. The music is very thrilling and I also liked that mystery in the story and just the overall atmosphere of the game.   The only downside is that in my opinion the player physics are too simple, it's a bit boring if the character does move in a linear fasion without any acceleration or decelleration, but that's just a personal taste. However the thing I really have to complain about ist that grappling hook. It doesn't follow any physical rules at all, it's just a hardcoded progression of 4 or 6 waypoints and it's frustratingly uncontrollable, especially if you have to use it multiple times in a row to get to a platform.
Date 2015-06-06 Playtime 16h 54m Rec Positive All the greatness of Metroid, Contra, Castlevania, and Bionic Commando rolled in to one with a good story and a great sound track.  I just can't get enough of this game.
Date 2015-06-06 Playtime 2h 34m Rec Positive If you like super metroid this is the perfect game for you. Retrogame perfect in every way.
Date 2015-06-05 Playtime 3h 26m Rec Positive Fan de Castelvania et même plus de Métroïde ? ce jeu est fait pour vous ! Axiom Verge est une jeu de type MetroïdeVania 2D comme on les aime ! -Le challenge est au rendez vous les boss sont a l'ancienne ils n'ont qu'un point faible a vous de le trouver ... ( OU PAS ) -Le LvlDesign est bien pencer a l'instar de ces maitre et il réclame de mémorisé les endroit inaccésible pour pouvoir y revenir quelque heures plus tard. -les combats ne laisse aucun pitié aux personne trop bourine ou encore aux pleutre il faut savoir quand attaquer et quand se cacher. -De très nombreuses armes, objets, tenues, et autre bonus sont collectable pour amélioré sont personnage a la manière encore une fois d'un Métroïde ! En Bref une perle !
Date 2015-06-05 Playtime 24h 22m Rec Positive 这是我花钱花得最值的一次。
Date 2015-06-05 Playtime 35h 58m Rec Positive Well, I was looking for a good platformer game, and I certainly found it. But turned out there is more.  The game matches me completely. Things I absolutely loved: [list] [*] Game is fun. Almost all the time. Even despite having several large levels, you never get tired of running back and forth. Graphics is colorful and stylish, range of available equipment is wide, and you can move really fast, performing various acrobatic tricks. Also, there is [spoiler]a certain horizontal lift[/spoiler], which makes inter-level journeys a matter of seconds. Very nice. And very important for every game of metroidvania genre. [*] It's not hard. I'm definelty not a hardcore platformer lover. Neither a casual, though... I just enjoy style, story, puzzles and exporation more than fighting, analysing boss movement patterns and so on. When I see "difficult" tag on a platformer game, it makes me a little sad. Axiom Verge is not one of this rouge-likeish super-hard platformers. [*] Visual style. There is not enough words to describe how much I love pixel-art. And also, I adore cyberpunk, bio-mechanical-styled things, and postapocalyptic athmosphere. Every one of that is present in Axiom Verge. On the top of it, game has very nice and modern visual effects, which turned up to be very nice addition. Stylish bio-mechanic pixel gun, radiating distortion effect on stylish pixel backgrounds. Beautiful. [*] Soundtrack. It's very good. Just listen to it. [*] Game tells interesting story. But, to be honest, the story is not a main source of fun in the game. [/list]  Also don't let the fact that this game has only one developer, who is also the artist, composer and designer, Axiom Verge is not a mere "indie" game. It is very much professionally made, despite being independent.  tl;dr: pure fun, great soundtrack, not very hard, superb visual style, casual (erm... not hardcore) platformer fans are crying from joy (at least, myself)
Date 2015-06-05 Playtime 18h 31m Rec Positive Ótimo jogo, recomendo!  Estilo side scrolling, tal qual os clássicos Metroid's, vem tanto em inglês quanto em português, história criativa e jogabilidade incrível.  Sem medo de fazer farofa de cu, um dos melhores jogos de 2015!
Date 2015-06-04 Playtime 18h 36m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is amazing!!! I feel like a little kid again playing Super Metroid!!! :D
Date 2015-06-04 Playtime 16h 2m Rec Positive A true gem. Returning me to memories of ancient Nintendo games, Metroid, and a the side scrollers that once were.  Don't underestimate that either. The hidden area, gun and body upgrades that made those games so great Axiom Verge has further refined. It will have you constantly guessing and seeking its hidden treasures, but search well as they are well hidden.  It's cumbersome to play on a keyboard and much more natural on a controller, but all said and done I beat it on its hard mode on a keyboard, so don't let that dissuade you from playing.  If you love the greats of the past, or even if not, this game is a treasure for times present and I hope it inspires more of it's like to come.
Date 2015-06-04 Playtime 53h 31m Rec Positive This is an amazing game!  It plays like a sequel to Super Metroid from a universe where 3D games never happened, except that it manages to set up an almost completely distinct set of power-ups that work in subtly different ways from the standard Metroid loadout.  The game has the same great sense of exploration and discovery as the best games in the Metroid series, but is a bit more modern and forgiving in some ways (for example, you keep your power-ups and explored map tiles if you die).  One interesting divergence is that it provides a ton of optional weapons.  These mostly don't unlock new progress through the game, but many prove very useful in certain situations.  Clever weapon selection can completely change the difficulty of some of the boss fights, for example.  There are almost *too* many; in my time with the game I've barely touched at least three or four.  This game is one of my best recent buys, and easily one of the best PC "Metroidvania"-type games out there.  Worth every penny!
Date 2015-06-04 Playtime 31h 13m Rec Positive Un magnifique Metroid vania aux accents délicieusement 80-90. C'est grand, c'est torturé, c'est sale, c'est organique. La bande son colle parfaitement à cette ambiance glauque et immersive, et l'histoire nous mène dans un labyrinthe métaphysique rafraichissant (ou imbuvable, c'est selon...) Un jeu de plateforme propre et finement et fréquemment mis à jour, tenu de main de maitre par un unique développeur-designer-compositeur. Bravo !
Date 2015-06-03 Playtime 18h 5m Rec Positive Not going to sugarcoat it, this game is pretty awesome. Nice, slick, Metroidvania. It'll definitel help to hold us over until Igarishii's Bloodstained hits. This game has tight controls, deceptively linear play, and all the constantly expanding possibilities of the subgenre. It can sometimes be difficult to know where to go next, but the game does give you an option to place reminders on the map. Whenever you pick up new powers, uou often know where to go next. There are quite a few weapons, some of more dubious efficiency than others. As far as i can tell, most of them do the same amount of damage. The story is interesting, but mostly optional. There are notes scattered around, and you can find and translate them if you wish, or just skip them and the conversations. It is ell worth the price for 12 hours or so of Metroid, probably more if you go back trying to get some of the completionist achievements.
Date 2015-06-03 Playtime 23h 19m Rec Positive Un excellent Metroid-like, aussi bon qu'un Fusion ou Zero Mission. J'ai été agréablement surpris par le design du soft. Dès le début on sent cette patte Metroid, cette ambiance rétro-futuriste. Et pourtant le jeu trouve toute son identitié dans ses inspirations : un panel d'arme complet, des items inovant et offrant de très bons moments de gameplay. Un must pour les fan de jeu Metroid-like ou de plate-forme. Puis alors la musique n'en parlons pas, c'est un orgasme auditif. À acheter absolument !
Date 2015-06-03 Playtime 37h 40m Rec Positive The freshest, most interesting Metroidvania-style game since Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.   -------------------- Pros: -Great Enemy design -Beautiful environments -Maintains a completely original, ominous tone -Huge array of interesting, balanced weapons. There are a few duds, but I found myself changing weapons often to cope with various situations -Tools for navigating the environment are very unique and interesting, with only a few items coving the same role. -Fantastic music. I will probably buy the OST. -Glitching enemies and exploiting their glitches is extremely satisfying. -Hard mode and speed-run mode give replayability to a genre that usually lacks it.  Mehs: -Level design is not on par with Metroid games, probably on par with Castevania games though. The game spends most of its time hiding items and less making areas difficult or interesting to transverse.  -Many secret items and areas feel gimmicky or seem to require prior knowledge to get to. Metroid games were good at giving appropriate visual clues to make a player stop and give an area a second look, whereupon Axiom Verge seems to take delight in hiding things in areas you would never think to look. This fine a couple of times, but it you rely on it too much, the player spends all their time drilling walls looking for secrets. I feel the game would have benefited greatly from some sort of "X-Ray Scope" equivalent from Super Metroid. -The story is different and interesting, and hints at something greater going on.... but then never delivers. It may be the intention of the developer to keep the story vague, but as a player I was invested in the world and wanted to find out more about it.  Cons: -Bosses are usually just meat shields with one gimmick that is predictable. I was hoping for more fights that forced me to rethink my strategy, glitch the boss or spawned mobs, or use weapons that I normally wouldn't. The bosses aren’t terrible, but next to how creative the rest of the game is, they are surprisingly old-school and do not take advantage of the tools that the player amasses throughout the game. --------------------  All and all this is a fantastic game, and is worth every penny at full price. The fact that Tom Happ developed this by himself is mind boggling, I would love to see what he can do with some help and a bigger budget. If you are a fan of metroidvania games, you are doing yourself and the genre as a whole a disservice by not picking this one up.
Date 2015-06-03 Playtime 32h 47m Rec Positive One of the best platformers to come out in years. There are certainly some issues, for example I found boss battles to be a bit underwhelming it is at very least a solid 8/10 for me.
Date 2015-06-02 Playtime 10h 1m Rec Positive Had Metroid been developed for the Turbografx-16, it likely would have looked an awful lot like Axiom Verge.  I honestly can't think of higher praise than that.  An astonishing and inspiring achievement for Mr. Happ.
Date 2015-06-01 Playtime 8h 17m Rec Positive Amazing game, I have never played Metroid, but this title makes me want to. It's awesome in every way, the gameplay, the story, the visuals, and music: all just great. And to top it off, it was made by one guy. It's crazy. 13 hours plus of core gameplay, then you have the option to speedrun or go for 100% completion. 10/10 game to me, worth every penny.
Date 2015-06-01 Playtime 23h 34m Rec Positive While I do have some very specific issues with this game, I can not sing it's praises enough. More then just a competent MetroidVania title, Axiom Verge is an amazing game that more often then not just shows how good retro-style games can be. If you were ever interested in the Metroid franchise in any way and wanted a new 2D game that lived up to that name, this is the first one we've had in years and you would be doing yourself a serious disservice to miss it. If you miss the old-days of gaming, I also can't recommend this game enough as it feels like and plays with that ascetic with a master's touch. Hell even if you like just being given something fun that you need to figure out for yourself, this game will do that too. Basically, this is one of those rare games I have a hard time finding any group I can't say should try it. Is it perfect? Absolutely not, but it is easily one of the best games I have played in a long time.  Full review at [url]http://redsectorshutdown.blogspot.com/2015/05/axiom-verge-pc-review.html[/url]
Date 2015-05-31 Playtime 24h 45m Rec Positive I don't review many things, and I really don't like to pay full price for games, I wait for sales most times. This game is worth every penny of any price steam has it for. If you liked Metroid/Bionic Commando/Castlevania/Megaman, play this game. It has an amazing environment, a solid engine and a throwback feel that is reminiscent of so many classic amazing games.
Date 2015-05-31 Playtime 23h 0m Rec Positive Super Metroid fans, this is the 2D Metroidvania you have been waiting for.  I will be playing this game for years, and so will you. Buy it now.
Date 2015-05-31 Playtime 22h 35m Rec Positive Wonderful.  Old-school feel with modern tech, set's you back to the time when games were about being fun and not the looks.
Date 2015-05-31 Playtime 28h 3m Rec Positive このゲームの魅力はなんと言っても、作者がメトロイドヴァニアではなく【メトロイド風】とはどんな作風のゲームであるかを理解している、という点でしょう。   メトロイドでサムスが使うような単発ビームから、火炎放射器、拡散レーザー、追尾弾、爆弾などメトロイドにも劣らぬ10種類以上のユニークな武器。 空間や敵をハッキングする装置や壁や床を崩したり近接武器としても使用できるレーザードリル、メトロイドでもおなじみのグラップルなど時には武器以上に役立つツール達。 有機的かつ無機的なAxiom Verge独特の世界観に合ったメトロイドチックなBGM、中でもボス戦の曲は印象的です。 英語力は必要だが（今のところ）主人公の物理学者Traceとこの謎の惑星で目を覚ました彼を彼を手助けする女性型AIのElsenovaのやりとりや、道中で入手できるメモなどを読んで惑星の謎を理解していくにつれて深く引き寄せられるストーリー。 そして所々に見られるメトロイドファンをニヤっとさせるようなギミックなど、これらの要素がこのゲームを単なるメトロイドクローンとして終わらせていません。  特にケチのつけようがないゲームですが、人によってはボス戦を単調気味に感じたり、エリア移動を長く感じたりするかもしれませんが、メトロイドで経験済みな方には苦でもないかもしれません。
Date 2015-05-31 Playtime 13h 37m Rec Positive This game is well above average and being that one guy made it? Yea. Buy this and support indie gaming. I find it's better played for an hour or so at a time than binge playing as there is just SO much to do. The combat is standard fare, the weapon selection is large and varied but you won't use too many of them except in specific circumstances. The narrative is good with good intrigue. The art style and dystopian design is wonderful. There are some surprisingly dark parts that really set a tone that I've never really felt with a "16 bit" game. I almost find the exploration aspect, the "hm how do I get up there" or "I wonder if I can break that block in the corner" parts more fun than anything else. Explore every corner of every screen and you might find many hidden secrets! I highly recommend this to anyone who's a fan of classic games or to anyone who is looking to switch things up from a world of Witcher 3's and CS GOs.
Date 2015-05-31 Playtime 23h 58m Rec Positive Amazing game! Mind Blowing Story. Buy this game now!
Date 2015-05-30 Playtime 19h 41m Rec Positive If you have an itch to play an old-school 2D Metroid than Axiom Verge is the game for you.  The game follows the classic Metroid formula with some modern game improvements.  For example, the various weapons are tactical in nature.  As opposed to Metroid where the guns just get predictably more powerful, the various guns in Axiom Verge display radically different characteristics.  Picking the right gun for the right situation is the key to succeeding in combat.  Fortunately, switching between the surprisingly large arsenal is quick and easy with a controller (native PS4 controller support!).  Another surprising aspect is the story.  Though at first glance it appears to be a minimalist tale like so many other Metroidvania games, notes scattered around the world reveal a deeper and more convoluted plot than what is initially presented.  Combined with a cryptic ending, there is definitely a path paved for a sequel.  The only downside for me was that the game was rather easy.  I played it on Hard for my first run through and the game only started to get challenging towards the last third or so.  The main reason for this is that the enemy behavior is not very complex or varied.  Most enemies fit into one of two categories: moving in a set pattern, and dashing straight towards you.  The first type are always easy to kill, while the second require more thought but are usually easily defeated with proper tactics and the right weapon.  Boss behavior is similarly limited with most bosses only exhibiting one or two patterns.  Ultimately, I feel that $20 was a bit much for what I got.  While I enjoyed the game, the lack of enemy variety and challenge doesn't inspire me to do multiple play-throughs.  I would say it would be a must-buy at $10, but for $20 you need to be a fan of Metroidvania to really appreciate it.  In conclusion, great controls (played with a PS4 controller), great music, cool pixel art, and all designed by one man.  I'm definitely interested to see what he will do next.
Date 2015-05-30 Playtime 19h 28m Rec Positive If you're a Metroid fan, there is no reason you shouldn't enjoy this game.
Date 2015-05-30 Playtime 12h 19m Rec Positive A great 'Metroidvania' title, although the -vania isn't really accurate. Clearly inspired by Metroid (particularly Metroid 1 and Super Metroid) with a creepy very alien feeling world to explore. Lots of new weapons and abilities to find, a lot of hidden pickups, and a lot of weird looking enemies.  Manages to perfectly hit that feeling of 'Oh man, now I can go do THAT thing that I couldn't before!' whenever you find a new item.  Decent running time, I clocked in 12 hours to finish it on my first playthrough (without 100% completion). Will keep you occupied, but also is clearly designed to make speedrunning/sequence breaking possible.   The ability you get fairly early on that allows you to digitally 'corrupt' enemies and parts of the environments to have different effects is really great and something I havn't seen before.  If I were to give criticism it would be that the boss fights, while visually impressive, are mostly pushovers. Also, there are a LOT of weapons, but several of them are not really worth using outside of very specific situations, and others aren't worth using at all.    Oh also, the soundtrack is fantastic.  Would thoroughly recommend it.
Date 2015-05-30 Playtime 57h 11m Rec Positive plays like metroid but that is a good thing though. makes me want to get into that series as well. I like the feeling of discovery and finding new items to get me though. very well done game and great soundtrack and game play you will like it too.
Date 2015-05-30 Playtime 17h 6m Rec Positive The game is very challenging, on normal expect to die roughly 50 times+ before you beat it. Aside from the annoying low life sound the game is a very acceptable metroidvania.
Date 2015-05-30 Playtime 45h 5m Rec Positive I....I can't....even.....  Ok i have not had this much fun and addiction to a game of this style since the legendary Super Metroid.  controls=very tight. weapons= varied and most are optional visuals= fantastic subtle mix of new tech in an older style. each defeated boss has a MASSIVE shower of particles gameplay= ideal! the perfect amount of getting gear, boss fights and back tracking, in order to explore new areas  if you loved Super metroid (or the more recent but rather easy shadow complex on 360) this game is for you.
Date 2015-05-30 Playtime 15h 29m Rec Positive GREAT GAME. Just like the good 'ol metroid games but with new abilities. Fantastic music, sound, and art design and even the story is great. I highly recommend it.
Date 2015-05-29 Playtime 6h 55m Rec Positive To start: I used to add a much longer header to these reviews, but since it often made the reviews too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery page.  Gameplay: o boi guiz its another indie metroidvania gaem. Yes, as we all know, Metroidvanias are a dime a dozen in the realm of indie games, and it's easy to see why: It's a genre that is very easy to make, but takes a lot of talent and effort to do really well. For every Cave Story and La-Mulana there's a deluge of mediocre to straight up awful Metroidvanias a few meters behind them. Axiom Verge is a Metroidvania style game in which there's a lot of Metroid and not a lot of Vania, which I do quite like, as the Metroid side of things allows the designer to go really crazy with the atmosphere and world building as opposed to "get the thing to increase your numbers."  As mentioned above, Axiom Verge feels a lot like Metroid, even down to the very first area of the game feeling a lot like Brinstar, complete with long vertical shaft with a bunch of enemies that run along the walls. It does start to branch off from there, as rather than breaking walls with things like power bombs or missiles, you are instead equipped with a drill. This drill can be used for combat purposes, but it's not too recommended as it does bugger all for damage. Another way in which this game branches away from Metroid is that you get a LOT of weapons throughout your playthrough. I ended up with ten different weapons by the end of the game, and while they're all pretty fun to play with, odds are you'll fall into one weapon and just use that for the rest of the game. This was a little disappointing, as I would've liked to see more environmental puzzles that made use of the characteristics of the weapons.  Powerups in this game are pretty neat, and there are a fair few of them that are pretty cool, but there are a few that feel like completely arbitrary gating mechanisms, with the most egregious example being one of the later areas in which you have to mine through more blocks with your drill than the average Minecraft player, only to receive a key "powerup" that moves literally two blocks in the world and that's it. In fact, there were more than a few powerups that felt like completely arbitrary gates, something that I think could've been fixed with more of a focus on environmental puzzles that make use of the weapons you have.  One of the most important things that you need to do right if you're going for a Metroid feel in your game is to get the world itself correct. The world itself is big, very big, but it does have a tendency to feel somewhat sparse after a while. Another problem with such a big world is that if you ever need to backtrack, it gets annoying very quickly. There is no teleportation powerup (unless I just didn't find it; if there is, let me know and I'll change this review accordingly), which really doesn't make sense given that you teleport to the last save point when you die. Speaking of such, one thing that I was definitely happy that this game did is that you never game over, so even if you die, you don't lose progress.  Enemies are your typical Metroid fare, wall-crawlers, spiders, things that shoot at you, and they do more damage as you go along because reasons. Bosses are really disappointing, especially given how cool they look. In fact, there is one boss where you can spend most of the time crouching and be perfectly fine. I did play through this game first time on Normal, so maybe the AI was tweaked for the bosses on Hard mode to make them actually threatening; I dunno. There was only really one boss that I would call challenging, and that's just because it does a lot of damage. The final boss was just a mashfest, honestly; dash around everywhere and shoot the thing from time to time.  Overall, I had a pretty good time with Axiom Verge. The world was pretty good, despite all the backtracking; there were pretty well hidden secrets that were fun to find, and even though bosses could've been a lot more fun to fight than they actually were, this could be something that was fixed on Hard mode. If you've played something like Environmental Station Alpha, I'd definitely play this on Hard first time through. It manages to be pretty good, but not fantastic. 7/10.  Story: The story, or at least what all I got of it from this playthrough as you need powerups to translate some of the alien text, is actually pretty cool. It's written quite well, even though it gets a little bit up its own arse from time to time (a line from a page that goes, "As everyone knows from the Euclid Equation..." Yeah, as *everyone* knows...). The only "real" character in the game - and that's somewhat questionable from time to time - is the character you play as, called Trace. Trace is/was a scientist at a facility that blew up, science happened, and now you're in an alien world. Without going into too much detail, the game does a very good job at making you wonder whether your "benefactors" are really that, as well as making you wonder whether what you're doing really is for the best. Despite this, there doesn't seem to be any alternate endings, for better and for worse. While there isn't much in the way of character development in the game, the focus of the writing is not on the characters; it's on the world, and building of worlds this game does pretty well. 8/10.  Graphics: When I saw the art style of this game, I instantly knew why the person who recommended it to me did so: the art style in this game is pretty dang excellent. One shocker is that it was all done by one person. An even bigger shocker is that this entire game was made by one person, although I don't think witchcraft makes you one person still. All joking aside, this game does look really, really good. As mentioned above, the bosses look really, really cool, which makes it all the more disappointing how boring and easy almost all of them are. Funnily enough, the boss that looked the least interesting ended up being the hardest of the bunch (the bee thing for those who were wondering). Still though, the art style of this game is very, very good and it's all the more better considering that just one person worked on it. As for the technical side of things, the game fullscreened to 1080p and ran at a solid 60FPS throughout; just what you'd expect. It can be run windowed, but I never messed with that option as I like having things searing off my retinas at glorious full screen. I don't really need to say much more on this one than, "look at the screenshots." 5/5.  Sound: Another thing that became very surprising once I learned that this was a solo project is the music: the entire game, as well as the music, was still made by one person. This is surprising because the music is quite good. It's kinda chiptune-y in some areas and kinda not in others, which normally shows a bit of a confused direction with the audio, but since the whole game is "kinda 8-bit, kinda not," it never becomes too distracting. Plus, I don't know if these tracks would offer as much atmosphere as they do in a strictly 8-bit format. Speaking of sound direction, every enemy in the game makes the same exact noise when you hit them, which is a bit weird but again, one of those things that you notice if you're really nitpicking. I don't know if the OST is good enough to make me wanna buy it for myself, but it at the very least works really well in-game. 4/5.  Overall scores are: 7/8/5/4; cumulative score of 8.0/10. Quite a good showing, especially from one person, but it does some issues with level design and bosses that keeps the game from being as good as it could be. Still though, if you're looking for a Metroid-style game that you can blaze through in a couple of nights, this is a very good one to pick up. I got 60% item completion and 90% map completion in the ~7 hours that I played it, so I could see 100% being possible in under 15 hours.
Date 2015-05-29 Playtime 1h 22m Rec Positive You don't play as Samus in this Metroid, but it's pretty good.
Date 2015-05-29 Playtime 39h 24m Rec Positive Great game, nice retro feeling with a 2015 technology finish. Neat main game & fast run, great controls, clever "in game puzzles/investigation" for "meta-cheat-code-of-access" [you'll get it when you find them] & even "glitch-looking sections "outside" of the game, yet part of the game".  Now I can't help but think about that game when I hear "Copy of a" [NIN]  Last but not least : they need to make a double jump in Axiom verge 2... that must have been the only real downside!
Date 2015-05-29 Playtime 13h 10m Rec Positive The best 2D Metroid game you'll ever play on PC.  It DOES have fantastic original designs, weapons, visuals, and story.  But, it's for sure the great successor to the 2D Metroid era.    
Date 2015-05-28 Playtime 11h 46m Rec Positive If you are a Metroid fan like me and have been anxiously waiting on the next installment, look no further than Axiom Verge. Indie games come and go and many have had their fair stab at reviving the exploration based platforming of Metroid, but none have hit closer to the mark than Axiom Verge. Everything from the gameplay down to the atmosphere feel as close to Metroid as one can get without being a rip-off. If you enjoy isolation and exploration with an amazing soundtrack, this game is for you. It easily beats Cave Story as my favorite indie game, and it was created by a single person.
Date 2015-05-28 Playtime 9h 2m Rec Positive whaaaaaaaaaat?
Date 2015-05-28 Playtime 35h 46m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is styled after the original Metroid, both in art direction and gameplay style. You are almost completely unguided, which does have some problems in that the world is large and figuring out where to go can be frustrating. However, it also lets you be creative - you can often get places you aren't really meant to be at yet through the creative use of abilities.   The game's plot is not overly extensive or twisty, and ends in something of a cliffhanger, but there are notes and other things laying around for you to pick up which add a bit of depth to the world. At one point you get an item which allows you to quite literally hack reality, which really raises a lot of questions as to just what exactly is going on.  The controls take some getting used to but are responsive and work quite well for the type of game it is. There is a huge variety of weapons, and even if a few of them shine brighter than others all of them are useful in one situation or another, Getting hit is punishing, there aren't too many areas where it's truly difficult to do things, and most bosses are fairly easy once you have their patterns down.   Art wise, the game has a very "organic" feel to it, and the music goes along well with it. Even the low health beep, which is infuriating in most games, is timed to go along with the music and fades in and out, so you notice it, but isn't irritating.  I only have two real issues with this game. Backtracking can be quiet slow, even once you've unlocked the intermediate area that connects all others, and you will be doing quite a lot of backtracking. Beyond that, there are several hidden zones which are unique to each save file, but the only notification these are nearby is a slight visual change that's easy to miss. However, these hidden areas don't count towards your 100% completion or any achievements, but they are a fun throwback to the glitch zones of the original Metroid, and they can contain unique (and powerful) weapons.  The characters, such as they are, are typically interesting and the mish mash of English some of them do works very well to fit in with the game's alien feel. If you're looking for a retro exploration game, this is definitely right up your alley.
Date 2015-05-28 Playtime 10h 33m Rec Positive Awesome Metroidvania style game
Date 2015-05-28 Playtime 12h 18m Rec Positive it is a metroidvannia experience that continued to surprise me until the very end. I had some aggravation in getting stuck, but that always happens to me with these games. It is amazing that this was built by a single character, but you can see a lot of love was put into it.
Date 2015-05-28 Playtime 15h 20m Rec Positive A good fix for your "MetroidVania"-needs. :)
Date 2015-05-28 Playtime 19h 39m Rec Positive Great game - really captures the feeling and gameplay from Super Metroid!
Date 2015-05-28 Playtime 7h 13m Rec Positive Reaches for Metroid and doesn't quite make it. Missing the mystery and isolation of the NES Metroid, and it doesn't quite have the feel, weight, and atmosphere of Super Metroid.  Good art and music, but the story is trite and melodramatic.  The final areas and the last couple bosses have increasingly bad design. Still a mostly enjoyable experience even if it doesn't have the polish of the greats in the genre.
Date 2015-05-28 Playtime 37h 58m Rec Positive A challenging metroidvania with classic graphic styles, an interesting story, fantastic music, and art design reminiscent of H.R. Geiger.  Tons of hidden items, and randomized secret areas will guarantee replayability. It remains one of my most beloved games since it's release.  An impressive piece of work all around. Especially considering it was all made by one person.
Date 2015-05-27 Playtime 43h 44m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a fun METROIDvania game that successfully emulates some of the best all time classics.  Pros: -Great Retro Art-style -Wonderful Retro Soundtrack -Precise and well-build platforming  -A wealth of weapons and abilities -Good balance of challenge and fun   Cons: -diagonal aiming mechanism not great compared to others  -health item drops not consistent or reliable  -some areas have excessively long distances between save points  At the end of the day, Axiom Verge is seemingly an interpretation of Super Metroid (not a bad thing) but is still unique and well done. It plays well on nostalgia but completely stands on its own. Click the Buy button.

Date 2015-05-27 Playtime 18h 1m Rec Positive Лучшая метроидвания за последние много лет. Настоящий метроид, в котором абсолютно точно передан дух старого метроида и щедро добавлены современные элементы.

Date 2015-05-27 Playtime 36h 23m Rec Positive Very few games will keep me up to 3 am on a weeknight at my age, but this game is one of them. It captures the creepiness of being in an alien world that the original Metroid conveyed quite well, but provides modern helps like a minimap that make beating the game a little more surmountable. The difficulty level is probably a good bit less than the original Metroid, but it is still engaging. Player skill is still a big factor and the demands on your skills only continues to ramp up as you get some of the late-game items. It also rewards exploration and clever solutions with its "glitch" mechanic to some rather unclear puzzles to get some of the more rare items.   My only complaint is that it was a little too short. Even though a veteran of these types of games, I was taking my time on this game, and it still was only about 12 hours.  As a huge fan of the Metroidvania genre (having beaten Castlevania: SotN and Super Metroid multiple times), I highly recommend this game to similar fans! Completely worth the current (already low) price tag.
Date 2015-05-27 Playtime 17h 11m Rec Positive This was super good! You gotta love the ridiculously-named "metroidvania" genre, because this one is a firm instance, but it's really well executed and has tons of details just right. Graphics and animations are great; controls are laser sharp and well thought out; the collection of upgrades and some of the central twists are very creative. Highly recommended if you like platformers.  If I were to make any criticisms: The music got on my nerves after a while; some of the tunes are too repetitive. (This is pretty forgivable since one guy made the whole thing!) Since I'm always hunting for secrets, I spend a lot of time running around with the drill out (and then, other items..) which is loud and unergonomic. But how can you resist scouring every screen for secrets? 
Date 2015-05-27 Playtime 7h 4m Rec Positive If you loved Super Metroid, get this get this get this get this get this get this get this get this get this get this get this!!!
Date 2015-05-26 Playtime 14h 49m Rec Positive Almost 10 hours into this game, and it's a full-blown-flashback to the first time I played Metroid on the NES. Favourite game since Super Metroid ;) Clever, time consuming, addictive, retro, the-best-sidescroller-retro-game!
Date 2015-05-26 Playtime 20h 3m Rec Positive This game is one of the best & most original Metroidvania games I've ever played & it deserves much more recognition than it's currently getting.  [b]PROS[/b] -Large Open World to Explore -Lots of Hidden Guns, Items & Areas -It's a top tier Metroid-Like game basically made by One person -Great Soundtrack -Great Artistic Style  [b]CONS[/b] -Final Bossfight is kind of lame -Story is hard to understand  [b]STORY[/b]  You play as Trace, a scientist who experienced some sort of tragic accident & awakens to find himself in some strange new world with a voice in his head.  The voice tells you to go get a gun in the next room & then tells you she's unable to communicate anymore due to her injuries which she needs to you help her with.  As you go on you find out you're infected with some sort of pathogen that wiped out all intelligent life on the planet you're on.  It's slowly eating away at your nervous system & will eventually kill you.  So, you need to not only save these mysterious machine beings but yourself as well.  The story does get deeper than just that but saying any more would be spoiling so I'll just end it there.  [b]FEATURES[/b]  The game starts out with you getting a gun & later getting various upgrades to help you on your journey.  These are mostly upgrades for your gun but they also give you some sweet looking attire like the Lab/Trench coats.  There's also health, damage & even projectile range & size upgrades hidden throughout the game. You eventually get more weapons that all have various uses like a big beam that takes up most of the screen, but deals very little damage to a laser that pierces through enemies.  There are so many weapon types in this game that it would take a small list to fill so I'll leave the rest to official guides or let you find them whilst you play.  The game has the main story mode with two difficulties.  Normal & Hard.  I suggest anyone new to this game play on Normal as I tried Hard (which I usually do play hard difficulties) but I found it much too difficult.  The game is fairly difficult even on Normal so I recommend playing it on that setting for your first run.  There are several boss fights in this game & each boss has its own weak point which you'll need to find & hit using one of the weapons in your arsenal.  Some weapons are better suited for each boss but it's your choice of which to use.  There's also a speed-run mode which I haven't tried yet so I won't comment on it.    This game doesn't hold your hand as you play it either.  The voice in your head gives you a task but it doesn't tell you where to go so you're free to explore at your leisure.  That's a good thing, too because there is a ton of exploration in this game.    [b]GRAPHICS[/b]  The game looks very good & it's pixel art is fantastic.  There are some areas where you may need time to adjust because the foreground uses the same colors as the background so it can be hard at first to tell what's on screen.  Eventually you're eyes get used to it, mine did anyways.  Overall the graphics look very unique & the game does things I've never seen before in any classic pixel style art game.  You really need to see it to appreciate it.  [b]AUDIO[/b]  The music in this game is god-like.  Try to imagine some really techno-metal sound effects, atmospheric music & trippy sunni style vocals mixed all together in one.  That's pretty much the only way I can describe it but the end result is fantastic.  I can't really compare this game's music to anything else I've heard before.  You really have to hear it for yourself.  [b]GAMEPLAY[/b]  The game utilizes every button on today's standard controllers.  You may not be able to use a retro controller for this one.  Everything feels solid from jumping & shooting to dashing & grappling.  You may need to get used to the dash & grapple at first but after you figure it out you'll be grappling off the ceiling & dashing through enemies like a pro.  [b]OVERALL[/b]  This game is one of the better games I've played in recent memory.  It's on par with games like Shovel Knight, Freedom Planet & even Super Metroid for quality & originality.  It may even surpass those games as a whole due to how unique it really is.  If you like 2D Adventure games that have a lot of exploration definitely pick this one up.  It's worth every penny spent.

Date 2015-05-26 Playtime 51h 1m Rec Positive what is there to say about Axiom Verge really? everything absolutely every little detail in this game is pure eyegasm, i can't say enough how THANKFUL i am that this type of game was brought to daylight in such a era as 2015 HONESTLY! how many other games can top this one? yeah sure GTA fans will say this an that but its not my point i grew up with Nintendo and Snes: Metroid, Zelda, Cstlevania so i got a PC and with it came all the "high graphics sh*ts* .. but getting to travel back to the GLORY DAYS of gaming as Axiom did was the best thing so far this year YOU ROCK TOM HAPP! for having the guts and courage to make a 1980/1990s game in 2015! much love and respect 99/99 will play again an again an again PS: the soundtrack is GODLY
Date 2015-05-26 Playtime 22h 15m Rec Positive A lot of people seem to have a problem with this game not being Super Metroid, leading to some negative reviews, but it is a genuinely impressive game in its gameplay and atmosphere.  Pros: -Tight controls -Unique weapons and tools -Mostly hidden/optional weapons -Great artwork -Really really tight controls -Killer soundtrack -Fun dialogue -Seriously the gameplay is fucking amazing it controls so well -Built-in speedrunning timer -Fun/exploitable save points can be used for easier backtracking -Glitch mechanics are unique and cool -Enemy variety and visuals contribute to atmosphere of surrealism -Justin Bailey :^)  Cons: -Boss fights feel claustrophobic -Areas don't make geographical sense with each other -Unsatisfying story -Some mechanics don't flow throughout the game  To speak to my criticisms, the reason I have such problems with these few things is because of how polished the rest of the game feels. The first boss fight teaches you that the faces of the enemies are the vulnerable spots, but this doesn't hold true for the rest of the bosses. Following fights have similar face areas on the bosses, but 2 of the 4 similarly designed bosses do not follow this same fight strategy. This would be perfectly acceptable if it weren't for the fact that it is established so early in the game that the particular spot is the weak point. In addition to this, multiple boss fights felt as though there was no space for dodging projectiles and attacks, and some of the attacks were too fast with too large of hitboxes. This left me feeling cheated at certain points of the game, having to fight a boss over and over, hoping I would make one mistake less than the last time (I'm sure I just suck at the game). The most memorable and well designed boss fight was the 3rd one, where the player could shoot different parts of the boss to disable those weapons. There was also an arena that punished reckless gameplay while rewarding thoughtful execution by providing cover to certain weapons at varying times. This fight also followed the first boss' damage design which made the other two fights with similar face designs feel more confusing. The arena was spacious and provided plenty of room to dodge the projectiles.  In regards to the overall world design, I liked the visuals and the different areas, but I found that they didn't make structural sense in the context of a world (and I hate to compare to Metroid) like Zebes from Super Metroid. Where in Super Metroid the levels changed gradually and made sense in their placement relative to each other (lava is deeper in the planet while the crashed space ship is at the surface, burrowed partly into the crust), Axiom Verge had a world which seemed to feel more like a variety show à la Metroid Fusion. In Fusion this made sense because Nintendo created a scientific environment testing vessel, but Axiom Verge is supposedly a continuous world. The story of Axiom Verge is told through notes and written dialogue/cutscenes, and while I have no problem with this method of storytelling I found the story itself to be far less ambitious or consequential as I thought it would be. This is where I bring my first direct criticism of Tom Happ himself; he has stretched himself too thin in creating Axiom Verge as a one-man development team. Happ has a strong grasp of the metroidvania genre and he clearly understands implicit level design where the player can find the next area and item through exploration. Where he struggles is storytelling and designing a compelling narrative for players. This is fine of course because Happ is great at making a tight game that controls like none other, but with such an ambitious story for Axiom Verge, I would have preferred someone else's touch on the narrative and how the gameplay and world reflected this story.   All of these gripes are minor because I simply loved the overworld, the combat, and the sense of progression based on items and powerups. I look forward to seeing what Happ develops in the future, and I hope he can collaborate with others to create a masterpiece following this promising first major release.   TL;DR THE GAME IS GOOD, NOT PERFECT. BUY IT AND PLAY THE SHIT OUT OF IT.
Date 2015-05-26 Playtime 19h 25m Rec Positive Great Metroid clone. Exceptional music.  If you enjoyed any of the Metroids or Symphony of the Night this game is a must buy.
Date 2015-05-26 Playtime 44h 46m Rec Positive Remember the demonic imagery and disturbing backgrounds of Ninja Gaiden as you got closer and closer to fighting the demon? How about the sci-fi creepiness of Metroid? Or the creepy alien lair of Contra?  Axiom Verge takes these elements and cranks them up. The setting is creepy, the music unsettling, and the story increasingly disturbing. There's even some impressively melancholy chiptune music at one point.  The game first starts out as an utterly shameless ripoff of Metroid. I'm talking totally shameless - everything from the enemy types to the types of environments encountered early in the game, to the Super Metroid-esque map - it all screams Metroid, and it's painfully blatant, to the point where I rolled my eyes and thought "Does this game have *any* originality?".  Well, it does.  Not only does the game not continue in this direction, it even deliberately subverts expectations.  See that thin space that you just can't fit through? In Metroid, you'd get through it by turning into a ball. Axiom Verge never gives you an equivalent ability, but rather, a drone that can fit through spaces that you cannot. High up areas that you can't reach? Grappling hook - there is no Space Jump. Thin walls blocking your path? No, you don't speed through them and break them - you teleport through them with a special jacket. You don't freeze enemies to stand on them - you "glitch" some of them to stand on them, or you "glitch" the world on occasion.  What's this about "glitches"? Well, Axiom Verge has a little fun with the fourth wall. Remember how NES games looked when they weren't working right? When graphics glitches caused things to get garbled and strange looking? When in some cases, a graphics glitch would even transform an enemy or object in such a way that its behavior became totally different? (as just one example, Chip and Dale on the NES had a weird glitch in the sewers level at the point where you went up, where if you managed to get the water at the bottom of the screen to turn white, you can suddenly stand on it as if it were ground)  Well, this game does that for deliberate and sometimes unsettling effect. There are "fake graphics glitches" you encounter quite often, which perfectly simulate what actual NES games looked like when they malfunctioned. The glitches and how they are used almost make it seem as if the world is tearing itself apart - an impressive way to take an error from our childhoods and use it as both plot and gameplay device, not to mention to add atmosphere. There are even some creepy "outer world" areas that look like unholy glitched up messes with some filters that approach the fourth wall, such as filters to make the game suddenly look like it's being played on an old TV that's dealing with interference.  Your "glitch gun" weapon (it's called the Address Disruptor) can invoke this deliberately to a degree, as it transforms enemies into glitchy abominations and even changes their behavior. An enemy may slow down, change its attacks from ones that harm you to ones that break through walls, or even try to escape you. Some of these behavior changes are the sort of thing you'd expect to see from a messed-up Game Genie code used on the NES. Or, appropriately, what NES games do when the memory addresses of objects get disrupted. This game's sole designer, Tom Happ, really knows the NES.   The graphics, while retro-inspired, actually use certain design elements of the olden days to intentional effect. Areas tend to have their own color scheme. While NES games tended to do this out of necessity (without going into super technical detail, the NES had strict color limits due to how it handled its 8 palettes at any given time), this game does it deliberately. It starts out looking a lot more NES-esque, but gradually, more color is used. It works, and the areas, while generally not having more personality beyond "creepy and alien", "super creepy and alien", "disturbing and alien", and "kinda creepy but cool, and alien", still look distinctly different. They range from tunnels with pulsating organs hanging on threads to a very strange forest that looks like something that could not only never exist on Earth, but on any planet in this universe.  The music and sound design is... interesting. Sounds are often loud and piercing, similar to old games. I assume this was intentional. The music is entirely different, and is quite the genre mix. One song I found particularly memorable started out as a melancholy NES chiptune with echo effects, and started getting louder and with more electronic non-NES instruments added. Another song features alien lyrics and chanting.  The world is huge. You will get lost. You gain new abilities and new weapons constantly, giving a rather impressive feeling of progression that few games match. As you get new abilities that aid in travel, you'll naturally have to use them, and that's when it's time to look at the map and see which areas haven't been filled out. The hallway that seems to cut off on the map - is that because you got stopped by something and were unable to reach the end? Might want to check it out.  The problem is that backtracking takes longer the further you get in the game, and there just aren't enough connecting areas or fast means of travel to really speed it up that much. I didn't find it a dealbreaker, and some enjoy that aspect of the game, but just be aware that it's there.  My other complaint is that the end of the game ramps up the difficulty to such a degree that I had to use cheap tactics to fight the last few bosses and deal with annoying, tough new enemy types. I felt like I was fighting cheapness with my own cheapness. Not the best way to end the game.  Despite these complaints, Axiom Verge is an amazing game, especially for being made entirely by one person in his spare time over 5 years. It's more than just a nostalgic throwback to the creepier side of the NES with its Contra, Ninja Gaiden and Metroid inspirations along with its oddly unsettling use of "glitches". It's also an amazingly creative experience that plays with the expectations of the 30-somethings and late 20-somethings that it's aimed at. Even if you hold no such nostalgia for that era and that style of game, it's still a great game.
Date 2015-05-26 Playtime 24h 8m Rec Positive Anyone looking to play an old Metroid style game, this is it.  The style and atmosphere are really well done.  There's a lot that's been inspired by the old Metroid games and others like it.  It doesn't hide this fact but it also expands upon those elements further giving an old genre something new.  A must for those looking to dive back for some nostalgic play with a new story, map, enemies and especially abilities.
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 28h 28m Rec Positive One of the best metroid style games I have played in a long time
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 1h 5m Rec Positive "Axiom Verge is a stellar game filled with collectables, combat, exploring, and mystery, which has the power to entice the retro gamer out of anyone who picks up the controls.  Meandering storyline and mediocre boss battles aside, Axiom is an expertly polished title which evokes the spirit of Metroid perfectly, and in some places, verbatim.  Pick it up if you have a crush on Nintendo era classics, or if you’re just looking for an indie game that doesn’t suck.  Because let’s face it.  There’s a lot to choose from out there."  Check out the video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W302ismR_Hk
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 10h 59m Rec Positive Awesome Game, Just like a retro metroid game, kinda short but the puzzles get increasingly difficult... and the weapons are  just fantastic to play with, I am only sad that there isnt more... hopefully this will have a sequel :D
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 34h 22m Rec Positive this game is amazing - it looks and feels like the NES Metroid .  controls and music are both great.  Trace is a likable character - when he realizes someone needs help he tries to help them, and when confronted with a monster that talks, "Oh, you can talk!  Hello!"  i am thoroughly enjoying myself - ten stolen cheese wheels out of ten, and two stolen brooms
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 9h 52m Rec Positive A Metroidvania in the purest sense, Axiom Verge combines Metroid and Contra.  In particular, the original Metroid and Super Contra, in both gameplay and aesthetics.  The controls are snappy and responsive, and you can lock your feet like in Super Contra.  The game applies modern graphics to old NES Metroid aesthetics.  Environments and music are spooky, and enemies are disturbing.  There are many items, and you will not find them all on your first run.  The map lets you lay down markers to investigate secrets earlier.  Also, like Metroid and Contra, the game is tough as hell.  I highly recommend this.
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 20h 33m Rec Positive Career is futile. Trash-tier Waifu is futile. Gaming rig is meaningless. Dogs haven't been fed in weeks. Personal hygiene has been ignored. Hopes and dreams have been forgotten. Life has been given over to the Verge. I will gladly spread my cheeks for the Verge. I will gladly receive copious amounts of Axiom love all over my face.   10/10 Axiom Verge is love, Axiom Verge is life  P.S. I am Captain Basch Von Ronsenburg of Dalmasca. Don't listen to Ondore's lies.
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 20h 32m Rec Positive I know retro-indie platformers are a bit played out by now, but Axiom Verge, in my humble opinion, does right by the concept. It features a detailed labyrinthine world that pays homage to its Metroid-vania influences while maintaining an identity of its own, and the visual and audio design go well beyond the capabilities of 8 and 16-bit consoles of yesteryear to make for a truly unique experience. Some of the backtracking and item collection can get exhausting, but players who love meticulous exploration and challenging (and often cryptic) puzzle solving will have a blast. If you've been looking for a 2D Metroid-like platformer or just a good sci-fi story, Axiom Verge will certainly scratch either itch.
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 22h 17m Rec Positive I found it a good challange witha intresting story. Brought back memories of playing older games such as metroid again.
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 18h 22m Rec Positive Fantastic game with great gameplay, story, visual style and music.
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 24h 15m Rec Positive A fantastic Metroidvania. Gorgeous pixel art, excellent music, interesting game mechanics, an intriguing story, and an art style I'm absolutely in love with. Honestly, I love nearly everything about this game. My only real nitpicks are: one important maneuver is executed by double-tapping a direction, which is inconvenient at times and there's no option to bind it to key or button; some flying enemies are straight-up annoying to fight rather than engaging; and the map doesn't display any markers that show where uncollected/collected items are, which makes it difficult to determine exactly when you no longer need to keep searching an area.   Putting all of that aside, this is a title that takes the weirder, creepier environments the Metroid series occasionally dips into and makes an entire game out of it. As someone that likes H.R. Gieger-esque art directions and has been a Metroid fan since the age of 6, Axiom Verge was an absolute joy to play.
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 11h 28m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is the Metroid game that any fan has been waiting for. If Nintendo is unwilling to give the consumers what they want, then someone else will make it. Thus, Axiom Verge was created. It is full of beautiful music, sound, and gameplay that makes you question if it really is Metroid. But, it isn't, and that is the beauty of it. This is a must buy for anyone that has been dreaming of a game that pays homage to the 8-bit/16-bit eras and to Metroid.
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 120h 9m Rec Positive we want more games like the classic great games like metroid and megaman
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 10h 21m Rec Positive It's some really good Metroid. Like really, really good.  Not Metroid-vania. Just Metroid. Plot is sparse but quite dense. The hidden stuff is well and truly hidden. The powerups are cool, as are at least half of the weapons.  Yeah. I'm in a state of pure gaming when playing this. Nothing else exists. Sometimes I forget to eat.  10/10 Would recover mindmachines again.
Date 2015-05-25 Playtime 12h 26m Rec Positive Excelente juego, 100% recomendable, si te gusta la saga metroid, no puedes perderte este espectacular juego, contiene toda la dificultad de Super metroid.
Date 2015-05-24 Playtime 9h 19m Rec Positive Pros: Very solid metroidvania, good sound effects, interesting theme, hard mode is viable Cons: Invisible wall secrets (terrain identical to surroundings but breakable). Most of the times it's hinted at like with a strange indent or a platform that doesn't need to be there, but it's not my favorite either way
Date 2015-05-24 Playtime 22h 57m Rec Positive No se que decir de este gran juego, me recuerda cuando de niño jugaba a Super Metroid. El soundtrack es maravilloso, la exploración, la variedad de armas y objetos hacen a este juego excelente en mi opinión.

Date 2015-05-24 Playtime 13h 49m Rec Positive This game proves that to be great, you don't need shiny fancy graphics or complex rpg systems.  Instead, it gets the important, essential stuff, right.  That's right I am talking about the Sound Effects they are really really just so damn good.  ALSO the way you can organically string together your special moves into traversal-combos is absolute genius.
Date 2015-05-23 Playtime 16h 45m Rec Positive This is the best Super Metroid style game in a long time, much more Metroid than Vania. It gets bonus points for studiously avoiding most of the actual Metroid weapons and mechanics, and for having a lot of totally optional power ups. Not just extra health and such, but many/most of the weapons can be skipped if you're in a hurry. But, if you're taking your time you get rewarded with extra power that works really well for certain enemy setups, including against the bosses.  Extra bonus points for running around in a lab coat and bailey.  The only thing I can fault it for so far is the gadget on the B button. It's a return from Super Metroid, but it actually feels a lot more like a different classic NES game. One that I didn't like. It's really clunky next to the precise controls you have for everything else.
Date 2015-05-23 Playtime 31h 59m Rec Positive It's great.
Date 2015-05-23 Playtime 35h 26m Rec Positive Excelente juego, buena historia, controles perfectos, un aura que de pixel art muy bien elaborado y rejugabilidad para encontrar los objetos del mapa o mejorar tu tiempo. Recomendado.
Date 2015-05-23 Playtime 15h 33m Rec Positive "Axiom Verge" is a one-man masterpiece. That it comes even close to the quality of its forebear, Super Metroid, is a genuinely huge accomplishment. It's been a long time since I felt this fascinated and this compelled to complete a game (Pixel's "Cave Story" comes to mind as well, speaking of similar genres), to see as much as I could, to come back as often as I could, never wanting to stop playing.  The soundtrack is gorgeous and memorable, the controls are -- with one or two quirks kept in mind -- as tight as can be, the items are truly clever and innovative, and even though the game is inspired by Nintendo's brilliant game-changer, it never feels like it's flat-out aping the game Tom Happ so clearly adores.  "Axiom Verge" is its own game, through and through.  And then there's all the hidden items and map sections and secrets galore.  You'll be so proud of yourself when you find some of these cartographic riddles.  If you have ever enjoyed a "Metroidvania"-style game, support this fella and buy this game.  $20 is a small price to pay for a game that would've been $50+ in 1994.  Oh, and the story?  Well, it's a lot deeper than you might be prepared for.  This has immediately gone into my All Time Best list.  No one was more surprised than I was, believe me.
Date 2015-05-23 Playtime 27h 19m Rec Positive If you like Metroid you will love this game. It has all the components that make Metroidveinia games great. An absolute masterpiece!!
Date 2015-05-23 Playtime 17h 25m Rec Positive I've never liked Metroid and similar games, but this one I've enjoyed.  Interesting story, great art, grimdark style, good level design and solid gameplay. A lot of different weapons and items gives more tactic possibilities. Boss fights were a bit short and simple, but thats ok. Special thanks for Linux support.
Date 2015-05-23 Playtime 11h 35m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a 2D side scrolling platformer that is the spiritual successor to old school Metroid games. Most people call this genre Metroidvania but it's really just Metroid.  This game captures the look and feel of the classics making it an amazing throw-back. It's full of secrets, promotes well paced combat and hosts a variety of weapons. I was especially impressed at how the game approached similar Metroid problems in different ways (ie. mini-bombs replaced with a giant drill)  The story is interesting and engaging but ultimately it's the exploration loop and combat that keeps you coming back. The boss fights are what you'd expect in an NES type game and most can be beat fairly easy (even on hard).  On hard you are looking at 11 or hours to get 75% completion and around 20 hours for 100%. Do yourself a favor and stay away from guides. I never had any particular problems difficulty wise. As long as you take your time you'll win. The last boss can be tricky if you don't have the correct weapons though.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Metroid style games.
Date 2015-05-23 Playtime 15h 53m Rec Positive This game is a love letter to the old school metroidvania fans. The environments are a blast to explore, the gameplay is challenging, and the music goes from moody and atmospheric to tense and energized. I could not put this game down until I finished it. The story isn't something you'll get at first glance, but the concepts are almost unsettling as you piece together the existential themes of the game. This is best played with a controller and some headphones with good bass. I love this game and can't wait to see the sequel.

Date 2015-05-23 Playtime 6h 6m Rec Positive One dude.
Date 2015-05-22 Playtime 43h 15m Rec Positive Du très lourd !!  Avec son aspect jeux 8/16 bits et son coté "MétroidVania", Axiom Verge viens amener un peu de vent frais à un genre ou les bons titres ne sont pas légions.  Et il le fait bien !  Après 12h heures de jeu, j'ai pu apprécier un level design soigné ainsi qu'un gameplay aux petits oignons. Un très bon titre et une ambiance sonore digne des plus grands titres. L'histoire n'est pas en reste non plus.  Je suis un fan inconditionnel de Metroid 3 : Axiom Verge m'a conquis !!!  J'y retourne !!
Date 2015-05-22 Playtime 14h 14m Rec Positive If Contra and Metroid had a kid, they named it... um... Controid I guess.  Or Metra. If I was Contra and my kid was Axiom Verge, I'd suspect my spouse to have slept with someone else, maybe Dark Seed.  I observed Axiom Verge's development (by only Tom Happ) for quite some time and was looking forward to its release. I cried a little when I heard, it'd be a timed exclusive for PS4, however it's all okay again, since it was just one month. And what I got completely satisfied my thirst for a next "true" metroidvania.  While games like Guacamelee! or Strider (2014) are great and fun in their own regard, the metroidvania feel gets lost when they show you where you have to go on your map. In Axiom Verge, there's no such hand holding (at least not that I was aware of). You get put in a maze and have to figure out on your own how to get through it. I backtracked wrong a couple of times, but that's more fine by me, as this defines what metroidvanias should be about - to be beaten by your own urge of exploration. And when you didn't (and I didn't...) set the markers, the game generously give you, you'll be there for some time to explore.  It took me little more than 10 hours to complete the game, if don't explore every inch, like me, and sometimes pointlessly backtrack, you can finish it in about 8. For me, this is a perfect duration. In fact, I expected the game to last about three to five hours, like, say, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, so I was pleasantly surprised when I hadn't reached the ending at all after five.   The game feels even more amazing, when I think about that it was developed by just one person. Also, this ensures that the whole game experience is a lot rounder, however it doesn't come without at least SOME downsides. I thought, that some controls (I mean you, double tapping! And you, grappling hook.) felt a bit unintuitive. The music, while providing an excellent atmosphere to the game, was looped a bit cheap in the areas, that might have been better.  Otherwise Axiom Verge brings an amazing experience to every lover of the metroidvania subgenre or frightening, HR Giger like artstyle or, preferably, both.  Highly recommended!
Date 2015-05-22 Playtime 18h 37m Rec Positive Amazing, but this is a game you want to play with a D-Pad, and the Xbox controller has a terrible D-Pad.
Date 2015-05-22 Playtime 14h 46m Rec Positive Very similar to Super Metroid (and that's f******g awesome) but it has his own Style and Character! I recommend this Game to annyone who likes Platformer and Action-Adventure.  A true "Metroidvania" piece of art.     █▀▀░█░█░█▀█░█▀▀░█▀█  ▀▀█░█░█░█▀▀░█▀░░█▀▄  ▀▀▀░▀▀▀░▀░░░▀▀▀░▀░▀  █▄░▄█░█▀▀░█▀▀▀░ █▀█  █░█░█░█▀░░█░▀█░█▀▀█  ▀░▀░▀░▀▀▀░▀▀▀▀░▀░░▀  █░░█░█░▀▀█▀▀░█▀█░█▀█  █░░█░█░░░█░░░█▀▄░█▀█  ▀▀▀▀░▀▀▀░▀░░░▀░▀░▀░▀  █▀▀░█▀█░█░█▀▀  █▀░░█▀▀░█░█  ▀▀▀░▀░░░▀░▀▀  
Date 2015-05-22 Playtime 16h 16m Rec Positive 近年来最为优秀的 Metroidvania 游戏之一，好玩！完全停不下来！虽然这个游戏处处有着 Super Metroid 的影子，但难能可贵的是各种能力升级完全不是简单的拷贝自其他 Metroidvania 游戏，非常具有自己的特色。隐藏要素也很丰富，设计的也比较巧妙，在视觉或文字上也给了玩家足够的提示，玩起来没有被刁难的感觉。难以相信这是完全由一个人开发完成的。不过这游戏也并非没有弱点，Boss战设计的比较乏善可陈，特别是前几个Boss甚至有完全安全的站位点。不同区域的视觉效果区分度也不够大，很多时候感觉仅仅是换了个颜色。最后，游戏里的武器实在是太多，这点说是缺点也有点怪，不过这游戏的武器间并没有什么区分度，到最后也就是看自己的喜好，绝大部分的武器也只是试一次就再也不会用了。  虽然多少可以看到一些欠打磨的地方，但是这游戏总体完成度很高，内容非常丰富。虽然售价20刀稍贵，但绝对值得，特别推荐给喜欢 Metroidvania 游戏的人。
Date 2015-05-22 Playtime 10h 40m Rec Positive Give you nostalgic memories of older classics specially that Metroid vibe. This game is possibly the best mix between a H.R. Gigar (without the sexual content), and metroid as I said. Barely played an hour and I was hooked in by the atmosphere of the environments in each room or area I went to. Enemies are pretty creepy looking as well as certain music tracks which have an erie feeling in some areas. Specially the one with the zombies and corpses the music track there is pretty disturbing making me more interested in this game more. Even great games don't need to be  $49.99 to $59.99! If you loved Metroid or any metroidvania like games and sci-fi stuff this game is for you.
Date 2015-05-22 Playtime 41h 44m Rec Positive It's not often that I pay full price for a game, and rarer that I don't regret doing so. This is one of the few exceptions. The game is everything I wanted in a Metroidvania and more.
Date 2015-05-22 Playtime 25h 16m Rec Positive A brilliant game which outshines many others of the same genre, including certain games which directly inspired it.  If you like exploring then this game could very well be right up your alley.  As far as puzzle mechanics go, I find this to be much superior to Fez, in that some of Fez's puzzles required community collaboration (METATRON, anyone?), however this does not, a keen eye and leaving no stones unturned will yield the solutions to even seemingly the most complex puzzles (and there are some very unconventional puzzles in the game).  This is the best single-player game I have played since playing single-player mode on Mercenary Kings.  Highly recommended.
Date 2015-05-22 Playtime 15h 45m Rec Positive Fantastic game.  Channels the original Metroid & Super Metroid in the best way possible.
Date 2015-05-22 Playtime 1h 13m Rec Positive AWESOME super metroid style game. if you're familiar with that series (and you SHOULD be) you will feel right at home playing this!
Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 24h 7m Rec Positive Wonderfully fun jump & shoot in the vein of Cave Story and of course Metroid. Great fun if you're looking for a casual game to play on your off time.
Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 28h 47m Rec Positive Would never have normally looked into this genre of game but having sat down to try it on a PS4 at REZZED I knew from those 3-4 minutes that it'd be one I'd buy.  Amazing soundtrack Lovingly crafted graphics (with some really nice authentic feeling glitch effects, some of the best) Tight controls Varied enemies and varied weapons  16 hours to finish and there were still a few things I had left uninvestigated.  Although not for me, the presence of a SpeedRun mode that removes dialogue scenes, adds a timer and removes all random elements is a really nice touch.  Highly recommended
Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 7h 43m Rec Positive Considering the fact that Axiom Verge is heavily inspired by Metroid already makes it intriguing. As soon as I saw the trailer, I almost immediately bought it ( due to Metroid being one of my most favored Nintendo franchises ).   The game is unique, challenging, and most definitely fun to play. I've only played about 2 hours of it, and i'm already addicted to playing through out the entire story and find out what happened to Trace. Speedrun also seems to be a good way to get hooked onto the game.   On another note, I like to bring up the old 8-bit style and the old chip-tune beats. Really brings a lot of nostalgia to those who owned a N64 and played games like these. I HIGHLY recommend buying this game if you're looking for a original, platforming, shooter, and amazing game to play.
Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 22h 23m Rec Positive Fan vom Genre? Kauf es!
Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 21h 58m Rec Positive It reminds me of Iji from Remar games.   It is a metroidvania type game that actually lives up to being a metroid-like game.   I played using the keyboard. I had no troubles with the controls.
Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 13h 31m Rec Positive Метроид и Кастельвания с графоном. Атмосфера присутствует. Прям как раньше, когда всё было лучше.  Желателен гейпад, но и на клавиатуре можно придрочиться.

Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 21h 12m Rec Positive My experiences of the MetroidVania style have been alot more Metroid, and very little 'Vania. This game most certainly nods to the Metroid style of play. You will navigate through the world, gathering power ups and new weapons. Defeat bosses to gain the next big piece of tech that you need to progress to the next few levels (as well as access recently unreachable areas that you have already passed by).  One of my favourite parts has to be the disrupter. This allows you to alter reality within the game and effectivley "glitch" your enemies into less threatening ones (except bosses.. at least, not in my experience!). There will be sections of the environment itself which you can remove/create with the help of this device. It is a great addition to a gaming style/gaming style whose era is full of unintended glitches, and has more or less become a hobby of most to exploit. Which brings me onto the Speedrun option.  I haven't played the Speedrun yet, but the intentional ability to "Glitch" within the game makes me very excited with this! There is even an achievement if you successfully complete the game in under 4 hours (quite a long way away from my 14 hours to complete - I was trying to be thorough and enjoy the beautifully tiled worlds and well crafted music).  My experience with this game is fantastic! I just need to find the last few items and areas of the map to be completely satisfied with my play. If you loved the original Metroid games (especially Super Metroid; being my favourite); you should definitely give this game a try!  Hands down 10/10 from me
Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 27h 36m Rec Positive So very. very good.
Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 11h 56m Rec Positive 10/10 scratches the Metroid itch extremely well
Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 35h 8m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is game that features an "address disruptor" that causes various elements of the game to glitch out and behave in unexpected ways as one of its central mechanics, and it still can't even manage to be glitchier than an Early Access/Ubisoft game.  I owe this game a review/thumbs up. I followed development for 2 years prior to release. Being a long time fan of Super Metroid, I wanted something that was as good as Super Metroid. I gave Axiom Verge a lofty set of expectations, and it exceeded almost all of them. But to keep things short and concise, my personal takeaway:  Pros: [list][*]The world is [i]very[/i] well-designed. The way pathways connect in both expected and unexpected ways, and the means by which the layout of blocks guides/teaches you is superb [*]The story - some may not be a fan of it, and it can be a bit hard to grasp, but I found it both different and intriguing. It's not limited to dialog/journal pages, but more subtle world elements as well [*]Upgrades - they start out fairly boring, almost a carbon copy of what's been done before (weapons, high-jump, etc) but eventually become bizarre and unique, allowing the player to glitch through walls and such [*]Controls - Movement mechanics in particular become a lot of fun once you get all the mandatory upgrades [*]Scope - The game is a good size; large enough to sink several hours on your first playthrough, but small enough to complete in a sitting once you've mastered it [*]Secrets - There are a lot of them, including an entire [i]avenue[/i] of secrets I didn't even know about in my first playthrough. Some are very devious to find[/list]  Cons [list][*]Secrets - They manage to be both pros and cons, because while a lot of them are clever, a lot are equally esoteric and almost frustrating [*]Note taking - you're able to mark "reminders" on the map, but those reminders are just "1" and "2" - having a means to note "come back when I can jump higher" or "glitch wall I can't open yet" would serve the player much better. This issue bugged me in SotN, and it's not any better here. [*]Weapon balance - There are a bunch of unique and interesting weapons - and most of them are useless gimmicks. The Axiom, the Kilver, the Flamethrower and the lightning gun/piercer are about the only weapons you'll ever use when dealing with day to day combat [*]The Climax - not strictly the "ending" or the "final boss", but the entire lead-up to the finale felt weak compared to the rest of the game. There was a lot of build-up, and the final area just didn't live up to the rest of it[/list]  In short: the weapon balance is terrible, the climax was disappointing, and in spite of that Axiom Verge is pretty much guaranteed to be my game of 2015 and one of the best platformers I've played in the last 20 years, if not the best thing since Super Metroid.   And since everyone seems to like talking about price: Axiom Verge is [i]absolutely[/i] worth the $20 price tag for anyone who likes games in the vein of Super Metroid.
Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 16h 42m Rec Positive A love letter to Metroidvania that still manages to stand on its own; it's well worth the play, even if it's a little rough around the edges. I beat the game on Normal difficulty with 100% completion in 16 hours.  It gets the feel mostly right, but dialog and cutscenes happen just often enough that the sense of pleasant loneliness that comes from exploring a hostile alien world is lost. In addition, the story, while generally fine, is told somewhat strangely--too much detail to hold much mystery, and yet not enough detail to appreciate its scope. I actually think it's fine that you can't really relate to most of the characters, being that they're supposed to be so alien, but the one that you are supposed to connect with is still fairly bland.  Controls are fine--the addition of a lock button to hold still while aiming is a nice touch, but there's a dash ability that requires double-tapping a direction that gets kind of old, and probably should have been its own button. Nonetheless, the game presents enough interesting ways of maneuvering around the environment that just traversing rooms feels pretty satisfying.  Item collection is probably the game's weakest aspect--there's a ton of backtracking, and the map doesn't have any indication of what items you have or haven't gotten--it only tells you if you got them all. This would be forgivable if there weren't a pretty sizable number of items that are almost impossible to find without a cheat sheet or a lot of obsessive checking of every single wall, and some require even more unorthodox solutions--I'm all about out-of-the-box problem-solving, but the game gives little indication of even where to start in some parts (helpful hint: try 'scrambling' every enemy at least once to see what it does.) When you don't feel like you can trust the information provided by the game--when you aren't even given indication that you *should* be curious about a room--it makes for a pretty tedious exploration experience. This is further exacerbated by the lack of a final powerup that essentially trivializes navigation in the early areas of the game--an important element that helps mitigate the fact that the threats of the areas you're backtracking through are no longer challenging to someone with all the weapons and power-ups the endgame affords.  Visually, the game knocks it out of the park--environments and enemies are beautifully bizarre, and come in almost endless variety. Nothing more to really say about it--it's a visual treat you'll be happy to pore over.  The sound design is similarly excellent: the music has good variety while keeping a certain pulsing feel that makes every area feel alive and alien; your weapons sound appropriately powerful, and your enemies sound appropriately monstrous. The only two knocks I have here are the low-health alert, while cleverly timed to the beat of the music, is rather piercing, and the "clang" you get when you hit an invulnerable part of an enemy becomes overpowering when you start fighting large bosses with rapid-fire weapons (since they tend to be almost entirely invulnerable save for a small weak point.)  Overall, this is a great game, and my complaints are really mostly nit-picking--I enjoyed it thoroughly, and I can't wait to see the next game from Mr. Happ.
Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 29h 20m Rec Positive The best metroidvania game that isn't Metroid or Castlevania that you will play this year. The last two bosses are a suitable level of bullshit. I was most intrigued by how they made a low-health noise bearable by synchronizing it to whatever the background music is. You will probably miss at least 20% of the collectibles without help or spending an extra ten hours re-exploring the world, and that's okay.
Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 36h 22m Rec Positive Last year at E3 Reggie from Nintendo was walking by the Axiom Verge booth and he stopped just to tell the game's creator "hey, that looks alot like metroid." then someone from the crowd yelled at Reggie " well if your not going to make it then someone has to!" So thanks to the creator of this game for making the metorid game Nintendo does not want to make.
Date 2015-05-21 Playtime 16h 6m Rec Positive Do you like Metroid? Of course you do, it's fucking Metroid!  Axiom Verge is also Metroid.
Date 2015-05-20 Playtime 120h 38m Rec Positive Simply put, one of the greatest games of all time. Axiom Verge, I adore you.
Date 2015-05-20 Playtime 13h 18m Rec Positive This game shouldn't be written off as a metroid clone. It does take from that game series but not just on a superficial level like most games in this genre. The developer, Mike Happ, cleary understood what made Super Metroid a classic and used that as a foundation. The game has creative weapons and a lot of action, which is partly where it differentiates itself, the other part is the story.
Date 2015-05-20 Playtime 42h 47m Rec Positive [h1]Unbelievable Polish and Playability[/h1]  This is a really interesting case. I can't even call this a metroidvania; this game is very unabashedly a Metroid. You know this game already. You probably already LOVE this game... but you have no idea how it ends. Even after deciphering all the codes, it's hard to even tell where it began, and with whom. Was it Queen Elizabeth I? Earlier? Later? You might even begin to question which version of yourself you are, or discover you can't account for a few months of time. Finally, as you start to unravel the fabric of reality, you'll start to see meaning in the scanlines themselves, and begin to believe that you aren't even IN the map.  I would recommend this enchanting combination of retro glitchiness and cthulian insanity easily, without reservation. Get it now!
Date 2015-05-20 Playtime 6h 34m Rec Positive [quote] [h1]Original Review[/h1] I've only played 0.6 hours but from what I have played I can make a first impression.  If your really into the old school Metroid games then this game is for you.  A lot more forgiving than Metroid as you don't lose all the stuff you collected when you die.  Save rooms function as checkpoints, the death and respawning works more like in Borderlands.   Update 2: You also don't loose progress on death either.  So when you beat a boss and die in the same   Seriously give this game a go.  Well worth the £14.99.  Update: REVIEW UNCHANGED! and its not an Early Access Survival game either.  Hats off the one of the many decent indie developers on steam. [/quote]  [h1]Pros[/h1] + Excellent Metroidvania style gameplay + No handholding.  (No objective indicators etc) + Feels good to explore + Top notch soundtrack + Brilliant Checkpoint system + Low system requirements + Supports Controllers  [h1]Cons[/h1] - Bosses can be pretty tough - Easy to get lost and even stuck in some places requiring starting the game all over again. - Few issues with the controls  [h1]Overall[/h1] This is an outstanding example of a decent Metroidvania styled game.  In fact its more of a pure Metroid game in that it shares many similarities with the Metroid (NOT PRIME) franchise.  While I am usually put off by no hand holding, when I find where I need to go it feels great, that I've done something without being told where to go and exploration is rewarding in its own right.  When playing this with a controller I find myself using the right thumb stick to aim which it doesn't it in fact selects a weapon you want to use.  A very minor complaint but something I thought was worth a mention.  At the end of the day the question you should ask: Do you like Metroid? If so then GET .... THIS .... GAME!
Date 2015-05-20 Playtime 15h 51m Rec Positive A very good game. The game play is solid and the story is decent. The game does a good job of keeping you intrigued with the world. A good representation of the Metroid style of game play but yet able to find its own identity.
Date 2015-05-20 Playtime 7h 17m Rec Positive Believe the hype, this game is a joy to play. It's not the most complex game ever, but it's not trying to be. It's got a great atmosphere, a wide selection of weapons, a stellar soundtrack, intuitive controls(that can be mapped how you want them to be), and the platforming is a bit more forgiving than Metroid, which is always welcome. WELL worth the $20 price tag.   The one criticism I have is that I wish you didn't have to move while shooting diagonally. Else, this game is totally awesome.
Date 2015-05-20 Playtime 21h 15m Rec Positive This. Game.  Are you tired of Un-Original games? PLAY THIS.  You'll me blown away by how amazing the art, soundtrack,  gameplay and overall atmosphere this gem of a game has. And this was made by ONE PERSON.  Holy cow, i LOVE you Thomas Happ!!!!!
Date 2015-05-20 Playtime 17h 0m Rec Positive A++  Fantastic game!  I'm a huge fan of the original Metroid and this captures that feel perfectly.  The music is excellent as well, very catch.  I haven't played a game this fun in 10 years!  Love the classics, please make a part 2
Date 2015-05-20 Playtime 26h 8m Rec Positive Axiom Verge might be a Metroidvania game but boy does it ooze personality and it is very much its own beast.  I just finished the game and i'm ready to jump in again!  Its visually interesting which makes you want to lose yourself in this 2D world. ( And you will get lost , allot )  Axiom does not tell you where to go or what to do, you have to figure it out for yourself so this might not be for everyone.  The soundtrack is phenomenal and is an integral part of the experience as well as the sound design.  Also worth mentioning a speedrunner mode has been added for all you speed runners : )   Probably the best Metroidvania iv'e played since Metroid fusion.   If your a fan of this genre buy it now!     
Date 2015-05-20 Playtime 24h 26m Rec Positive A fun retro-style metroidvania game that I would recommend to any fan of the genre. The gameplay stresses exploration, getting lost, and fun combat gameplay. New areas are unlocked by tools found, with each tool providing unique and interesting functionalities. Graphics are done in a NES-style 8-bit feel with modern touches that really feels like an alien world. The soundtrack is superb with chiptune sounds and amazing sound effects. Even after completing the game, hours can be lost in searching for remaining items. Multiple playthroughs are encouraged with randomized areas and a speedrun mode that challenges players to play through the game in as short a time as possible. It's still astounding this was developed by a single person, considering the care and execution on all areas of the game.
Date 2015-05-19 Playtime 21h 31m Rec Positive A love letter that addresses the classic Metroid game. On top of that, the story is also confusing in a very positive way. You might find yourself between the note to find out the complete truth behind all actions.
Date 2015-05-19 Playtime 13h 21m Rec Positive God, where do I even start. Everything about this game is utterly fantastic. The gameplay, the graphics, the music (good lord the music). Axiom Verge is a love letter to Metroid in video game form. It is -unabashedly- Metroid. If you grew up on 2D platformers, this will be your jam. Even if you didn't, PLAY THIS GAME. It was made by a single dude!   It's a short but sweet experience. I'd say on average it'll last anywhere from 8 to 12 hours. I clocked in at 11 and a half hours as my clear time. There's a ton of collectables and hidden items scattered throughout the game, but most are pretty optional.   Speaking of collectables and hidden items, Axiom Verge has a lot of weapons. A LOT of weapons. I think there's 20 or so? A minor gripe I had was that despite the vast array of weaponry, only a handful are actually useful. It seems like the design mentality was akin to "sounds cool on paper", but in practice it ends up being pretty useless. Fortunately, the handful of weapons that are good are REALLY GOOD. And to be fair, some of the "useless" weapons are really useful against certain bosses.  Another gripe I had was regarding some of the controls. Two upgrades in particular, the Grapple and the various Dash upgrades you get have kinda... janky controls. They're pretty unwieldy. The grapple's just plain hard to use, and the dash, well... The dash activates by doubletapping a direction, but often times I'd find it would activate randomly on its own just from normal movement. I would much have prefered the dash being mapped to a button instead.   Overall, solid Metroid-y experience. I'd recommend it to anyone who's a fan of 2D platformers or Metroidvanias. GREAT GAME A+++++ ALL THE THUMBS UP.
Date 2015-05-19 Playtime 37h 5m Rec Positive 10/10 Hard to believe that one man made it all. Excellent game for those who are looking for a old school challenge. Music is just brilliant and keeps the atmosphere.
Date 2015-05-19 Playtime 15h 10m Rec Positive 11/10 would labcoat through walls again. Only three hours in and I'm completely hooked.  Update: Finished the game. The story is phenomenal, and the gameplay excellent to match. The only complaint I have is that the boss fights are relatively uninspired and don't do the rest of the game justice.
Date 2015-05-19 Playtime 11h 12m Rec Positive 11 hours, 34 deaths.  77% items 96% map    This is a good game.  This is an awesome game.  This is something that feels like it came straight out of the early nineties. Something that could almost have existed on the SNES with a bit more of the harsh pixels of the NES. A soundtrack that is electronic; Dark and brooding that still somehow seems like it could also be coming from one of those old consoles.      It plays and control in nearly the same way as Castlevania Symphony of the Night, and Super Metroid. Running around collecting items and equipment to run around again, getting farther, deeper, to collect more items and equipment.  The game can be grueling if you aren't an explorer.  Finding weapon damage power ups as well as the weapons themselves can be hard.  Some of them much more well hidden than others.  Maps, and the "cheat codes" are mandatory for some pickups.  Searching the web for secrets made me feel like I was back on dial up just hoping I could figure it out.    I recommend a controller.  I found it the easiest way to pull off some of the harder "jumping teleporting pet lobbing teleporting again and then again" jumps.  The game can be beaten in under four hours with a map and a plan, but it's much more fun to go it yourself. When you get stuck, get help with that part and then continue.  You can always come back when you miss something.    The only two things I might gripe about are the asking price and the myriad of weapons that are either useless or bothersome to use.   I would have been a bit more solid on the price if it were 15 or closer to that.  Many weapons are specialized.  None seem to be "super effective" against any one kind of enemy, nor are there really any types of enemy.  They all seem to just have a base health pool, and you deal damage until they are dead.  No shielding, no regenerating and no armor.  There is a hotswitch button to change weapons without opening the weapon wheel.  This is underused completely. I simply stuck to the most powerful gun in the game until I found a more powerful one.     If you're having trouble progressing, a power upgrade or two can let you breeze by.  I found particularly the last boss to suffer from this.  It seemed near impossible with my weak weapons.  Even the enemies leading up to the boss were giving me trouble.  I went back and collected a few upgrades and a weapon I missed.  Returned swiftly to the boss and there was no difficulty.  I simply destroyed him.  Unlike most of the bosses there was no pattern, nothing to learn.  I just shot the weak spot and I won in seconds.  Sadly a weak ending gameplay wise.    This is still an amazing game, beautiful to look at, slightly upsetting sometimes as well.  With it's near gore style in some sections, mechanical biological machine in others... the "friends" that you meet on the way are also terrifying monsters in their own right.  You should get this game, maybe wait for a sale? but it's nolstalga that plays amazing. A joy to control and bomb around in.
Date 2015-05-19 Playtime 25h 23m Rec Positive Does it look like a metroidvania game? Does it feel like a metroidvania game? Does it play like a metroidvania game? Does it capture your heart and mind like a metroidvania game? Yes It does.  It's a beautiful entry into the under appreciated and underrepresented genre (the genre being, if I haven't said it enough already, Metroidvania), and it truly does ooze with it's own style and beautiful mix of SNES and NES style graphics and sound design. Interesting items and enemies abound, and no lack of secrets and exploration.  Casuals and Pros alike can enjoy and appreciate it's design and get a tonne of entertainment out of it. I have no major gripes with it.  --=PROS=-- -Design -Story -Controls -Sound -Damn near everything  --=CONS=-- -No sequel announced yet -My thumb hurts double tapping in any direction to "teleport", why wasn't this made as a button, or as a double tap jump   and hold a direction for how often it's used  9.5/10
Date 2015-05-19 Playtime 8h 16m Rec Positive Do you like Metroid? Then buy this game. Do you not like Metroid? You're a fucking liar, now go buy the game.
Date 2015-05-19 Playtime 19h 31m Rec Positive A retro-ish platformer that is practically a love song to the original NES Metroid, but with plenty of twists, borrowed game mechanics from other NES classics, and modern functionality to keep things fresh.
Date 2015-05-19 Playtime 23h 21m Rec Positive Great !
Date 2015-05-19 Playtime 3h 14m Rec Positive Extremely fun metroidvania style game!
Date 2015-05-19 Playtime 16h 4m Rec Positive Excellent metroidvania game with some great mechanics and a gritty undertone.
Date 2015-05-19 Playtime 18h 58m Rec Positive Quite nice Metroidvania game.
Date 2015-05-19 Playtime 20h 25m Rec Positive This is the Metroidvania game you've been looking for. After completing the game, I can say that there are a number of things I have enjoyed, making me recommend this to both fans of the genre and those who don't know about it:  - Great controls - Many different weapons - Many different utility items (which adds for some innovative ways to explore) - Different game modes (Normal, Hard, and Speedrun) - Compelling story (In the form of both cutscenes as well as hidden lore within in the game) - TONS of secrets - Beautiful Pixel-art graphics - Beautifully crafted music  Again, I would highly recommend this game to anyone, as it touches on the nostalgic game design of the Metroid franchise while at the same time being completely unique with a fresh story and solid gameplay. 10/10
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 2h 36m Rec Positive Metroid is back in Indie form. Plays great. I really really really love the music. Fantastic all around. I've been waiting for a new game of this type because it's one of my favorite genres.
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 11h 18m Rec Negative Axiom Verge has a pretty great intro. It reminded me of the games from the time-period when I got into this hobby. It's got a great soundtrack, very Metroid-like graphics and encourages exploration, like this genre of game should. At first, it seemed like the sort of game that I was going to enjoy.  Unfortunately, around halfway through the game, it takes a turn for the worse and the whimsical exploration from the early game is replaced with spamming every metroidvania ability on every surface to make sure that you aren't missing a deviously hidden main path.  (If you're going to play it: Use the disruptor on the slightly pinker goo than everything else that 2 fishlobsters jump out of)  Another problem is the controls (I played using gamepad) become overburdened with half-baked exploration mechanics that never quite feel good enough to pull off what the game is trying to get you to do, instead just putting you in a nightmarish loop of repeating the difficult parts over and over until you get it right by virtue of chance... and then you get killed in the very next room and have to do it all again.  For now, I've decided to put the game down, at what I believe is the final boss, because it is more frustrating than fun. Will I come back to it? I don't know - probably not.   Maybe you'll like this? I didn't, even though I wanted to.
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 13h 13m Rec Positive This game feels like Metroid in all of its aspects. Totally loved it!  I never got bored, even with all the backtracking that comes with a metroidvania game. Gameplay it's Metroid-like (8-axis firing, jumps, nano-ball mechanics - a little bit twisted :D - and so on). The plot is not so original, but it's well written and told through the whole game. When you feel you are starting to get bored, the game kicks in another piece of information (a note, a dialogue) that keeps you going further. Sound and graphics are stunning, really, expecially knowing that all this came from one man only.  I really enjoyed it, recommended if you enjoy metroidvania platformers.
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 14h 34m Rec Positive A modern take on a classic formula that can stand alongside the likes of Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night as one of the finest in its genre. And don't be fooled by the 8-bit aesthetic -- this game's engine is deceptively complex and makes for some incredibly memorable moments. (Not to mention those awesome "glitch" effects reminiscent of an NES game in need of cleaning!)  Also: it was made by one guy in the span of five years.
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 17h 57m Rec Positive Amazing game. Similar to metroid, but still very much its own game.
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 6h 53m Rec Positive I should have been asleep 4 hours ago, and I blame this game.
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 5h 21m Rec Positive I can't believe it's not Metroid!
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 10h 48m Rec Positive Well this was a pleasant surprise.  After countless disappointments and false leads into a genuine metroidvania experience, Lo and behold on a whim I decide to give this a try and it's like a love letter to the genre. Granted, it doesn't even bother to hide it's super metroid influences but honestly with all the crap steam is trying to push as "metroidvania" when the games are anything but, I am willing to let a few things slide.   So short version: If you loved super metroid, you will find something to love about this game. It's that game but with a different skin.   There are a couple things that made me wince in terms of design choices, namely the mobility-based skills you pick up and a very hit or miss soundtrack, but overall the experience was more or less what I had hoped for in a game carrying a metroid-vania tag.   It's also generously  long, with a modest helping of replayability. Namely in the form of a speedrun mode, size of map, a hard mode, and a couple other specific challenges for the achievement hunting folks out there (don't die more than once)  I definitely recommend this game in the hopes other developers will see how successful this game is as an example of what TO DO when you want to make a metroid-vania game.   Seriously though, Kur has one of the worst BGM's I have ever heard. I never had to mute a game everytime I get to a specific area. hah.

Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 34h 52m Rec Positive I followed the development of this game for two years and had no second thoughts about throwing down $20 for it on day one. I don't regret it, I highly recommend it. So I'm going to try and break it down:  The Good: -The art! It's gorgeous.  -The music! I've been stuck on this bee lookin boss for about half an hour but it's ok because holy crap the boss music is awesome -The world is huge and there are so many secrets. It's great. I'll play it forever.  -This was a labor of love made by one man, and it's great and I think he deserves all of the money for this -if you like Metroid get this. It's basically Metroid.   The Bad: -lots of backtracking. It can be time consuming and a little tedious. In my dreams he will update it so you can fast travel between save points. That would be a nice feature! -sometimes the controls are a little wonky. Aiming your gun can be tricky   I'm not going to do a numerical score. I'm going to do a binary type score.   "Should I buy this? (Y/N)" Y forever Get it
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 10h 51m Rec Positive Also bei diesem Spiel sollte man ganz klar mit den negativen Sachen anfangen: -bei manchen Dialogen steht anstatt "haben" nur "habe"  Und da wir nun mit den Nachteilen fertig sind, die Vorteile: +große Spielwelt, die Dank tausender Verstecke mit nützlichen und Interessanten Belohnungen immer wieder zum erkunden einlädt +großartige Grafik im Stile der guten alten NES-Spiele mit modernen Partikeleffekten +eine fesselnde Story mit ungeahnten Wendungen +eine Suchtspirale aus neue Fähigkeiten erwerben/ausprobieren/neue Gebiete erkunden +toll inszenierte Bosskämpfe mit mehreren möglichen Strategien +eine Vielzahl an Ohrwürmern, für jedes Gebiet ein einzigartiger Soundtrack passend im NES-Stil  Also insgesamt ein Pflichtkauf, für den ich auch gerne mehr ausgegeben hätte!!!
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 12h 21m Rec Negative I liked it better when it was called FEZTROID
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 14h 45m Rec Positive Man, oh man, I *DO* love me some Metroid. That said, Axiom Verge really fills that nostalgia void without being cliche, trite or otherwise deniable. It manages to keep its own style while still paying heaps of homage to the classics of my generation. HIGHLY. RECOMMENDED.
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 16h 14m Rec Positive Axiom Verge = Metroid - brain-sucking aliens + more guns + existential crises  This is a hell of a game, with classic Metroid exploration and huge bosses. There's a ton of stuff hidden away in the nooks and crannies. The Address Disruptor (glitch gun) is a nice genre-savvy twist. Speaking of twists, there are a few nicely-executed ones in the story, so don't skip the cutscenes... at least until you beat the game once and shoot for a speed run.
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 19h 57m Rec Positive This game is incredible.  From the mind of one man, who made all the art, music, story and gameplay, comes one of the best Metroid games I've ever played(my favorite game series, sans Other M).  Now, that's being a bit disingenuous, since Axiom Verge very much adds a lot to the Metroid formula, though makes no bones about where its inspirations initially come from.    Through abilities such as teleportation, the Address Disruptor(a gun that creates NES-era visual data corruption on objects and enemies, similar to if you put an NES cart in wrong), the drone, and other abilities, it expands on the standard 2D Metroid gameplay in a huge way.  The lack of a run button is kind of a bummer, but that's a minor quibble, and the only major gripe is that teleportation requires a double-tap in the direction you want to teleport, which means trying to do this on an analog stick is pretty much luck-based.  I wind up going sideways when I want to go up, up when I want to go sideways far too often, but there's other means of movement that I can resort to to avoid that.  The graphics are incredible.  Using a faux-8-bit style with setpieces and bosses that fill the screen(or beyond!), I would say it is a visual combination of Metroid and H.R. Geiger.  Every single tile and object is covered with minute details, from dents and rust on bosses and enemies, to throbbing veins in organic scenery.  The Rusalki are incredibly unnerving looking, as you'll see as you play the game.  The gross organic look of many objects and enemies mixed with the technological parts of others makes for horrible techno-organic nightmare machines.  Backgrounds and terrain are lovingly detailed, and the special effects are straight-up surprising.  While I've been following the game for a while and thus knew about things like the Address Disruptor's effects, or what a boss death looks like, these things will likely shock a new player with their "oh, right, this is a modern game!" effect.  The weaponry is plenty and varied.  Not all are useful, plenty are gimmicky, but most have their time to shine.  I wound up sticking with the starter weapon for long range, and the Kelver for close up for most of the game, switching to about a half dozen other weapons throughout the game for specific reasons.  At the end I still hadn't found a full half of the total weapon count, so I'm eager to get back in and track them down.  The music is outstanding.  The boss fight themes are all frantic and intense, and the general world exploration themes are fitting to their respective zones.  I am definitely going to buy the soundtrack once it goes on sale.  The story starts off as basically Half-Life 1.  Lab experiment goes wrong, you get teleported to hostile alien world full of horrible death creatures.  Trace is a pretty interesting character whose reactions to things are pretty justified.  The Rusalki, your "narrators", essentially, are alien AI and have different personalities themselves that evolve as the game progresses.  By the end, I was mostly satisfied with the story, and a few sections of the game blew me away(the Hallucination section, in particular, was one of my favorite parts of a game in years).  Athetos, Trace, the Rusalki, they COULD have had more fleshed out stories, but I think it was fine as it was.  There's more to the story in hidden notes and such, possibly a true ending as well?  Not entirely sure, still haven't collected everything as of this review.  Game time clocked in at around 12-13 hours total for a 70% playthrough for me.  I'm the sort to fumble around trying to find secrets though, so an 8-10 hour playthrough wouldn't surprise me, and there's a speedrun achievement for beating it in 4 hours, so there's that.  It's definitely a much longer Metroid game than most Metroids tend to be.  Overall I'd say this was a 10 out of 10.  The only complaint of mine, detailed earlier, is for a single movement ability that works most of the time.  I was constantly exploring new regions and surprised by the variety in terrain, the music is great, very fitting, and only gets better as the game goes on, the gameplay was fun and very varied while providing plenty of options for weaponry, the visuals are some of the best 8-bit style graphics ever made, and the story is perfectly serviceable.  A must-buy if you enjoy Metroid games, or platformers in general!
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 3h 6m Rec Positive Great game that reminds you of Metroid... obviously recommend to those of which that like shooters and platforms combined... gotta love it 
Date 2015-05-18 Playtime 15h 20m Rec Positive The difficulty is a bit rough around the edges, at times, as were the puzzles. I hated a few bosses. And yet... the music was great, the exploration was generally very well done, and this game oozes style, between the aesthetic and the story, and how the two interact.
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 28h 39m Rec Positive This game is amazing. That this is the work of a single person is nothing short of astounding. An amazing love letter to Metroid that also blazes its own path with an interesting story and fun gameplay.
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 15h 33m Rec Positive I especially like the fact that they apparently took great care not to copy familiar Metroid powers and mechanics, but came up with a lot of new ideas on their own. A perfect blend of hommage and creative innovation. Thumbs way up!
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 15h 15m Rec Positive This is truly one of those games that you cannot miss if you have ever played and enjoyed anything "Metroid-ish". It has a great story, the combat is great for a 2D sidescroller, so what I'm saying is: "Do yourself a favor and buy it now!"
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 18h 35m Rec Positive A nearly perfect game. The only flaw -- and I really don't see any way around it -- is the fact that you have to backtrack a lot, but that's not so bad. The combat is tight, the difficulty is delicately tuned well, the sense of progress is outstanding, and there's always a feeling of accomplishment when you get a new item. The plot is really good, appropriately mysterious. It's got a LOT of really good ideas; would highly recommend.
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 33h 22m Rec Positive The most fun ive had with any game in years! Can't wait to see the sequel...crossing fingers and toes that this series expands! :D
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 5h 26m Rec Positive As a big Metroid and Castlevania fan, I highly recommend this game.
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 60h 1m Rec Positive Summary:  A polished, thoroughly inspired metroidvania experience which delivers to on all fronts.  If you're into this genre or have a craving for a game filled with exploration, powerups, and rewarding backtracking, then look no further.  Pros:    -- Do you know what metroidvania is?  This is a near-perfectly executed game if you're into the genre. -- Challenging gameplay (you must set it to hard for the true experience!!!) -- Fantastic weaponry, powerups, and upgrades do what you hope they would:  expand your abilities and open up new areas for exploration.  --  I especially liked that your upgrades didn't suffer from the "grapple hook" phenomenon where the only thing you can do with your tools is use them on tiles specifically marked (like the grapple hook tiles from the Metroid games).  The game probably won't stump you completely with the platforming puzzles, but it won't make it stupidly obvious with grapple hook/power bomb tiles. -- Great, difficult level design will have you praying for save points.  Really satisfies your urge to explore and backtrack.  There are scripted sequences, and often times when you're going through a new level that you'll have sections between save points you'll have to retry many times until you figure out how to tackle the enemies. -- Disturbing bio-mechanical themes (think Geiger without all the sex).   Cons:  -- The color palette was often abrasive and muddled to me.  There were times when I couldn't distinguish background from foreground/boundary tiles.  This isn't a deal-breaker, but I would love to see someone mod this particular aspect of the game.  The concept of the art is great, just not the color...in my humble opinion :)
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 19h 12m Rec Positive Finished in 13h30 of pure joy, worth every penny  First thing first Mr Tom Happ, let me write your name down, so I can make sure not to pass on any of your future projects.  This game has it all : music, secrets, bosses, weapons, abilities, ... as many mentioned, in a very metroidy way, in the end I personally got a some nes megaman feeling too.  Yet it is very tied to the first impressions, the game get passed that, very quickly, it gets its own identity, and it's brilliant, to me it's already a classic among the greatest.  I enjoyed the story, it has still incredible potential, I hope you will build on that.  The thing I enjoy the least was the design of some surface areas. The level design is where there is more room to improve in my opinion, but to be honest it's a minor issue.  Until next time Tom / Trace / Athetos ...
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 15h 21m Rec Positive This is the best metroidvania game I've played in a long time. It stays true to its roots, has a great story and an amazing soundtrack.
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 3h 30m Rec Negative Was expecting something that looked like NES Metroid; not something that played like it. Controls are unresponsive and awkward and there's no dual-stick option, which is ridiculously anachronistic for any side-scrolling shooter released in 2015.  Only two bosses in and I'm also thoroughly unimpressed with the boss design. The first boss is just a generic bullet-hell spammer, while the second boss might as well be from a rhythm game. Both follow the formula of getting gradually faster as you tediously chip away at their health 0.5% at a time. The second boss also appeared to be glitched, as ducking under the high bullets only worked about half the time. This meant jumping over the high bullets, which the timing doesn't seem to realistically allow once the boss is at its fastest.  Coupled with the damage knockback and maybe only 200ms of immunity after taking damage, there's no recovering after you inevitably get hit. Outside of that boss battle, the knockback also has a tendency to send you through doors and, upon reentering the room you were just kicked out of, the enemy who knocked you back is often sitting on the door and instantly depletes your remaining health.  Art is fantastic, soundtrack is pretty decent (although the bass mix is ridiculous, turn down your sub before playing unless you enjoy head-throbbing migraines), and the concept is solid. I just wish its dev had put as much thought in to the game's controls and boss design as he did towards original weapons and powerups. Instead of an homage to the best bits of the NES, this game is currently a slavish recreation of everything that sucked about that era of gaming.
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 22h 23m Rec Positive I can't say enough good things about this game. By far one of my favorite games of 2015 so far. You can tell a lot of time, effort, and love went into making Axiom Verge. This is a game I feel everyone needs to experience. You'll never know how good it really is until you play it yourself.

Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 1h 39m Rec Positive Here's my review of #axiomverge a new title with a retro feel. Is it worth your money? Always honest reviews on DaGaimez! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuiAKLMNab4
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 11h 57m Rec Negative Being a metroidvania fan, I've been hyped about Axiom Verge for months. I couldn't wait for it to drop on Steam. So, I never thought I'd be writing a negative review for it.  I did have fun with the game, but that's where the praise begins and ends. Of course, the soundtrack and art style are very cool and attractive, but the game proper underwhelms.  The game length is quite short (8 hours with ~85% completion), and the early parts are fun, but you quickly become too powerful for any of the game's enemies to be a threat to you, even on Hard mode. Basically, that means Axiom Verge quickly becomes focused on the exploration aspect.  While exploring is half the fun of any metroidvania, the game gets into a slump where you're just dashing around the map like a mad man toward any undiscovered map tile, ignoring enemies and trying to find the next powerup (which you only need to get to the next powerup, anyway). The enemies might as well not even be in the game; you hardly deal with them past the first couple hours of the game.  The real problem with this game is the controls. Bosses get damn near impossible at the end of the game; one tiny tap on the control sticks will switch out your weapon, or enter the radial weapon select menu, or send you double-tap dashing in a random direction. The final boss fight was a nightmare akin to a Mario Party minigame, where I was spinning my D-Pad around and mashing buttons like crazy, just praying to get through it. The final upgrade you get is practically impossible to control, since it seems to have a mind of its own in terms of controller deadspace and which directions it "thinks" you wanted to double-tap.  The bottom line is that the game suffers from simplistic level and enemy design. If enemies were designed to be tough at first but then much easier to beat with each successive upgrade, there would be a sense of difficulty progression, but the game feels like a flatline item-hunt after the first couple hours. Also, the story is mostly incomprehensible, although to be fair, I haven't read all the collectible note logs. It's possible that the story does get fleshed out and has a great ending, but I personally wasn't gripped by anything the story had to offer.  That being said, I still think any self-respecting metroidvania fan ought to give Axiom Verge a go. I'd just wait for the game to go on sale.
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 132h 34m Rec Positive bloody great. just like Metroid but completely different.
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 7h 54m Rec Positive Looks like Metroid, plays like Metroid. Follows the formula; Start exploring, see something you can't interact with, find the item to interact with it and get through, repeat.   Platforming/Movement: MegaMan-like, no momentum and instant acceleration. Works well enough when the platforming isn't where the challenge is, it's the shooting. Only problem I ran into was the dash ability you eventually unlock, which is a little too sensitive. Works by double-tapping a direction, and from fidgeting on platforms, I would constantly dash myself off of them.  Combat: Easily the game's biggest strength, there are a ton of different weapons to find, and all of them are optional (apart from the first), I think. I found a use for just about every weapon at some point, which is a nice surprise given the lack of ammo/damage types that are usually present to force weapon variety. Somewhat challenging boss fights, though it helps if you have the "correct" weapon for the fight.  Story/Exploration: Story was weird enough to keep me guessing at where it was going, but interesting enough to keep me invested in what was going on. Granted, if it takes too long to progress and get to the next story beat, you might not care about the plot anymore. Nearing the end, I took about an hour and a half of backtracking to find the one room I needed, which was starting to get to me. The map would feel familiar to anyone that's played Super Metroid, with the different zones having their own look, but fitting together nicely. Trying to find secret passageways is nicely rewarded, decent total number of collectables in the world, that have immediate benefits.  Overall, I enjoyed it, recommended if you enjoy metroidvania platformers.

Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 72h 29m Rec Positive I love when a game developer can take retro feels and turn it into an innovative game.  When a game like metroid leaves you wanting more, Axiom Verge comes around and runs with it. The gameplay is great, the feeling of isolation and exploration is there, and the music really helps immerse you. Well done, guys.
Date 2015-05-17 Playtime 40h 25m Rec Positive this is one of those perfect indie titles that takes all it can from the NES classics and makes it a new game
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 14h 14m Rec Positive Took about 16 hours in normal difficulty to beat the game and got all the tools for the character. Still had plenty of weapons/health upgrades to finds, so could be quite a long game, if you are trying to find everything.  Similar game to the likes of Metroid etc., so if you are a fan of those kind of games, i think you will like this game a lot.
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 44h 23m Rec Positive This is a perfect game for anyone wanting a new game in the style of classics like Super Metroid. Clever, sometimes devious puzzles, tons of secrets, unique gameplay elements, tight controls and an incredible soundtrack. There is little to not like about this game. If it looks even remotely appealing to you, I recommend you give it a try.  I bought it initially on the PS4 because I didn't know when it was coming to PC. I liked it so much I bought it again. And I got my money's worth with over 50 hours into the game between the two versions, and I plan to keep replaying to get all the achievements.  
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 6h 16m Rec Positive I really recommend this game to anyone that loves metroid or castlevania. It is a perfect game for us that grew up with 8 and 16 bit side scrollers. 9/10
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 13h 55m Rec Positive Absolutely wonderful metroidvania-style game. The best of it's kind since Symphony of the Night.
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 13h 41m Rec Positive Like playing Super Metroid again for the first time.   10/10 would verge again
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 9h 10m Rec Positive Very good, buy it at full price it's worth it!
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 40h 42m Rec Positive This game takes you back to the age of Metroid and Castlevania. There are so many secrets and fun areas its hard to stop playing. This game a a big challenge as well but it doesn't feel like it's unfair. If you want a challenging game with lots to discover, Axiom Verge should be your next pick.
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 10h 38m Rec Positive Axiom Verge manages to encapsulate the feeling of the Metroid series but plays it safe by pretty much copying Metroid and not building on top of the proven formula. However it turned out surprisingly good for a one-man project. Not bad at all, Mr. Happ.  Axiom Verge's story is alright but nothing that will stick with you. It does start out promising but as I've uncovered more of the story, either via "cutscenes" or hidden collectable letters (an idea I always welcome), the less I cared for it. It's really hard to win me over with a story so take this information with a grain of salt.  Graphically it looks very reminiscent to Metroid and the games' overworld provides some beautiful sceneries, tho I think that fore- and background visuals often look very inconsistent. Nevertheless they get the job done and I really love the overall asthetic, right down to the garbled mess of glitchy sprites. The music is for the most part well done and greatly add to the isolating atmosphere of the game, but the instrumentation in some of the tracks can get very annoying.  There are over 20 different modules for your "Axiom Disruptor" to find, and while I haven't unlocked all of these modules yet, I've found myself only using 2 of them in my entire playthrough as both were efficient enough to destroy whatever came in front of me. Along your way through the game you will also pick up items that allow you to literally glitch through obstacles, dash or let you cling on ceilings and swing across pits "Bionic Commando-style". Player control is well done with the exception of performing dashes which require you to double-press your analog stick or digital pad to the intended direction. It often happened that I dashed without actually wanting to do that maneuver. Not only that but the analog stick control in the main menu is overly sensitive. I've played Axiom Verge with a XBOX360 controller and I'd like to hear feedback regarding this issue from other players.  Thomas Happ did a really good job with the design of the overworld. I haven't found myself stuck at any point during my playthrough despite the lack of information given to the player (as it should be). Even backtracking to locations you've already been at before doesn't feel like a chore. Secrets are very well hidden and will require some extensive searching. I'd argue that the level design is Axiom Verges' strongpoint.  And despite all the good things I have to say about this game, it somewhat lacks its own identity. It lends itself way too much to Metroid and plays it safe. And the somewhat lackluster story doesn't help to emigrate that feeling. Also I don't think that the game provides enough content for the 20€ Steam is asking for it. I think that 15€ at max are a good investment.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Axiom Verge schafft es, das Metroid-Feeling im Spiel aufkeimen zu lassen, geht aber auf Nummer sicher und kopiert Metroid lediglich, anstatt auf dem altbewährten Konzept der bekannten Reihe aufzubauen. Dennoch ist es eine respektable Leistung für ein Ein-Mann-Entwicklerteam, gute Arbeit Mr. Happ.  Die Geschichte von Axiom Verge geht in Ordnung aber es ist keine, die den meisten Spielern lange im Gedächtnis bleiben wird. Am Anfang beginnt sie vielversprechend doch je mehr von der Geschichte aufgedeckt wurde, entweder durch Cutscenes oder versteckten Notizblättern, desto weniger interessierte sie mich. Ich bin nur sehr schwer mit einer guten Videospielgeschichte zu überzeugen, daher solltet ihr meine Meinung zur Geschichte nicht zu wörtlich nehmen. Die deutsche Übersetzung ist tolerabel, einige Rechtschreibfehler gilt es zu verkraften.  Grafisch lehnt sich Axiom Verge an Metroid an und die Overworld bietet hier und da auch einige schöne Kulissen an, auch wenn es öfters vorkommt, dass Vor- und Hintergrundgrafiken oftmals sehr inkonsistent zueinander wirken. Die Ästhetik des Spiel gefällt mir sehr gut, bishin zu den grotesken Glitchgrafiken. Die Musik ist größtenteils sehr gut und verleiht der Overworld auch eine unglaublich gute Atmosphäre der Isolation. Nur wurde die Instrumentation für einige Musikstücke ünglücklich getroffen, was beim längeren Verbleib in einer bestimmten Sektion auf die Nerven gehen kann.  20 verschiedene Waffenmodule gilt es für deinen "Axiom Disruptor" zu finden. Allerdings habe ich während meines Playthroughs nur von zwei von diesen Gebrauch gemacht, da beide sich gut komplementiert haben und der Rest nicht wirklich hilfreich erschien. Außer Waffen findet man in Axiom Verge noch weitere Items, die einem ermöglichen, sich durch Wände zu glitchen, einen Dashmove auszuführen oder sich an Decken anzuhängen und über Abgründe zu schwingen, wie in "Bionic Commando". Die Steuerung wurde im Großen und Ganzen gut umgesetzt. Allerdings hatte ich das Problem, dass die Spielfigur öfters den Dashmove eingesetzt hat ohne dass ich dies auch wollte (Doppel-Tippen des Analgsticks oder Digitalpads in eine bestimme Richtung). Außerdem ist die Steuerung im Menü mittels Analogsticks viel zu empfindlich. Ich habe Axiom Verge mit einem XBOX360 Controller gespielt und würde gerne wissen, ob auch andere User die selben Probleme hatten)  Thomas Happ hat hervorragende Arbeit bei der Gestaltung der Overworld geleistet. Nicht einmal während meines gesamten Playthroughs bin ich irgendwo hängen geblieben, trotz spärlicher Informationen, die dem Spieler vorgesetzt werden (wie es auch sein sollte). Selbst das Backtracking in Areale, die man schon besucht hat, belastet nicht. Secrets sind sehr gut versteckt worden und es bedarf ein waches Auge um sie alle zu finden. Meiner Meinung nach ist das Leveldesign die größte Stärke von Axiom Verge.  Und trotz all den guten Dingen, die ich über das Spiel zu sagen habe, fehlt diesem eine eigene identität. Es lehnt sich einfach zu sehr an Metroid an und geht auf Nummer sicher. Und auch die schwache Geschichte des Spiels trägt nicht dazu bei, es vom Muster zu differenzieren. Und ich denke nicht, dass das Spiel genug Content abliefert, um die 20€ rechtfertigen zu können, die Steam für das Spiel verlangt. 15€ wären noch in Grenzen.
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 9h 36m Rec Positive This game is, on the surface, a metroid clone.  However the more you play, the more you realize that the developer made sure to give the game its own identity.  The game throws quite a few curveballs at the player and remains interesting for most of the playthrough.    The developer has also nailed the controls.  They are as perfect as they can be, you never feel you're not in control of your character, or that you died because the game didn't do what you told it to do.  My only complain would be that, although the game has an amazing weapon variety, most of the weapons end up not being used much.  I recommend this game 100% 
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 17h 28m Rec Positive Thank you for making such a great game.  it has a good difficulty setting and the Gameplay is amazing. I don't mind if the guy who made this gets rich.  Buy this game if you like Metroid. This is the stuff dreams are made of.

Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 21h 48m Rec Positive Amazing metroidvania art and gameplay. I'm constantly trying to interact with the map to find secrets and anticipating the upgrades I'm going to get based on the dead-ends I find. I'm barely getting into the storyline, but this game has been solidly keeping me busy exploring and progressing. I am against the $20 pricepoint, but you're paying for a well polished, quality 2D sidescroller rpg, if you're into that sort of thing.

Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 16h 3m Rec Positive Amazing game with a real goodretro feeling. i loved the Metroid games when i was younger, and this game comes so incredibly close to that feeling.  Great sounds and smooth gameplay with a fun story and superb ability/weapon upgrades.  Keep up the great work on this.  Would buy again 9/10

Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 0h 40m Rec Positive I've played about 10 minutes of the game. Listening to the first song on my Audiotechnicas has been blissful, nearly religious experience. I cannot wait to play more, and that experience alone was worth the $20. Cannot wait for more. I know this is a bad "review" but I cannot stress enough how good this game sounds. Not just the music, but everything. And I have very expensive headphones and I know what you're thinking: this isn't an audiophile game. But man, the way it sounds is incredible. PLAY WITH NICE HEADPHONES AND BE AMAZED.
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 8h 23m Rec Positive if metroid and castlevania had a baby on acid ..... anyway: great game, sick soundtrack .. the immense amount of work Thomas Happ put it his game is plainly visible .. a true labor of love, retro in all the good ways  the colors hurt the eyes a little at times but i believe that is an acceptable price of admission  I wholeheartedly recommend this game
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 10h 35m Rec Positive An above average Metroid-like game. It's got a lot of flaws (forgettable boss battles, control issues with some of the mobility upgrades you find, no real reason to utilize the tons of weapons you can get), but it's okay because it's still fun to explore the world you're given. The exploration is the real seller.  7/10
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 20h 15m Rec Positive A great tribute to Nintendo's [i]Metroid[/i] series. Just about everything in the game is perfect, the controls are responsive and the game engine is well optimized on the Mac (my fans don't kick on during this game).  The only thing I don't like about the gameplay is that the grappling claw doesn't maintain swing velocity, this makes swinging counter-intuative and difficult.
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 25h 34m Rec Positive it's like they made another metroid for nes. game owns, real good soundtrack too
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 15h 30m Rec Positive This is the best metroid game I've played since Shadow Complex.  I feel like it could be unfair to compare a 2D pixel-based game to a 3D one, however both Axiom Verge and Shadow Complex were created to take the very best core mechanics from metroid games (notably super metroid) and apply their own spin on them.  Where Shadow Complex was 2.5D, Axiom Verge's alteration focuses on having a wide variety of weapons, each more useful in different scenarios. With multiple collectables upgrades for health, weapon damage, range, projectile size, and various special upgrades, the game's structure plays out with the exact same progression as a metroid game. The most interesting gameplay mechanic comes from a sort of 'virus' that appears to plague the planet you are present on, and it is represented as game corruption (the kind you get when you don't put a game cartridge all the way in or run a rom through a corruptor). There's even a weapon upgrade that allows you to corrupt tiles and enemies with various, and sometimes bizzare, results.  The music is very solid, and while the graphical fidelity may be lower due to using pixel art, there is enough in the way of modern particle effects and distortion to make the game feel visually polished. Sadly, while the story is interesting enough, the main character is fairly forgettable, but Axiom Verge isn't a story driven game in any capacity, so this doesn't hurt the game much, if at all.  This game is of course not as polished as an actual metroid title, but is well worth playing, and at the very least has rightfully earned my 20 dollars.
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 17h 41m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a good game in the vein of Metroid/Super Metroid with Castlevania-esque graphics circa 1990. It's rather impressive for a title made by one person, but it's not without faults. The gameplay itself is very tight and enjoyable, and the story, while sort of predictable, is interesting to a point. There's a ton of upgrades to obtain, and many of them are optional. One thing I do like is that most upgrades boost the stats of all of your weapons, including damage, bullet size and range. This is an excellent way to make weapons feel less useless throughout the game, but the problem is there's so many weapons that you'll likely only use a handful of them. I think I had around 13 or so, and I kept defaulting to the best ones, some of which are from the first quarter or third of the game.  Secrets are kind of interesting, as while there's a lot of secrets that are the same playthrough to playthrough, some of them, the secret worlds that look more retro and glitchy than the rest of the game, are randomized. You get 5 of them, and one of them is supposed to contain a strong weapon. Unfortunately I couldn't ever find the secret world with the weapon in it, but it's a really cool idea.  The game has an interesting "speed run mode" where it'll put time stamps on killing bosses and automatically skip text and cutscene stuff, so that's pretty cool if you're into speed runs.  I guess the only other gripe I have besides there being a state of weapon overload, some of the level design could be more interesting. Much of this could be chalked up to the NES style, what with the blocky setting, but many of the underground areas lack their own gimmick to make the areas feel more separate. Also, I guess another extra thing on top of it is the last boss is really unsatisfying. Like, RNG bad. You are basically trading hits until it's over, so if you don't have a ton of upgrades or the flamethrower it's going to be rough (beware low %!). It's really up to if you get health drops or not, which sometimes you get absolutely fucked on. Not really a great way to close off an otherwise really fun experience.  All of this aside, I still feel like it's $20 well spent, though I'm highly biased toward Metroidvania titles. There's a lot of fantasy themed Metroidvanias to pick from (Chasm, Valdis Story, UnEpic, and eventually Bloodstained) but not really many sci-fi ones. Axiom Verge would be in the top selections of what you can get on Steam in the sci-fi variety without question, but it may not be as deep of a Metroidvania compared to some of the fantasy ones. A good title, but probably not a "must play" for everyone.
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 16h 46m Rec Positive Incredible. Inspired by the classic Metroid games, and meeting their quality, Axiom Verge will have you getting lost in it's depths searching for items and secrets and then finding your way out again. And there's a lot to be found here, it took me 13 hours to complete with 85% items found my first time through... but the Steam integrated speedrunning leaderboards tell me it can be done in an hour!  Absolutely recommended for anyone who loves a good platforming run and gun shooter.
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 76h 10m Rec Positive I cannot recommend this game enough. we've been waiting years for a game like this. the music, the gameplay, the adventure, the exploration, the sense of discovery, they are all alive and well in this love letter to Metroid. the formula is tried and true, but has been refined and updated at the same time.   Take notice, Nintendo.(and all other devs for that matter),  Gamers still want this.  Also, Trace might be Gordon Freeman with vocal cords. not sure yet.
Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 22h 10m Rec Positive The feeling reminds me of when I saw the first Matrix movie in theaters for the first time. It combined everything I loved into one grand work of art. If I were to make a movie, that would have been it at the time. This game is the video game equivalent. It feels like it was made personally for me.    Metroid + H.R. Giger + Eric Chahi's Another World with a pulsing electronic score. It doesn't get any better than this.

Date 2015-05-16 Playtime 17h 56m Rec Negative      The story in this game is lackluster at best and annoying at worst. I played a good amount of it, and was nothing but annoyed and frustrated the entire time.       There's little fun to be had here if you don't have a significant amount of patience for a game aping at Metroid, but without all of the actual interesting parts of Metroid. I played and loved all of the Metroid games, this is not that, not even close.       Don't believe the hype and wait for a sale. I feel this game is definitely not worth $20, and I'd not find any fun in it even if it were free. There are better free games out there.  The game has good art and style, and the way that the character abilities is atypical for the genre, but that doesn't make them good. They're not, they feel mushy and imprecise. The nice art can't make up for bad gameplay.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 55h 13m Rec Positive Ce jeu est un incontournable pour tous les fans des Metroid 2D. Il en reprend l'essentiel sans pour autant tomber dans la simple copie paresseuse, et se permet d'y apporter des originalités de gameplay très plaisantes, un scénario totalement différent (plus confu et spirituel) et une atmosphère plus froide, plus glauque et plus crade (très biomécanique dans l'âme).  En bref, on retrouvera tout ce qui a fait le succès des Metroid, mais dans une toute autre ambiance et une toute autre histoire.  Je n'irai pas jusqu'à dire que l'élève dépasse le maître, loin de là, mais on n'a jamais été aussi proche. Il faut dire aussi que c'est le premier à s'y être frotté de si près, et son audace paye.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 6h 47m Rec Positive  There was a time when ‘Metroidvania’ titles were flooding the market. Recent trends have a seen a move towards the super hard ‘Rogue-like’ game and with no new Castlevania or Metroid on the horizon gamers have been at a loss as to how to scratch their map filling itch. But fear not because Axiom Verge is here and it’s a little big special.  The brain child of one man studio Tom Happ, the game follows the long twisting story of a scientist who awakens in a strange world after he dies in an accident. It’s certainly closer to Metroid than Castlevania but there’s also enough of a difference to not make it seem like one of those carbon copy knock offs you used to get called things like Poc-Man or Space Invaded. Considering the lack of this type of game around at the minute and the fact the last proper 2D Metroid was back on the Gameboy Advance there’s certainly a gap in the market.  If you’re not familiar with this type of game then let us explain. In Axiom Verge you explore and leap around the various landscapes shooting monsters and looking for useful objects. Upgrades normally give you a new move of some kind. In this case the first few you find add a drill for destroying certain types of wall, a high jump and shift scrambler thing. These objects then allow bypassing of certain obstacles and exploring further. You basically keep going until you meet a boss or hit an area where you clearly need something to progress and it’s wonderfully addictive as your little map constantly updates and fills out the layout of the areas.  Of course, you have to want to explore and Axiom Verge does a good job of keeping you locked into it. The environments are beautifully realised in their old school pixel style and each area has a unique look and characteristic. Enemy types also vary widely from area to area and the accompanying musical score sets the scene perfectly. The game also does a good job of keeping interesting looking things just about out of sight so you are always intrigued to go back later and see what they are.  The bosses you come up against start off large and proceed to get bigger and badder as the game progresses. They all require decent dexterity and brain power to overcome and this is a throwback to the shoot the 'glowing weak spot’ of old days. We didn’t come across anything crushingly difficult but you do need to be your toes. The difficulty level in general is set just about right. There is the odd spike here and there but our exploration was never stopped for too long. It can be annoying to be sent back a long way to the last save point but you do keep your exploration progress.  The save points are spread around each area and see our hero entering a pod which regenerates their health. These aren’t exactly everywhere so you do have been careful when exploring as there can be a bit of distance between them. We did find this a little frustrating to begin with but once we found a few upgrades it became much less of an issue. The one thing we really would have liked to have seen is the ability to teleport between save points. It was the developer’s choice not to integrate this but it would have solved the frustration of realising you need to be all the way over on the other side of the map.  There isn’t much hand holding here either. Don’t expect map markers of flashing squares to guide you to where you need to go. We didn’t really have much issue with this as you nearly always have to go to the bit you haven’t been able to explore yet so it wasn’t exactly rocket science to work out what to do next most of the time. If you do find something that looks interesting the PC version now allows you to drop a little reminder marker there for you to come back to later.  Level design is strong throughout, which is good as there’s a serious chunk of game to get through here. It’s massively impressive to think this has been created by a one person team as it has the production values and feel of something made by a much bigger collection of people. It’s filled with moments that you’ll remember and it seems to have been so carefully created that you can’t help but marvel at what has been achieved at times.  Overall, Axiom Verge is a highly impressive game. It remains original enough while playing off core values of classic games to keep away feelings that you’ve seen it all before. It offers up surprises and fun new things to play with at regular intervals and gives players some big beasties to test themselves against. It’s a well thought-out game that has moments of genuine brilliance among a core of all round good design. It’s very easy to recommend this to fans of the genre as there hasn’t been a Metroidvania this good since Zero Mission.  Overall 8/10  http://www.retro101.co.uk/2015/05/axiom-verge-review-pc.html

Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 12h 19m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is 2D Metroidlike/Metroidvania is as much a love letter to games like Metroid and games of it's era such as Contra and Bionic Commando as it is a solid entry into the genre all it's own. Developed entirely by Thomas Happ (including the soundtrack) you can tell that every element of this game has a huge amount of passion behind it and love for the games that it's so heavily based on. I go into more detail in my video review but suffice it to say Axiom Verge is a quality, but imperfect entry into the Metroid like/vania genre.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtGqWbr8u8E&list=PLdz5FE73bTSr5t1iw3tNP5NbrH7GxExgU&index=1

Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 47h 3m Rec Positive This is the closest you will ever get to experiencing Super Metroid again. The story is intriguing enough without being intrusive. The game evolves constantly as you continue to discover new items and upgrades that change how you traverse the world and fight enemies.  Metroid vets will rejoice at constantly being surprised by the game's setting up your expectations and taking a hard left turn. Who needs a morph ball? Not I.  If you're a fan of side scrollers, dungeon crawlers or just plain exploration of an emerging and ever changing world this game will grip you for hours and hours.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 10h 32m Rec Positive Axiom Verge and it's world is just breath-taking in it's deliver. It really brings back recent memories of me playing Metroid Fusion, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, Super Metroid and old memories of playing Metroid Prime. I beat Metroid Prime, never beat the others, also wish I had, but this game feels fresh compared to those. Above all that, I just can't wait to get access to the Glitch gun. Thomas Happ took an idea that I thought of, but never could make a reality and did just that...for this I applaud him. He is a man I will gladly support with my money and game appreciation.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 22h 19m Rec Positive A love letter to metroid that vastly outshines its inspirational material.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 40h 3m Rec Positive I am thoroughly enjoying this game. It is very will written and the game play mechanics are very well thought out.  The story gives you information just often enough to keep you engaged without being giant walls of text.  I did a full 45 minute review over here. https://youtu.be/M47EOXvpsYM
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 9h 36m Rec Positive XBOXコントローラー使用。キーコンフィグ可。 難易度はノーマルとハードがありノーマルでプレイ。 ゲーム起動時にロード時間は殆ど無い。  約9時間でクリア。（MAP90％ITEM66％） トレーラーを見て期待した通りの出来で面白い。 MAPに次の目的地の印などはつかないが、 新しく手に入れたアイテムを利用していけば進んでいける。 英語のストーリーは読み飛ばしているが問題なく楽しんでいる。  ショットはどれも8方向に打てる。 ロックキーが地味に便利。（押してる間移動せず方向のみを変えられる）  不満点は、 ・エリア間の移動が若干めんどう。 　セーブポイント同士を移動できても良かったと思う。 ・ボスのグラフィックはすごいが、あまり動かず 　中・長距離で弾を撃ってくるだけなボスが多いのでやや単調。 ・移動キー2回の短距離テレポートが使いにくい。 　ボタンひとつで使えるのであれば使いやすかったと思う。 　キーコンフィグではボタン配置の変更のみなので改善できない。 　テレポートがないと攻撃がかわせないボスはしんどかった。  少々の不満はあるが丁寧に作られていてオススメできるゲーム。
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 24h 31m Rec Positive If you're looking for a Metroid-like game that doesn't hold your hand or tell you where to go, with a good amount of enemy/weapon/item variety, great music that has a nice full, modern sound to it (as opposed to the retro chip-tunes type stuff), and controls that feel just right, then Axiom Verge is for you. This is as close as I'll probably ever get to having a Metroid game on Linux (ROMs notwithstanding); although familiar, it still manages to feel like its own unique game.  I was hesitant to drop the $22 CAD on it on launch day, but after playing over 4 hours that night, I feel it was certainly worth it. I'm nowhere close to being done, and I'm totally lost at this point. It's great!
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 9h 17m Rec Positive Et bien, quel titre ! Je dois en être à deux heures de jeu, et je les ai fait d'une traite.  - Level-design excellent, très instinctif. - Graphisme retro marqué (qualité nes+) mais ça colle parfaitement sans faire dans le "non mais le retro-gaming c'est tendance, t'as vu ...", je ne peux pas m'empêcher de voir du HR Giger, et j'adore ça. - Scénaristiquement : Un savant mélange d'un metroid + half-life, j'ai été conquis dès la troisième seconde. C'est vraiment prenant. - Ovation particulière pour les musiques : style 8bit mais composition très bonne, variée, propre, inspirée ...   Un titre qui coûte un peu plus que la plupart de mes achats, mais le feeling ressenti à la vidéo s'est avéré être exact. Un excellent titre qui vous plonge dans un monde extrêmement riche et typé. Ca fait longtemps que je cherche un titre comme ça ; fan de metroid, fonce.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 2h 15m Rec Positive What can I say? A really true to style game.  Imagine a SNES with 8gigs of RAM, game runs so smooth and various effects populating  the screen at once! 10/10!   Pick it up If you like speedrunning games.. Or jus games in general =)
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 1h 26m Rec Positive Neat game so far, terrible music.  Music so bad it gives me an instant headache.  Music so bad I turned if off so I could give the review a thumbs up.  If not prepared to turn the music off or play other music while you play, be prepared for possible disappointment regarding the music.  TL/DR  Game good, music BAD!
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 17h 34m Rec Positive Heavily inspired by Super Metroid and friends, but that's not a bad thing at all. It only gets weirder (and more awesome) from there.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 8h 19m Rec Positive lo mas cercano a metroid que podrás jugar para PC, excelente juego
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 7h 23m Rec Positive It's like the rebirth of Super Metroid. And that's a great thing! Beautifully designed. Gave plenty of room for exploration just like Metroid. The only problem I have is some of the 8-bit music is a little uneasy on the ears. I get this is going for the nestaligic look, but the music could use a small upgrade. Otherwise, I would recommend this game to anyone who grew up with Super Metroid.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 46h 8m Rec Positive If you liked the old 2D Metroid games, you'll like this.  Wait at least a few days before getting it, though.  There are some game-stopping bugs, and the dev's patching them as fast as he can.  Once those are fixed, it'll be an incredible game.  I'm putting a Yes for my recommendation since I doubt those bugs are long for this world.  Some people actually complained about the graphics, but they're supposed to look that way.  That's the chosen art-style.  It's not cheaping out.  We like it.  Retro-styled graphics are somewhat popular these days.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 15h 7m Rec Positive --UPDATED-- A modern day take on a classic NES platformer made nearly 30 years ago? Yes please! Surprisingly there are very few retro metroidvania games that exist on Steam, so the erection experienced was fierce when I found out that Axiom Verge was making a appearance.  On a more serious note... As a whole this game is rather impressive, with nice environments to explore, pleasing musics to be heard, crisp and responsive controls to be played and quality pixel are to be seen. But if we were to dissect Axiom Verge and take a closer look at our samples we will start to find a couple of flaws.   This peculiar world is big and vast but has many empty areas which aren't fully utilised; it seems like there are a few too many pointless areas and places which act like filler or a waste of space. But, you find a tool called the "Address Disruptor" which can be used to disintegrate certain walls and bring platforms into existence. While altering the environment it also has a effect on the creatures as well. Some of them can be altered to allow you to access new areas you originally couldn't get too. A little creature that shoots beams at you will transform and instead shoot enemies or blow up walls, while a floating ball can be made more solid and ridden on to allow you to get to hard to reach places. Very neat and fun addition to the game.  While the boss designs are brilliant, they really lack any form of difficulty and each fight so far seems to be underwhelming and unrewarding. (The biggest downfall IMO but maybe this might be better on the hard difficulty) For example you fight this one guy who is absolutely huge and intimidating, but the entire fight is spent standing behind a wall and peaking out shots between his attacks. Another fight I spent the entire time crouched down spamming my weapon fire while the boss just sent shots over my head. So far I have 1 shot all bosses and they are quite lame fights to be honest :(  Conclusion This is starting to sound like a negative review but it truly isn't. When you put all the pieces together the game shines as a fun and addicting platformer that I can really see myself sinking a lot of time into. Sometimes I feel I need to do something more productive with the time given to me. But I can't resist it when you have game developers/music producers like Thomas Happ, who with tender love and care create absolute quality games by sinking their heart and soul into them. While it's not without its flaws, I can't recommend this game enough to every gamer who likes to dabble in retro platforming goodness.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 7h 58m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a fantastic castle-metroid-'em-up.  It hides its secrets in really cool ways. Weapons are fun, unique and plentiful. Great soundtrack and artwork. Made by a single dude.  Its only flaws are totally forgivable; namely, the main character is a dweeb and some of the boss fights aren't so hot. But Axiom Verge delivers on everything else it aspires to be.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 28h 31m Rec Positive Pretty damn great, but unfortunately isn't able to quite live up to the quality of it's source material in terms of design, although it could never really have hoped to. Still well worth the purchase though.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 2h 4m Rec Positive Game Informer did a story about this game some time back which made me curious. I'm glad I got it, even though I just started I really like the feel of it.  Makes me miss the good ol` days when the original Nintendo was coming out with new games.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 4h 15m Rec Positive YES.  ABSOLUTELY, A MILLION TIMES YES, THIS GAME IS WORTH IT.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 9h 15m Rec Positive Awesome game, metroidvanian but no stealing from it...assisting it.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 4h 0m Rec Positive Finally a game I can get my Metroid fix with! Thanks and keep them coming. Im so sick of multiplayer FPS games. What every happened to good old single player awesomeness!
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 2h 7m Rec Positive buy it now!!!!!
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 33h 59m Rec Positive Great game, glad it came to steam as I do not own a PS4.  The couple of reviews knocking the stability of the game need to be ignored, it is not the game, I have nearly 9 hours in and not a single issue with coding / bugs / crashes / stability.  They need to upgrade some computer parts or something.....
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 14h 33m Rec Positive Everything about this game is masterfully done.  It's like Christmas come early!
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 23h 46m Rec Positive I can unequivocally recommend this game.   This is, without contest, one of the best metroidvania's that I have played in recent years.  It's not perfect, but it hit's all the right notes.  The bosses start off strong and kind of go down hill, and the secret finding is kind of clumsy brute force at times, but this game will not disappoint.  If this guy puts out more games, IGA will be given a run for his money in making Bloodstained a return to form.  Granted, this is more Metroid than Castelvania, but it's good.
Date 2015-05-15 Playtime 13h 39m Rec Positive Review updated  Fantastic Game! Full of great, responsive Metroidvania gameplay. Very close feel to Metroid, without seeming like a clone. Great ascetics and atmosphere. Menu systems are great, as are the map and weapon systems.    Gameplay: Controls are very tight, and I highly suggest that you play this one with a PS3/PS4 controller. Having the dpad in the main spot and the precision of the gamepad is vital near the end of the game, where you use one of your swifter moves and require precise use of it (or at least I did to stay alive) during the final battle. Doing this double tap Left/Right with a joystick is ok at first, but it is very difficult near the end.  The weapons are fantastic, and I implore you to find them all. Each weapon as it's great strengths, even if they felt miniscule in the final few rooms, where the enemies are quite tough. Superb selection. Movement is tight, and I very much loved how responsive the game was.    Story: Stunning, while you are in a place that you don't understand, the alien story is nice and simple, while leaving ambiguity in droves, even after the end of the game. Smells like a sequel :)  While games like this (due to ADHD) tend to make me only play in small bursts at first, man, was I HOOKED near 2nd half of the game, going after every nook and cranny of each map section. Even though I took time to explore every area I could, I ended up with a 90% map completion, and a 60% item completion. Maybe I will come back at some point to see what else can find.  Great game if you are a fan of Metroidvania-type games.   OS: SteamOS Video Driver: Nvidia, proprietary Card: Nvidia GTX 970 SC CPU: Intel i5 @ 3.4 GHz HDD: Seagate SSHD RAM: 8 GB DDR3 Launch issues: none, fluid and works well. Music: PHENOMENAL, pulse pounding, great bass Menu system (main), very good, buttons fully configurable, nice aesthetic, dpad + thumbsticks work Pause menu - nice quick access to controls to do on the fly button swaps. Controls: responsive Visually looks great Well animated for it's style Capped at 60 FPS it seems, and it runs great.

Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 11h 52m Rec Positive This is one of the best modern Metroidvanias I have ever played, hands down!
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 14h 17m Rec Positive Axiom Verge, the spiritual successor to Metroid 3 now released on Steam! After the huge success and fanbase that started growing on PS4, the developers decided to port it to the PC, which is in my eyes a very smart step.  Lets talk about the game for a minute. (My opinion on about 60+ hours on PS4)  Axiom Verge is a exploration-adventureish game similiar to Metroid games, or how alot of people call those type of games, Metroidvania. You wake up in a incubator egg, not knowing where you are, and all you get is a weapon to defend yourself. Explore, collect, fight and die in this brilliant gem, until you see the ending screen after about 8-12 hours depending on how well you do (I honestly took 18 hours on my first attempt back on PS4), and you probably want more. Why?  For once, it is very rewarding getting all the weapons, seeing all the notes and reading them to learn more about the story and find the secret areas, that are RANDOMLY placed every time you start a new game and the areas itself are randomized too. Upgrades you find will not count towards the item collection rate so they are optional, but weapons and upgrades you can get there are neat aswell.  I would give this game easily 94%. Why not more? Because there are minor things that aren't so well done. For instance some mechanics in the game (not spoiling for you) are weird to perform (double forward for instance), which could've been done better on a seperate button. Also the german translation is horrible, this should not concern most of you but for me it is a minor flaw.  I suggest all of you grab it and play instantly, its well worth it!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED GAME!
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 1h 59m Rec Positive Für den Mut alleine schon hat der Entwickler eine positive Rezession verdient! Im Zeitalter von (vermeindlich) tollen AAA+ Spielen, die sich alle gleich spielen, SO ein mainstreamuntaugliches 2D Spiel zu veröffentlichen grenzt an selbstüberschätzung oder einfach an Überzeugtheit.  Und genau hier sind wir richtig: Das Spiel ist ein Genuss für jeden Metroid und Castlevania Liebhaber, da es genau so ein Spiel nun mal ist! Es spielt sich wie ein NES/SNES Spiel und könnte absolut auch eins sein (im positiven Sinn!).   Ich habe zwar noch nicht so viel gesehen aber, das Gesehene reicht mir um zu sagen, dass sich die Wartezeit von fast 3 Jahren (bei mir) gelohnt haben.  DANKE DANKE :-*
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 11h 13m Rec Positive This game is amazing. Its like Metroid yeah but honestly at some points it surpasses it. All the weapons, Gadgets and enemies are unique. Always upgrading, always improving. And the soundtrack... MMMM, I LOVE IT! And small things from a button to lock you in place so you can shoot anywhere without falling off a platform, to that normally annoying low health beeping sound being synced up to its current background music makes me curtain that this game needs all the money you can spare.
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 16h 8m Rec Positive Old statement: I was really looking forward to play this game. Unfortunately, it crashes immediately after starting up (one second of sound is audible, then a white rectangle indicating the error). Too bad - it's is terrible to release a buggy product like this. I thought that this was only happening to Assassin's Creed these days :-(  New statement: After a few updates in the game, it finally works fine for me. Thanks a lot for the effort; so far, I love the game! Rating updated.
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 13h 53m Rec Positive This is it. This is the Metroid game we have been craving for a very long time. Thomas Happ has given us an astounding, beautiful, and at times, challenging game. I had been excited about AV since I first heard of it, and it's finally here. This game is absolutely phenomenal, from the music to the bizarre and ominous aesthetic, to the level and boss design (I've downed 2 bosses thus far), this game is PHENOMENAL. I can't recommend it highly enough.  That said, I would recommend changing some of the controls if you're on a keyboard. I changed Jump to "L" and Shoot to "P", and that has worked out very well for me.  **EDIT**  I have just finished the game. My god. This game is incredible. It is just my level of difficult--challenging, but not frustrating, and the backtracking is painless, especially compared to other metroidvania games I have played recently and been unnecessarily frustrated with.   Thomas Happ did something very special here. My excitement leading up to the game's release has been absolutely justified.  I'm calling it: Indie Game of the Year.
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 49h 51m Rec Positive I looove this game! I am a big fan of detailed sci-fi designs and this game is it!
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 16h 56m Rec Positive So far I am really enjoying this game.  For those of you who enjoyed the old school Nintendo games, this definitely will bring back that same nostalgic feeling, but it still feels like a new game with great, tight controls.  Furthermore, I have played for over 10 hours and still have not finished it, so it's not going to disappoint because it's too short.  Excellent music... Excellent action... Excellent game...
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 3h 26m Rec Positive Great game, As massive fan of Metroid (Super Metroid being my favourite game of all time) This is probably as close as we will get to Metroid since Nintendo seem to be taking quite some time to get another game out!   It's simple. If you like Metroid you will like this.
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 6h 36m Rec Positive This game is a perhaps the greatest modern love letter to metroid - or perhaps a love child - to date. Tom happ made this by himself over 5 years, Coding - artwork - music, everything! an extraordinary feat with great execution, I feel if this game was made before metroid we'd be calling things AxiomVania instead. He manages the formula perfectly.  While it may be more on the side of metroid then it is vania, its a fantastic game well worth your money if you are a great lover of this genre. Progression runs smoothly and swiftly as you are constantly finding weapons, items and abilities that unlock the previously restricted areas and with a notice marker added to the map to help remind you of those secrets you couldn't reach in the previous areas.  So far from what I've played the story seems to play out a bit slowly gaining information from characters in "broken english" making it all the more enjoyable to decipher - unless you hate that kind of thing.  Here's a not so eloquently put Review/Gameplay - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgaB0ogHG0Q  The man deserves your money for realsies.
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 4h 9m Rec Negative First of all, the game crashed after a few seconds every time i would start it. Disabling the Steam in-game overlay and setting launcher option -force-opengl helped. This would be somewhat acceptable in early access, but having to debug a fully released game for 20$ is just embarrassing. The log4net config is broken, too, so the log files are empty and don't give any hint. I will compare to Super Metroid, because Axiom Verge is such a blatant clone of it. The game itself: + good mechanics + clever weapons and tools + soundtrack, but not coming close to Metroid Cons: - The most important part of Super Metroid: Level design. Levels are really, really boring in Axiom Verge and not atmospheric, with few exceptions. Most of the time, tile colors change. - Plot is clever, but the storytelling is horrible - Exploration feels ... unrewarding (see level design), except for frequent items.  Developer should have taken some steps back and consider what aspects made Super Metroid a timeless classic. The actual effort in Axiom Verge is the game engine - it's a good Super Metroid engine.  Would buy for 5$ on sale, not worth 20$ at all.
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 15h 10m Rec Positive Awesome, long time Metroid fan, couldn't ask for anything more - it aint fully Metroid but it is as close as you will get until they make a new Metroid 2D game (3DS rumors this year!).   On difficulty: Not easy, not hard - unless you choose hard: You will be biting your nails, just like it should be. Awesome speedrunning options and global leaderboards.  Music: Good soundtrack, not as good as Super Metroid but I dont think anyone will ever make a more atmospheric 2D platformer than Super Metroid, a good secound place to Axiom Verge.  Plot: Awesome, told in a good way.  Enjoy!
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 10h 53m Rec Positive For any Metroidvania fan this is a must buy!
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 25h 5m Rec Positive Let’s start by saying Axiom Verge is essentially a Metroid Game… and it is a very good one. As a massive fan of the series it pains me that Nintendo have not released a proper 2D Metroid game in 11 years (none of this Prime nonsense) but Axiom Verge really is the closest you are going to get.  After an experiment of yours goes South you wake up in a strange world called Sudra. It’s a strange world not too dissimilar to the planet Zebes and this doesn’t seem to bother the games Protagonist Trace one bit… But we’ll overlook that. The game’s plot is interesting and engaging and remind me slightly of indie hit “The Swapper”.  The game sees you travel across the world guarded by large mechanical beings known as the Rusulka. These beings are your eyes and ears and guide you across the planet. Without giving away any plot elements these being form a key part of Axiom Verge’s plot. The game emphasises exploration much like the Metroid games of old and it draws you in as you want to push further and further into its twists and caverns. One thing where the game does differ from the Metroid Franchise is the emphasis on different guns. Each of the guns allow slightly different attacks and excel in different situations… think the guns in Contra and you have a good idea what to expect.  There are other equipment to find that opens up new parts of the map such as a laser drill lets you drill through rock opening up new paths and secrets, a grappling hook with a striking resemblance to the one from Bionic Commando and right about the time you expect to get the morph ball you get access to a drone that you can set through small space and eventually teleport to.  One of the games key stand out features however is its glitch mechanic. Early in the game you acquire a gun called the Address Disruptor. The device can corrupt enemies and make them glitch out. This allows enemies to be converted to another form which may make them attackable, give out health or let you stand on them. There are loads of cool things to find and using this gun makes the game seem like a breath of fresh air. It also allows you to access secret areas that contain some of the game’s best weapons but these secret areas change every play through.  The Save system in the game works well. There are save points scattered across the land which you teleport back to if you die. What is helpful is that you do not lose any of you gear that you have gained since you last save point. This helpful mechanic makes dying less painful as it tends to happen quite a lot.  The game isn’t perfect. Some of the controls are fiddly and do not always seem to work as expected and obviously forget playing it with anything but an Xbox game pad. Another small issue is some of the enemies seem a little odd and do not really fit the rest of the game (the swirly flower things particularly come to mind).  The sound design however is fantastic and the background music in each zone really helps set them apart from one another.  All in all the game took me about 15 hours to get through and even then I had only found 72% of items and 95% of the map (sod the tops of tall rooms). What makes this amazing game even more remarkable is the fact it is made by one man. Tom Happ has created Axiom Verge all alone and this really stands as a testament to what is achievable. Axiom Verge is the best Metroidvania game this century and apart from the 2 standouts of the genre Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night this really is the best of the best.

Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 0h 26m Rec Positive A great game oozing in Metroid slime. Interesting weapons and powerups and a great soundtrack too. My only real gripe is the dialogue, but that's really a minor issue. Definitely for fans of the Metroidvanias.
Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 28h 54m Rec Positive [h1]Uma homenagem aos clássicos metroidvania, trazendo aquele gostinho nostálgico junto com suas inovações em um universo vasto à ser explorado.[/h1]  [b]Axiom Verge[/b] é um jogo de plataforma sidescroller sci-fi, mas também pode ser conhecido como [i]MetroidVania[/i]. Um verdadeiro sinônimo de nostalgia pura dos clássicos dos anos 80 e 90. Inspirado diretamente em [b]Metroid[/b], Axiom Verge traz toda a diversão dos clássicos da geração mas não deixando de ter suas próprias inovações que se encaixam perfeitamente ao game. O jogo foi desenvolvido em 5 anos pelo desenvolvedor independente [b]Thomas Happ[/b], o jogo nasceu para brilhar, o sucesso foi imediato. Axiom Verge foi bastante aguardado e lançado com uma exclusividade temporária para o Playstation 4 no final de Março deste ano. Tom Happ foi sempre muito aberto com a comunidade, fazendo sempre atualizações sobre o jogo em seu blog oficial, chegando até a desabafar algumas semanas após o lançamento do jogo no PS4 pela morte de seu querido cachorro, que trocaria todo o sucesso do jogo para ter seu amigo de volta. Axiom Verge é sem duvidas um dos melhores indies de 2015 e uma inspiração de um trabalho feito pela paixão aos jogos.  [h1]GRÁFICOS[/h1]  Os gráficos deste jogo vão te levar de volta ao tempo do [b]Nintendinho[/b]. A inspiração nos clássicos jogos do vídeo-game beira ao incrível com arte e design perfeitos. A limitação dos vídeo-game na época causava bugs gráficos nos jogos, como os famosos flickering que causava falhas em pixels. E Tom Happ brinca com esse defeito da época implementando no jogo essas “falhas” como uma brincadeira usando no cenário e até para chegar em áreas secretas.  [h1]JOGABILIDADE[/h1]  Um mundo gigante para ser explorado com um sistema de [i]backtracking[/i] faz da jogatina em Axiom Verge passar fácil das 10 horas. Sem contar as vastas áreas secretas que contém notas ligando na história do jogo. A ambientação do jogo também foi inspirada em Metroid, com cenários e monstros sci-fi. Os acessórios do jogo não é pequeno com uma grande quantia de armas para ser usada que vai de furadeiras para alcançar áreas e até armas para hackear inimigos. A versão para PC ainda conta com um mapa no inventário que não contém na versão de PS4.  [h1]HISTÓRIA[/h1]  O enredo de [b]Axiom Verge[/b] é de mistério total. Um cientista chamado [b]Trace[/b] foi transportado à outro mundo/dimensão após o fracasso em um experimento. Trace sem saber onde está e ou que fazer é auxiliado por [b]Elsenova[/b], uma inteligência artificial. O jogo é completamente traduzido para o português do Brasil (e muito bem feita) deixando a experiência completa ao jogo.  [h1]TRILHA SONORA[/h1]  Como já dito, Axiom Verge foi desenvolvido por apenas uma pessoa, e a maioria dos jogos quando são desenvolvidos por uma pessoa só, tem sua trilha sonora feita à parte por outra pessoa, uma banda ou similar. Em Axiom Verge a trilha também saiu das mãos de [b]Thomas Happ[/b]. A trilha sonora é o complemento nostálgico com músicas cativantes e viciantes. Você pode ouvi-las clicando [url=http://axiomverge.bandcamp.com/releases]aqui[/url].  [h1]CONTRIBUIÇÃO AO GÊNERO[/h1]  [b]Axiom Verge[/b] é uma homenagem linda aos clássicos, assim como [b]Rogue Legacy[/b] e [b]Shovel Knight[/b] faz. O jogo é um dos melhores do ano e merece ser jogado!

Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 1h 25m Rec Positive Jetzt ist es schon ein paar Tage her, als wir 1994 mit ein paar Freunden Super Metroid auf dem SNES an einem Abend durchgespielt haben. Es war ein Fest, als wir am frühen Morgen den Endboss mit regenbogenfarbenen Schüssen ins Jenseits befördert hatten. Die wenn auch sehr kurze Zeit, die ich jetzt Axiom Verge anzocken durfte, hat sofort die Erinnerungen an die gute alte Zeit zurück gebracht. Das Spiel hat eine präzise Steuerung, ein schickes Level Design und eine deutsche Übersetzung. Der Soundtrack, der an die alten NES Tage erinnert, könnte gerade den etwas jüngeren Zockern auf Dauer nervig werden. Aber es ist halte der gute alte 8-bit Sound, der gerade mir besonders gut gefällt und einfach zum Spiel passt. Für jeden, der die Zeit als Nintendo noch für puren Spielspass stand mit gemacht hat, ist dieses Spiel sehr zu empfehlen. Alle anderen die auf Jump n Runs stehen, sollten sich von der schlichten Grafik nicht abhalten lassen ;)  Anbei ein Video aus meiner "angezockt!" Reihe, die einen ersten Eindruck vermitteln soll. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1qyVPz4fWc

Date 2015-05-14 Playtime 26h 8m Rec Positive Axiom Verge is a 2D metroidvania style game developed solely by Thomas Happ and it is the closest thing to the original Metroid I have ever played in years. Not only that, but also an excellent example of how you need to make a game inspired by original Metroid. Axiom Verge has very similar design and gameplay, but improves upon every aspect of them to make something really unique and at the same time very recognizable to make you feel at home.  Just like in Metroid games, there's a huge map you need to explore with unique areas and enemies in each of them. There's also a lot of secrets and hidden stuff to find including new weapons, story related notes and even random secret worlds which you can explore, each of which contains items and even unique weapon which is not available in the world map and not that easy to find. The game also has decryption device which not only can help you uncover hidden areas and Items, but also glitch some portions of the map to clear the way to the next area or even glitch enemies which can clear it for you or can fight for you in certain situations (this won't work during boss battles though). And if that's not enough, the game has a ton of unique weapons to suit your play style (22 or something in total including hidden ones) and variety of different abilities which can help you fully explore the map. The world of Axiom Verge is very unique and atmospheric, it has this organic and alien feel to it and it is also reflected in the soundtrack, which is just outstanding and surely one of my favorite soundtracks this year.   But if there's one thing that upset me a bit in Axiom Verge... it's boss battles. Now, don't get me wrong, it's not that they are bad or anything, it's just they are not very challenging, well, except maybe one boss but still, most of them is very easy. I don't know, maybe that's because I have played so many metroidvania games before and kinda know exactly what to expect from boss battles at this point, but that is the only complaint I have about this game, other than that it's just absolutely incredible and really fun to play. Oh, and if you are a speedrunner, the game also has a special speedrun mode for you.  [b]Final verdict:[/b] 10/10  Axiom Verge is one of the best (if not the best on PC) games inspired by original Metroid.
