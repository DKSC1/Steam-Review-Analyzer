Fun game with good stealth mechanics
I personally feel like the combat in Assassins Creed Shadows is a blend of the original combat with the Parry Counter attack Method and RPG Combat Stealth is amazing Naoe is quick and agile and can get in and out of Castles without being seen Yasuke is the brute if you need someone killed and you failed to get the Assassination Tactical retreat to switch to Yasuke The Scenery is Gorgeous by far one of the best scenery since probably RDR2 I will always love how a lot of the minor targets can just be found throughout the world even if you dont have the correspondant quest yet Who are you people vibes when you kill a target that you have no idea who and why theyre uniquely named The Base Building feature added on from Valhalla's Ravensthorpe now being able to place the buildings wherever you want rather than set locations is great While the World is gorgeous with realtime season changes and weather I do wish there was more to do just out in the wilds Minor issue I would like the Sync points to clear away from the Fog of War on the map Having to manually explore every inch of the map to clear the fog is a little tedious but thats circumventilated by all the locations have a road leading to them so the only fog that should be left are generally the mountain ranges that have nothing in them The In-Game battlepass It is completely free All the items can be obtained throughout the game without spending a penny of real money on it The Items it has are not better or worse than what can be obtained throught normal gameplay the only real difference is the cosmetics of the items They are more flashy with a red hue for bleed afinity or purple hue to poison afinity I for one am very pleased with Assassins Creed Shadows and very pleased with the direction the franchise is going and can not wait for the future DLC and future games coming into the series
Worth it
sarebbe bello poter giocare senza bug audio mappa ecc sconsiglio di comprarlo ora
Assassin's Creed Valhalla Valhalla Shadows Assassin's Creed Shadows Ubisoft Splinter Cell
Loving it Great assassin in Naoe
After 2 days of playing I really did not interest to play anymore it is kind of montonus the game becomes Sorry to say that but without clear instructions and sometimes the naqoe mission i didn't complete till now due to some g;litch or else But overall it is enjoyable game you can play it once
good
After Mirage Valhalla and Odyssey I really thought the series was dead for me but this game has proven me wrong I'm only about 3 hours in but so far it's very good
After 3 RPG entries and a spinoff with Mirage it seems Ubisoft is finally back with full force with this entry It is bombastic beautiful and contains some of the best gameplay the series has seen I say this as a fan that legitimately despises Origins through Valhalla not as games but as AC games This is the first time I have purchased an AC game at full price on release since probably Unity and I don't regret it
Alors bien que cela c'est plus oui qu'avant
Grappling Hook
Yasuke
delivers a dynamic mix of stealth and action Play as Naoe a fast shinobi who uses parkour gadgets and assassinations or Yasuke a powerful samurai who excels in direct combat The open world reacts to changing seasons and weather offering strategic opportunities for both playstyles Game is very smooth compared to previous versions P.S mechanics of construction are still questionable to me
muito bom
Worst AC game out-to-date
Ubisoft Quebec went the extra mile with this game The visuals and gameplay are incredible The characters are enjoyable and interesting The nostalgia and cornerstones of a classic AC game are all there while still making the player want to explore and use new mechanics The only area that could have been improved in my opinion is the smoothness in the cutscene animation and voice acting Some of this is definitely stylistic but it could still be improved Despite this I'm definitely gonna pass the 120 hour on this one 9.5/10
The hate is honestly not justified its a decent game not as good as Ghost of Tsushima or RDR2 of course but still feels like a better game than Valhalla tbh
Une boucle de gameplay qui arrive trop Je vais et ce sera sans doute la fois que j'offre une chance Ubisoft
Gioco molto bello sotto tutti i punti di vista Unica pecca che dopo la prima patch il gioco a iniziato a dare problemi con l'audio ma spero che ubisoft immetta una patch risolutiva
Von Anfang an hat man das gute da wurde echte Arbeit reingesteckt Nicht nach dem Motto Hauptsache Kohle und weg damit wobei an die Kohlen wurde sicher auch gedacht es steckt eine Portion Feingeist mit drin Die Story packt es stabil und es ist ein ACS wie man es halt kennt und hat echt damit haben kann und auch wird Das Rad wurde nicht neu erfunden aber es ist wieder rund und dreht sich perfekt Gute Leistung Ubi und bitte weiter so

jeu bien
Macht ist aber leider Technisch in einen schlechten Zustand Mal geht DLSS mal dann wieder nicht Ich habe Audio Bugs am meisten den das es nur noch Stimmen gibt und sonst alles andere gestummt ist Yaoe sich beim Klettern nicht wirklich gut steuern und sie kann Berge rauf rutschen
Better then Valhala

Assassin's Creed Shadows One of the best the franchise has to offer Pros 1)Great Graphics 2)No major bugs 3)Different playstyle for the two characters 4)Great Exploration 5 Excellent Gameplay Cons 1)It's not really a con but horse road auto follow is missing 2)Characters acting can be sometimes stiff I liked Odyssey very much but Valhalla not much.But definitely enjoying Shadows.Really Recommend it
Should've waited for the sale barely runs on a mid-tier pc Crashed constantly until i did hours of research and optimization They definitely should've used Eivor's playstyle for Yasuke like they used Evie Frye's everyting for Naoe Yasuke is a clunky mess but his voice acting is the best in English mode The hideout is literally the lifeline for me to play it Everything else is the same repetitive grindy micro-transactional ubisoft bs nothig new but the location
Ive played nearly all the Assassins Creed Games and man is this one good getting absolutely lost in the game The grind is fun the story is definitely cliche but good the combat is great Idk this is best Assassins Creed in years hands down
BAD GAME NGL
played for 54 minutes and for most of this time my game constantly stopped every 60 seconds to load itself and also damn enemy npcs were spawning outside the mission area without any way to go and kill them so I had to wait for my npcs to kill those npcs also so many damn loading screens damn Starfield was running better then this game on lunch If you want open world with samurai and so on just go and buy Ghost of Tsushima and you defo will NOT see a microtransaction shop on the loading screen or in game or even before you start the game the combat can give you more flavour to your life then this crap with better character growth of your mc through out the game
great game

Does NOT work on Steam Deck in offline mode

yes elon
Can't even get through the prologue without it constantly freezing Running 7800x3d and 7900 XTX
mabetlerde kasmak ettim Allah bari bir yana benzerlikleri olsa da da olan bir Assassin's Creed oyunu Seriyi sevip oynayanlar bir daha sevdirir fakat sevmeyenler forumlar
If you like the era it's set in it's fine but it has a number of problems The story doesn't make much sense The terrain and city settings are very well done but they're empty The NPCs are incredibly boring and the AI very smart And now the worst part which is what frustrates me the most the controls They're horrible Even if you try to move correctly so that the jumps and falls fit the game's logic they get stuck on anything or follow an arbitrary direction not to mention the murders that only work when the game feels like it In a world where things like Metal Gear 5 Red Dead Redemption 2 or Spiderman exist I don't understand how it can feel so bad The feeling it leaves is that it was rushed and that they've cut content Oh of course in-app purchases in a AAA single-player game What a fucking joke is that If you really like this theme and the series play it but I really don't recommend it
Le jeu est beau l'histoire de Naoe semble Trop la zone le combat est le de leveling est frustrant et j'ai l'impression que travers le de base building le jeu essaye de m'extorquer de l'argent Beaucoup de bug graphique et audio mais rien de dramatique sur certain il faudra juste recharger la sauvegarde
oyunu bi oyuna bakmadan gayet mis gibi oyun
oyunu alma konusunda Bu 1 oyun almaya Oyunun ama Assassins Creed zenci samuray pek gitmedi Ama karakter olan Naoe hem hem de karakter
played some of the game,but when i start the game again,i get so fare then i get a error dx2 0x80070052 be trying to continue the game but cant
machine Individuals want to complain 1 Achievement bug repair strong endless I have all kinds of legendary equipment except for the horse Yasuke and Naojiang but I am almost complete and I haven't jumped yet 2 Some enemy cyber ghosts hit the wall and their heads were lost just after killing and they turned their heads and stood stunned and the mouse was scared away 3 The Chinese Simplified Chinese translation text needs to be improved such as what exactly is the alternative attack Posture attack can also be translated to a more straightforward point 4 There is a bug in the default key position of the gold rod destruction which is difficult to type so you can change the key position
Overall good game Nothing ground breaking but the setting is nice and the story is interesting The combat isn't as polished feeling as a souls game but it still feels good I also like the difficulty options to make stealth feel more realistic Guards will see you on roofs with this option on Not many bugs and I can play the game without significant fps issues on a 1080ti So it's well optimized Game suffers from the usual ubisoft things such as a microtransaction store and convoluted menu but thats really it Overall I think the game is a bit pricey at a standard 70 but I think that price is too much for any game So depending on how much of a fan of AC games you are its up you if you'd rather wait for a sale at some point Regardless though I would recommend this game So thumbs up

it works one day then kills my pc the next
mesmo com todas as controversias do jogo ainda uma boa experiencia visualmente deslumbrante e com uma gameplay divertida que mescla a dos assassins antigos com a nova
I loved it Now I want to visit Japan irl
its like most normal game in ac history but the gameplay is smooth and world like there are thing make that place to what look like now so at least thanks ubisoft i wish this game make you create games better than shadows in the future
This game wont change your mind about AC but its a very good one of these Some of the best environmental art and weather effects I've ever seen in a game
Awesome game
A masterpiece by Ubisoft really enjoying every second of the game I play it on my laptop and also on my Asus ROG Ally Z1 Extreme I finally got it optimized on ROG Ally with no stuttering whatsoever and here are my settings VRAM 7GB Resolution 720p Dynamic Resolution Off Upscale Type TAA Upscale quality Custom and resolution set to 100 Frame Gen FSR Motion Blur Off Overall preset Medium
Its good for some dumb fun especially as Yasuke and the environments are beautiful But the story characters and villains are so bland its hard to get invested Would pick this up on a deep sale at least 50 Otherwise its just too bland The power fantasy of being an OP samurai or ninja isn't enough to carry this game
very fun to play
Stabbin in the dark
An astonishingly beautiful world filled with vistas that make you stop every time you ride out into a field of flowers at dawn or dusk spending hours in photo mode an engaging combat system with diverse playstyles that keeps you coming back despite having seen everything the game has to offer an interesting story that doesn't reach for the stars but does a good enough job of immersing you in the game's world and serves as a worthy backdrop for the most important thing that should be the main focus in games the gameplay All of this is present in Ghost of Tsushima including it's absolutely wonderful co-op mode Legends and is largely absent in this game I regret the money I spent on this game and regret every hour spent playing it
Ni aunque os paguen por jugarlo merece la pena

I loved Odyssey and love this game It's less RPG-like than Odyssey because you are not dealing a million damage assassinate is about health segments instead of raw damage and I like that Way better stealth than Valhalla and Naoe is fast asf Japan is beatiful forests are dense and the map is not as big as valhalla and odyssey The parkour isn't like unity ofc but love the flip animations you can do there are some bugs here and there but hope they will get fixed
en que les devs regarde les avis se putain de bug de son
i strongly feel that this is one of the best assassin creed games released in a while it's very nice
Pas simplement que des combats une ambiance qui demande une immersion dans la culture japonaise Je les d'un graphisme magnifique des paysages splendides qui correspondent la Peu pour plus de 200 heures de jeu pas les pisse froid vous serez Une cable circule contre UBISOFT combattez
I'm having fun with it Nothing feels clunky The only issues I found were having to update the drivers and no matter what I do I get a warning about the video player not being up to date But that's not true Everything is up to date and I am able to max out all the video settings with no problems
Stealth is back canon mode immersive mode guaranteed assassination 2 types gameplay for 2 different character this is best assassins creed after ezio trilogy blackflag
bien optimiser 1 seul bug en 12 heure et musique mon bon burger made in ubisoft
great game just a little hardware heavy
Mi ero fermato al capitolo Valhalla non mi era troppo piaciuto molto ripetitivo e la storia l'ho trovata molto banale Questo AC devo dire che mi sta piacendo anche le secondarie non sono per nulla male e la storia primaria ben scritta e piacevole Il periodo storico nel gioco mi piace veramente molto il comparto grafico davvero spettacolare Gioco con 4080 super a 3440x1440 e sto con tutti i settaggi ad ultra e ray tracing full oltre i 100fps Per ora non posso far altro che consigliarlo
much better than expected truly next gen technology like weather system and attention to detail in world building
Gierka przyjemna uwielbiam klimaty kilku nie by losowe eventy tego z czystym sumieniem
jest zajebista takie gry mega jeszcze w jakosci 4k super
I had a good time with this one when it worked I loved the game but three crashes in 30 minutes refunded Maybe they'll fix it and I can grab it on sale
Cet AC Shadow est excellent tel Odyssey avant lui
big piece of dog shit
BAGUS
se mi fakt Z AC jsem AC1 AC2 a Syndicate Tohle je v top3 nebo top2 s Black Flag a hratelnost boj a stealth jsou a se mi moc a dokonce tam byly momenty to ani nebo Dialogy jsou a postavy kraviny Naoe je a se Yasukeho jsem odemkla po 15 a byla jsem mile Je a boj s je p*del vykopnout chlapa 5 dozadu a cestu do si tak a jimi chlapa Do toho hraje hudba Yasuke rockovou s hip hopem cetek a nejste se ale a interagovat s Ubisoft si hlavu z p*dele a zamyslel se nad jak dobrou hru Tohle je jak vody Ano najdou se tam chybky ale bych tomu bugy Naoe nevyleze se zasekne apod To ale se
Great game
Great graphics Good combat system and stealth Level design knowledge points and open-world activities were definitely unpolished DISASTER Absolutely ZERO depth story filled with forgiveness BS and constant flashbacks with no order Side quests feel like simple chores designed by LOW-level AI to prolong playtime instead of improving the experience It had such potential but UBI screwed it up
My PoE 2 guy told me to buy it
Fantastic game loving the combat Oh and fuk Musk and all his little swallowers
Nice
Purchased to support against Elongated Muskrat got an okay game as a bonus Very clear from the start they are not going for historical accuracy even a little bit but the new engine and mechanics make the gameplay feel way more refreshing compared to the last few iterations of AC The biggest downside is the ubi launcher
Finally this creed series extended to oriental culture with fantasy visual effect performance good start and looking forward to having sequel to tell other cultures basing on Asia pool
bien pero se queda Si te Valhalla te va a gustar porque es del estilo y tiene algunas mejoras pero por varias horas mi general es desinstalarlo y dedicar ese tiempo a otros juegos Tiene sabor a La verdad soy fan de Assassin`s Creed y esperaba Me

einfach wieder ein gutes spiel nicht so wie odesyy oder valhalla
Rengeteg harci elemet vettek a Ghost of Tsushima a harcosok a piros mind abban voltak nem a AC ban az hogy automatikus a kevesebb a jelen mind csak hogy ezt az origins a most,hogy szorul a hurok hirtelen ezeket oldani
Assassins Creed
Geiles Spiel geile etc Aber die Soundbugs nerven brutal bitte fixen
Looks amazing performance is much better than i expected I am running at 2k resolution with high preset and ray tracing turned very high and averaging 120 fps Of course with the help of DLSS turned to quality and frame generation on I am rocking ryzen 9 5900x and rtx3080 Combat is different than in other games but in a good way and i personally like a lot that you have 2 characters that play differently Also you have a lot of ways to customize the mechanics in this game if you prefer the old AC mechanics Also huge recommendation playing with Japanese language with English subtitles the English voice acting is pretty bad
Best assassin's creed game in awhile I forgot it was assassacreed and was just having fun playing a cool ninja/samurai game
Pros Playing as Naoe has been the highlight so far Her gameplay feels like the most refined stealth experience in the Creed series to date It rewards patience timing and creative infiltration It captures that feeling of being an assassin better than most entries in the franchise Feudal Japan is beautifully realized The environments are lush atmospheric and layered with small cultural details that deepen immersion like Naoe removing her shoes inside her home Ubisoft clearly put effort into representing the setting with care and cultural nuance The game feels like the successful middle ground between the original AC formula stealth parkour and the RPG-heavy entries of recent years not quite as stripped down as Mirage but it avoids the overwhelming sprawl of Odyssey Despite Naoe being a squishy character the game allows for fun build experimentation The right gear weapons and skills can transform her into a deadly melee threat which rewards experimentation without breaking her identity as a stealth-first assassin The game leans into Asian-style storytelling with slower pacing and emotionally charged contemplative scenes It may feel unfamiliar to some but it fits the setting well and adds weight to the narrative Cons While Naoe shines in stealth gameplay leans heavily into Valhalla-style combat That shift may not be what stealth-focused fans were hoping for though some may still enjoy his brute-force approach a tonal and mechanical departure that feels like two different games stitched together Some contract missions fall into a repetitive grindy loop While stealth keeps them challenging and dynamic with Naoe they can lack variety over time and risk feeling like filler parkour movement isn't as fluid as some would prefer an improvement from the more recent titles maybe very similar to Mirage but those hoping for a return to Black Flag or Unity-level parkour may find it a bit stiff and inconsistent in tight situations Side missions and non-combat mechanics like kuji-kiri or art interactions are slow and often feel like a break in momentum While this reflects the storytelling traditions of the setting it may test players looking for a faster-paced gameplay Overall Creed Shadows is probably one of the strongest entries in the series in years Naoe offers a stealth experience that rivals or surpasses past assassins set against the backdrop of a meticulously crafted and culturally thoughtful world It strikes a meaningful balance between the old-school AC identity and the newer RPG evolution While heavier combat feels like a nod to Valhalla and may divide opinion it at least offers variety The pacing mission design and parkour perfect but if stealth exploration and immersion are what you value in an Creed game Shadows delivers Alongside Mirage it feels like Ubisoft is finally listening to the fanbase and re-centering the series around what made it great to begin with
best AC game in YEARS idc idc you won't change my mind they used the typical AC formula for the base but they tried things that actually work and i appreciate them for it plus they absolutely wrecked elon on twitter and i appreciate that the hate for this game is so forced and i fully believe if you dislike it you're either a bigot or a complete idiot who has never had an original thought outside what the manosphere youtubers tell you to have valid critiques are not included in this the micro transactions are just ridiculous but they also aren't necessary so just don't buy them tbh now repeat after me yasuke was a real person yasuke was a real person YASUKE WAS A REAL PERSON
ubisoft connect den nefret ediyorum
Personally my favourite Assassin's Creed ever Note currently requires an SSD in order to work properly
Best game 10/10
y
Improves upon everything that I had gripes with in Valhalla Better animations combat graphics the environments are sick music story and less bloat Stealth on expert is pretty good and more in spirit with the first AC games
Leute ich kann das Spiel nur empfehlen das Gameplay macht die Grafik Die Story ist okay was ich bisher gesehen habe mir gefallen nur nicht die Gesichtsanimationen das machen andere Spiele besser Bisher bin ich aber sehr zu zufrieden
wow just wow i'm blown away just how it feels like a proper evolution of AC Series after the RPG Trilogy Everything is a major step up and felt like built from the ground up Despite the forced internet controversy surrounding it i think it's safe to say that this is THE best game set in feudal Japan ever
As a fan of the series(even the RPG games I knew this game was going to be good but I didn't expect it to be this good In a way it is kind of annoying having two different characters that suit two vastly different play styles instead of having only one character that can do both However after playing the game for a while it is actually pretty easy and fun to seamlessly change between Naoe and Yasuke for certain situations It also doesn't feel like the game is forcing you you have a choice between either most of the time The story by far is very interesting I have been playing a lot of side content too which is very fun I like how they have made both Yasuke and Naoe their stories and character development is really well made The only thing that I find a bit bad sometimes Naoe's faciel expressions and voice lines seem a bit robotic compared to Yasuke As for gameplay the more you play the better and more fun it gets since your characters level up getting more stats and such Some abilities change the gameplay a lot giving you an edge in some situations for example Naoe has an ability with the Tanto which let's you assassinate enemies while in combat which means that even if you do not have enough level to one shot assassinate a target after starting the combat you can finish them off with a second assassination Compared to Valhalla these abilities are interesting and actually help you instead of just giving you more stats Valhalla did have some interesting skills but not as much as the ones here Talking about Naoe I think the stealth gameplay has never been more fun you sprint jump around do flips prone and use a variety of different tools The thing that I like the most about the stealth is how Naoe moves it just feels very natural and elegant As for Yasuke he is a pretty standard guns blazing kind of character nothing ground breaking but he is very fun to play for people that don't want to wait and stick to shadows There are people who unironically pretend to be Japanese on social media to slander the game hate the game for having watermelons and other pretty ridiculous things like disrespecting Japanese culture while in reality the game actively pushes you and rewards you to respect shrines and not climb tori gates and even removes your shoes while you are in some buildings which I recently noticed among other things The gaming industry has gotten to a point where your game working is something that people should praise since every other game especially AAA is broken and sometimes even unplayable I remember playing Valhalla and it constantly crashing even playing it a month or two ago before shadows came out it still crashed 1-2 times which is astonishing I also don't have a weak PC so that definitely isn't a reason However this game works flawlessly I have had 0 crashes random FPS drops or any other issues so I can only applaud the devs If you are down to play assassin's creed a game set in Japan or just generally a good game This is definitely a must

Hate all you want this game is actualy really nice Both character are fun to play the story is interesting the investigations are fun and the scenery is beautiful I find myself loving to improve my hideout and decorating it I was sur to hate that part Turns out i was wrong So yeah 10/10 would b*ng
By far the worst RPG creed game out of the four that have been made thus far The story is just straight up terrible in almost all aspects If you have played AC Mirage you will know what im talking about because this games story is basically a copy and paste of Mirage but with some of the worst English voice acting you will ever experience in a video game The story consists of you going around the game world taking out targets one by one each with there own self contained stories Once again if you have played Mirage you will know why this is so terrible as it leaves all the side characters and developments of each story contained within there respective regions to the point where every side character and ultimately side story is extremely forgettable and adds almost nothing to the overall narrative besides just another person you have to kill The side content in this game is also the worst in the series besides maybe Valhalla Gone are the days of side quests from games like Origins or Odyssey and instead the overwhelming majority of side content is just more assassinations targets The overall gameplay is conflicting because the combat is worse than Odyssey Valhalla and Origins but the stealth is very well done and the best the series has been in years maybe even ever Graphics and overall world design are both very good just like every other AC game Parkour is the best out of all the RPG creeds Progression and loot systems work very similarly to that of Odyssey which I think has the best progression out of the RPG creeds Overall I would only recommend this game if its heavily discounted at least 50 or if your a fan of the general Assassins Creed gameplay loop and just want a new game set in Japan I would give this game a 6.5/10
The game is pretty enjoyable so far BUT Dear Ubisoft I will not buy 2500 HELIX shitcoin 20 eur to purchase a costume in-game after I spend 70 eur on it Also I will also not buy 4200 HELIX shitcoin 35 eur for an extra 5 skill points and a Katana Starter Pack How about you pack deez nuts into your mouth

Un bon Assassin's Creed pour l'instant On peut toujours faire mieux c'est Il y a une certaine redondance dans le gameplay comme dans les autres Le jeu est magnifique si on a une bonne config Le est un peu long par contre et l'histoire et le lore autour de la des assassins ne sont pas pour l'instant A voir par la suite Si vous amateur de la licence et que vous avez les 3 foncez sinon attendez les soldes
what a pity when I have bad connection from Ubisoft launch I wasted 60 minutes in real life to play 5 minutes game play because the game just loading and lag waste almost time just waiting the game load even that is cut scenes or game play

Richtig gute Performance Auch in 1444p mit der RTX 2080 Grafisch macht das Spiel auch was her Ich mag diesen Stiel bei AC mit dem RPG System Man hat viele Spielstunden und viel Erkundung vor sich
One of the best Assassin's Creed game in the last years The graphics are beautiful the sound is really nice the gameplay is way different than the previous games but in a good way Zoomers are upset that the game contains many and long cutscenes being used to watching TikTok all day and their brains can't look at the same scenes for more than 1 minute I really liked the cutscenes the only minus that I have regarding them is the fact that they are capped at 30 FPS Other than this no comment The graphics are really beautiful on 4K having 60 FPS or more constantly using DLSS on a 4080 SUPER Most of the haters are mad at this game because a black man a slave has managed to become a samurai I was skeptic at first as well but I gave it a chance being one of my favorite gaming franchises without knowing his full story which is also really well said towards the end of the game everything being explained in detail If you liked AC Origins Odyssey Valhalla or Mirage this is the game that you will like as well If you also like Japan and their history and culture you will love it
Can I buy Ubisoft shares in the MICRO transaction store
The best Assassins Creed game so far Beautiful to look at smooth as butter and and great gameplay But Two things are necessary to get the really great experience 1 Set spoken language to native so you get the immersion of native Japanese and in some cases Portugaese rather than the below average english voiceacting It makes a huge difference in immersion and suddenly the story-arcs also appears to be better in line with a japanese epic Shogun comes to mind with a natural pace rather than the brain expecting an english versioned fast action packed paced block buster which is a mistake in expectations 2 Set the difficulty level to expert There is a misalignment in difficulty levels so expert actually represents a completely normal experience while normal makes the game way too easy e.g boring Do that and the game becomes borderline fantastic

yes
New to AC I am really enjoying the game so far Storytelling leaves much to be desired especially the dialogue However it is fun going around the world and doing all the side quests it is relaxing and engaging
Great Ac game Haven't played since Unity and this did not disappoint
hikayeyi sikeyim
Pc-n nem ismeri a az SSD as a HDD szaggat minden 30 egy percre az support azt javasolja hogy a drive-ot kicsit tikkelek Nem a file-ok sem Ne siessetek PC-s a minden platformra addig pedig vissza a
Je n'attendais rien de cet opus et au final surpris il est fun et immersif
All in all a fun game From best to worst parts Graphics are wonderfull Parkour is great Animations are very good Japanese voices are also very good Music is nice Story is good Combat is fine later in the game with more mastery points spend English voices are a bit less less good Combat is quite limited early game with less mastery points spend Stealth mechanics are ok ish
Overall the game is a solid 7/10 The stealth system is so much better than in other previous AC games if you play it on expert mode The landscapes looks astonishing and there is a lot of content if you like to explore freely I like the fact that you have 2 playable characters with their own advantages and disadvantages This way the game feels more challenging not like in Valhalla where Eivor even in the hardest mode was a one man army and was able to do everything by itself easily The only problem I have is with their Ubisoft Connect bullcrap they are literally forcing us to install it which is kind of annoying but whatever
IGN UU UU

pour l'instant un tres bon jeu tres attractif avec une belle quakite dimage les combat ne sont pas redondant et le monde est magnifique
Its beautiful the game play is average AC experience nothing innovative but reasonably fun The voice acting in immersive mode is really good honestly recommend turning off english for audio The game has a bunch of MTX which is insane on a 110 video game But what would have been a solid 7/10 i just can't recommended because of these 3 reasons 1 uplay launcher is absolute garbage it doesn't even install when you install the game forcing you to go find the installer 2 UPLAY crashes constantly kicking you out of the game 3 the game itself is a technical nightmare it crashes about as frequently as Dragons Dogma 2 did on launch day if not more and each time you have to let uplay crash restart uplay outside of steam otherwise it won't login then boot up the game wait for all the logos wait for the stupid memories bullshit to take you to the actual video game menu and finally the game crashes again Wait for it to be 7 on sale or for somebody to figure out how to patch uplay out
best assassin creed in a long time
Always been huge assassin creed open world RPG fan i had to play this one too i neeeeed too im still not even half way through the story yet i have done yasuke and naoe story and its Great story till act 1 was also very good i heard the story is just alright but let me decide that later i be having fun exploring and stuff At first i do had a problem with character not being in the middle but i got used to it now other than that i encounter one photo mode bug combat feels nice I LOVE IT
yes
dont get the hate for this game they have microtransactions just dont buy them anway other than that love the game so far
Very beautiful looking with Nvidia 3060 Ti 12 Gb A little confusing at first because it is not like previous AC titles
Shift click not working during sword training
good story good graphics good sound
War wirklich eine finde ich Es ist wirklich gut geworden und mir sogar besser als Ghost of Tsushima Vorallem das Bausystem und die vielen streichelbaren Tiere gefallen mir gut aber auch im allgemeinen spielt es sich sehr und macht Endlich mal wieder was gutes
Approaching 2 days play time and still having the time of my life Game is so well made zero performance issues I enjoy both characters and their different play-styles The story is interesting and has me locked in and engaged I love the hideout customization Basically like SImCity in Assassin's Creed The world is vast the weather effects are stunning the seasons are an interesting change of pace The various activities between both characters are fun and enjoyable
Se fan de AC fique sabendo que esse jogo tem uma das piores de todos os Eu esperava muito da mas conseguiu ser pior do que eu imaginava Um dos pontos fortes desse jogo os e a gameplay A muito boa e o jogo praticamente tem bugs Espere uma
Beautiful fun and entertaining
game play is great the characters are amazing and well made in their sense of self and the story is very immersive cant help but want to keep playing to find out what happens next very addicting
Sehr gut mir fehlt nur leider der Exploration-Faktor der letzten Teile
bir senedir oyun bu Olumlu olarak sadece grafikler ve diyebilirim kendi Hemen ubisoft yermeye gerekiyor Neden mi Suikast askerlerin tekrar bir oyun saymazsam en sorunum Kendimi bildim bileli kaliteli bir oyun en az etkisinde Kcd 2 3-4 kendime gelemedim Bunun sizin bu rezil kepaze senaryonuza edip ana hikayeyi bitirdim Oyunun hikayesi vasat da bir o kadar berbat geldi Zaten karakterlerle kurmak neredeyse Her ne kadar hikayeler olsa da ben o ve bize hem hemde klasik Ulan zaten gibi tarikat hikaye diye annesini tamam biraz heyecan geldi derken oyunu dlc olarak onun gelir bilmiyorum ama o bana buldurmazsan senin ubisoft Senin oyunlarda hikaye sen Ezio ile 2025 ama sen bende bir Altair etkisi bile Son olarak de oyununa olumlu geri ubisoft
Honestly the best recent AC Game yet the combat is Fluent and fun hell the Detail is REALLY good you can see Naoe's vains on her arms kind of good
a bit complicated compared to other AC series but once u get a hang of it it starts to get very intresting the story line is fantastic
I'll rebuy if they fix the damn DX12 error problem Right now Both AMD/NVIDIA cards are suffering this issue FIX IT
jogao
It feels like Black Flag and I love that one
Biraz dedim oyun bitti Oyuna luzumsuz nefret var net'de Ubisoftu zaten az neyi veya tahmin edebilir bir GOT'dan 2-3 ekledikleri 2-3 oyunu baya Naoe ile oynarken gizlenerek ilerlemek klassik ac verdi Yasuke ile ise bam var zaman ki Yasukeye eklenen silah da baya hale Ana hikaye de dram mram falan tatmin eder Yan hikayeler mmo gibi git 123123 eleman kes git getir gibi Bir rpg He birde ana benzeyen belli gibi o da Gay nefret geldi de oyunda zorunlu bir maruz bir eylem yok Ubi tamamen oyuncuya ki iyide sonuna kadar hak ediyor 8/10
I have to admit the game looks amazing The combat is probably the best had in the RPG series alongside stealth and gameplay mechanics The story bad either but mostly mid I also like parkour in this game a lot Raytracing looks amazing as well in this game But goddamn I have to cutscenes in this game suck I found myself laughing yesterday at how bad some of them look not talking about the motion-captured ones but the regular ones The voice acting sounds like it was done by AI The forest feels empty and you kill any you do anything in the forest which makes up 70 of the map I just get why the developers put more effort into the wildlife In Red Dead Redemption 2 which I consider the best game of the last decade and it still holds up today you can literally spend hundreds of hours hunting gathering herbs and collecting unique flowers Especially when I found out this game had a 300 million budget which is almost the same as RDR2 I ignore the forced diversity scenes trans options and all this game had so much more potential than what was delivered Also I own an RTX 4070 Super and the game even recognize DLSS or DLSS FG as an option I have to restart the game multiple times just to get it to This is ridiculous a decent game but for I recommend it Wait for a sale
If you look past all the political stuff they messed up on with Japan the gameplay isnt as bad as people claim The reviewers who say the combat is boring is the same people who give Souls games 10/10 combat dont get me wrong my favorite games are souls games Story so far is Okay I only played Naoe shes fun Don't care much for the tank gameplay I will say play it on Immersive mode the English dub is awful for Naoe some of the NPCs are okay but her specifically is really bad lol All that being said I still cant recommend it because at the end of the day Ubisoft is charging 70 for a game and still adding cancer type microtransactions to a singleplayer game and you can feel it getting resources or waiting on scouts forced how crap it is then i seen you can buy them in the store no wonder its bad This is how games go but u dont gotta buy it thats not the point its slow to make you want to buy it Ubisoft Trash
Got 60 hours in the game and still feel like I have so much more Overall this is the best AC game released to date Positives Great graphics Fun game play Heaps to do World is beautiful with tonnes of things to explore Save anywhere Option to turn off or on automatic kill on assassinations if you prefer the old AC model Love being able to switch between characters Really enjoy the heisting of the capitals Negatives Little bit glitchy with parkour moves sometimes happens Little bit annoying with the horse movement in and around trees auto turns and causes movement loops Wish the quests told you which character you had to be nothing worse than running so far to find out you need to switch characters Mixed Not a fan of the meditation side activities as they can be annoying

Weebs und Schlitzer ac has redeemed itself with this one
Teacher
The visual are gorgeous It is a shame that it is buried under so much controversies Not the best entry but faithful to its new path since Origins wich was a masterpiece
Definitely the best modern AC game way better than I originally thought it would be Very fun game so far
Great game with wonderful stealth mechanic Story can be a bit anti-climatic but solid overall Best game in the series for me ever since Origin Combat is great but lacking in immersion activities Hopefully future update will add more immersive things to do
After updating why can't I play using my Xbox Series X controller
Thumbs Up
Absolutely loving it The story graphics sound design.so far the best AC iv played Good job Ubisoft
Feels like Ghost of Tsushima mixed with AC:Valhalla with more attention to narrative than Valhalla Only finished Act 1 and really enjoying it so far Hardly any bugs I hope future AC's follow this trend The mechanics in previous AC's have been all over the place and it finally feels like they landed on something great with this mix The weak points are the facial animations but the writing has improved so most of the time it can be overlooked 9/10 so far
ASWESOME and colorful steamhappy
Los muy buenos los de armas y armaduras excepcionales y ya El combate soso y repetitivo mismos ataques y ejecuciones siempre la IA de los enemigos de risa jugando en modo experto el mapa rebosa cantidad y echa en falta calidad la historia se pierde y ya pasas en oferta porque es bonito de ver yo si pudiese lo hasta verlo rebajado
fire game so far loving the combat and traversal changes the story is solid voice acting could be a bit better but barely noticeable finally being able to play a shinobi in an assasins creed game has been dope definite recommend if not for the story the game play alone
awesome no complaints
ASSASSIN
So far only 4 hours in but this is a fun game The art direction is beautiful the voice acting is top notch and it has a great story Gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect from an AC game I haven't gotten too deep into it yet but it has nice character building and base building in an RPG way It's not an RPG per se but you can alter your character to your playstyle to a degree Overall I do like the game and do recommend it
damn.just damn bout damn time
D
I've tried i've really tried
The game is great even with its flaws Playing as Noae feels like returning to the roots of the franchise and they really nailed it with this one Finally an AC game that actually requires skill and effort to get through enemy zones Yasuke is a cool historically accurate his gameplay is extremely dry Honestly if you want to play as Yasuke you're better off playing Ghost of Tsushima What I really dislike about this game is the story like Ubisoft has been allergic to writing an engaging narrative ever since Unity And I say this as a huge fan who 100%'d all the original AC games as a kid This game had a 500 million budget yet I feel like I could pay a high schooler 50 to write a more enthusiastic script Sure the world is complex and connecting certain plot points is the writing is so bad I had to put the game down halfway through even though I initially planned to 100 it Controversy aside the game is objectively great overall The environment design is a technical marvel gameplay as Noae is fun and engaging and the graphics are up there with Horizon Forbidden West As I said my only real gripe is the writing Not as likely but if anyone at Ubisoft is reading this This is a public service announcement to whatever toilet-head at Ubisoft decided to include in-game purchases in a single-player game You should be ashamed of yourself buddy let me catch you on my block blud
bello
very good

I've loved the AC series since I was a kid and this game does not disappoint I don't know why there is so much backlash over it it's a great game great story great graphics
Ubisoft has let me down for a long time even SOMEHOW messing up a game like Outlaws with the Star Wars ip entry that lacks in everything Jedi Survivor already did They need a hit BAD and trust me when I say that I wanted to hate this game Just use the free 2 hrs and refund They are so back Imagine my suprise when I was met with PEAK Ubisoft Gameplay is crisp with long cutscenes with motivated characters optimized fairly decently on a 3070ti What else can I say if you want to hate to hate go for it This game is actually really fun and I can see so much care put in this game which itself is art Thats all I really look for when playing games If the developers are passionate about what they are creating You can feel the love for this world that they crafted and the music is expertly crafted Look at whats good instead of whats bad and maybe you'll enjoy not only this game but life better 9/10
Decent game worth the price Great combat and stealth mechanics Ubisoft's games are clearly unmatched when it comes to stealth Great character animations Really fluid and artful sword-handling and parkour techniques by the protagonists Facial animations are also very good Excellent world and environment design with a lot of efforts put into details Main story is not bad but not great either The main characters personalities and principles are not invested deeply enough For example they aim to eradicate corruption and restore peace but in a lot of instances quests demand killing guards and soldiers It goes against their agenda for peace The game could really use some more drama like in TV shows A lot of cutscenes/story events really have the potential but are not quite there yet Side quests still lack depth A good portion of quests are just Assassinate somebody or Kill 50 bandits without the context or the story of it A lot of times players just have to murder people in cold blood for the sake of completion of the game but have no real justification for doing so A lot of assassination targets don't feel quite deserving of it Therefore the satisfaction from killing bad guys does not exist The map is huge and contains numerous locations However these locations lack the depth and the events that make them interesting or unique The castles and outposts are just there to raid The towns/villages are just there as a map marker There is no background no interesting character no story-related intrigues to explore in such locations around the world Exploration therefore feels bland boring and repetitive Inappropriate music in some situations/cutscenes Applying modern music in medieval times Rate 82/100
An amazing game definitely recommended for any Assassin's Creed fans
9/10 Breathtaking Visuals Fun Gameplay More Refined Parkour and Movements Meh Story
I haven't gotten very far yet but my first impressions are 1 The environment is nice 2 Story seems good so far 3 I REALLY don't like the combat it relies WAY too much on perfect parry and perfect dodge and when there's even a couple of enemies on you it's a bit rough It feels like they're going for a souls-like in terms of combat style and that's not at all what I was looking forward to in an Assassin's Creed game Will update at some point
👍
Bon un avis objectif et sur cet assassin's creed pour vous conseiller au mieux Config R7 9800 X3D RX 7900 XTX 32 Go RAM 6000 Mhz SSD nvme Je me le suis pris j'y ai je me suis fait Les raisons 1 erreur de type freeze blue screen DX12 ERROR toute les 20-30 minutes de jeu Lassitude en si peu de temps Vu et revu la capture des camps encore pfff Vide tellement vide y'a rien faire sur la map Au bout d'un moment j'avais envie de retourner sur Rise of the ronin Les Woke et DEi sont car le jeu est gentillet et pas du tout lourd ce niveau Vous pas d'avoir telle ou telle relation avec tel ou telle perso c'est comme c'est du roleplay ce niveau vous jouer comme vous aimez c'est comme le PMU Ensuite sur Yasuke dessus j'avais un petit doute je pensais avoir du mal l'incarner et me projeter dans un japon avec lui mais marche Il est sympathique ce perso et pas si mal dans le On y croit et on aime l'incarner Donc pour les 2 elles sont stupides Le jeu n'est pas il est gentillet bon enfant pour moi le a ailleurs En le jeu est beau et il fait bonne impression au Les gameplays des 2 protagonistes sont biens franchement avec de bons mooves agiles excitant sans un doctorat en combat donc pas prise de la map est jolie bien les saisons sont top la est top Au je me suis de l'avoir pris MAIS ensuite tout j'ai une erreur critique toutes les 20 minutes de jeu qui affiche DX12 ERROR avec retour au bureau Ensuite la map est belle mais elle est VIDE DE CHEZ VIDE y'a RIEN y faire C'est beau mais on n'y croit pas On est pas Si vous aimez vous promener en sous la pluie et le brouillard allez vous promener dans un Ghost recon BreakPoint dont la nature est encore plus convaincante jolie immersive Avec votre team vous allez vous planquer en bas du ravin neigeux dans le village par une nuit neigeuse et venteuse avec la menace d'une patrouille Au fond d'un vallon la inextricable sous une rocheuse avec un drone de combat haut dans le ciel et 10 minutes un orage terrible et vous decidez de quitter le bivouac avec votre lourde jeep qui patine dans la boue bref dans ce shadows le plaisir de couper 2 bambous et peindre 2 biches il ne se passe rien Aucune creux vide Et en plus en quittant les sentiers le jeu vous artificiellement dans les sentiers battu avec des murs invisible sous forme d'annonce vocale non j'ai pas envie d'aller par la Dingue dans un monde ouvert Nul Si vous voulez de la japonaise naturelle allez dans GoTsushima c'est encore plus joli et En plus vous pourrez la que vous souhaitez en sortant votre flute et en en jouant tout en vous promenant Si vous voulez une plus belle historique et plus d'immersion allez sur Rise of The ronin L'histoire est gentillette vue et revue Franchement fonctionne mais il faut vraiment pas exigeant Le jeu transpire la Agile et le Scrum braining alors qu'est ce que vous pensez de ci de la 20 personnes C'est pas coche des cases Quand trop de personnes mettent leur sauces tombe dans le convenu au de l'inspiration Au on s'emmerde vite surtout si on a Odyssey Origine et Valhalla C'est la recette vue et revue 1000 fois des camps infiltrer des mecs qui bougent pas avec leur IA de moule vous rampez devant un gland 1 qui vous voit pas vous assassinez tel mec vous recommencez PFFFFFFFFFF c'est chiant Les auras des armes des pieds rouges des sabres bleues des mecs tout en aura jaune des mecs rouges travers les murs etc en allant dans les options pour modifier le HUD y'a toujours ces auras qui vous sortent du game y'avait pas autant sur les anciens assassins C se casualise tellement Y'aurait eu sur aurait tellement dommage Je n'ai pas ces auras ces changements de couleur de sabres de background d'auras etc Le jeu est en moins oui curieusement plus en avec la des monuments de la map le les mythiques les vieilles bien les le vernis de la grecque l'exploration navale le vrai vent de la le charisme d'Achille chez Alexios etc que sur un japon en beaucoup plus paresseux Vous n'avez plus les gameplay auxiliaires excitant comme la bataille navale L'organisation de base c'est marrant 5 minutes mais ne sert rien Le jeu est en fait Ce qu'il propose est vu revu fait 1000 fois sur des alors que le est que ses quelques bonnes comme les gameplay des 2 protagonistes la le jeu est vite OSEF on ne se dit pas parce que je m'ennuie non c'est juste comme une bougie qui finit de se consumer on n'a pas envie de le rallumer Moi j'avais envie de retourner sur rise of the ronin dans lequel je me sens plus et qui a de bien meilleurs combats et sensations Tout en aussi joli en ultra avec une qui est bien et au moins rien ne vous sort du jeu GoT est meilleur aussi que ce shadows Bref c'est paradoxal mais le jeu provoque la passion pour des raisons lui non mais en lui le jeu ne passionne pas c'est un jeu OSEF qu'on finit par ne plus lancer et car on n'a plus envie d'y revenir P.S Il y a 1 dans le jeu que j'ai pouvoir couper les herbes du C'est tout je ne sais pas si vaut 5 ans de dev et 500 millions d'euros mais j'ai cette feature A mettre dans les autres AC avec une maj
Its just okay at best And even after multiple delays it is still not a polished game As a huge fan of the series it is a disappointment
Quiero compartir mi experiencia en Creed Shadows Este ser una nueva joya dentro de la franquicia y aunque tiene aspectos que me han encantado hay ciertos detalles que me han dejado con sentimientos encontrados Para empezar los son impresionantes La del feudal es simplemente espectacular con paisajes detallados efectos de realistas y una al detalle que realmente hace que el mundo se sienta vivo la del juego es sorprendentemente buena algo que se agradece en un lanzamiento de esta magnitud En mi experiencia el rendimiento ha sido sin de FPS ni tiempos de carga excesivos Sin embargo no todo es perfecto He notado varios bugs de audio que pueden ser bastante molestos A veces las voces de los personajes se cortan los sonidos de los combates desaparecen por completo o la se superpone de manera No es algo que arruine la experiencia pero definitivamente afecta la en ciertos momentos En cuanto a la historia es donde siento que Shadows flaquea No es que sea mala pero se siente excesivamente larga y con un ritmo que a veces se vuelve tedioso Los personajes no terminan de engancharme y las misiones principales aunque bien en de jugabilidad no logran emocionarme tanto como esperaba me hubiera gustado que el juego tuviera una fuerte con la hermandad de los Asesinos y que se vinculara con la historia real algo que especiales a los primeros Creed Pero si hay algo que realmente brilla en Shadows es el combate Es divertido y satisfactorio Cada pelea se siente intensa con animaciones fluidas y bien pulidas Poder alternar entre un combate sigiloso y enfrentamientos directos le da mucha variedad al gameplay y las ejecuciones son espectaculares Sin duda este es uno de los mejores sistemas de combate que la saga ha tenido en no he terminado la historia pero ya llevo entre un 65 y 70 del juego y aunque sigo espero que el tramo final logre sorprenderme un poco narrativamente En definitiva Creed Shadows es un con un apartado impresionante y un combate adictivo pero que cojea en su narrativa y en su con la franquicia
I Have not really tried the game yet i believe i can't even run it on my pc but they ratioed Elon Musk so 10/10
great combat and parkour system bit there are some issues with stuttering when using frame generation
Good game so far Fun and looks good Runs well with a few glitches that are more funny or weird than game breaking or annoying Story is interesting if you know your Japanese history/culture than someone who doesn't Keep it classy
THE REALITY 1 The Game is Beautiful 2 The Story Is Ok 3 The Parkour is Better 4 The Combat is Typical 5 The History is Mostly Wrong and no not talking about Yasuke 6 The Political Decisions are Garbage 7 Decent Amount of Content In Its Map Size
extremamente feliz com esse jogo incrivel
I don't care about any of the weird culture war stuff surrounding this game But the HDR calibration is awful and the opening cutscenes look worse than early PS4 titles There wasn't even any particularly interesting dialogue to counteract that On top of everything it opens with a title select screen asking you to choose which 100 game you want to play as if that isn't insane All after spending 10 minutes signing into ubisoft's DRM software Refunded
BOM
This game is filled with historical revisionism and cultural disrespect The combat is boring the story isn't even good and the historical figures are being disrespected This game is a massive insult to Japan history and the AC community
The game has minimal performance issues and is actually a complete game with hundreds of hours of content It has been super fun playing it so far and I am excited to play the rest of the game
20-30 5 6
Good
C Program Files x86 Steam steamapps common Assassins Creed Shadows vidoes Here find your language and delete the videos in the folder Then search the root folder of videos for logos and delete all of those Then you won't see any splash screens when you start the game Game runs really well on ROG Ally X as well Can't wait to get into this more Has a Sekrio like parry system where you have multi hit combos to deflect I really didn't get very far into the game to see the open world stuff yet but this game is great so far
Ultra fast quick review Combat 10/10 You can play RPG Style or you can choose to play Old style with one hit assassinations The ability to choose is absolute godsend I hated the RPG style of the new AC series and preferred the old school style of just assassinating everything with one hit Graphics 10/10 Game is absolutely stunning Old Japan is absolutely beautiful dynamic weather in this game is just top notch Gameplay 8/10 They did not stray far from the Assassins Creed mechanic which involves a lot of parkour and a lot of running some people love this some people dont AI can sometimes be clunky and some bugs need to be ironed out but nothing game breaking Story/World 7/10 While the story is not the best it is still immersive and pretty good World is just huge with lots of things to see and explore I would actually say it has too many Overall rating 9/10 AC fans eating good after this release I was actually one of the skeptical ones because past AC games was Sh*t but with this my faith has been slightly restored
3 10 Game play pre Ubi Xsolla Support Ubisoft Xsolla
I've never felt this immersive to the game since Origins So far everything is great Especially the story in Act 1 of the game I wish the whole game could be like that It surpasses my expectation in terms of gameplay Both combat and stealth is really fun to play with The stealth is challenging with the expert settings turn on and The combat is not too easy even with Yasuke I still not fond about the transition between cutscene and gameplay though In AC Unity the transition is seamlessly smooth and that game is 10 years old Why can't they bring it back It's super helpful with the immersion
7/10 A lot of dumb controversy for a decent game great visuals needs optimization parkour is much smoother then other assassins creeds most haters have not put in time with the franchise to understand what the game is even about this is not a perfect game though my one HUGE problem with this game is the lack of trees you can climb you're a dam ninja that cant climb 90 if the trees.anyway 7/10 seems fair 30fps cap in cut scenes is an immersion killer
Ghost of
been waiting for a japan or china AC TY UBI
fun
Beautiful story epic fighting incredible stealth lovely build-a-hideout function impressive graphics Overall 11/10 Game Totally would recommend to anyone who is willing to give it a try Don't listen to the haters haters will always hate
Elon Musk is a fraud confirmed
1 2 3 4
Probably the best Assassin's Creed And I really REALLY REALLY liked the Odyssey
she assassin on my creed till i shadows
Seems optimized to push hardware sales with some lower settings producing artifacts Store link overlay on menu screen and login required to start
Besides Ubisoft Connect being a pain Assassin's Creed Shadows checks all the boxes
GOOD
play in japan before anime existed 10/10
I will preface this by saying that if you don't like the standard AC/Ubisoft Open World formula this game isn't going to change your mind It is very much that experience Oh and yes the Ubisoft Connect garbage is terrible and needs to not ever be a thing That said I think this game is worth checking out albeit on a relatively deep discount for most Elephant in the room too but there are micro transactions though as far as I can tell it's mostly if not entirely cosmetics There's probably also shortcut kits or currency stuff to avoid grinding but the grinds for those aren't egregious to the point where I've even checked at least as of 17 hours in focusing side questing Moving onto presentation I think there's a lot to love here The game looks really really good and runs shockingly well I do have some complaints as facial animations in particular are pretty rough but they're not terrible Sound is Iffy the music choice went more for modern sounding hip-hop over more old school Japanese instruments/sounds which is off-putting The English Voice acting is also Not the greatest I'd recommend going for Immersive Mode to change voices to Japanese if it's that jarring though I switched it off since the lip-syncing is for the English voices and I found I preferred having properly synced faces to better voiceovers In terms of gameplay there's a lot to like here Again there's nothing groundbreaking but I do like how they let you pick between the rah rah kill everyone and don't even attempt subtlety and the more standard stealthy assassin style of play Both characters can fight direct or go stealthy but they're both very heavily tuned for their preferred style I went with normal difficulty for both stealth and fighting I found that ticking the stealth difficulty up made the game kind of annoying and I imagine some later missions aren't tuned around the additional detection can't say for certain since I'm not straight lining the main story though based on Black Flag being the last AC game I played I'd imagine some missions getting really annoying with easier detection Overall as someone who doesn't play as much AC as I probably honestly want to it's a very good time and will likely get your money's worth Although it's not groundbreaking at all Solid recommend although unless you're really really into it which you're probably not if you're reading reviews I'd wait for a sale
This game is amazing I love the graphics the kill animations and most of the time even the story This may be the best AC game since black flag
N/A
h1][quote table tr th tr tr th th tr table quote][/h1
Its not bad just pretty boring Bad voice acting Bad story Decent combat If you are interested in this type of game then i recommend to just play Ghost of Tsushima or Rise of the Ronin instead
Best AC since Odyssey Both great protagonists but you should play on the Immersive mode with Japanese voice acting Only bad thing is the lack of the ability to wait and progress time of day That's sort of crazy for a Ninja game What kind of Ninja doesn't sleep till sun down
I don't understand how people can force hate on this game It's so beautiful and the animations and graphics have improved sooooo much since Valhalla and mirage I hope Ubisoft wont fall Also who cares if you dont like Yasuke bc hes black he adds so much to this game
This is the most soul-draining Creed ever Been waiting for the Japan setting forever and wow can a game possibly get more repetitive and unenjoyable than this h2 b]Good:[/b][/h2 list Japan Japanese voice actors are great Music is very nice graphically beautiful the vegetation is especially well done playing on a 3080Ti Temples are well recreated Koyasan especially almost exactly like real life Customizable hideout is something new and very cool list h2 b]Bad:[/b][/h2 list Scout system Very annoying such a waste of time Horses are copy and paste from previous ACs No effort was made Story is terrible insanely excruciating to watch the cutscenes Facial animations almost nonexistent You play Yasuke for 10m and then Naoe for what feels like an eternity enough time to forget that Yasuke is even in the game Right after father dies you get a flashback about her father which completely takes you out of the vengeful emotion they were trying to convey also it's kind of hilarious that the first thing you do is train for combat with him when just minutes ago you were slashing entire armies The Iga meditation flashbacks are such an excellent way to break immersion and fragment the story Sync points are all in the most horrible inconvenient locations possible Not enough of them a waste of time Parkour is bad like nothing is made for parkour Magnetically follows the top of temples flow well not enjoyable Animations feel disconnected from one another AC Unity felt superior This is what I used to enjoy most about AC What happened Yasuke can move this Are you kidding me Also Yasuke climb castles What kind of Creed is that Being forced to switch characters to do certain things is stupid Yet another waste of time As least this message reminded me that Yasuke was in the game RPG/level system Completely hinders natural exploration removes the fun forces you to grind Combat system I understand the praise actually very mid Every mission so far has been extremely boring Even the ones with were not entertaining and poorly orchestrated Exploration is painful you can no longer cut through vegetation and forced to follow extremely boring paths You can no longer climb anything Trying to cut through vegetation will often result in you getting stuck and having to reload the game making you waste even more time I guess more realistic but not fun Games are supposed to be fun Even areas around some castles were poorly designed you can get stuck and will need to reload The world is pretty much dead The towns feel dead very underwhelming Very repetitive too no sense of awe or discovery all the same there is no surprise no sense of interaction with anything You skip the night are you kidding me Half the game is spent barely seeing anything You need to take so literally Yes the nighttime looks good but nowhere near as beautiful and vibrant as the daytime Rain wind and fog Why is it always so rainy foggy or windy legit infuriating When not night you have a 5 minutes window to actually enjoy the environments before another thunderstorm Some parts of the game look like they were procedurally generated and others are straight up unfinished areas with terrain devoid of trees just bare geometry AAAA gaming I guess Photomode is a downgrade from previous entries at least on PC the interface is slow and inconvenient to use World map is slow and not properly reactive when zooming in/out and moving around on PC both using the keyboard and the mouse Clutter and microtransactions are back No more bird to fly around It would seem especially useful and nice to have in this AC but it was deleted Game crashes sometimes apparently been fixed list h2 b]Conclusion b][/h2 What I thought would be a big tech upgrade and revival of the franchise ends up being an incredible letdown Game had massive potential even for DLCs with new prefectures/islands But already extremely repetitive and exploration is a pain Gameplay/parkour fun Everything seems made to waste your time Atmosphere is off and hard to enjoy the environments due to the unskippable nights and exaggerated weather system Some parts of the game feel unfinished Story is abysmal I seriously wish good luck to Ubisoft trying to sell another AC game to me ever again and coming from a Ubisoft sheep who bought every single Creed game
craziest redemption of a franchise beautifully executed game 8.7/10

dobre skradanie Recenzja w jednym zdaniu Bardzo dobry Creed
Absolutely great
First off the good naoe is beautiful that's it the bad this game is a product of woke propaganda that instead letting players be immersed in the world of japanese culture and become a samurai they gave us an option to play a black dude smashing gates as he is bigger than an oxen ramming mid size japanese and beheading them We just want to play as a japanese samurai not some black dude this is outrageous plus ramming the doors by sprinting have I mentioned that before oh right I had goodness gracious this is hilarious Gates are usless for Yasuke as he is as big as an oxen Controls are clunky unlike other AC games controls the automatic horseback riding to enjoy the view was also remove the devs are giving us less and making us pay more the QoL is wooooooorse I love Naoe but I really like to play and role play as samurai but can't do that without laughing and at the same time feeling cringe with this Yasuke fellla Ghost of Tsushima is waaaaaay better than this crap and that game is far older than this Storywise it is bland sooo bland it is boring no depth unlike Ghost of Tsushima KCD2 and other RPG out there every fewsteps are cutscenes that lacks power Plus this game is forcing to use Ray Tracing i know others will say get a better hardware but not all gamers have that capability out there there are majority of players who are have no way of playing games with Ray tracing on as they cant upgrade as of course some have other priorities simple option to enable the players to turn it on or off was not included leaving players to force to play in lower fps This game could have been the BEST AC game they ever released but no 1 first is the character Yasuke a black dude over tons of japanese characters you could've based on during that era really 2 QoL are soooo bad forcing players to do more work and play in their most inconveniece 3 Story is bland animations are repeatitive 4 Controls are clunky 5 Ubisoft connect on a singleplayer game plus anti cheat this shows that the developers DOESNT CARE for their consumers they don't care what will make the gamers life convenient as long as they can provide crap that we will pay for I am just bummed that I played long enough for me to unable to refund this rubbish but I want to see it through so I could give a proper feedback and trust me I tried to like this game in extent of buying it did not even refund this so I could provide as honest feedback as I could give for people saying this is a good game they are total liars they lie and the Very Positive reviews are fake for sure and it is most likely a very positive ones as people who doesn't support this crap of a game didn't buy it so there will be no people to not recommend it but even so you can see lots of people who bout not recommending this game Like I said DO NOT BUY THIS GAME PLEASE IT IS A TRAAAAP
Game Bad PC Good Game no go good on pc game bad SHould have known ubisoft bad triple a game bad

Unironically one of the best open world stealth games since MGSV I fucking hate Ubisoft as a larger conglomerate but the dev team that worked on this They're talented and passionate and it shows in the game Highly recommend
so dope
After playing Valhalla and getting bored after 10-15 hours this game has been much better It looks good is fun and a step back in the right direction It also runs well under Proton which for me is a must I'd recommend if you liked any of the other open world games like Odyssey and maybe even if you haven't played any of the other games
The game is good but very boring
Depois de Black Flag agora o q mais curti Pra quem gosta de fazer secundarias como eu um prato cheio O Defeito que a das de acordo com seu e da da Ficam varias historias pela metade mesmo no modo o qual estou jogando esperando pra ser completada senti que se perde um pouco o engajamento nos personagens da Tem muito e muitas builds legais Estou com 60 horas e agora que cheguei na metade do jogo Ponto forte que da pra jogar com 2 personagens completamente opostos Um porradeiro e um furtivo da agradar os 2 estilos ou qdo cansar de um jogar com o outro Nota 9
This game is fantastic If you are a long time Assassin's Creed fan you will love this game The setting the graphics and world are all beautiful I am really enjoying Shadows even more than I thought I would
hemen bitti

The game is well done the environments are nice and the combat is also satisfying
Yasuke
All in All its a pretty good game that im enjoying my time with If your coming into this expecting some brand new breakthrough game this isnt that its just what fans of AC are used with better graphics and combat The knowledge system is kind of annoying but manageable My one bad thing about this game is the facial animations and voice acting i dont know what they were doing but it isnt great 7/10 for me
Beautiful
cet exellent
Best AC game since Origins Great visuals really fun sandbox and pretty compelling narrative 8/10
This game is best described as quantity over quality I think It is probably largest open world title I have ever seen but it's definitely the emptiest You will not find anything if you go off the path the game is about going to pings on the map and finding out which activity is there except the wildlife paintings which are randomly encountered There are no puzzles unique challenges or mechanics to explore Levelling up felt more like a punishment instead of a reward because the enemies get stronger with you Part of the problem is that you have to level up your gear with resources which after a certain point you have to grind for since the upgrade cost gets pricier every time If you don't do that the enemies will be stronger while you stay the same and just straight up feel weaker After unlocking the second playable character it even get's worse because now you need to manage another set of gear Yasuke would be a greater addition if switching characters was smoother or it wasn't forced on the player to use him The story is not bad but gets cringey at parts and is quite predictable The presentation is spot on both in the visual and sound aspect with only the facial animations lacking in quality After 30 hours I can confidently say that in the first 10 hours I got to see almost everything that the game has to offer It is just stretched out for around 80 hours more
story is ok main characters ok lots of bugs and crashes parkour mechanic is very jenkee NPC are just dumb to be honest if you do your proper research it just spits on Japanese history Ubisoft shouldnt of used a real person from history exaggerated his story to fit a narcissistic manipulative agenda

ESTA ENTRETENIDO Y GRAFICAMENTE ES HERMOSO SI TE AN GUSTADO LOS ULTIMOS ASSASINS RPG ESTE TE VA ENCANTAR POR AHORA NO E TENIDO BUGS Y CORRE MUY BIEN EN 2K A MAS DE 100 FPS CON UNA RTX 4070 SUPER CON TODO EN ULTRA Y DLSS
ter vontade de jogar o Odissey e o Valhalla me veio a vontade de jogar esse AC me arrependo.bom jogo O que joguei foi o Mirage eu prefiro o estilo RPG do Mirage e dos jogos de AC anteriores ao Origins mas enfim mesmo sendo nesse estilo RPG eu gostei do jogo assim como gostei do Origins recomendo
The game is fantastic Great story interesting characters fun and satisfying game-play and beautiful visuals and sound design
Despite the internet being up in arms over this game it actually turned out to be pretty decent and I'm not even into Assassin's Creed It's not perfect specifically its progression mechanics and story is pretty lackluster yet in terms of its fantastic world and surprising level of historical detail it still finds ways to go above my expectations Definitely recommending to anyone who enjoys Japanese history specifically that of the sengoku period 1467-1615
Graphics are insane Naoe gameplay is peak
Negatives are it's the typical ubislop open world with the same repetitive activities through out the map The animations can be janky and enemy AI could use some improvements Positive is the world is beautiful to explore The characters quests and story are interesting Having different protagonists gives different gameplay options which is neat Despite the negatives it's still the best of the nu-Assassins creeds with how much effort they put into the world and quests
Naoe a baddie

h1 This is my advice if anyone see this review h1 It is best if you make your own opinion by watching some walk through any youtuber is fine but remember make your own opinion regardless of what the youtuber says I have more than 20 hours and only starting Act 2 I tried to review the good and bad ones from my game time and there's a couple of things that I need to say h3 Micro transaction h3 It's actually a game progression level where you do some weekly challenges level it up and collect the rewards ohh and its a one time only So far the game never slap those things while I play the game and I sometimes forgot that they exist h3 Denuvo h3 Surprisingly it runs well like REALLY WELL for a DRM game Never had a stutter or anything But hey if you still dont like DRM in this game its fine Everybody has different taste h3 The weather and season change your playstyle completely h3 Ermm yeah its a yes and no If you play like a normal person would you are just gonna do the old hide assassinate and what not just like the previous game The season only add flavour and some miniscules advantage and disadvantage on your approach The only thing that change our playstyle is when we play whether as Naoe or Yasuke Other than that I just do the same thing pillaging some castle I'm gonna copy one of the review which simplified my opinion about this game Credit VolKan b Not as bad as everyone is saying it is b b Not as great as everyone is saying it is b b If you got the money to spare buy it b b If you don't got the money to spare skip it b
O problema que se tem nesse jogo que a DLC foi junta Fora isso o jogo excelente jogabilidade maravilhosa e muito boa Depois que platinei aguardo da DLC para voltar a essa maravilha
The game runs horribly even with beyond recommended settings The stealth is terrible The AI is terrible The story is terrible The parkour and movement is disastrously bad The entire audience for this game is people with No brain No prior assassins creed experience before origins People so incredibly bored they'll play anything for any amount of money The original games were far more historically accurate they didn't make characters gay for no reason other than to push a narrative(especially when they're making all of the important historical figures gay that he can have a relationship with that is far left DEI woke garbage It's beyond disrespectful to the Japanese people Please keep your fan fic out of history Because nobody with a brain wants to play a gay dystopian past
Favorite since Odyssey Which i adored Miss my eye in the sky tho
I booted up this game expecting more slop like the last game I was thankfully wrong Ignore the grifters on Twitter Play the game for yourself and make your own opinions I did exactly that and I'm in love with the world
Honestly great game hate for no reason
bis jetzt nach 19 stunden ist dass spiel einfach top leute die das spiel eine negative Rezension geben die haben einfach nichts gefunden wo man haten kann weil ubisoft mal was gutes gebracht hat ist schon echt schade wie schlecht die leute es reden kampfsystem ist wieder gut geworden grafik ist top beim soundbug ja und gut kann man game neustartet ist es gefixt und die open world einfach zu
As an Asian male living in the West I can actually get some of the outrage/controversy of first time Asian setting with protag not being Asian male when all previous entries allowed you that choice BUT this is a videogame after all and it should be judged on just that a VIDEOGAME This honestly is a solid 9/10 game Every major category aside from MTX hit the mark as far as gameplay graphics and story Its very polished for 1.0 and easily top 3 AC of all time beside black flag and ur choice Very happy for Ubi and AC fans
PLAY THIS GAME
Great graphics pretty easy a lot of targets so the replablity is high get the game and make your own opinon
GOOD
I love being sneaky but if going in loud is called for I love that my characters that can handle either This has become my most favorite game over Horizon Forbidden West and even GOW Ragnarok The world is gorgeous and the combat is slick and responsive I was able to get right into the story from the start and there are different kinds of quests and activities to pursue Thank you Devs for giving us little piglets for our Homstead
Termine todos los AC y voy a terminar este pero la verdad es que estoy aburrido se hace muy repetitivo(aceptar buscar en mapa lugar de viajar a lugar de perder el tiempo con los 4 mismos simples tipos de evento de mundo mientras se llega en lugar de buscar con vista de matar o robar objetivo ver cut-scene REPETIR REPETIR REPETIR Agregaron como 30 40 monos siempre con los mismos patrones de ataque y por supuesto incluso en experto siempre va a ser igual como todo en AC si farmeaste lvl y equipo legendario los mobs son flanes Mas del drama y de la de Ubisoft de elegir estos personajes y el marketing que tuvieron para el juego que a mi no me afecta porque soy un ignorante de la cultura japonesa tengo que decir como juego es un 7/10 como historia es un 7/10 en graficos para mi 10/10 pero con una 3070RTX 64GB RAM y un 13gen intel anda para el OGT por suerte usando LS saque de 40fps con ray tracing todo alto y lo escale a un solido 120fps Voy a terminarlo y capaz cambio el negativo por el positvo pero la verdad que no es recomendable a este precio los bugs mas obvios y groseros de los AC siguen apareciendo jajja
The graphics and art style are simply amazing DLSS and FSR deliver a smooth 60fps at 4k for me at med/high settings The story telling is improved from Oddy/Valhalla and less cartoony I hope it keeps improving The combat still seems clunky with lock-on and camera issues but it's decent enough I guess the devs still can't figure it out when I get too annoyed by it I just go play NIOH 2 for a bit UBI's scummy launcher and micros are still here Overall I recommend it if your pc is strong enough to enjoy it The fact that the fanatic MAGA cult lunatics lose their mind over this game is just icing on the cake
A fun play if you're a fan of the recent AC games The combat exploration and general vibe are reminiscent of AC Odyssey
As much as I would have loved to watch Ubisoft take another L I can't deny that this is probably the best AC game that's come out in years Apparently it took facing the very real possibility of bankruptcy for this circus of a company to get its act together But just look at the results 90 of the Origins RPG nonsense has been removed There's no more stupid Time Savers for you to purchase Assassinations actually kill the target again with just a few exceptions to keep the game interesting The brainless modern age narrative has been reduced to a 2 minute cutscene at the beginning of the game There is unfortunately a battlepass old habits die hard I guess but it's free and almost completely irrelevant to to actual game And now finally with all the old baggage burned AC is allowed to focus on its one shining truth Breaking into castles and stabbing people is fun The stealth is stylish and interactive while the combat which I initially thought looked like shit in the trailers feels amazing to play and is a blast to pull off With the core stabbing gameplay well and truly nailed Ubisoft has set about making a gigantic map absolutely PACKED with huge Japanese castles for you to tackle And for as much hate as it got I personally think that the dual protagonist plan was a brilliant move Ubisoft had two groups of fans to please the meathead tourists that wanted a gorefest power fantasy Origins Odyssey Valhalla and the snobby purists that wanted a classic AC game Brotherhood Revelations Black Flag Splitting the protagonist into two very different popular styles ninja or samurai and letting the player pick their poison was a great way to make sure that everyone gets what they want and that the game stays on theme But even with all that praise Ubisoft needed a smash hit to save their brand and I just don't think that this game will cut it It's still got just about everything that makes the AC games suck Lots of boring travel time bouncing back and forth between uninteresting objectives before you can even THINK about stabbing someone WAY too many characters for literally any of them to be memorable even the leads are pretty dry Mountains of dialogue that you will inevitably start skipping slippery slope Genuine historical information and research that is absolutely wasted on the audience of these games pls just let us stab someone I somehow managed to get a lot of fun out of Shadows despite its flaws Like I said before this is the best Assassin's Creed game that's come out in years But unfortunately for Ubisoft it's still Assassin's Creed
Ghost of Tsushima
Great mechanics added to game and great story Only 10 hours into the game and already one of my favorites of the entire the Assassin's Creed franchise
compared to past titles it has been cleaned up a bit of the HUD in terms of constant pop ups of quest like in origins or odyssey
no hizo falta jugarlo mucho para darme cuenta de que no es un Assasins Creed aunque si creo que supera a sus 3 antecesores esta muy mal optimizado pero si tenes buena pc safa sino a esperar parche xD el parkour esta piola no al nivel de unity pero esta bueno y el sistema de combate es entretenido si esperas que sea un AC de la vieja escuela mejor comprate los viejos xD
recommended good game good graffic good fight good story line to rpg is good

Follows the usual AC formula with enough changes to keep things from being too stale Is it fun Absolutely
I've never seen a single player game so AGGRESSIVE with NOT LETTING YOU PLAY if anything off is going on with your save file Try starting a quest and the game crashes Congratulations You now have to delete ALL YOUR SAVES and start the game offline JUST SO IT WON'T CRASH ON STARTUP
👍👍👍
As fun as the gameplay is the game is so badly optimized that you're likely to have assassinations not play leaving Naoe floating in the air for a few seconds as well as the UI not loading for long periods of time struggling to move anywhere without the game forcing to stay paused to load in the map graphics not loading the high-res versions when you're right up in their face etc If you want to play this game buy the console version until Ubisoft finally fixes the performance issues Even with a god tier computer these issues are unavoidable
Having a blast Really good game Looks beautiful and is very fun If you liked AC Odyssey you will love this game
Me Likey
Love it the best AC for me best combat till now and I fk love Japan
gg
Well done story Good Combat all around what i expect from the Assassin's Creed/Ubisoft
66666
I'm having a lot of fun
good job
sehr positiv
Finally an AC game set in Japan Fighting seems tighter than the previous entry and the graphics are insane Helps that it makes the anti-woke mob all butt hurt too
One of the best Assassin's Creed games I've ever played
mocno odradzam dobrze kase xd
Very repetitive exactly the same as the last few AC games just in a new location
Najbardziej przebajdurzona gra
By far best AC game in the series everything is done so well I highly recommend this game If you fork over 70 bucks then wait for a sale but you will def get more than your worth 9.5/10
bardzo dobra gra i grafika opcja w opcji
I had fun in Act 1 before I unlocked Yasuke Spent about 14 hours in Act 1 then I started getting bored I'll keep playing a little longer to see if it gets any better Performance is iffy just like some of the tools and skills in this game Nothing works 100 percent of the time Brian Fantana would be proud
Best Assassins Creed game since Unity Meaning the most updated engine
its good but the controls on pc are a little wonky so had to rebind them the graphics are amazing and sounds feels like im actually there in japan some of dodge and parry mechanics are hard like you have to really be aware of your surroundings and do hit and runs don't try to fight large groups you'll die and have to restart far from where u were so save constantly and load from those saves the auto save still spawns you far from where u were but the game runs smooth and its pretty good not as good as lord of the rings shadow of mordor but its up there in say like the combat style
love it best ac rpg yet
The game is nice it gives me a similar feel to origins however the world appears a lot more polished and more compact a good thing easier to traverse It feels good to play and it can be even be a bit challenging at times when the game design forces you to find a way to use stealth effectively Graphics are beautiful it's an Ubisoft Open World game after all If you are on deck turn the sharpening in graphics it's a bit too strong by default The environment design gets a bit repetitive however at least the level layouts in e.g castles is unique-ish making this a lot more fun to explore than e.g black flag's castles At first glance 8/10 As a side note 10 hours in on my steam deck and no crashes yet I'm impressed that Ubisoft has been able to deliver a game that doesn't crash every few hours or leak ressources/memory continously I also appreciate it being verified for deck this made me actually buy it for full price within the first weeks instead of waiting for protondb reviews to come in
Best AC game since Origins 9/10
be honest as a huge AC fan I went into this with pretty low expectations because of the politics surrounding this game But actually pretty fun and has surpassed what I expected The graphics are really good and it runs pretty well optimized but a patch or two hurt The open world is absolutely breathtaking Character models could use some work though not gonna go into the pedantic discussion on historical accuracy I just wanted a good open world action/adventure game set in feudal Japan and I believe AC Shadows delivers on this
bon jeu
Great Games so far
never bored of the game
show
It's made a really good first impression
Not sure why this game gets so much hate its pretty solid i love the combat im starting to think hating on ubisoft is like hating on nickleback
It's a brilliant game The world is absolutely beautiful The combat is fun as heck I'm having a blast with it GG Ubisoft on this amazing game
good game haters are racist incels
Great blend of samurai/ninja assassin play styles
Let me preface this review with All the rage bait controversies hating etc on social media I never really followed There's certainly some validity there for some things but for the most it seems very much overblown Do I think Ubisoft could do better Yes absolutely Do I hate Ubisoft Connect Yup but it's not the worst thing in the world and I've been using it for a lot of other older AC games in the past It's worked and I honestly don't mind it because well I'm usually playing this game connected to a desktop PC with an active internet connection Now for the actual game itself which is what this review is really about First off the English voice acting is.well it could honestly be A LOT better Nothing against the voice actors but in a game set in Japan it just feels so off Luckily you can change the voice acting to Japanese and it is SO much better and provides a little more realistic immersion into the game Second the story Well so far it's basically kill bill but in Japan Again not bad but it's not as riveting as say your first time with Ezio in AC:2 Then again it's still kind of a revenge story so.take it for what you will It's serviceable but nothing mind-blowing Third the music It's fine Again serviceable but certainly the soundtracks seem a little.not appropriate for the time setting I guess It's not bad For me it's not overly distracting Now finally we get to the big meat-and-potatoes The Gameplay Honestly I'm having a TON of fun with it If you've played Odyssey or Origins chances are like me you found that there was almost TOO much to do and the RPG mechanics were too much in your face and ugh it just didn't FEEL like AC Sure they tried to reinvent it but maybe they went a bit far with that AC Shadows does kind of a blend between systems you saw in Odyssey and Origins and blends it with probably I would say Black Flag in a way Parkour is simpler RPG mechanics make sense the combat mechanics are servicable and actually engaging because you can't just spam attacks though you could and make an ass-assin heh of yourself For the true purists you can even turn ON Guaranteed Assassinations which.I feel would make the game too easy Without it on heavy enemies with heavy armor and weapons actually can't be assassinated from the get-go because well turns out blade can't pierce heavy armor that well Whoulda thunk So the game actually blends that all pretty well in my opinion There's plenty of collectables and lore about Japan and the story to be found throughout the game and I'm enjoying actually getting to explore Japan There's even tiny little attention to details such as when Naoe steps inside a building her shoes come off though there's no animation but that makes sense for a sense of flow or not being able to harm animals and not climbing on Torii gates All-in-all they did a really great job with portraying Japan in the 1500s and I'm really pretty ecstatic about the attention to detail they gave the game to give you an authentic feel for how Japan would have been like in those days Yasuke not included So in conclusion if you still have mad hate for Ubisoft you're not going to like this game or Ubisoft any better because let's face it you're already on the rage-bait cult that has become the internet as of late and that's probably not going to change unless you go touch some grass and learn to form an opinion of your own If however you can appreciate a game made by thousands of dedicated designers developers actors etc and can appreciate that yes there are some flaws with this game and yes Ubisoft could stand to do a hell of a lot better as a company but you can look at this game independently and understand the hard work and dedication that went into making this game a reality and not a shite-fest like a lot of people expected you will probably like this game Fans of older and maybe some newer AC games will find enjoyment here If you're a diehard fan maybe look elsewhere I give this game a 4/5 Play it finish it If you're not dying to play it wait for it to go on sale
Some good looking AAA to enjoy and doesn't take me 2 hours to beat a samurai
So far I highly recommend Assassin's Creed Shadows It is actually a lot of fun more than you'd think with all the negativity surrounding it Of the four RPG AC games I would have to say this is my second favorite one I think it is better than both Origins and Valhalla but I do still like Odyssey a little more Now onto the game itself Firstly the setting is magnificent I am actually speechless with how beautiful the world is and how actually fun to explore it is I am always getting sidetracked and not even by gameplay events but literally just by walking around and enjoying the world Then you have the combat This is by far my favorite AC combat system it improves on Valhalla's great combat making it less floaty Very brutal as well Now I'll tie the stealth into the characters as it differs for each one On one hand you have Naoe She is a Shinobi the true assassin I really love playing as her The stealth in this game when using Naoe is great Stalking from the roofs or bushes taking down enemies one at a time etc etc It rocks Parkour is just meh same as the other RPG games I will say it is an improvement but mostly just in the animations available Otherwise the older AC games are still better in that regard Then there is Yasuke He sucks at stealth and parkour Obviously that is not his purpose He is a tank and my god he is good at being THE tank He feels like Eivor Since it is AC I do prefer Naoe but Yasuke isn't bad by any means just not my style of play The story is also pretty good I really like their choice of music it is much different than normal and I think the Flight did a wonderful job this time around The writing is pretty strong with the main quests as well as the smaller side quests as Naoe when you revisit Iga Typical quests though taking down the big bad order Downsides well there's a couple Few bugs where proper enemies don't spawn in castles can't complete them Facial animations aren't the greatest could be better This is mainly a nitpick I don't think it should effect your opinion on the game as it is optional but paid cosmetics just seem off just let us get them via hard quests or something It is a singleplayer game not a mp one Those were my main issues honestly not bad at all for a new release Overall I do recommend this game It is quite fun and I think it has the potential for a massive amount of hours of FUN gameplay
Gra obsrana oszczana orzygana ale koty
Me encanta de los que han salido me parece el mejor Si hay cosas que se pueden mejorar como por ejemplo que en las aparezcan los cascos que se usando al momento y que se vean las armas Es un poco frustrante al punto de hablar con un npc y que el casco desaparezca de la nada y vuelva a aparecer Por lo se siente fluido solo en diversas situaciones que hay de FPS estoy con un ryzen 7 5800x y una 3070ti y va de maravilla solo por de fps cuando abro y cierro el mapa por ejemplo
evrey thing
Pomimo gram w 40 fps'ach to jako osoba Originsy i ma sentyment do black flaga ta gra mocno mi Po pierwszych 10 godzinach na eksploracji jestem zadowolony z samej gry to przez fakt gram w ten albo po prostu odczuwam spory sentyment do franczyzy Lub przez fakt ceny tej gry XD ale mam te gre na 100 Polecam dla klimat Azji wschodniej I nie sporych odwzorowania historycznego bo nie o tym ta gra
5 hours in and enjoying myself Solid start to the game and already introduced characters that I'm going to care about what happens to them Hideout building minion gathering mark assassinating and greater lord plotlines Fun so far
I was waiting for a long time for an Assassin's Creed based in Japan and Ubisoft delivered an amazing game Haven't finished it yet because I like walking and enjoying the beautiful scenery Graphics are fantastic My only issue is that you can't play the game from start to finish with only one character I would love to play two different campaigns based on different play style Congratulation to Ubisoft and the whole team for this game
S game First time playing AC This game is VERY nice
Great game if you're itching for that Assassin's Creed experience Don't listen to the anti-woke gamer rage rhetoric that seems to be spreading to more and more games these days It's not to say this is a perfect game there's no such thing I dislike the map layout and some of the invisible walls that make getting from point A to point B a drag The game also starts out slow with a lot of dialogue and a lot of flashback stuff but I'm a Kojima fan so it's nothing I can't handle I will say I like the differences in playstyle between the two characters You can choose to go the classic stealth route or take on a more head-on approach that is more similar to Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Ragnarok You also often get a choice to spare or kill your enemies which I'm hoping has some story payoffs later on but we will see Music is cool They mix in some modern Japanese rock in some points of the story which I think is a nice addition The voice acting isn't necessarily the best but it also makes me wonder if some of those choices were deliberate The seasons and weather change throughout the game which is a nice touch There are also some differences in the world depending on where you go which is nice as well You get some beautiful nature but also some war torn areas that gave me a very Princess Mononoke vibe The differences in weapons is fun to experiment with a well It's nice to see it's not only katanas and hidden blade stuff Overall good game I also understand some people hesitating because of the price which I totally understand I think that's an industry issue rather than just an Assassin's Creed or Ubisoft issue though If you feel that strongly about it put this sucker on your wishlist and wait for a sale just like every other game out there PS Maybe stop trying to find everything bad in a game and start looking for the things that bring you joy That's a mindset thing I think a lot of people need to start implementing and not just when it comes to video games
This game is one of the best assassins creeds in a long time The environment looks amazing and the season change adds a new element to the game The parkour is the most realistic in any assassins game so far If you like the size of odyssey or origins then this game is definitely for you Playing on expert is the most fun way and the way i think it was intended to be played The battle pass is not paid you get the currency in game although their are cosmetic micro transactions if you want them They are not needed I have 25 hours in so far and I've barely scratched the surface I am not a fan of the micro transactions but overall I would give it a 8 or 9 out of 10
this is the first assassins creed game since syndicate 2016 where you actually play as an assassin
game not bad
Probably the best AC so far
nice game IF I COULD RUN IT
The game has all the ambience you are looking for The game has palaces and beautiful street scenes It is breathtaking on an RTX 5080 There are lots of enemies to kill on every part of the map The game doesn't get boring The game has all the ambience and fun you would expect from the creators of i]Assassin's Creed Unity[/i h3]It is more i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i than i]Ghost of Tsushima[/i].[/h3 i]Ghost of Tsushima[/i struggled to hold the player's attention This game makes me want to schedule a trip to Japan's Edo Land It makes me want to rewatch i]The Elusive Samurai[/i The ambience of this game makes the player want to go outside into the real world to experience the real thing The game has an system with inventory items that provide various bonuses I had worries that the bonuses and rarity of such items would give the stink of a live service I was worried about the system just getting in the way playing the game It is a set and forget system that slips into the background It is a non-issue The live service elements from the previous games are not getting in the way There is a major bug where the menus and the UI do not load Avoid this game until they provide a major bug fixing patch It is as if the gameplay was at i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i update 2.0 levels but the bugginess from i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i at launch Wait until it gets patched 6/10
Shadows 100
L'histoire est juste incroyable le on nous met dans le bain Des rebondissements la ou il faut un lore logique bref le jeu est parfait ce niveau la Le de combat est top La entre la et le bourinage et bien permet de pas du tout et par c'est clairement pas redondant Les deux gameplay sont satisfaisant a jouer Vraiment si je dois mettre un TOUT PETIT point ce serait les graphismes qui sont pas parfait mais c'est largement et pardonnable avec la distance d'affichage et la bonne optimisation du jeu Je recommande fortement c'est un excellent jeu sur bon nombre d'aspects
Muito bom
HUH
addicting
h2 25 h2
nice
You become a man of color killing asians in broad daylight Assassins Creed San Francisco is a must play video game 10/10
Combat feel satisfying movement is fluid and stealth is rewarding its not quite the return we wanted but a great game regardless
Best assassins creed since unity
Bottomline upfront Not the major revitalisation I hopped for Pro The athmosphere and Landscapes are beautifull and playing Naoe you get these assasin vibes Con Super grindy controlls are somwhat clunky You have to follow the way since moste mountainsides are almost unclimbable The map is heavily overloaded with loot and bandits combat is repetitive at best sometimes downright borring and anoying since the controlls are not too responsive NPCs have little to non daily routine and appear somewhat plastic and the storry so far is a hard meh It is slightly better than AC Valhalla but a far cry from the really good ACs like 2 Brotherhood and Blackflag Personally I kind of had it after the Valhalla disaster and I am not planning on grind trough another AC just because I like the setting and the landscape
it's-a good
yay
23 Spielstunden aber nur eine Hauptmission erledigt
A masterpiece compared to Valhalla
The story is laughably bad voice acting is just awful but game play wise it's the best of the modern AC games Stealth is excellent in this game It somewhat scratches that Splinter Cell itch
Not as bad as everyone is saying it is Not as great as everyone is saying it is Not the best game ever made but it's fun and that's the only thing that matters
Creed Shadows is a 9/11-level in real-world weight obviously but in the way it spectacularly crashes and burns what been a dream game Ubisoft was handed feudal Japan on a silver platter a setting fans have begged for since they still managed to botch it like it was an experimental beta The opening sequence teases something emotional something then dies a slow death thanks to writing so bland it could be AI-generated and voice acting that makes Siri sound like Shakespeare Naoe our stealthy cardboard cutout of a protagonist delivers her lines like just learned human speech Combine that with a face that has the emotional range of wet tofu and got yourself an less compelling than your average background NPC Seriously even peasants grunting about rice sound more invested Combat Hope you enjoy vu the same few katana animations repeated like a YouTube loop glitch After the 40th slash less samurai fantasy and more unpaid intern doing motion capture on repeat The environment looks you step into the woods and realize entered version of a maze with no exit Beautiful yes Playable Only if you enjoy hiking into frustration And then there's Yasuke A historically intriguing figure reduced to a checkbox Ubisoft clearly wanted to make a point but instead of writing him with depth they just gave him a sword and hoped no one would ask questions less representation and more glorified background noise with a hitbox Enemy AI Hilariously broken Try stealth-killing a guy who's napping and casually stand up halfway through your assassination like he's just remembered he left the stove on You basically have to kill some enemies three times just to convince them bedtime Still playing though Why Because I can pet animals and slice bamboo Which at this point offers more satisfaction than the actual plot Creed Shadows feels like a beautiful cringe laugh but somehow still be having a good time
I tried this game out for myself and expect to enjoy it a lot Guess what Those YouTubers calling it trash and boring are probably just saying that because of their personal agenda against Ubisoft Not the best game ever made but it's fun and that's the only thing that matters
Making an AC character also a ninja is like peanut butter and chocolate It just works perfectly Haven't had this much fun in AC in a decade Also apparently the cultists are working overtime trying to hate this game Expected but extra hilarious given how fun it is so far
Japan
i mean its alright
OMFG Insane Such a beautiful open world I love it
Well Very disappointed Combat is clunky as hell Story is drawn out and a boring blunder the enemy AI is bad traversing the terrain and buildings is bad the parkour system is a complete joke gets stuck on every edge very bad experience Promoted early access and then revoked it Characters are impractical Couldve implemented a companion system that allows you to give allies commands directly instead of a poof of smoke very lame and corny Couldve added For Honors fighting system and done way better Overall a bad buy
cool
My expectations were quite low however I got extremely surprised by the fact that it feels like an old school but at the same time modern Assassins Creed There are still RPG elements which I personally dont mind since I like these types of games But it isnt as RPG heavy as Odyssey Valhalla and Origins I am actually extremely happy To finally be able to have fun with an AC game once again is a nice feeling If you dont like some RPG elements wait for a discount If you do like them go ahead and try it out
wow
great game
Creed Shadows est un excellent jeu avec son univers fascinant et riche en action et exploration est immersive et bien offrant une de jeu fluide et dynamique est au rendez-vous avec des graphismes de qui tournent sans accroc En somme un jeu qui va enfin rabibocher les joueurs avec la licence
10/10
h1 Ubi Quebec cooked h1 Been a fan since my dad got me AC 2 as a kid played all of the main entries from this series and this is by far one of the best Assassin's Creed games they've made The stealth it's the best it has even been the setting is beautiful and fully realized both Naoe and Yasuke are fun to play in their respective roles and have interesting personal stories that loved to experience both as a duo and as separate protagonists Overall for me this is the game I dreamed of as a kid wanting an AC game set in Japan
Assassin's Creed Shadows provides an incredible experience that fans of a game set in Japan needed The open world is absolutely stunning with vast cities and huge castles that bring feudal Japan to life in a way that the video game industry rarely does even games like Ghost of Tsushima or Rise of the Ronin although they're wonderful don't have the architectural beauty and immersion that Shadows brought to us The gameplay is cool the story blends history and fiction together nicely and the world-building immerses you in all the cultural details that I wasn't expecting and it was a surprise However the overly steep mountains of the map can seem inaccessible occasionally breaking the flow of exploration the world could be more flat even if it does cost a bit of realism On the other hand it's disappointing to see the unjustified hate this game has faced.It's a shame that such trivial excuses mask the prejudice of certain people overshadowing a game that deserves to be praised for its bold choices and quality Saying that the Japanese hate the game is erroneous because it's only a few right-wing minorities who are doing so Many are criticizing the game for things that other games have already done before but no one complained about just because of their biases and that's not right it's called a double standard No one is going to destroy temples in Japan because of Shadows this was the same ignorant speech that our parents and grandparents said in 2005 when we used to play GTA assuming that it would make us violent anyone who was a gamer in the 2000s knows what I'm talking about Give it the necessary criticism but in a constructive way For me it's a 9/10 and I thank the developers for their hard work and may they continue to expand the world of Shadows with new content and new regions to explore Thank you for creating the game that the 12-year-old me dreamed of while playing Tenchu or ShinobiDo in PS2 it's like seeing a dream come true
Made a huge comeback after all the other games everything just became better and good again
Beautiful Game I recommend to anyone who loves Japan and it's culture
Overall fun game Not the best game ever made like people want it to be but it is a fun time and that's all I can ask for
Beautiful fun and a good story so far No need to over analyze nitpick etc Just live life and enjoy what's in front of you
Enjoying myself a lot so far The music is incredible combat animations are awesome and the landscape is stunning I feel like I'm barely scratching the surface of the game because I get distracted by all that there is to see with side content Honestly my only negative atm is the lacking facial animations in non-cinematic cutscenes But this isn't a problem exclusive to Ubisoft titles But the emotions in some of the cinematic cutscenes felt raw and even had me crying a bit for one in particular spoiler The scene where Naoe is crying over her father as he dies in her arms spoiler I can't wait to see all that the game has in store I've always been an AC fan and Japan has always been on the top of my wishlist for locations next to Norway and now I've gotten both of those D
perfect game
Community might hate me but I have more fun on this game then Ghost of Tsushima I dont say that GOT a bad game its incredible but Shadows is more fun to me Dont listen Tik Tok and whatever just try the game
un desastre no funciona error de dx12 arrepentidido y decepcion de comprarlo
i understand some of the hate because there are a lot of chinese not japanese things in the game however the game over all the story fighting mechanics gameplay customization is incredibly good keeps you engaged its like you're playing a movie i think they did a great job personally i'd give this game an 8.5/10 and when they add co-op maybe a 9/10 it does have its flaws though aka the annoying side stuff you have to do to rank up your mastery it's very boring other than that amazing game
I mean what was I expecting tbh I just want to play an well written AC game again man preferably one that you play an actual Assassin instead of The Hidden Ones or The Order of The Hidden Blade I want dense cities designed with parkour and social stealth in mind I want linear stories with plots that are well paced and acted Assassin's Creed Shadows isn't even that bad of a game It's just painfully mid like most of the RPG AC games
4 24
10 hours in felt like I've barely scratched the surface of what the game has to offer I have been playing AC games since the first one the RPG versions came out starting with Origins and I have enjoyed them since Im not going to give the usual you should play this cause i think its good Play the game if you liked the other RPG ACs if you didnt you probably wont like this but this game has me hooked and Im enjoying it The combat is a lot more intuitive feels like my weapons have weight instead of just hacking and slashing and using abilities on endless amounts of enemies The Stealth is greatly upgraded from what i recall in the other games sneaking slowly is necessary if you want to assassinate The story line has been ok its the biggest gripe ive seen from reviews but if you like it you do if you dont you dont Make your own opinion and dont ride the hate train or content creators that sit around making youtube thumbnails for clicks about how bad the game is Ubisoft has had its issues but i enjoy the games and worlds they create at the end of the day all that matters is if you enjoy what you bought and feel you got your moneys worth
7.5/10
it's ok
good
Grummz is cringe otaku
Loving this game so much The character animations are amazing and the landscape absolutely beautiful
It's purty gud

Ich habe das Spiel sowohl auf Xbox S als auch als Steamversion und kann nur sagen dass es sich auf beiden Plattformen lohnend ist Shadows zu spielen Technisch es sich aber sagen dass man dieses Mal wirklich kein Lowspec-Gaming machen kann Ich habe es nur geschafft grafisch zu stemmen weil ich mit gemeinsamen VRAM Spreicher 12 GB VRAM habe Ich spiele das Spiel mit einer Geforce 1500 Ti mit nur 4,9 GB dezidiertem Speicher In der Ini-Datei habe ich auch alles von 2 auf 0 gestellt Die Steamversion bitte nur kaufen wenn ihr die Recommended Specs habt also die normalen Voraussetzungen
Game is fun to pass time but run into issues more often then not PC restarts randomly when launching Game crashes frequently NPCs get stuck on anything You can be running to your next quest and get stuck in a random downhill slide mechanic that you cant get out of A dog walked up to me and i was able to pet it that's how i got out Combat is alright inputs sometimes don't work Parkour is alright sometimes doesn't work Forced to go left or right when there's a clear pathway up or down Running automatically makes you parkour onto something when all your trying to do is run past something Cut scenes are long drawn out and sometimes appear when nothing is even said Quest sometimes wont let you talk to the person you need to You'll have to restart the game or load a previous save point The game will also stop allowing you to track quest you'll have to re-enable the setting to do so Definitely not worth 75 by far
As much I'm enjoying the game so far these bugs need to be fixed quick I got stuck in the menu settings where I couldn't go back to the regular pause menu no matter how many times i press Esc or even clicked to go back I was stuck there Buildings take forever to load textures and Character always have tpose Plus more but these are the ones I keep getting
amazing graphic detail and updated fight mechanics
Ubisoft tem que PARAR com essa merda de linkar a conta com a Ubisoft connect deles Comprei o jogo na de jogar tranquilo e tirar minhas sobre mas nem isso tive a oportunidade Ao abrir o jogo aparece o launcher da Ubi Connect pedindo uma chave de sendo que tenho nenhuma e muito menos cheguei a linkar qualquer outra conta ubi em minha conta steam Tentei contato com o suporte deles e NADA infelizmente tive que optar pelo reembolso ubisoft lixo
It's actually really good and enjoyable people just like jumping on the hate train
its fun
I'm a big fan of old Assassin's Creed games I played all of them on diffrent platforms well almost all of them I gave up on two previous games However I decided to buy AC Shadows as my way of saying thank you to Ubisoft for original games AC1 AC2 BHD RVL etc If here is any chance and time to help Ubisoft for what they gave us years ago it's now I played for like 15 hours right now and I am having fun sort of What is unclear for me right from the start First 2 hours of the game are like really really long cutscene It's great that devs wanted to create backstory for new characters but it's just long long long I actually have a theaory that prologue is so long so players can not return this game on Steam there is a limit right 2 hours within 14 days I guess I think that was the main reason they did this so long not will to create good story since after 2 hours there are less cutscens That's not fair Game is fun characters are likeable but I am getting annoyed with looking for characters that hide in diffrent places without any concrete hints east side of XY that's not even a hint since you need to go into all houses to find that one specific NPC xd it is annoying after a while I will consider it 7/10 for now I will update this review when I will complete the game or find something that will drive me crazy
Bugisoft veriyorsunuz yahu bir oyun oyun daki kapatmak oyunu tamamen bozar karakter den sonra oyundan den sorunsuz oynuyordum oyunu bence siz oyunlara daha falan getirmeyin hatalarda olsa oyunun ilk hali daha oluyor

If you're hating on this game you need to reevaluate some stuff
Best Assasins creed game since odyssey
Story graphics gaqmeplay Enjoying every second of playing this
it ran great for the frist 20 hours once i got to the next area that stays with a Y in the story it has crashed like 5-6 times last night hoping it was just a fluke game play has been great and so has story
nie to powiem ale to jest naprawde dobra gra grafika i fabula sa prawie idealne wedlug mnie jedyna rzecz ktora mi sie nie podoba to combat ktory moze sie znudzic po jakims czasie bo jedyne co trzeba to naciskac lewy przycisk myszy W grze kontrolujemy dwoma bohaterami Naoe oraz Yasuke Naoe to mloda shinobi ktorej ojciec umarl w ataku na Jej gameplay skupia sie bardziej na skradaniu oraz parkourze moim zdaniem jest bardzo przyjemny Yasuke to samuraj z innej krainy za wiele o nim nie powiem bo mam dopiero w grze 15 godzin i nie mialem przyjemnosci za dlugo nim pograc lecz jego gameplay napewno bardziej sie skupia na wbijanie na przeciwnikow Ogolnie polecam gre 9/10
5/5 A Masterpiece of Stealth and Combat in Feudal Japan Creed Shadows brings the long-awaited journey to feudal Japan and Ubisoft has absolutely nailed it The game offers an immersive open-world experience blending stunning visuals fluid combat and deep storytelling Pros Two Playable Characters Switch between Naoe the deadly shinobi and Yasuke the unstoppable samurai each with unique abilities and playstyles Breathtaking World Feudal Japan has never looked better from neon-lit towns to peaceful temples The attention to detail is insane Stealth Combat Balance Whether you prefer sneaky assassinations or full-on sword fights the game delivers both flawlessly Engaging Storyline A gripping narrative filled with historical figures betrayals and epic battles Customization Progression Tons of weapons armor and skills to unlock and adapt your gameplay Cons Occasional performance drops on PC though patches are improving it Some RPG elements feel a bit unnecessary Overall Creed Shadows is one of the best entries in the franchise bringing the long-awaited ninja and samurai fantasy to life A must-play for AC fans and newcomers alike Final Verdict BUY IT
I was not overly excited about this game but I've always loved ASSASSIN's Creed I think that is my primary issue with the game it doesn't feel like an Assassins Creed game at all Personally I love the RPG elements AC has been incorporating into their previous couple of releases but it falls completely short in this installment Honestly its just plain boring I do not understand at all the purpose of the two main characters One is a tank and one is an assassin but tbh it doesn't feel different playing either one Stealth doesn't exist in the game and the parkour component is absolute trash I just feel like they could have done so much better especially in the setting/time period
If you liked Odyssey this is basically the sequel to that
Played 6 Hours Didn't hold a candle to Odyssey or Valhalla Sadly Steam only refund with less than 2 hours game-play
Amazing visual game Needs to be on a SSD though Had it on a HDD at first and would struggle with random textures not loading properly or hitting load zones and having to wait for new areas to render in Other than that amazing game so far
HONESTLY AN INCREDIBLE GAME Story is actually peak
The game is absolute blast so far Love it
Love this game for the same reason I love all of the recent AC games It's about as close as you can get to running around in these historical settings as can be While there are some super minor historical inaccuracies they take a back seat to just walking around and feeling like you're there I love this stuff It can be a grind for completionists as there's a LOT of ground to cover not as bad as Valhalla But if you just want to enjoy the setting and story it's really really good
game
o jogo tem se mostrado como um dos melhores creed E olha que nem joguei tanto assim ainda Me deparei com elementos que me deixaram bem animados como um foco forte na do Feudal Combinou DEMAIS com o tema de assasino ninja shinobi Naoe uma personagem com personalidade jogar com ela e tomar as muito imersivo Trilha sonora espetacular O mapa muito bem feito de escalada as melhores que experienciei em todos os jogos da franquia E estou passando pano pra Ubisoft nunca fiz isso Eu gostei do Valhalla por exemplo achei o jogo raso e apesar de esperar ansiosamente por ser tema Viking Mas esse daqui eu tirando o Vale is 350 reais Se vc apaixonado pela franquia como eu vai em frente espera mais um pouco que eles concertem alguns bugs que atrapalhando a gameplay Por vezes fiquei sem som an interface muitas vezes some e volta mais o jogo a travar e precisa reiniciar Tenho uma 4080 de hardware Mas isso tira o da equipe sendo uma
masterclass
This is a real grinding game So far so good just hope it doesn't get repetitive
Its think its good buy it and try it you litteraly have 2 hours of playtime before the refund period is up Decide whether you want to keep it or not Make your own opinion don't listen to hate from people some of which have not even played the game If you think it looks like it's something for you give it a try man It's a beautiful game with a bit flaws but overall i think it's a great game recommend If you're gonna give it a go i would heavily recommend playing with the japanese voice over
Pues muy entretenido y con graficazos El sigilo es muy divertido Con naoe es divertido combinar asesinatos por sigilo y combate El combate es tranquilillo con parrys y esquivas aunque con naoe no te puedes descuidar porque los golpes le hacen mucho Acabo de empezar y parece un juego enorme Mi primer AC y me esta gustando mucho
excelente juego
Elon hates it it must be good
nice
A beautiful and immersive game with satisfying combat Well worth picking up
10/10
100/10 underrated
Good game if you want to have a nice story with a LOT of fighting
More or less what I expect from assassin's creed Formulaic but still fun to play

i'm not sure why but i cant launch the game I press play but it instantly crashes any help or advice would be greatly appreciated

Creed Shadows is a pretty solid entry in the franchise best thing Ubisoft has put out in a while It actually feels like they put effort into the world-building and the feudal Japan setting is absolutely gorgeous with insane attention to detail The dual protagonists are a cool stealth gameplay is the best the series has seen in years and Yasuke brings a fun weighty combat style that mixes things up Sure still got some of usual open-world bloat but at least the missions feel more engaging than the usual checklist formula been stuck on Overall not perfect but compared to Star Wars Outlaws Valhalla Mirage Skull and Bones I can see that they actually put effort and this one actually feels fresh and worth solid 7.5 or 8/10 Pros ✅ Beautiful open world with tons to explore ✅ Smooth and satisfying combat ✅ Stealth gameplay is really well done ✅ Playing as two different characters adds variety ✅ Engaging story with cool historical elements ✅ More fluid and realistic parkour compared to previous games ✅Dynamic weather affects gameplay/Four seasons cycle throughout the game Cons ❌ Some missions feel repetitive ❌ A few minor performance issues here and there ❌ the cutscenes are 30 fps sometimes please fix this ❌ Minor frame rate drops in busy areas like the hideout
i like it so much
Great game Voice acting bad though
7 P.S 7 10
Ne pas la formule mais des Un plaisir jouer et immersif D
Endlich mal wieder ein absolutes Top Assasins Creed
good game fuck ubi
Out of Origins Odyssey and Shadows Shadows is the best one yet Highly recommended
only naoe
The most boring basic game to play and it's worthless
I'm enjoying this game a lot almost as much as my beloved Odyssey This is another easy to love modern Assassin's Creed game A little different getting used to not having a bird Disappointed that I can't experience the entirety of Japan in this format It's an impressive part of the franchise though I mean we have changing seasons that changes the map like 8 times since each season has 2 different states But I cannot get over how wildly cool it is to play a shinobi Assassin I'm not through the entire story but it's becoming clear with the times I find the Assassin's symbol throughout the game it does tie in somewhere to the overall plot of the series Yasuke is a brick house of a character that makes me laugh at the enemies futile attempts to kill him He looks like he could kill you but is a cinnamon roll But also still kinda looks like a cinnamon roll
J'adore Le jeu est beau jouer et surtout bien plus voire Les personnages sont bien Juste dommage qu'en mode de jeu normal je n'ai pas encore les autres les ennemis ne regardent pas davantage vers le haut et ainsi nous voir sur leur toit Point De temps en temps alors que je joue en option graphique j'ai 90FPS constant puis de parfois durant les je tombe 10FPS Gros point positif Le mode immersion qui place les voix en japonais et en portugais j'adore
cut down all the bullshit hate this is really good
One of the dopest games out of the entire series
Story delivery is boring Classic ubisoft voice acting and facial expression this game feels like a long chore gameplay is ok its just how they package this whole thing makes it lacking and unrewarding
Finally good assassin creed game XD
Holy Moly who approved this Sounddesign It is horrible and not even closely fitting to the scenraio It sounds like a soundtrack to an old trash asia movie which does not take it self too seriuosly but this cant be intention or does it Yasuke is a useless plot being and it is a shame that there activities which can ONLY be done with either of the chars It really just feels like 2020 and BLM is in everyones mouth We have an Asia AC in development lets put more diversity into it Sweet baby inc link Over all it is fun and typical AC Finally a crouching possibility The enemy AI is stupid as Overll really mid but still fun to play since AC worlds are always beautifull Ubi still does not understand to fill a world with love and soul since they have a horrible story character and plot design It is mid not thumbs up OR down but I have ti pick something here
Best game in the series
It's like Odyssey or Valhalla but just better Combat is a highlight of this game No bugs or anything that pulls you out of the immersion Less bloated though I personally liked that and more streamlined intuitive than Valhalla Only downside is the story and NPCs are a bit less compelling than other games in the genre and series Not perfect but the flaws in this game are minor and overall it's really fun to play and even has a few areas I think it is differentially good
naoe is her
Simply amazing IMO best AC so far
spectacular game

the combat is the best thing about it
2 2-3 3 3 2 5-6\10 30
This game is growing on me It's admittedly painfully annoying with the ridiculous level system but still an entertaining game The stealth and parkour is a lot more engaging than GoT though the combat feels a bit more finicky Lacks the smoothness of GoT In a sense it's more realistic because I can't take on 50 enemies but it also means every fight with 5 higher level characters ends up being like a generic video game boss battle where I'm rolling around everywhere lol Still Really fun and Naoe is cool
me divertia tanto assim com um AC a anos joguei todos e esse sem duvidas sendo um que mais me faz querer jogar e explorar mesmo sendo repetitivo alguns pontos da mas no final ainda sim um excelente jogo Eu acho que poderia ser um pouco menor esse mapa grande pra caramba haha
Fun game solid entry in the Assassins Creed franchise I last played AC Mirage so the the overall investigative objective board was pretty familiar and otherwise its pretty classic assassins creed game play The dialogue is kinda mid sometimes but its ok The tanky Samurai gameplay and the stealthy Shinobi gameplay are fun in their own ways I often like to roam around as the Samurai to deal with the random encampments and then switch up to go into larger castles stealthy The climbing is fun I like having a grappling hook The Mastery Points come at a pretty steady pace so you unlock things in the 6 skill trees per character at a comfortable rate Performance is also pretty good for me always over 100 FPS except for the 30fps locked cut scenes If you don't want to spend 70 then wait for a sale but its a pretty good Assassins Creed game
super jeu
TOO GOOD TO PLAY
Liebe dieses Game Ghost of Tsushima ist einfach liebe und dann auch noch mit Naoe Gameplay 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
Top Game Finde dieses AC bis jetzt sogar besser als seine
At the beginning the first two hours or so are quite boring It's a tutorial that drags on for too long and after that there's another hour where you actually start to understand the game since the tutorial despite being long does a poor job of explaining how the game's systems work But after that it's surprisingly fun You have control over the targets you'll pursue and unlike previous games there's no marker telling you exactly where they are you have to hunt them down yourself I don't think it's worth paying full price but if you see it on sale you should definitely give it a chance That being said I haven't even seen 10 of what it has to offer so my opinion might change in the future
Jogasso agora presenciei nenhum bug nem nada jogo rodando liso PCzinho aqui com um ryzen 5 e uma RTX3060TI
very fun feels like a great step in the right direction for the ac franchise It is more similar to the older ac games than the new ones which I really enjoy
40/50
very rich in story line good fun and realxing to play
samurai
a fully release game that crashes on a Main mission to unlock a major part of the rest of the game 0/10 in regards to the above other content that require the main mission to progress has locked me out of doing anymore side quests unless i progress through the main quest that crashes bad game design so much for freedom to play how you want illusion of the freedom of choice out here is real LOL
Is this game going to blow your mind Probably not Are you going to have a blast playing it Absolutely The world is absolutely stunning The story is so so The violent encounters are amazing If Ubisoft has done nothing else with this game they have at least proven that the steam deck is still relevant if a team knows how to optimize their game Runs fantastic on the deck If you got the coin pick it up
historia pesima mapa enorme aburrido el combate es horrible los graficos son lindos pero es un juego mediocre si dicen que el juego esta bueno se ve que a la gente le encanta la mediocridad
I was going to wait until this was on sale for like 20 to give it chance that was until Ubisoft decided to let their social media team roast Elmo and that one twitter famous guy who looks like came out the womb as a Reddit mod I had to throw my support behind the genius intern and let our corporate overlords know that the public wants them to use their resources to openly mock people like El*n and G**mmz for being pathetic losers who are in their 50s constantly complaining about nothing StayWoke
i got cooked purchasing this game i wanted to go halves as i family share but this shit kinda dookie and i can't refund it man XD I AM SO COOKED
The game is the best AC in at least 10 years In terms of gameplay it's the best in the entire franchise The combat is fluid and has great animations It's a hardcore parry system and makes it quite difficult at times compared to the other games The stealth is the best ever It's got amazing NPCs and has many different animations and ways to stealthily take on enemies The open world is beautiful and has tons to explore with amazing side quests and activities The cutscene quality still lacks and the voice acting isn't amazing though I'd recommend Japanese Voice Acting as it's a bit better The story isn't a masterpiece but isn't horrible either I'd recommend 8.5/10 game
me like stab me also like stealthy stab stab equals good

ubisoft goat
It was my patriotic duty to purchase Assassin's Creed Shadows after they mercilessly roasted Elon Musk
was having a good time with it but then they patched it and now i cant even get it to launch
Moin super Spiel wer die vorherigen Teile mochte wird zufrieden sein Bin noch nicht durch und normale Review folgt
Need more dismember finisher
It's really good so far Love the characters the storyline and gameplay
Despite the price this game is very enjoyable Not only does it feel fresh in comparison to recent assassins creed games it's in game world is immersive and visually pleasing 16 hours in and I have to admit that I haven't enjoyed any recent assassins creed game this much Ignore all of the BS that the chuds are spouting they are scared of fictional protagonists that don't look like them
I'll write it up later

Way to much hate on this game and in the gaming community in general It's if some people wan't games to be bad and studios to shut down It's very sad Obviously it's not a perfect game No game is perfect but damn the step up from Valhalla is night and day Give this game a chance Whether it's right now or wait until a sale I'm having fun exploring feudal Japan
I just spent 3 hours clearing Himeji and Miki castle for loot I have been playing for days and apparently I have just started the main story This game is a beauty and the combat is fantastic I am usually fast paced in these types of games however this game makes me want to take my time For assassins creed game play style it works well I really enjoy having the capability to customise a hideout I do not like the grid system with no option for overlap Game play scales with you in difficulty making your gear relevant Hoping to expect further combo finishers from future updates Overall great game

Pretty solid game If you liked the other RPG AC games or Ghosts of Tsushima you will likely enjoy this plenty of content very pretty looking and improves over previous titles in a few ways most noticeably stealth On the highest difficulty they actually have working eyes rather good ones in fact They still don't have ears but I'll take the improvement Along with playing on the hardest difficulty at least for stealth I also recommend turning off most of the HUD elements it's all customisable for a much more immersive experience Nothing hugely groundbreaking though if you hate the Ubisoft formula for open world games I don't think this will change your mind My biggest gripe with the game is actually the facial animations They're comically bad lip sync and just everything about them I really don't understand why Ubisoft seem to be years behind on this front compared to other games considering everything else looks really good 2
great game ching wang long dong
uhh idk its a modern ac game and i LOVED odyssey Clearing out camps stealthily and marking them off on the map is pretty much the reason i bought this game and its fine I dont think Yasuke is fun to play and much of the map isnt designed for him to traverse anyway This game would be great if you could just stick to one character the entire time Many if not all quests require you to play as one of them specifically which is annoying on an immersion level but also adds to the already frustrating amount and length of loading screens this is a slop game and im here for some slop so the skill trees are uh just ok i guess you earn ability points really quickly but idk i dont really fw any of the upgrades I also like ac games to passively learn a lil watered down semi-accurate history and this is good idrk any medieval japanese history but i looked up some names and i like that this game does stuff similarly to ac odyssey the story is ok but if youre even considering that in your purchase decision you dont really know what youre getting yourself into The prettiest games ive ever played enjoyable off a few blinkers 7/10 ac game 4/10 game
35 10/10
b]Zero Innovation Bland Gameplay Cringe Writing[/b Not sure what I expected But if you've played any AC game from the past 10 years or so you've played this one After about 15 hours I realized the rest of the game would be identical It's the same bland tired and uninspired combat they've all had This game seems somehow more grindy than the other recent releases I assume by design to have you spend money on their pathetic online store I don't think a company exists that cares less for its customers than Ubisoft Just disrespectful Oh you want that sweet new sword Can't earn that in game You must spend money on top of the 70 you already spent to have the coolest gear And no matter how much grind you put in to this bloated bland fest the gameplay is the same They spent a good amount building out the world with detail and it looks nice but you don't get to learn the territory and appreciate it that much considering you just tag a waypoint and it'll draw a line on screen to follow The game is made for turning your brain off and cycling the same button presses over and over and over again The dialog Yikes Like most of these modern AAA releases it seems like it was written by someone who's never had a significant relationship in their life No one talks like this No one Except maybe in the overly PC world of corporate America It's alarming how awful the writing is in modern AAA games If writing was my profession I would be embarrassed to have my name in the credits of these games So after 20 hours of this game all it made me do is reinstall Ghosts of Tsushima A massively better game in all aspects So for those that want a samauri japanese setting do yourself a favor and go pickup the better option

fun AC game whether you think it's woke or not but I miss Valhalla's combat that let you use weapon in each hand which makes combat more vary and customizable
very repitive the world looks amazing and seasons it goes through is really cool but the first guy you fight in the tutorial is the same as the bosses across the game doesnt matter the level just different numbers with a very simple move set and combat experience
Ghost of tsushima 1.5.0.1
game renders so slowly that it freezes the game completely and then textures dont load in for minutes at a time Story is boring and uninteresting Combat is terrible and repetitive not worth 70
Cant kill and dismember kids bad game
gostei do jogo.vou zerar e tentar platinar
Naoe Amazing young assassin with insane parkour and stealth moves Yasuke Amazing Samurai in combat but a 90 years old grandpa when it comes to parkour exploring looks like noble knight shrek in heavy armour.whenever i run i finally feel playing as shrek Game is 10/10 so far one of the best assassin's creed games with new weather and seasons system big amazing stealth play Some game moment s have weird azz music out of place i felt like i'm fighting a boss in devil may cry 4 game
release yasuke vs aoki soundtrack
Ubisoft Quebec Odyssey umutlarla bana Odyssey kalitesi korunsa bile ancak maalesef Odyssey'den daha bir Ruhsuzluk konusunda Valhalla ile Sevemedim maalesef Oyunun en ve temel hissettiren yok resmen Mafia pek bir yok bu oyunun var git ilgili info topla tek tek fena ama oyun o kadar maruz ki bu ve Yetenek yetenek dahi gereken dolu Bana 2 daha fazla vurur diye yetenek usta benim bunu elde etmem gerekiyor skill amk ne Sorun da var hani oyunlarda bile illa ki pasif direkt etkisi olmayan skiller oluyor Ancak sorun yetenek bunlardan ibaret Yok abi etkileyen skill az pasif ve pek de etkilemeyecek Odyssey'de mesela skillerin skilldi ve Bu Samuray ve Japon ilginiz var oynayacak bir oyun mu bu oyuna harcamak yerine Rise of the Ronin'e daha iyi olur diye Rise of the Ronin her konuda ACShadows'u yerle yeksan eder Hani Sekiro Ghost of Tsushima gerek bile yok Rise of the Ronin'in kadar bile iyi bir oyun Shadows
The best AAA title I've played in years Extremely enjoyable experience
superando expectativas
I was not a fan now i am a fan Amazing environment graphics with good setup and gear amazing combat and mechanics story it's not superthrilling but not bad either a little classical but you can tolerate this the very moment the luxurious environment opens into your eyes you will undertsand what i m saying
Game is absolutely incredible when you don't have someone in your ear who hasn't even played it trying to tell you it's bad
Excelente jogo game play envolvente muito top o melhor da franquia
Having been a long time Assassin's Creed fan this game does hit the spots for those who have been following since back in the early days I found myself enjoying the game the graphics are amazing and the sound design of the game has been absolutely phenomenal But being a Ubisoft title it comes with its caveat Currently right now this game is unplayable for my system mind you my system is not outdated whatsoever I am currently facing issues where quest are broken when speaking to NPC to continue a quest-line the game freezes and doesn't action the cut scene Another bug is loading into the map sometimes it is so slow and takes a good solid minute game is installed on a SSD Other times the map goes black or flickers trying to give me a late night rave when all I want to do is check the map The game would of been good if these bugs have been fleshed out or sold at lower price Honestly if you want an assassins creed game that actually isn't buggy and has developers who actually care about the product they release and ensure that the experience is perfect on day one Play Ghost of Tsushima
Thanks for focing boobiesoft disconnect malware on my pc Very glad to have it Uninstalling this crap the second I'm done with the game
has a amazing story and great overall feel you can tell they really did a great job with this
Enfin un Creed au et pourtant si 8 heures de jeu ma patience a mise rude Entre les bugs une RTX 3070 et des animations faciales dignes jeu des 2000 est frustrante Puis la un nouveau personnage et je me dis Ne me dites pas que lui le ce serait presque ridicule tellement c'est Malheureusement une sur Google au prix spoil vraiment lui me rend fou que en 2025 des jeux comme Ghost of Tsushima un jeu puisse aussi grandi avec cette saga Creed au Japon et je me retrouve avec un jeu peine jouable est un autre point noir impossible de les 40 FPS en bas sur une machine plus de 1 500 Par contre les skins payants disponibles la sortie Je pensais donner une chance la franchise mais depuis Odyssey la des jeux semble toujours aussi Mirage ne pas envie bout alors que des moins comme Rogue restent au moins jouables et Si vous retrouver la magie des meilleurs Creed ce pas ici que vous la trouverez Bien cela reste mon avis personnel et certains aimeront ce jeu mais pour moi la saga a perdu son essence Je tiens que c'est la fois que je laisse un avis sur un jeu c'est dire quel point je suis et quel point cette saga importante pour moi
I think it's the best Assassin's Creed in the last 10 years Excellent environment with a fascinating story The first 10 hours were one of the happiest times playing Assassin's Creed ever The storytelling part is great progress The characters facial expressions are the best ever It's hard to describe how much I like this game I guess it will be my next 100 hours game Plus I LOVE Naoe
i love Naoe everything about her is GOOD it felt like an older AC game pre black flag but then you unlock yasuke and you go to his first quest you beat the fight and the cutscene goes to you losing alright whatever then your put into another fight you win that fight and the cutscene goes to you losing the fight im beyond pissed cause i coulda put my controller down and not played at all the next quest go duel other students ok first student i fight i win and the cutscene shows that i lost again WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER TRYING IF IM JUST GOING TO BE IN A FORCED LOST
AC Shadows is perfect Okay AC Shadows isn't perfect but it's still a great game Shadows might not be that great but it's nowhere near as bad as the chuds are claiming Actually Assassin's Creed games have always been bad You Are Here[/u Shadows is only bad because gamers made it bad
Assassin's Creed Shadows has its ups and downs On one hand the game brings a fresh take on the series with refined stealth mechanics and smoother parkour making the gameplay feel more immersive The dark atmospheric world and the new protagonist's story are intriguing and the combat is fluid and satisfying at first However the game also struggles with some pacing issues certain sections feel unnecessarily slow and the lack of depth in the backstory leaves you feeling detached The combat while smooth starts to feel repetitive after a while and the open-world exploration can feel aimless with too many filler objectives that add much to the overall experience While an enjoyable game for Creed fans it quite live up to the excitement and polish that come to expect from the series Still highly recommended for people who love Assassins Creed
Turns out if you go woke you don't go broke Go fash you do lose cash
Fantastisch spel grafisch ook Wel jammer dat je CPU avx2 moet ondersteunen
cut scenes freeze until fixed i refunded the game and cant recommend this game
can hide Naoes clothes 10/10 game
Bambus
Its alright its fun but its not 70 worth maybe around 40-50
5/10
nesklame to ako predosle diely je to viac putave ak vam vadi cernoch tak mu dajte helmu ignorujte to alebo neviem chodte plakat mamine pod suknu zmierte sa stym ako ja X
great story awesome graphics
much better than mirrage
Das Spiel ist eine Katastrophe Es sich auf um das mal vereinfacht zu sagen Bei jeder Cutscene sich das Spiel auf MEHRFACH Abgesehen davon laufen die Filmsequenzen nicht einmal Wenn man dann endlich mal im Spiel angekommen ist gehen die Lags einfach weiter Alle 7 10 schritte sich das Spiel wieder auf Wenn man an einem Missionscheckpoint angekommen ist braucht das Spiel gute 5 Minuten um erstmal zu erkennen dass man den Checkpoint erreicht hat Ich habe bereits probiert die Grafikeinstellung komplett auf Niedrig und alles auf Performance einzustellen allerdings Erfolglos Da ich die immer Problemlos auf sehr hohen Einstellungen spielen konnte denke ich nicht das das ein Problem meinerseits ist Ich werde versuchen das spiel zu Reparieren und wenn selbst das nichts bringt dann wird es einfach Sehr schade ein Spiel zu wenn man doch so viele Probleme damit hat
great game fun engrossing story stealth exploration best ac in years
gioco molto intuitivo e semplice
My politics are simple ridicule far right nimrods such as elon musk and I will buy your product simple as
Amazing
At first I thought it's going to be like Valhalla and Odyssey but I was wrong This game feels something new like a fresh start of a new morning air
SOLDI MAL SPESI NOIOSO
This is an awesome game It sucks to see it be review bombed The visuals are stunning the storyline is fantastic it's really similar to AC:Odyssey in terms of gameplay and I played that game over and over again My main complaint is that I play using a PS5 controller on PC I guess this must be out of the ordinary because ALL of the tutorials for controls are geared toward xbox controller I've played all of my Assassins Creed games on PS5 and this is the first time I've transitioned to PC so I don't want to give up controller gaming I also dont want to re-purchase on my ps5 since this was already expensive enough Yeah I could switch to KBM but it really sucks that all of the tutorials and instructions assume my controller is an XBOX controller I'm almost ready to drop 40 to buy one I really prefer AC games with controller it would be nice to see this patched I'm probably just going to suck it up and get an xbox controller Yes I'm a controller truther for AC

This is the best looking Assassins Creed Game I have ever played Story is good the quests are okay but the overall feel of the game is great Aside from some bugs and some aspect of stealth which you could easily cheat your way out the game is a must play for any AC fans
good
First thing that really mattered to me and made me satisfied with this game is that the main and side missions repetitive or boring story is average Graphics Absolutely stunning easily one of the best Gameplay is solid with one major issue enemy AI is terrible Other than that no real complaints Weapon variety and designs are great definitely one of the strong points Having two characters with different gameplay styles really helped keep things fresh and engaging Parkour as amazing as it was hyped up to be but not bad either Sometimes gets stuck in weird spots which I hope gets fixed but aside from that decent Stealth mechanics Outstanding One of the best stealth systems ever seen World design is a masterpiece especially with seasonal changes which absolutely blew me away Performance though is disappointing Even on a high-end NVIDIA GPU hitting 60 FPS without frame generation is a struggle All in all considering the few flaws compared to the many strengths definitely recommend this game
Super
huge comeback for ubisoft
super moie picsels en mooie game play en in het aud japan echt de moeite waard
Gorgeous game first off The setting is immersive and beautifully rendered Love the characters and stories being told This is a great game so far Only complaint so far is I am not the biggest fan of the menu interface not a big deal and the controls feel a bit clunky compared to other modern action rpgs but once i settled back into AC mode it felt fine Will update more after I finish
The reason for giving a negative review to Assassin's Creed Shadow is the inability to climb freely especially in mountainous areas Assassin's Creed Origins allows for free mountain climbing Assassin's Creed Odyssey allows you to climb mountains freely Assassin's Creed Valhalla allows for free mountain climbing The newly released Assassin's Creed Shadow cannot climb mountains freely
Tolles AC Game Ubisoft ist auf dem richtigen Weg Pros Grafik Gameplay Audio Umfang Gesichtsanimationen in Zwischensequenzen Neutral Story Charaktere Negativ immer noch zu sehr Ubisoft Gesichtsanimationen im normalen Gamplay Ingame
One of the best Assassins Creed game since Assassins Creed Black Flag
As a big fan of Odyssey and Valhalla this game was a massive disappointment Choice and consequence in this game is completely non-existent ALL the choices lead to the EXACT SAME outcome Given the option to kill or spare a character Choose the spare option and my character still kills them The combat is a button mash fest Upgrading gear is a super grind just like Odyssey Looting castles is extremely repetitive kill the samurai loot the chest rinse and repeat for the entire game Most of the side quests are boring fetch and kill quests with no interesting story hook BIG DOWNGRADE from things like the Delian League in Odyssey The writing in the game is terrible The English voice acting is bad The game is full of bugs and glitches Tons of missing QOL features for instance you can change the season but you CAN'T change the time of day Your character no longer has a torch so when the game gets dark you can't see anything Modern day plot is non-existent There's pretty much no content tied into the Isu The quest log UI is a complete mess The open world activities are just one button presses and QTEs Sure the game is beautiful but that's just it Everything about this game is incredibly shallow and surface level even for a Ubisoft game Overall Shadows is just all sizzle and no steak I wouldn't even recommend it on a discount It's just a hollow waste of time
Ubisoft'a bize bir oyun ediyorum
I love the open world Simply roaming in this beautiful world is satisfying and the random events i have found to be satisfying If you like stealthily invading castles and taking out people you will enjoy Naoe I have yet to unlock Yasuke The combat is satisfying The only draw back being sometimes the parkour feels clunky but its not a gamebreaker
Creed Shadows is a masterpiece of detail and atmosphere Ubisoft really went the extra mile with the visual fidelity from the way the wind rustles through the trees to how leaves scatter during a storm What impressed me most is how the game portrays its characters The gender dynamic is handled with nuance Yasuke feels like raw power and resilience while Naoe brings a more calculated and grounded approach Neither overshadows the other they complement each other beautifully Ubisoft nailed the balance between strength and subtlety If looking for a game that blends combat stealth and immersive storytelling in a gorgeously crafted world I absolutely recommend Creed Shadows
good
After 27 hours of gameplay experienced every weapon type encountered all enemy variations and thoroughly memorized the layout of all four castles The game does not expand beyond what is introduced early on There are no opportunities to actually capture bases and the gameplay loop remains largely unchanged after the first 10 hours rate it a recommending to fans of the AC series or those looking for an enjoyable ninja-themed experience lasting around 20 hours However I consider it worth more than 40
Damn
Last AC game i played before this was Odyssey and was not a huge fan Before then I had played all of them and beat them from 1 to Black Flag Shadows is beautiful smooth and a great comeback While a little confusing the only real negative is sometimes the free-running feels clunky Combat is sweet and customization is dope Def would recommend
Review zu Assassins Creed Shadows Open World Artstyle 9/10 Map 9/10 Grafik Visuals 8,5/10 Performance 6,5/10 Naoe Parkour 9/10 Combat 9/10 Stealth 9/10 Yasuke 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Ja es ist schade ansonsten hat Ubisoft leider einen an der Klatsche und Ich spiele jetzt nicht darauf an dass sie unbedingt einen schwarzen Samurai im feudalen Japan haben mussten Um ehrlich zu sein fand Ich es Anfangs sogar noch passend also ohne zu viel spoilern zu wollen Yasuke war ein Samurai unter Oda Nobunaga bis dieser Seppuku beging und die Sache ist die er kein gewesen dann er nach japanischer Tradition wahrscheinlich auch Seppuku begehen Ja gut dass er das nicht tat so kann er da er ja nicht weiss wo er hin soll unserer Hauptdarstellerin helfen Das dachte Ich zumindest aber das ist nicht was Ubisoft ihn vorgesehen hatte Ubisoft soll er die Hauptrolle spielen mit einer Geschicklichkeitswertung von 0,0 in einem Assassins Creed Spiel Mir es ja Anfangs fast nicht aufgefallen weil Ich mit Naoe Nebenquests gemacht habe aber als Ich dann angefangen habe die Hauptquests zu spielen war es einfach nur mehr zum kotzen Da muss man denen drei mal sagen dass man mit Naoe spielen und dann ist Yasuke trotzdem noch in jeder Cutscene drinnen und er ist der allerbeste so kultiviert und gelehrt und supertoll wie es nur ein schwarzer Samurai sein Absoluter Schwachsinn Der ist einfach nur wie ein Klotz am Bein und Ich mir zumindest eine mit der Ich am Ende jeder Mainquest Cutscene die Frage ob Ich wirklich mit Naoe weiter spielen skippen kann Es gibt noch andere kleinere also mir die Open World zum Beispiel echt gut aber vielerorts ist erkunden zwecklos weil erstens meist zu steile und Bewuchs davon abhalten und ausserdem eh nichts zu finden ist Also Erkunden sich eigentlich wirklich auf das klettern auf Aussichtspunkte und Fragezeichen aufdecken abseits der Fragezeichen braucht man auch gar nicht suchen weil dort gibt es eh nichts Hie und da gibt es kleine Random Events wo man Tiere Zeichnen kann oder Schreine zum beten und Opfer bringen die einem kurzfristige Buffs geben aber das war es dann wirklich schon Anfangs dachte Ich mir auch noch cool dass Ich mal nicht irgendwelche Wildtiere jagen um mir meine selbst herzustellen aber noch nichtmal die Option zu haben weiss Ich jetzt auch nicht was Ich davon halten soll Das Angeln in Valhalla fand Ich eigentlich ganz OK abgesehen vom Achievement wo man dann wirklich jeden einzelnen Fisch fangen aber in den japanischen gibt es noch nichtmal einen einzigen Fisch Was die angeht zeigt Ubisoft wieder mal keine klare Linie in der Serie so ging man nach Valhalla weder zu dem quasi Standard wie man es auch davor schon in Odyssey hatte dabei jedes eine Gravur und kann ab blauer beim Schmied mit einer weiteren Gravur versehen werden Das System ist Odyssey aber sehr stark vereinfacht so gibt es Beispielsweise nur eine eine Kaputze und ein und Setboni sind mir bisher noch keine untergekommen dropt im Gegensatz zu Valhalla auch wieder random von Gegnern bis zu lilaner es gibt aber auch eine Anzahl von im Spiel welche man von Spezialgegnern sowie aus Quests Truhen und sogenannten Kofuns bekommen kann Das Itemlevel entspricht meist dem Charakterlevel und kann beim Schmied verbessert werden was Ich allerdings noch nie gemacht habe weil ja eh dauernd dem Level entsprechende dropt und es sowieso keine Setboni gibt welche es sinnvoll machen ein bestehendes Set weiter zu verwenden abgesehen davon ist man in dem Spiel selbst mit random ohne spezielle Gravuren overpowert Ausserdem gibt es zwei zu verbessern entweder mit Mon standard und und einer der entsprechenden Ressource oder mit Gold und ja als Ich das zum ersten mal habe dachte Ich mir man das Gold auf jeden Fall was aber ein Problem weil Ich bin jetzt gerade Level 50 und hab gerade mal 4 Gold gefunden Die das Gold echt nur zur Verwirrung ins Spiel eingebaut haben weil Ich hab jetzt nochmal geschaut und Ich eine von stufe 7 auf Stufe 50 verbessern indem Ich 572 Hanfstoff und 592 Mon verwende Also keine Ahnung warum Ich stattdessen Gold verwenden sollte was Ich Beispielsweise aus einer Quest bekommen habe die Ich in einer Region 100 Samurai musste Naja es gibt aber auch die eine oder andere positive wie zum Beispiel den Unterschlupf den man sich selbst einrichten darf auch wenn der Editor nicht wirklich viel kreative Freiheit ist das durchaus nice Ich hab nicht wirklich viel damit gemacht eigentlich nur ein par hin gesetzt und bin draufgekommen dass Ich die weiter von der entfernt platzieren muss wenn Ich dort einen Bambuszaun pflanzen weil der Bambus ein ganzes einnimmt obwohl er wirtklich nur eine Seite des Quadrats beansprucht Ausserdem habe Ich noch keine Bambus Ecke gefunden und da Ich nicht zwei Bambus um gedreht in einem pflanzen kann wird da wohl ein Loch bleiben Eine weitaus coolere Neuerung ist aber der Jahreszeitenwechsel wo sich etwa alle 3 Stunden die Jahreszeit und das wirklich Abwechslung sorgt Obendrein neu ist der vollkommene Verzicht auf wo Ich sagen das geht mir jetzt nicht wirklich ab ist aber sicher Geschmackssache
Macht Mega Bock GEILO
I'll keep it short I'm thoroughly enjoying it
played Assassins Creed since AC Unity and got to say impressed The graphics look really good there is A learning curve playing as Naoe if not used to the newer AC games well until you unlock Yasuke that is an absolute tank I love how both characters have completely different playstyles adding a dynamic feel to the game
Super fun
TOP
Esta bueno
Macht mega Laune als Naoe zu schleichen ist 1A und als Yasuke man sich in AF Manchmal sin Voicelines etwas Leise evtl Liegt das an meinen Einstellungen dass ist mir aber aufgefallen Grafik ist Wunderbar Keinerlei Performance Probleme auf meiner Seite Gameplay sich einfach sehr gut und Fertig an Ich kann es nur Empfehlen dem Spiel eine Faire und Unbiased Chance zu geben die hat es verdient Ich bin jetzt lvl 22 und habe erst 15 der Map 1 Region fast Komplet Kyouto und 3 Regionen Etwas gesehen und freue mich darauf weiter einzutauchen

not launching I worked for a couple of days and when they updated the problem came back
Very bad
Tierlist A Tier AC1 AC2 ACB ACR B Tier AC3 AC4 AC Origins AC Mirage AC Shadows C Tier AC Rogue AC Unity AC Syndicate D Tier AC Odyssey AC Valhalla It's alright I guess Story Story is an improvement over the last few games and some older games like AC Unity and Syndicate but I think it's still not as good as the older games Two big factors is the cutscene quality and voice acting Sometimes there's pretty good cutscenes and sometimes there's just cutscenes that look straight outta Walking Dead Season 1 English Voice acting is pretty bad for most characters like Naoe where it feels like they just told an AI to read off a script Other languages are fine tho The overall narrative is alright some of the characters feel kinda underdeveloped and uninteresting but most of the cast is okay One thing I did not expect is preferring Yasuke's story more than Naoe's for reasons I dont really wanna say cause spoilers I'm a bit confused on why there's nothing about the Isu in this tho bit disappointing Gameplay The combat is way better than the other RPG games with enemies being more aggressive and actually being a little bit diffcult now Stealth is way better than all the other RPG games with more depth and mechanics to it but the lack of social stealth leaves me longing for a bit more AI is weird tho sometimes you can get spotted on a roof pretty easily and sometimes you can just stand in front of an enemy and they wont do anything Basically it's inconsistent Exploration is mid mostly the same as the other games but with more activities Movement feels way better even with Yasuke but parkour basically has no depth cause the environment isn't built for it lol Overall yea it's an okay game improvement over the last few games but get it on a discount this aint worth 70 dollars
h1 Looks good and feels good BUT it's just more of the same again h1 This means locations seem vibrant and full of life at first but are devoid of any meaningful content and are recycled all the time side quests are inconsequential and mostly boring low-rarity gear becomes irrelevant almost immediately if you actually commit to exploration loot is only good for currency or upgrade mats you don't expect to find anything good when clearing an outpost very limited assortment of available armors which reduces customization options you can buy cooler sets in the mtx store but they actually look like shit anyway lmao main story is bland which is not a huge issue but It has some b MAJOR b cornball moments Despite that the gameplay and visuals carry the experience It's fun to clear the copypasted castles even if they feel like doing the same activity again and again I've been enjoying b Naoe's b playstyle she's swift sticks to the shadows and actually gets to do dramatic flips and assassinate people She's actually good at combat too It's a bit more challenging than with her samurai counterpart but she gets the job done and she has some sweet anims too If you invest a few perks into weapon trees you can actually make it easier and cheese through your enemies no problem if that's what you prefer b Yasuke b is not for me which fucking sucks because I lock myself out of a lot of content by choosing not to play him as much He's big He's burly A bull in a china shop if you will He just doesn't meet my expectations He makes combat so laughably easy that you can ram into the enemies and start relentlessly hacking away without minding your HP bar I guess that could be fun for some people however I would have preferred it if they just made one character with the ability to go full Rambo OR assassin It would definitely make the gameplay more seamless and help with the customization issue This two protagonists conundrum isn't really as bad as people make it out to be though you can switch characters on the fly so if there is a spot that your current character can't get to then you just get to hold a button and sit through a quick loading screen You can just pick the one that matches your style and then help yourself with the other character whenever you need to Game very visibly favors Naoe though and if you want to play as Yasuke you'll have to speed through a few hours of the main story before you unlock him Sorry I guess lmao Overall all the issues it has are the same ones that were prevalent in the previous modern installments If that doesn't put you off and you like the general gameplay loop just get it there's a lot of hours that you can spend on it and it is just mindless fun And if you're uncomfortable with gay stuff or are afraid of black people then you don't have to engage with that content Amazing huh Enjoy the game it's pretty as fuck Runs smoothly on an 8gb rtx 4070 too with and without framegen I do use dlss though Only had to make concessions with the texture settings
So good
This is an edit to my previous review after playing a while longer At first glance the open world seems bland However I suggest slowing down and paying more attention to the details For instance I went to a temple where people were hanging out Out of no where people started running and I thought it was my character due to poor or buggy game design However I noticed some bandits chasing some villagers I killed two The game world is actually changing with the weather seasons and it really does look good Its a pretty game Although you can't really interact with the wild animals aside from drawing them side activity the world still feels immersive and alive at times Overall the more I play this game the more I enjoy it I love Ghost of Tsuhima Honestly there are things about both worlds you could say that are better but I have to hand it to Ubisoft I think they did a better job on world design At first I was a little annoyed about the forced dsync on civilian kill forced save reload However you can actually kill the civilians of other faction controlled areas Castle areas for instance If you don't they run and tell the authorities if you are spotted Give this game a shot Play it and let it soak in I think this is a game with some bland parts to it but there are plenty of details in it that show off the beauty of its open world if one is willing to slow down and pay attention To Ubisoft A future patch just for immersion would be nice Maybe fishing mechanics a garden for your hideout or hunting and skinning Even if its just for mon in game currency Also the ability to eat and drink would be cool You guys did a good job However some small tweaks could make this world even more immersive Also please fix the subtitles for random dialog between NPCs when playing on immersive mode I can see the English subtitles during cut scenes but can't understand NPCs when there is generic random dialog
bom jogo
It's funny to buy this even if you aren't into culture wars Fun game too

Before I review this game I want to share my perspective on the AC franchise over the past few years Now been invested in the AC universe since Syndicate came out which I never finished I bought Origins and Odyssey during a sale but I only accumulated around 80 minutes of playtime in total Valhalla I skipped it entirely While each of these games is vastly different from one another they all bored me and my faith in Ubisoft delivering anything therefore basically nonexistent Honestly I wanted this game to fail I hoped it would be the final straw that forced Ubisoft to change things On to the game itself In having an absolute blast playing this game The prologue while lengthy and almost entirely made up of cutscenes does a great job of introducing the protagonists and their story That said it feels more like watching a movie than playing a game so recommend starting it when you have time to spare The gameplay and combat system keep me constantly wanting to explore and improve my characters Specifically the stealth combat is the best but decent However if you get spotted I have to say actually happy that more challenging Compared to Black favorite AC it really matter if up against 5 50 or 500 enemies because counters always get you out of trouble this game actually makes you think about how if you engage in fights While Challenging its still Fun The game world and graphics are stunning The visual beauty alone makes me want to explore and take my time doing so I think ever spent this much time in photo mode in any other game One thing that still irritates me is the night-and-day stealth mechanic The game makes a difference between attacking during the day and night but it let the player manually skip time to take advantage of nighttime stealth I assume this has something to do with the changing seasons system but it be better to simply not let time-skipping affect seasonal progression This is the first story-driven game since Cyberpunk 2077 that keeps me thinking about it after stopped playing I eagerly wait to get off work just to jump back in The shop system and battle pass are fine as long as they aggressively push me to spend money So far in my experience they In my opinion Creed Shadows is a step in the right direction If considering buying this game recommend waiting for a discount Just because is the new standard for games like this mean justified in my opinion That being said if you have the money to spare and are looking to sink time into a well-crafted open world go for certainly did and I regret it I felt obligated to write this review because I have a feeling many people share the same doubts I had If you made it this far I truly appreciate the time you took to read this This review is probably longer than any essay I ever wrote in school Side Note I am not a native English speaker so I used AI assistance to improve the readability of this review and minimize grammatical and spelling errors I wanted to make sure my thoughts were as clear as possible and I still stand behind everything that is written here
The hate on this game is unreal its not perfect but I've been enjoying the hell out of it
the best assassin game out there my opinion
good
10/10
carzy game
game good
No creia que me fuera a enganchar pero la historia esta muy buena la dinamica entre los dos personajes principales es interesante y cambia la forma de aproximarse al juego dependiendo de los gustos de cada jugador Graficos impresionantes solo desearia que el mundo en si a pesar de lo grande fuera mas interesantes de explorar
The best Assassins's creed game that I've played I loved Origins but this one just 12 hours in has definitely has become my favorite and so far I haven't even done a ton of the story or even gotten to be the secondary character for more than the little bit at the very start
Refunded it The game is just okay Really was hoping for it to be badass but sadly it's not Right now it doesnt feel worth the 70 price tag I suggest waiting until its like 40 Lots of cut scenes lots of walking Nothings really making me want to keep playing the game It just feels very boring to me That being said I know some people are enjoying it This is just my opinion
So far it's actually quite enjoyable Yes it steers away from typical assassins but I think its still got some fun mechanics to play around with Obviously nothing like AC1-Black Flag era of the games But still enjoyable to say
I LOVE AC GAMES
AC Shadows 6-7 10
I like that finally there is an AC game that takes on Japan The overall gameplay is good for me I know there are lots of hate towards this game but i dont really care Im just enjoying the game so far There are some minor bugs in the game but not really annoyed me
Graphics are insane Setting is gorgeous Stealth is on point 10 hours in I'm loving it
SB
Very Good

Hello my friends it's running better than I thought on the Steam Deck and the game itself is also running better than I expected So far it's been fun and after a long wait it's doing everything right Here's my Steam Deck review
Ca me fait puisque Ubi c'est l'origine Mais le jeux est merdique Ok je mets 2 car sur GeForcenow le jeux est jolie Mais le reste c'est au sol L'exploitation c'est Tu passes ta vie faire la chose des parchemins dans des temples Tu trouves des objets inutiles des armes et des armures qui servent rien puisque comme tu peut up ton attirail via le forgeron pour que dalle Tu uppera ton stuf or que t'auras lors de la campagne principale le Donc finalement ya zero l'explo Si c'est comme pour les achats externes avec de belles armures vous avez simplement pourri le jeux Zero J'aime pas la map Finalement je la trouve vide C'est que des temples temples qui sont et se ressemblent quasiment tous C'est jolie mais ya rien dedans Ok les arbres bouge l'herbe aussi Whaaa mais si c'est pour se faire dessus reste de l'herbe Je comprends pas pourquoi on peut plus chasser non plus C'est quoi ce truc de la peinture c'est chiant T'as plein d'animaux mais tu peux rien faire Si le but c'est de propager la non violence autant investir dans un nouveau SIMS et pas faire du Assasin Creed Le combo des deux personnage est aussi Comme 98 des gens tu prendras Naoe puisque l'autre est lourd lent Dps par plus vite et que l'essence d'assassin Creed c'est quand la lame et l'infiltration Donc je me demande quoi il sert En ou en personnage jouable sur certains passages pourquoi pas Mais c'est nul Fallait utiliser ce temps de pour mettre des trucs sur la map J'aime pas non plus le de repop Tu laves un temple tu fais un aller retour tout le monde est avec d'autres casse le unique de la chose Les secondaires se des gens sur la map tout le temps Rien d'autre Ah Si trouver des bol de pendant ta partie mdr sur Wow les secondaires sont plus Bref c'est un nouveau concept Fedex Le du domaine c'est pareil Tu pose tes puis c'est tout mieux sur Valhalla ou assassin creed 3 Il se passe rien sinon L'histoire est pas mal cependant C'est pas ouf mais passe On dirait qu'il manque quasiment 30 du jeux Soit les ont Ubi le et commercialiser soit ils vont te vendre la partie manquante pour sur 5 volets Bref j'ai le jeux une 20e heure car je m'ennuie trop J'aurais ne pas l'acheter
This game brings me back to original Assassin's Creed formula playing it on hard mode was a little frustrating at the start as it should be since you're low level but once you get past the first few level and learn the mechanics of Naoe the game is really good I haven't played as Yasuke yet and im almost 20 hours into it level 17 on console I played 3 hours or on PC and then moved to Playstation 5 thanks to the cross progression Ubisoft offers which is fantastic i can play it wherever I want everytime I really enjoy everything that comes with the hideout customization and also your allies and scouts which can help you find targets in the world If you want to assassinate people without the level scaling then id turn on assassination gurantee in the options I haven't yet because its not been a problem but I have in older games where level scaling wasn't as good as this Never seen a rich world so alive in an Assassins Creed game since maybe AC3 I love Japan and I love the culture and history so this is honestly a 10/10 game for me Also you can pet every cat and dog and then add em in your hideout which is really cute
LAJI
Dont listen to haters this game is truly amazing time to buy assassins creed again
Best AC game in the RPG genre love the stealth love the parkour fuck the cut scenes love the combat love the character designs love everything except the cut scenes
parts of the game are locked behind playing yasuke this is more bs from ubisoft about forcing people to play the significant worse mc its just unity again
It's gr8

i like the scenery and setting the graphics were amazing 6 hours in the game i like the mechanics but horse riding is a little weird and there are lots of cutscenes the prologue is good also the game brought back the true feel of the old AC games i liked the grappling hook
70 euro is too much for this game
Great game amazing graphics and ambiance Addictive gameplay loop Great surprise
naoe 10/10
this is peak so much to do
this is what happens when they dont rush niceeee
I don't recommend this game at least for now for a game that took 4 years and was delayed twice it's filled with bugs Plus the requirement for ubisoft connect if you do not like 3rd party launchers don't buy it at all
good game
Good Game but not Better
After 30 hours in the game I feel like in a decent position to cover my thoughts As a casual fan of Assassins Creed this is one of the best entries in years played them all my last favourite being Black Flag I found odyssey and Valhalla way too overwhelming The juxtaposition of 2 very different characters keeps the game fresh Combat feels really satisfying as Yasuke and the stealth elements as Naoe are scratching a Splinter Cell itch for me Being able to switch between the 2 almost on the fly is awesome You can just brute force your way through or stealth And the trade offs between each character feel meaningful As for the story it exists A classic revenge story not fantastic but interested to see the characters develop Assassins creed has never been about historical accuracy for me about putting me in a period of time in our history and letting me have fun Which definitely having with this game Oh and the OST is phenomenal The only downside I have for the game right now is some parkour can be a bit iffy Usually in tight enclosed interiors the hose controls can be annoying at times and the microtransactions There are microtransactions for gear and weapons Solid 30fps on steam deck also for on the go gaming Awesome Did I mention how good the OST is
I tried this game out for myself and expect to enjoy it a lot Guess what Those YouTubers calling it trash and boring are probably just saying that because of their personal agenda against Ubisoft
Better Than any other samurai game except sekiro ofc
Solid stealth game with a promising improvement on the Ubisoft formula Stunning visuals good performance and satisfying gameplay
Dla tej serii i Japonii jest git
10/10
J'aime beaucoup le jeu mais gros de son qui casse
Great game so far The world is really pretty and the exploration is fun Definitely a step up from mirage in my opinion but I will admit this game has not topped Valhalla or odyssey for me yet but the developers are heading in the right direction Sometimes the story is a bit cringe but so far so good 8/10
The game looks and plays great The story has a few hiccups because it uses the same style of quests as AC Mirage and so progression comes in stages rather than with every quest It runs well AC is good and has been good for a while and this game is the best the series has been in a long while Is it as good as Black Flag or other Best in the series games No but that's not to the detriment of this game
SCORE SOLID 9/10 First the game looks phenomenally good and plays exceptionally well It's made by the same team as Odyssey my fave AC It ditches the bloat and repetition of Valhalla It's super fun with a great gameplay loop that scratches a lot of itches The story and dialogue are both mid not terrible but not great In no way does this hold the game back Love the dual protagonists and the historical accuracy is blown out of proportions plus it's a game Enjoy life and quite being so pedantic
AC
Even though I love the series this game is one of the worst I've ever seen and it's way less exciting than the previous ones I wouldn't recommend it at all The environment is repetitive AI is weak The story is lame and childish The side activities are boring The map is huge and just full of trees hard to get through Your time is way more valuable than this crappy game
If Ubisoft take anything away from a paid customer If Ubisoft reduced games it had created each year focused on quality like what it has done to Shadows If Ubisoft insist to leave Steam and gave players the choice of gaming on their preferred platforms Ubisoft would not end up with the situation it is today If Ubisoft try to its audiences misleading players to believe AC represents history itself Instead make it steel clear that none of stuff the company has created has anything to do with the real world and be linked to each other fictional real All these against Shadows would not spread like a wild fire in its community In exchange Ubisoft would not end up in the eye of an argumentative storm the negative impact and damage to Shadows would have been reduced to minimum Ubisoft has done glorious past for AC games it proves it can recreate a similar glory as long as it about to bankrupt Funny to say it extreme condition creates miracle Another typical example showed the best way to counter an anti-consumer company is to cut off your financial support When it walks on the thin ice of destruction it automatically comes back begging for your forgiveness Make it struggle to survive is the only way to make it start caring about your demands as a customer Anyways putting all past matters aside Shadows is a great game no mistaking it Ubisoft really did everything it could this time little thing inside the game that I can pick up against it enjoyable from the story to the gameplay combat missions puzzles hideout building etc All are addictive and fun a giant game from the scale seen so far easily 100h On the first day of its launch played 14h straight away hardly had any stop This broke the longest record spent time in a game on the day of its arrival All in all a solid 8.5-9.0/10 is a must to be just
2 karakter konseptinden 2 karakteri sanki ikisi de hikayede bir role neden asla bir konsepti var Siyahi abi yasuke ile yok free roam'da Ne bir ne stealth'i yeterli tepesine bile Tek adam kesmek Hikaye olarak zaten karakter naomi Yasuke sadece olaylar o orada bulunuyor oluyor Verdikleri ara sahnelerden de direkt bunu Oyuna gelen yeni mekanikler falan da tamamen naomi yenilik sadece yasuke yeni gelen animasyonlarla havada 3 takla ya da yine yeni olan yerde kullansa bile dana gibi bir direkt Yasuke abi shadows'un Bu siyahi abiyi neden oynanabilir karakter olarak gram Oyunun kendisinde ise stealth maalesef yenilik yok o yeni animasyonlar yerde gibi yenilikler zaten bir oyununda 10 gereken veriyor Base kurma ekstra fakat bu bir inovasyon olarak bence yok oyuna Grafikleri ve optimizasyonuna gelecek olursak direkt 10/10 uzun en smooth oyunlardan piyasadaki m.ymun grafik teknolojilerini bi oyuna entegre edebilmeleri DLSS,RT,FG de Hikayesi ise hollywood ilerliyor imdb'den 5.2 bir film izliyor gibi oluyorsunuz hikaye sunum kalitesi seslendirmeler ve iyi Bir de ve level olur yapmadan sadece solda gezip o bilgileri okuyup ve naomi'nin not defterinden okuyabiliyorsunuz bir assassins creed oyunu daha diyebilirim Ubisoft'un 150 ve tarifinde yenilik yok serinin tekrar yapmaktan benim gibi kaliteli bir oynamak istiyorum tavsiye ediyorum bunda da ubisoft sizi denemeyin bile bir oyun Fakat oyun benlik ve ben de bir ubisever oyuna 7/10 veriyorum ve tavsiye ediyorum Not yasuke ve o bi zenci
really fun
Pretty fun don't listen to the hate give the game a go before giving a your thoughts
one of my fav AC series good experience if you liked AC before you should try this
to to co se od spolku ale pokud na to nebudete koukat jako na AC hru ale jen na Light RPG tak je to fajn hra
Pare po zagraniu 17 godzin i 1 Aktu Graficznie gra prezentuje wybornie nie jej tu niczego odmienna sytuacja tyczy warstwy wydaje nieco nijaka w z Valhalla i Odyssey Co do to co nie porywa jest w ale nic ponad to po 1 akcie Brakuje mi tu atmosfery przygody i eksploracji nam w poprzednicg w Odyssey przyjemne obranie kursu na by przekonac co na niej znajduje Valhalla klimat stawiania pierwszych na nowej ziemi w Shadows nie czuje niczego podobnego postacie O Yasuke nie wypowiem bo chyba dopiero po 1 akcie go odblokowywuje Co do Naoe to da jednak nie ma ona tyle charyzmy co Kassandra brak jej tego pazura jest chyba jednak lepsza od Eivora Bardzo podoba mi za to granie Naoe sam gameplay skradania i jest bardzo na animacje walki patrzy bardzo przyjemnie aspekt skrytobojstw jest z najlepszy ze wszystkich ostatnich odslon serii Minusem jest jednak dla mnie kompletny brak Isu a przynajmniej co w nie na cokolwiek z nimi a mi ten aspekt w poprzednich Gra nie jest idealna ale i tak gra bardzo przyjemnie gdybym po pierwszego aktu to to 7.5-8/10
Sadly this game seems to yet another front in the culture wars Ignoring that It's a solid stealth game Yasuke seems a little heavy handed for and AC protagonist but can be a nice change of pace occasionally Sticking to Naoe is the ways to play the game if you're looking for stealth gameplay This game lost a few stealth mechanics i.e Archery the bird for scouting and gained a few grapple hook crawling prone The largest change is the traversal mechanics Gone are the days of simple climbing over every obstacle in your path you'll need to learn your way around the map rather than blazing a path straight for the quest marker

J'attendais depuis 1 an le nombre de reporte j'apprecie beaucoup le jeu divers etc sauf bemole bug de sons defois
Assassin's Creed Shadows Ubisoft 12 30 10 Assassin's Creed Shadows
Take two mediocre but somewhat fun games Sickiro Shadows Expire Two Times and Ghosts of Sashimi and make it an actual banger exciting to play what we have here folks Also Yakuza or whatever his name was an actual samurai just hate seeing other people succeed Open a history book and read the words you nerds
Ubisoft connect is probably the worst service of all time i cant play the game whenever i want to
mir gut D
one of the best games in 2025
the facial animations are jank sometimes and the writing isn't the best but the game itself is quite fun and otherwise gorgeous
value for money
10
the introduction is honestly terrible it's so poorly paced and all over the place that I almost refunded it gets better afterwards though and is honestly enjoyable I have no clue about performance because I'm obviously overkilling with a 5080 it runs smooth duh the music is hit or miss a lot of it is nice the more modern re-imaginings are quite awful and remind me of wild west settings which is quite off putting for the settings visually the game is actually pretty gorgeous although the facial animations in runtime cutscenes don't reflect the mood and intensity of the conversation most of the time which is a shame they have fixed a lot of the most annoying and odd bugs such as not being able to choose nvidia frame gen if a controller was plugged in while the game launched and I haven't really run into anything gamebreaking length wise I've kinda finished the first zone there are a few POI I haven't gone to yet so make of that what you will so far I think it's a pretty decent game and I'm having fun
por enquanto bem melhor que o Valhala
So far so good Optimized performance No stutter at all Graphically outstanding the world the wind the ambient sounds so beautiful I like they add weather and seasons system Sometimes I just stand around just to enjoy the view Brutal assassination is amazing Only lack of fun activities Overall solid game for me 8/10 Good job Ubisoft
Great game a lot of people are comparing this to ghosts of Tushima but personally i think you should buy this for it being an assassins creed game and not a Ghosts 2.0 The game runs great on my rtx 3080 with the settings maxed out no bugs yet which is great as a lot of new games i play nowadays seem to be problematic from day 1 With regards to the story very interesting partly factual and its a great game to lose yourself in for a few hours I like the touch of creating your own hide out and upgrading elements of it I find this adds a personal touch to the game If you liked Ghosts you'd like this and if your a big assassins creed fan then this game will keep you entertained
Assassin's Creed Shadows A Masterpiece Redefining the Genre Assassin's Creed Shadows isn't just a game it's an interactive cinematic experience that transports you to the heart of feudal Japan From the very first moments you're captivated by the stunning graphics the attention to detail and the authentic atmosphere Every frame is a work of art and the landscapes from the mysterious temples to the lush forests are simply spectacular The story is compelling with complex characters and a suspenseful plot The gameplay is fluid and varied offering countless ways to approach missions Whether you prefer direct action or stealth infiltration the game adapts to your style The fights are intense and satisfying and the progression system allows you to customize your character to your liking The music is another strong point contributing to creating an epic and emotional atmosphere The ambient sounds immerse you in the game's world and the sound effects are realistic and immersive To the haters Play before you judge I understand that there are always different opinions but before criticizing a game like Assassin's Creed Shadows I invite you to play it You will discover a rich universe a captivating story and refined gameplay This game is a testament to the passion and dedication of the developers and the result is simply phenomenal Conclusion Assassin's Creed Shadows is a must-play for any fan of the series and for any lover of action-adventure games It is a masterpiece that sets new standards in the industry and deserves all the appreciation

It's been a long time since I've enjoyed playing an Assassin's Creed I'm really delighted Thank you Ubisoft for this opus which for the moment I'm really enjoying
nie chce mi sie grac jak widze tego nnnnnnnnnn zrob ktos moda pls pozdrawiam D
The game crashes and closes at two key story points where progression becomes impossible During the mission where you help Yaya during a fight after you defeat the last enemy the game crashes and closes Happens every time Also when you kill the last enemy during the mission to kill Nobunaga the game crashes and closes after the cutscene even if you try to skip it The patch doesn't fix it a complete reinstall doesn't fix it I have received no help from Ubisoft after reporting both problems
cette licence comme Tomb Raider Dark Souls Uncharted les jeux de courses ou les jeux de sport Je fais rarement des commentaires Mais me gonfle tellement tout ce qui est dit ecrit sur Shadows Faites vous votre propre avis sans les avis des uns ou des autres a tous les AC sur PC PS4 xBox 360 PS5 emulateurs Shadows est un bon jeu et une superbe bonne ambiance sonore et une bonne histoire sans revolutionner le monde du jeu video Si vous aimez les jeux lite vous passerez un bon moment voire bon Bon jeu
Pretty good game enjoying it a lot
Love the game don't mind the haters
Mise jour hier le 25/03 15h de jeu Le exe qui Plus moyen de jouer cyberpunk fait mieux c'est dire Ok beau mais 70 euros pour 15 heures de jeu fait cher quand Il faudra attendre 5-6 ans histoire qu'il soit moins
AC Shadows is good but but missing lot of past good game features from previous AC genre series 1 No animal hunting 2 Don't think its input lag but lot of delays in countering and blocking 3 Most game missions are repetitive 4 They need to push patch or expansion where Yasuke and Naoe make love scene GG`s ya'll
one of the best AC games if you mainly play stealth this is the best stealth AC game
love it
ta mt bom tinha sido influenciado pela critica negativa de alguns canais de yt antes msm do jogo nao vou negar que estava receoso que o jogo fosse tomado pelas pautas woke mas n jogo ta mt bom gameplay gostosinha amei a naoe
Eines der besten Assassin`s Creed teile seit langer Zeit Die Grafik Optik Designs und sowie die Story ist echt mega gut gelungen In meinem Fall mit einer ROG STRIX RTX 4090 OC das Spiel Konstant problemlos mit 150 FPS auf 4K Einstellungen und einem MAX FOV Performance haben Sie auch maximal abgeliefert Respekt an Ubisoft das Sie AC gerettet haben Ein bisher sehr gelungener Nachfolger

absolutely a step in the right direction for both AC as a series but also ubisoft as a company
Best new gen Assassin's Creed i have played 8/10
Unlike all these public hate and comments This game is good It good that we have 2 different playstyle you can play the game the way you want
So I am pretty deep into the game and currently it is barely playable i'm talking complete loading freezes every 5 seconds or so It's not constant however noticeable enough to ruin a 70 dollar game at this time I do not recommend this product also sometimes the ground detail does not fully load in making it look like complete trash this game has not currently been optimized whatsoever I know my system is fully capable of running the game ryzen 9900x rtx 4080 super with 64 g ddr5 and 6 tb storage there is no excuse for this not recommended at this time
